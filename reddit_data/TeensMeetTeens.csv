184,"I'm sorry for you girls that receive such horrible and disturbing texts from the boys on this sub that have never talked to a girl in their life. I personally have seen some of the texts from the degenerates lurking in this sub and it's really gross. At some points some of these are extremely gruesome and even disturbing. 

This sub aims to establish healthy friendships and cool conversations between teenagers(girls and boys) from all around the globe. And the fact that most of the time this isn't possible for most girls (since there are so many thirsty guys that oversexualise them) is sad. If I were a girl I'd never post here knowing the consequences, thus to all the girls in this sub that have the guts to do so, you have earned my respect and the respect of many others. As soon as you encounter one of these creeps report them to the mods and block them. Thank you for reading

191,"Hey. You may know me as the person who posted something yesterday, but this is serious. Yesterday I received a DM from a person claiming to be 16 years old, and that he saw my post on this subreddit. I checked his profile, like I normally do to make sure the person is legit. It turned out he was 27, and had commented on many NSFW posts and created many himself. I reported and blocked him. So please guys, just check someone's account so that you know that they genuinely are teens and want to be your friends. I'm just posting these to make sure you guys will be safer in the future.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk :)                                                                                                                        Alex

262,"Hello, I have made 3 different accounts over the last year because a man who found me through this sub won’t stop harassing me. He had made at least 40 different accounts and bombards me with sexual and insulting messages. 

He targets my mental health issues and insecurities mainly but has recently threatened suicide and started harming due to me telling him to leave me alone and blocking him.

He finds the fact I’m underage (15) more attractive and he is a fully grown man. Please, if anyone messages you from a very new account with no activity and a very generic username and the nature of the message is inappropriate avoid interacting at all. He’s very persistent and very, very insensitive. 

Also if you think you’ve been contacted by him message me, I want to know how many people he’s done this too."

We started to consider doing this earlier, but finally put it into effect as we’ve gotten more request to remove it. As of today, Number Game will be put under Rule 9 as a low effort post. 

The point of this sub is to meet people with a similar age/interest to you who you could become online friends with. What’s not point the of the sub to just figure out what somebody likes, via spamming numbers in the comments to somebody’s post hoping they do some stuff you like. Hope you guys understand and have a great day.

Also if anybody has any suggestions for the future of the subreddit please comment on this post, contact one of us via PMs, ModMail,  or joining the TMT Discord Server. We’ll take all suggestions/ideas into consideration."

I have made some lovely friends along the way and learned about myself and all of you in the process. I would not trade the time I have had with all of you for anything. However, I think the experiment is done. I made a thriving, friendly, mid-size community and had fun doing it, but now is the time for me to step down.

446,"Hey folks.... I've been using this site for about 4 months now, made a couple of really excellent friends but every now and then, I come by and either make a post or dm people who seem genuinely cool or interesting. But here's the thing..... its really strange when you see posts often state ""Don't leave just a hi or hello, leave an intro please!"" Which I follow to the tee and I do just that.... and I get an astonished ""What?"" Followed by either blocking or ghosting. Why? Its not just me, but many people do sincerely put in effort into befriending you guys.... and to be frank, friend making subreddits are not the most optimal places to meet new people, yeah sure there are those one-in-a-million super kind people and there's the average joes which are actually pretty nice, but these places might be the only options for some, and i definitely would like to see some changes,  but for now, here's some of my opinions on this.

 Firstly, don't ghost. Just let them know they aren't a good match for you and they'll understand. I've talked to so many people who seem to disappear off the face of the planet all of a sudden. What is worse... is something im sure many of you have experienced before. They make a post.... following which, you, a jolly and friendly human, decide to talk to them! And after sending a dm, you get no response. ""Oh, don't worry. They might just have changed their mind!"" But then just a day or two later, you see the same person make a post again. Its irritating to say the least cause you basically just left them hanging. Why? It really doesn't feel nice to just tell people to talk to you.... then turn around and proceed to ignore them and then ask for more people to talk to you. 

Secondly, its the oh-so-common issue quite a number of us face. Lack of effort. See, what you put in the posts makes up our first impression of you. For me, I can read a post and be like: ""Woah this person sounds super fun to talk to! It's gonna be great!"" And after accepting the dm and some pleasantries.... this ensues:
""Hi there! I saw that you are interested in ________! Its pretty cool! Mind telling me more?""
""Well.... its just something cool to me i guess. Can't think of anything to say"" 
Eventually.... it just ends up in ""Hi! How's everything going? "" ""Good, hbu?"" It just.... ruins the mood really. Friendships are a two-way thing, you can't expect someone else to put in lots of effort while you sit idly by and just cruise along...... the friendship just won't last! Just try your best people. I'm a pretty shy and awkward person myself, but at least do try your best to maintain a conversation, it takes time to build up but look, I was awful too to start with, but over time I've improved. So can you. :)

In addition, we also have the creeps. Seriously? According to common sense.... (unless you lack any then....umm..... oh well) straight up asking people for sexual favours would first solicit shock from the victim, and then anger and disappointment in humanity. Firstly, this is a sub for making friends and meeting people, not to find people and make sexual advances on. Secondly.... there are minors on here, you jerks. They are called minors for a reason.... they aren't mature enough to do those disturbing things you want them to do. Just because they are vulnerable doesn't entitle you to mistreat them! The fear of creeps and pedos here have actually led to significant numbers of people to not respond just because they assume you're a creep. Geez. Thirdly.... oh wait there is no thirdly... just get the heck away from here!

Also also.... there's the gender issue here.... based on multiple experiments fellow redditors have conducted, as long as you have [__M] or male or something.....your amount of dms automatically decrease. Whereas for females.... their inboxes fill up faster than they can deal with....sigh. I'm not asking for perfection.... but us guys are human... and we would like to have friends too. 

Last but not least.... this is for everyone here.... if your conversations don't work out or your dms are filled..... don't ghost. Just tell the user that you would prefer to stop talking. It leaves a huge impact on the person whom you're talking to if you basically just up and go and leave them unsure of what happened to you. Personally, I'm a worry wart so I get concerned. Some get hurt, some feel angry and that it's unfair. So to minimize that, its as simple as, ""Hey, I don't think we can make good friends, I hope you don't mind if we stop talking."" And if your dms are too full, try to filter out those creeps and super low effort people so you can focus on those who genuinely would put in the time and effort to be your friend. I'm not totally off the hook for that but I do try my best to let them know what happened. For example, my reddit gave out a few weeks ago and I lost all my dms and so I posted a photo on my profile which showed that I can't find my dms which was why I couldn't talk....or because its the exam period for me now, I can't talk as much. I'm sure that they will understand and take note of the circumstances.

Alrighty my fingers are aching a little so I should stop here.... but well.... thats pretty much it. Oh yes.....umm if you'd like you can feel free to dm me :) Alrighty....have a good day!"

Ask them to send you a clip of them holding a sign with their name/username and the date, then wave it around from multiple angles to make sure they're who they say they are.

I discovered this place by going to /r/all , so quite accidentally. I'm just a bit concerned with some of the things I'm seeing. 

Another small tip, please do not drop a link to any of your other social media accounts publicly on Reddit. If you're going to post images of yourself, do not use any other images that you're also using or have used on other social media accounts. Someone could reverse search the images and find you.

Some of them were a bit flirty. A few of them were pretty creepy. And at least 2 of them were straight up pedophiles. If you’re here for nudes or sexual conversation from underage girls, get the hell off reddit entirely. Get off social media. Seek help. Get a therapist. Stop giving in to your urge of having sexual feelings toward children. People like that are not wanted in r/teensmeetteens, and on planet earth for that matter. One man asked if he could be my sugar daddy. Another wanted my nudes even after I tried reasoning with him, saying that it was illegal. It’s insanity. To any pedophiles/creeps that might be reading this now, leave these girls alone. If you are above 18, there are many horny women your age that you can message on ACTUAL DATING SUBREDDITS. NOT A FRIEND-MAKING SITE FOR TEENS. If you are under 18 and still creepily messaging young girls, learn how to stop before it’s too late. If the main reason you’re attracted to a girl is because you want sex with her, you’re not “in love”. You’re horny. This isn’t a place for horny guys to simp as they please. You’re by no means wanted here. To the teenage girls that are at risk of, or have been sent dick pics, been asked for nudes, gotten requests to have a “daddy”, gotten sex invitations from grown ass men, and have been dehumanized to nothing more than a meaningless sex object, watch out. This world is a messed up place. There will always be guys that try to use you for their own benefit. The best thing to do about this is report any perverted behavior you come across to let people become more aware of what really goes on in this subreddit. If you are for whatever reason tempted by them, don’t give in. You are strong. You are amazing. You are beautiful inside and out, and you don’t need some horny neckbeard perverts in your DMs to make you feel like that’s the truth. ❤️

Now that I’m done ranting and I’m too tired to make an entirely separate post, here’s a few facts about me:

- I’m a 16M like I already said.
- I live in Georgia, USA.
- I go by my initials KC when online.
- I hardly watch tv shows or movies because I’m too busy browsing the internet.
- I’m highly interested in philosophy, specifically my own.
- I like Music (dUh) my favorite genres are like indie-pop-alt-rock I guess? And my favorite band is TØP.
- I can’t draw or cook.
- I’ve been single my entire life.
- I should be finishing my math homework due at midnight but I’ll do that after this.
- I have a cat and a dog.
- I have so many stories of bad school experiences to tell and so few to tell them to.
- here’s a story: My ex best friend cheated on his girlfriend for the second time so I told her what happened and she believed me at first but she changed her mind and he ignored me and she ignored me until she asked if she could have the electric guitar he gave me a few months ago as payback for me giving him 20$ to buy his brother a birthday present 5 years ago.

I’m rlly tired and bored so please respond if u wanna be my friend :)

so rn it’s just a super chill group that’s been talking about a lot  of things. 

we had a bad experience with a dude just spamming racist, transphobic and homophobic memes so that’s why we don’t really want anyone like him. and he was being so rude when we asked him to stop and it was just a headache"

Why hasn't anyone done anything about this fucking subreddit yet?! The moderators are non-existent, teens are NOT aware of the rules and/or the type of shit they post which will eventually be looked at by ANYONE! 

I just feel REALLY fucking bad that these poor teenagers/minors are getting SOOOO many creepy notifications! I've already talked to people here who admitted they are getting a lot bad DM's. I understand it was their choice to post on here, but I want EVERYONE to be aware of what they are doing here. 

YOU ARE A MINOR. THIS IS THE INTERNET. 

PLEASE! MODERATORS WHAT THE FUCK?!? GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER! I really wish there was somebody else noticing or reporting this sub as much as I do, because it's seriously really bad. 

Teens who are reading this, I want you to start reporting and standing up for others in the chats and on this subreddit. Also, warning other teens about the type of people who see their photos. We need to take action NOW! 

Thank you.

557,"Now, heres the the thing. I would much rather find someone in person to despise and exchange passive aggressive comments spiteful enough to make Jane Austen worried, but unfortunately most people are put off when you pull bullshit like this. Strangely enough, not really how people interact.

But rejoice! This is reddit! Surely a platform of much more intelligent and articulate people who don't succumb to unnecessary social norms, right? Uh, yeah, my hopes are not high. Chances are I spend too long having a great opening conversation with a plethora of people and never talk to them again. Oh well.

Anyway, down to business. The end goal? After years of unnecessary competition, we meet up in person and duke it out with medieval swords in a parking lot at the dead of night. One of us dies tragically at the ripe age of 19. The other goes to jail, and withers away as they've accomplished all of their goals in life and also dies. It's tragic, it's shakespearian, and it'll get a solid 54% on rotten tomatoes. The ""looking for friends"" flair is a red herring. Get outwitted. I've got enough friends at the moment (like, 3 and a half), so that's not what I'm here for.

However, before that fateful climax, we'll probably have to talk, at least a little. Hiya, I'm Trinity, I'm dumb, and I'm overly competitive. I silently try to outdo every single one of my friends, and it's probably not healthy. I lament as I realize that all the people I knew in middle school has surpassed me in nearly every aspect in life. It's fine though, since I'm making BFFs on reddit at 3 in the morning. It's fine. Okay? It's fine. 

You hit me up, that's a fucking vow you've just made. I know, really metal. Actually that's a bit much, even i'm not that committed as a person. That's like, a vague general agreement you've just made. You need motivation to actually function in school? It's common knowledge is that spite is the best motivator, so I'll boast endlessly about how I fucking nailed that ungodly math quiz the other day, and I'll be goddamned obnoxious about it too, unless you manage to stifle my ego a bit. Essentially, no reservations held when it comes to bragging. You're proud of the fact that you won that one chess competition in 5th grade? Declare as such, and then I'll tell you I won the sports day race in third grade. So on and so forth.

Wow, this whole thing is a tangent. I'm tired, alright? That's not a solid basis for good writing. I'll ramble at you in the conversation instead of sticking it all here, so you can at least have some semblance of input. I'd prefer a fellow junior in highschool, because i'd feel bad dunking on a freshman or something. I'd also prefer that you had some sorta rad skill or two. Just so like, there's stuff to actually compete over. 

This is stupid and i'm tired so i'm going to sleep now, but yeah. If you're interested, dm me. School's currently dragging me through a ditch, so I will likely not entertain idle small talk. I respect small talk. I respect just opening conversations with 'Hello'. The problem is, right, is that I just like, dont want to uhhh suffer through a painfully dull conversation. I'm sure you don't either. What? Where was i going with this? Uh, i dont know. Yeah, I'm Trinity, I read too many fantasy medieval books in middle school, and I overuse commas.

Later skaters

(tldr; there's so much bs in this post, but honestly just read through it. use it in a paper on the fragilities of human sanity, if you wish. But I seriously don't want a 30 minute long talk that goes nowhere, so just read it.)"

Some do this already, and I appreciate those who do, but it would be great if you can distinguish in your post whether you're looking for someone to talk to within the moment (out of boredom), or if you are actually looking for a long-term online friendship (consider the long-distance factor as well). This could perhaps reduce the number of people who are either ghosted or simply not compatible with the OP. For the mods/devs of the subreddit, perhaps there could be tags/flairs implemented to help with this. Just a thought. 

In addition, if you want a connection to last more than a single day, (after your first day of knowing each other) perhaps you can pm or text the person first instead of waiting too much on them, it tells them that you are invested in the friendship. Now I know that many already do that and end up being ghosted anyway, but I often see OPs who say they want a friendship but then ghost ppl without giving them much of a chance or showing much effort.

I just think that everyone on this subreddit can benefit from this info, and it can help get rid of the number of ghosting incidents. Lmk below what you think below!

EDIT: Wow! Didn't actually expect this to blow up the way it did. Muchos Gracias mi amigos!

Im the type of person to always message you back and am never dry and conversations! And am looking for someone else like this. I'm also the type to look for more long term friends, people that I can be there for and can always talk with.

 I play lots of games on PC like Minecraft, Brawlhalla, Valorant, CS:GO, Krunker, Stardew Valley, and terraria!  

I also have lots of interests outside of video games including animals, hiking, going on walks with my dog, flying drones, listening to music, and even programming!

  With all this I'm sure we have something in common that could help us start a conversation!

I tried dming one of the girls that posted here but it's been 3 months since my dm has been read and not replied to and another one here that got 100+ upvotes then turned out to be sexist. I just really wish this sub becomes more balanced and girls who aren't actually looking for friends should post to other subs such as r/selfies, r/TeenAmICute etc instead of here. I miss the old sub where cool people get more upvotes/attention rather than girls collecting simps.

693,"hi! I'm 14F cishet, looking for a friend my age, preferably female due to religious reasons. strictly for people in my age group so like 13-16/17 max. i live in Singapore and I'm looking for a friend to like, cuddle with and just to chill and chit chat a bit and is comfortable with just sitting around with each other's company. I'm a generally awkward person so if you're the type who don't like silence I'm not the right friend for you. I'm hoping for a healthy friendship kind of thing and race/religion/sexuality doesn't matter to me. it would also be convenient if you stayed in the west area.

things i will do for you (and hope you will also do for me) :

\- i will make time to hang out with you at least once a week ( we could just eat somewhere/go window shopping/go ice skating/picnic/or we could even go to each others houses ect.)

\- i would love to just go on mini adventures with you.

\- \*i will give you hugs and cuddles and i will let you sleep on my lap.\* ( you must be comfortable with this )

\- i am willing to be your listening ear so you can unload all you problems to me. (i might even treat you to your fav food if I'm not broke atm)

\- i will try to visit you if you're sick.

\- you don't need to tell me everything about yourself but i would love it if we became closer overtime and started being real close friends.

\- i will be honest with you and i will tell you I'm if not comfortable with anything

\- i will respect your boundaries ( but if you don't like hugs then byebye )

i might add more but thats all i could think of atm. i know this is kinda unrealistic and i can foresee things being awkward in the beginning but i hope to make this work. I'm not even sure if anyone would reply, but a girl can dream.

more info abt me if it helps:

i like watching anime, i like ice skating, i play the guitar and is currently learning the violin. I'm a muslim (just incase that bothers you), i love soft toys and plushies and i have many of them at my house. if you're a male we can still do all those stuff mentioned above excluding the cuddles, not because i don't trust males, but because my religion does not allow me to have physical contact with ppl of opp gender. i wld still love to spend chill time with you!"

885,"Hi everyone! I'm Silver, 15, from germany  ( \^  v  \^ )  
My hobbies are playing ultimate frisbee, watching anime, gaming (Pc & Nintendo > XBox & PS, fight me if you disagree (ง'̀-'́)ง ),listening to music and talking to new people ( \^  v  \^ )  
Although I'm somewhat good at english (or at least like to think so, haha), I'm still practicing the language, but that shouldn't really be a problem.   
Oh, I also have a really cute [cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/cutepetsofreddit/comments/jzlnsp/look_at_how_happy_my_baby_looks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)!  ( ╹▽╹ )

***Looking for people between the age of 13 and 19.*** Like, seriously, if you're not a teenager why are you even on this subreddit?

After I got to know you, I'd be more than happy to add you on Discord so we can call/play videogames together but please know that it may take me a few days, I always wanna make sure the person I'm talking to isn't a creep first, lol"
