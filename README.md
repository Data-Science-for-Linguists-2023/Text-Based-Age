# Text-Based-Age-Recognition


This is Varun's Term project for LING 1340

The objective of this project is to find markers of age within blog posts using The Blog Authorship Corpus and a Reddit Dataset that I have curated.

To replicate any work, 

```
# create virtual environment
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
# activate virtual environment
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
# install requirements
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
