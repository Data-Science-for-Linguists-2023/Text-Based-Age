30s,"Final nail in the coffin was me finding a long blonde hair in my laundry. I'm not blonde, my new roommate isn't blonde. Who is? His little friend he only hung out with while I was at work all night and he always hid it from me. No. I won't play that shit anymore."
10s,"So boys, if a somewhat attractive girl were to pay you attention and have things in common with you, would you most likely be interested in her? Would you say yes if she asked you out? Is it really that easy to get a guy to like you???"
20s,"Physically active, non-hermit friends who like to play and have fun and be silly. And not just on a rare, scheduled basis. The type of friends who will drop what they’re doing to go out and play kick the can, toss a frisbee around, or just ride bikes.  I miss playing outside until we reached total physical exhaustion, going in for snacks and some chill time, then heading straight back out for more. EDIT: Let’s all be friends and do stuff outside together!"
