I miss playing outside until we reached total physical exhaustion, going in for snacks and some chill time, then heading straight back out for more.

EDIT: Let‚Äôs all be friends and do stuff outside together!"

20,"Was considered a ‚Äògifted‚Äô student all through elementary to high school, but now I‚Äôm finishing my undergrad with a sort of decent GPA and absolutely zero clue what to do with my life. I feel like I bullshit my entire way through college and had no takeaway. Anyone else?

EDIT: Just wanted to make a quick edit to say I put ‚Äògifted‚Äô in quotes bc I think we all know damn well the people labeled as ‚Äògifted‚Äô in school aren‚Äôt all academic geniuses. We‚Äôre just people who did pretty good in school at the time & they slapped a label on it. My whole argument is just that having that label kind of fucks up your mentality for life after school."

36,"It‚Äôs commonly said that Instagram often makes people feel insecure. When I was in college, seeing everyone‚Äôs highlights on IG made me want to go out more and keep up with my image. 

But since graduating, LinkedIn has been making me feel the same way. I by no means have a bad job, but it seems like every time I check LinkedIn, my peers are being promoted, accepted into great grad programs, and working at amazing companies.

There‚Äôs always that kid who got landed a software engineering job with Google, investment banking job at Goldman, or associate position at Boston Consulting Group. 

Of course I wish everyone success - these are hardworking students who deserve every bit of their success. It‚Äôs just that seeing everyone killing it in the beginning of their careers makes me feel like I didn‚Äôt try hard or wasn‚Äôt smart/competitive enough."

45,2 years since graduation. Still around 50k in debt. Just got a new job making $17/hr. Just got a call the other day from a rafting company offering me a job as a raft guide for the summer making $11.25/hr before tips. I want to feel alive again. I feel like taking this summer job would be something spontaneous and fun. I would camp out for the summer thus no paying rent. I‚Äôve been very depressed because I have no money to spend on hobbies. I just watch tv and that‚Äôs it. I feel like this would be a great way to work and pick up a hobby. Am I crazy for wanting to leave this office job to go pursue this??
46,This is so rad

50,"Get up, go to work, come home, make dinner, go sleep, and repeat the cycle.Nothing is quite  terrible but nothing is quite right either.  Like this can't  be it. I'm  ready to take on the world. Not be stuck  living some average life doing the same shit over and over till I die. Some people really think this is how life is and I refuse to believe so.  I'm  searching for answers. Right now money and things arent doing it for me. I think I'm  searching for a higher purpose amd challenge."
51,"It has been such a long year. Every single time I felt that I was getting close to something, it slipped through my finger tips and it all felt like absolute shit. My mental health has been so bad because I felt like I was a failure. But yesterday I was offered my first full time position at a really interesting company that sounds right up my alley and I am now realizing that maybe things really do happen for a reason. I‚Äôve been feeling like going to college was such a waste of time until now. I just came here to say that If you feel down about not snagging a full time position right out of school or feel like your degree got you nowhere please just remember you are doing your best and good things are headed your way. Keep working your butt off til you get where you dream to be."
52,"It's not that I hate actually wearing business clothes it's that I'm forced to because of the dress code. I didn't think it was a big deal until I realized I could only wear my favorite shirt and shorts after work or on the weekends. I think it's an identity thing. I feel like I'm becoming the suit and tie and it's not me. Every time I see kids walking the streets after school I look at them with such envy like you're so lucky, why can't I dress like that anymore? 

&#x200B;

As crazy as it seems the clothes I wear really effects me. I get that you don't want to look like a bum but having to wear a suit doesn't make me perform better. I simply like dressing the way I want, it's a way of expressing myself.  I feel totally disconnected from my true self right now."
53,
54,"There's a lot of people out there who wish they didn't have to work or go to school and could just have all the free time they wanted. This is coming from a person who's living at home with their parents and doesn't have to pay for any expenses fyi. I've been an unemployed college grad for a few years and I can tell you it's not what it's made out to be. 

Sure, maybe I can wake up whenever I want but having too much leisure time after a while gets boring. You could travel or do fun stuff you normally wouldnt have time for but I guarantee there will be something still missing in your life. Maybe a few weeks or months is ok but anything longer than that you start to question your existence. For anyone who wished they didn' t have to work anymore I would gladly switch places with them asap."

56,Edit: Figured out what I‚Äôm going to do. B.S in Biology. Then apply to some Physician Assistant programsü•≥
57,"Ever since school we've always been around people within our age. Now that we're in the real world it's all over the place. You work with people who are 30, 40, 50, 60, etc. I found it weird to be talking to someone who was my dad's age like he was my friend. I never thought I'd have anything in common with a middle aged man. 

Then there are times where I feel out of place like the baby in the group. There's people talking about their marriage, their kids, how their skin is starting to wrinkle, and I just can't relate to this . I'm kinda lost like a freshmen again."
58,"I can‚Äôt believe it. After 5 years at uni and climbing the ladder in health I was sought out for a job without applying for it. My resume was passed around people and I was called out of the blue. They didn‚Äôt even interview me! I start on the 18th and I‚Äôm so excited. I just wanted to share. It can happen guys. I‚Äôve spent years at jobs that made me depressed and anxious, thousands of hours writing applications only to be rejected. I‚Äôve thought I was worthless and deep down still do, but someone else doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm 33 so just be patient, if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone."
59,"I think part of the reason I feel so much anxiety right now is because my life doesn't look how it's supposed to. It's been ingrained into minds from a young age to go to school, get a job, get married, have kids, become financially stable, and buy a house. If you aren't or haven't done any of those things it makes you feel like you're a loser when you really aren't. Everyone is doing their own thing, it's not a race to see who becomes successful first. Like it doesn't matter if you're 21 or 31 when you get a college degree. If you want to become a doctor at 45 then do it. Who cares how old you are? Society has tricked us into believing what we should be doing with our lives and making us feel guilty if we aren't doing it that way."

61,"Sorry if this is not relevant here, but how do you cope with living with your family? A bit of background, I‚Äôm 23 and about to graduate with my bachelors this Friday(!!!) A week after, I start my masters degree in education which is 1.5 years. I currently work in retail and I make $7.50 an hour and work part time, which barely covers my personal expenses (gas, car insurance, credit card bill). Due to this, there‚Äôs no possible way I can afford to live on my own and so I live with my family. I get along fine with them, but I just can‚Äôt help but feel behind. Especially when my boyfriend who is two years younger than I is moving into his own place with his friend in a couple weeks. I used to live out of state while attending school, and it got to be too expensive which is why I moved back home, but by doing that it gave me a taste of independence and now I just don‚Äôt feel like I have it all together because I‚Äôm living with my parents. Sorry for the formatting, on mobile.

EDIT: did not expect this to blow up!! Thank you all for the advice and input! I hope this thread can help others too."
62,"I feel like this way of thinking is a mistake though because I keep hearing people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the geography that matters‚Äù ... but I don‚Äôt know how to make the most out of life here. I‚Äôve been meeting new friends and I live close to both my parents and my husbands parents, but it just doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm living anymore!? In college I did things all the time (weekdays too) and was super productive and fun. 

Now it feels like my eyes are closed all week and I only wake up for the weekends. 

When we were in college we rented a house that was THE HOUSE everyone would come to to hang out! All of our friends even had house keys so they could just come by whenever. We had friends at our place all. the. time. I loved it so much. Now we only know some people here but it‚Äôs like much more planned ahead of time if we want to hang out and it feels weird. When I tell my parents about this they say it‚Äôs just part of growing up. They tell me how they haven‚Äôt had friends since they were young and they love that and that everyone goes their own direction. 

Plus even if we did move back to our college town, it‚Äôs not like any of our friends are still there! They also all moved back to their home towns or other cities for jobs. 

Bottom line is I think I‚Äôm subconsciously keeping myself from ‚Äúliving in the moment‚Äù because I only think about the past or the future and I‚Äôm not enjoying the now anymore as much as I used to. 

Instead of making a drastic change with a huge move, I want to learn to enjoy life here and now! Any ideas? Or has anyone else felt similar to this?"
63,"I would consider myself an emotional person with a little lower-than-average mental health. I work an office job, 8-5, but I don‚Äôt know, for the life of me, how everyone gets up to go to work every day. I find myself needing a mental health day pretty much monthly, as my weekends are just as busy as my weekdays. I feel like I‚Äôm a bad employee because everyone else at work is there without sick or vacation days being taken up, while I make poor excuses to my boss why I can‚Äôt come in the morning of."
64,"Like I'm not expecting anyone to baby me like they're my parents but I feel like the real world is a cruel place. You can't pay your rent on time your landlord doesn't care, if you fall and break a bone it's up to you to get help, you got fired well go find another job, someone stole your laptop well tough luck.  I know I'm capable of handling these things by myself but man I wish sometimes there was someone there to say are you ok? Someone to have my back. Maybe I do miss my parents, teachers, coaches, and mentors. I guess that song ""Ain't it fun"" by Paramore hits it right on point about living in the real world."
65,"Honestly, I‚Äôve known my friends back home most of my life but going to uni showed me how great friends can actually be. Most of them are often giving excuses to not hang out, are introverted and just make no effort.

Some people might be questioning whether they like me and that they just don‚Äôt want to hang out with me. This isn‚Äôt the case, they‚Äôre just boring, awkward people and I‚Äôm desperate to find better friends around my area but it‚Äôs hard.  Anybody else ever had this problem?

Edit: I have nothing against introverted people, hopefully I don‚Äôt come off that way."
66,"Feels like 25-35 is a real weird time in our lives. Everyone is going in their own direction. I'm a 30 year old single guy and I have no clue what my role in society is anymore. I'm no longer a college rager who gets drunk all the time, I don't play on any sports teams like I did in school,I don't know how to dress anymore, true friends are way harder to find,my family is across the country, no gf, and   I don't have any kids so I can't be a father. Ya I'm pretty much nobody outside of work, paying bills, and trying to make my life not that boring. I do try a lot of things  solo but man it gets lonely at times. I'm just completely lost with who I truly am."
67,"I ask because that's where a lot of young 20 somethings are right now. I used to feel less than or missing out because I was still living in a small town. I live in SoCal so I go to LA a lot. Although I like visiting I just don't see the allure. It's crowded, expensive, dirty, and people are more rude. Don't get me wrong there's more opportunities and things to do but it's not like I can't get the same things somewhere else. Like anywhere else I think cities can get boring after a while. Same bars, same clubs, same restaurants, same scenery, the novelty eventually wears off.

&#x200B;

I feel like people move to a big city because everyone else is and it's the trendy thing to do. Unless you're already wealthy (which most 20 somethings aren't)  you're probably going to be living paycheck to paycheck in a crappy apartment. It's easy to get caught up in fads and be a follower. Eat at this restaurant, go this club, wear this type of clothing, hang out with this crowd, etc. Shit gets expensive because you want to fit in and not miss out. I'm being tricked into believing the city is the place to be."

70,"I (22f) just graduated with an accounting degree and I regret it. You always hear things like 'accounting is a good field', 'there's good money in it.'  Yes, I know that. To be honest, I chose accounting because it was a safe choice and Ive always had doubt in my mind, but I just settled with it. I mean just staring in front of a computer all day and working with excel, what was I thinking? I really regret going to college right after high school, because it was the 'normal thing' to do, but I really wished I took the time to not go to college first and figure myself now here I am being lost and not sure what to do."
71,"Some people are cool and some aren't but I can tell the age gap when I socialize with my older co-workers. For example they might talk about how their wife and kids are driving them nuts and I'm just like ok, I don't know nothing about that. 

The only time I ever interacted with adults were my teachers and parents. You realize they gossip, cheat, don't like certain people, have their own cliques, and have  flaws to. It's like whoa, I thought adults knew everything and that high school ended. Guess they didn't know what they were saying when we were kids. I guess I was expecting something different in the real world."

73,"Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt come off the wrong way. Just came across this sub (awesome idea btw) and decided to share my story. Maybe it will give somebody facing a similar fork in the road some hope. 

When choosing my major, salary was not on my radar in the slightest. I knew I wanted to help people, and that I didn‚Äôt want to become a corporate drone. For added context, I graduated high school in 2008. The economy was in full meltdown, my parents home was in danger of being foreclosed on, and I felt like the cards had been stacked against me by the previous generation before I‚Äôd even gotten a chance to sit at the grown-up table. So I made what seemed like a logical decision at the time: I‚Äôm not playing the game. Instead I decided to become a teacher. Fuck the boomers and their fucked economy. I want to help people. 

So I went to a pretty good in-state public university and worked my ass off for 4 years. I graduated in 2012  and as it turned out, I was a pretty good teacher for an inexperienced 21 year old. I was offered a pretty good teaching gig within a few weeks of graduation. I‚Äôll never forget the day I got the call from the principal offering me the job. I was working as a camp counselor at the time and all the kids and staff knew who was calling me, so they (not so sneakily) spied on me as I took the call to see how I‚Äôd react. They all started cheering when I closed my flip phone and started jumping up and down screaming that I got the job. 

That elation quickly turned to panic and rage after I got my first couple paychecks. I had 2 more months before I‚Äôd have to begin payments towards my student loans, and what I was getting paid would only barely cover the payments. Forget about gas, insurance, cell bill or anything else. On top of that, the previous year the school district I was working in had laid off just about every teacher who hadn‚Äôt achieved tenure, and then immediately rehired them. Doing this meant the laid off/rehired teachers started over at the bottom of the salary range and lost all their progress towards tenure, while the district got to save some money. All signs pointed to them doing it again at the end of the current school year (they did). 

I had arrived at a decision point. Continue on the path I was on, doing the job I had spent the last 4 years of my life preparing for with the knowledge that my prospects for making more money were basically zero, OR jump ship to something new with better pay. It was without question the most difficult decision I‚Äôve ever been faced with. I didn‚Äôt handle it well. My thoughts swirled around how none of this was fair. I‚Äôd done what I was told - tried in school, got good grades, went to a pretty good college, and got a job. Isn‚Äôt everything else just supposed to take care of itself?

The mixture of disappointment and understanding on my department head‚Äôs face when I gave my 2 weeks was another thing I‚Äôll never forget. She told me she understood why, but that me not teaching was a waste of a gift. Gee thanks lady. Not exactly what I needed to hear at that moment. 

I signed up with a temp agency since unemployment was the highest it had been in my lifetime and I had no idea where to start. They placed me with a finance company in their customer service department. Now, if you‚Äôve ever worked in a call center I want to extend my deepest apologies to you. I hope you‚Äôre ok, just take it 1 call at a time. If you haven‚Äôt worked in a call center... don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs hell. It is literal fucking hell. Imagine getting yelled at by strangers for 7.25 hours everyday for something you didn‚Äôt do that you have no power to change. Then once you get off the call your manager yells at you for any number of a million different reasons. It‚Äôs not fun. But my foot was in the door. So I took the same approach I took in college and worked my ass off. I learned everything I could about every product we offered, I practiced the steps to wrap-up and note a call the same way a gamer preparing for a speed run would. I became one of the fastest most productive reps they had so that they‚Äôd be *forced* to notice me. Once I had their attention I made it clear that I wanted more. More responsibility, more projects, more tasks. After a couple weeks they offered me a permanent position, and 11 months later they offered me a promotion to supervisor. 

This is where things started to get interesting. Every supervisor before me had been the same: jaded asshats that treated the staff like shit. Belittling them when they had questions or needed help. I was instructed to do the same, but instead I pretended I was teaching. I treated my co-workers with respect and helped them learn, rather then spoon feeding them answers I taught them how to arrive at the answer themselves. After 2 years I was offered a promotion to Team Manager in a different (non-call center) department. Fast forward to today and I‚Äôm a department manager in an industry I never thought I‚Äôd be in, making pretty decent money (nothing crazy), I own a home, my student loans are shrinking by the day, and I feel good about my future. It took a little over 5 years to get there after graduating, but I got there. 

So what‚Äôs the lesson here? I have no fucking idea. I didn‚Äôt necessarily do things the ‚Äúright‚Äù way, in fact I made some pretty terrible/shortsighted decisions. But I recognized that the path I was on wasn‚Äôt going anywhere and no amount of hoping or complaining was going to change that. So I made a leap of faith and learned everything I could about the field I ended up in. I didn‚Äôt let the corporate culture infect me, and instead tried to stay positive with a focus on helping others. 

If you find yourself on a similar path to mine, you can do it. You can find the courage to make the tough decision and start over. You have the strength inside you to start from the bottom and claw your way up. There‚Äôs no question that us millennials/gen z got dealt a pretty fucked up hand. But we also have some advantages that the previous generations didn‚Äôt have. Stay authentic, do things for the right reasons, and learn everything you can. You got this."
74,"at least, it does for me. I'm just. Everything feels like it fell apart for me a few months ago, when I graduated. I don't know what to do with myself and even with my degree, getting a job has been next to impossible.  I guess this is sort of a whiny post to make, but I figured everyone here would understand.

&#x200B;

I'm good at school. Always have been. I just feel really clueless now."
75,"I just realized how absolutely lonely I am. My sister is 25 and still able to keep a friend group and be consistent speaking terms with them and constantly have them over. Since college not once have I had a single friend over. I‚Äôve tried becoming friends with these cosplay people I know from conventions but I feel as I‚Äôve been forcing myself to their friend group. Am I that unlikable maybe? I remember how easy it came to me too make friends now I don‚Äôt even receive messages from anyone. I was hoping to make friends through the art and gaming community but no avail through there either. I joined the art club at my college but I also feel like they‚Äôre in it just to get something on their resume.  What can I do to be able too meet new people? Coming to grips with this is actually very upsetting realizing I didn‚Äôt even have any of my supposed friends tell me happy birthday.

Edit: I‚Äôve took all your opinions to consideration. Thank you very much, I will be trying to put myself out there again and stop letting my confidence drop so low. If I can hug all of you I would. Thank you."
76,"I'm a paid intern at a company for the summer. It's an 8-5 gig. Pay's decent.

Most of the day, I'm bored scrolling through reddit. 

The work they give me takes a few mins at most and then I have nothing to do for another 40 mins or so. 

I don't have my phone charger on me so my phone's gonna die soon and I'll have almost 4 hours of complete bordom today. 

I miss having loads of work where I feel like I don't have enough time and I'm rushing to do everything. It's kind of a thrill to be on the clock like that."
77,WOOOOO LETS GO BABY 1ST GRADE LETS GOOOOOO any tips/tricks?
78,"I feel like simply being quicker with a computer than 90% of my ageing work colleagues is the best skill I have (finance). I get everything done in my workday in 20 minutes to an hour.

I used to ask for more to do but I just get work that feels more and more like pointless busy work, so now I just spend most of my day on Reddit or pointlessly opening and closing spreadsheets to look busy.

It's been like this for my three jobs since graduating. I don't even feel like a wageslave at work, I feel like I'm just literally wasting time. At least slaves are productive."
79,I just graduated college this past weekend and I think the word that best describes what I‚Äôm feeling is euphoric. I‚Äôm just so glad to be done with all the stress that comes with school work and I‚Äôm eager to begin the next chapter of my life. I landed a really good job in my hometown which I start next week and I just moved back to my parents house which i‚Äôm looking forward to because it means I get to reconnect and spend some quality time with my family for a bit before I move back out. I just feel like I‚Äôm in a really good place right now and I just wanted to share the positivity with all of you :)
80,"I know I certainly am. I think of it all the time where I remind myself shit I'm 32 and I've been working the same crappy job for 5 years, maybe I should do what I really want to do now. Or shit, the thought of having kids still scares the crap out of me. Am I supposed to be thinking about that kind of thing now? 

I try to remind myself that life isn't a race and that you can do things at any age but I feel the pressure sometimes. Maybe it's societies standards but whatever the reason I'm beating myself up because I think I'm supposed to have done this or have that by now."
81,"I think a lot of us think we're in this competitive battle  to see who has the most money, best job, biggest house, etc. I feel like comparison is at an all time high after college and it's sickening. Don't be tricked or feel bad because your friend can spend $30 at a nice restaurant while you're still eating cup of noodles. Unless you're super rich most of us have limited money and it's just a matter of what you spend your money on.

Don't go broke spending money on designer clothes because you feel like you need to look  like you're wealthy. It's beyond stupid and it makes no sense. There's a lot of insecure 20-30 year olds and it's like high school all over again except it's on a bigger scale. Don't be tricked by appearances. Everyone is living their own life and like they say life isn't a race. Fitting in is for losers."
82,"I don't want this post to sound bratty because I obviously know the severity of Coronavirus and I understand a lot of others have it worse. That being said, I am super bummed about my last semester of college being moved online. I know the university ultimately made the right choice for our safety, but it just sucks. This time of year is always so fun and it being my senior year made me more involved on campus than ever. To have it randomly cut short just really threw me for a loop. I think having to unexpectedly say goodbye to my friends and professors was the worst part. 

On top of all this, our school is still deciding if we will be cancelling our commencement ceremony or not. After 4 years of working so hard to get my degree, thinking about not having the chance to walk across the stage and celebrate with my friends and family makes me really sad.

Anyways, thank you for letting me have a pity party! Most people don't understand how emotional it can be to say goodbye to your college days so prematurely. 

Are any of you guys going through this too? How are you feeling about it?"
83,I swear if you're 25-30 its really tough. I'm  27 and people my age are all doing their own thing.  People who are younger come off as immature and i have nothing in common with a 40 year old married with kids. I feel like a lost child.
84,"Your early 20s feels like you're 13 or 14. Honestly, being in your early 20s feels like being that little high school boy who is 14: unpopular, not socially desired, inexperienced, and significantly behind your peers. I never felt this way when I was 18, 19, or even 20. You feel too old for the kids younger than you but too young for your peers who are a little bit older than you. It is eerily similar to your high school years in my opinion. Anyone feel the same?"
85,"Pretty much the title. Spent 30 bucks on an Uber to go to my first in-person interview since graduating in May, and they had a sign up saying administration had left for the day and for interviewees to fill out an application left on the desk. The morons even sent me a text confirmation for my interview time a couple hours earlier. Another person showed up while I was still standing there dumbstruck and she was given the same interview time as me, which was our cue to say fuck it and just leave. Was extraordinarily annoyed  at first, but now just feeling really down after finally feeling wanted enough to get an interview."
86,"Just a long vent, really. If you have advice, feel free to throw it at me. 

I‚Äôm 23F, graduated from college December of 2018. Despite being totally introverted in high school, I went to a Big 10 school, hated it for the first year because I was out of my element and ended up having the best 3 years of my life after I finally decided to be more extroverted. 

Since then, I started grad school in January of 2019, moved to a new city and got a new part time job. I have some friends that live in the city near me, and when I first moved, I made a lot of attempts to be social in my new atmosphere since I was living alone for the first time.

As of the last 3 months or so, I‚Äôve felt so alone. My social life is practically non-existent. The friendships I‚Äôve tried so hard to maintain since college ended are hanging on by a thread, and the friends I do have in the city I live in don‚Äôt exactly reciprocate in terms of making plans and getting together.

School consumes a lot of my time (despite the fact that it‚Äôs mostly online) and although I love my job, I‚Äôm not particularly close to most of my coworkers as I‚Äôm 23 and they‚Äôre all late 20s/early 30s. 

I‚Äôm trying to develop new hobbies, find new ways to get involved in the area and make new friends with similar interests, but I feel stuck. High school me probably would‚Äôve loved all of the alone time, but man I hate it. Making friends after college is fucking hard. I‚Äôd give anything to be in college again, this transition blows."
87,Now what?
88,LinkedIn every time I go on there it‚Äôs full of self fulfilling posts rubbing there egos up all the time. If I have to hear about someone else‚Äôs post about how they struggled with homelessness and fast forward 5 years there now a ceo of some company that crap is so lame. Just makes me feel like wtf is LinkedIn anymore it‚Äôs like a big circle jerk like Facebook. Anyone feel the same way?
89,"How do you stay positive after college???

 I graduated in May-3 months ago. I have yet to find a job. I have applied to SOO many jobs at this point. (100+)

I had a job interview at a very prestigious office in nyc and even made it to final round and ended up not getting chosen. It was a job I REALLY wanted, and now that I didn‚Äôt get it I‚Äôm feeling very low/defeated.

I just feel as if I‚Äôll never get a good job. My days consist of me being locked in my room, looking for jobs online, and crying. Just full of depression. 

I am losing faith in myself/ my career/ God/etc. üò£"
90,"I used to love wearing what I wanted to school: sweats, sweaters, sneakers, t-shirts, shorts, and the overall freedom to express yourself . Now I gotta put on slacks and a dress shirt and I feel a huge disconnect between who I am and how they want me to be. I didn't realize how I dressed would affect me. Every workplace is different and maybe some of you still can dress casual but what's the point of buying say for example a Nike sweater if you know you can only wear it after work or on the weekends?"
91,Makes you miss college right?
92,
93,I felt in college like I was on top of the world ready for life afterwards. I felt like I reached my peak once I graduated college but I feel like I'm at the bottom of the totem poll now.  Who I was in college don't matter anymore and I got to start over again. I'm suddenly the youngest one at work who doesn't know how to act and there's people with more experience like 10-20-30 plus years.  Nobody cares where I went to school or what frat I was in.Now I'm in a different world.  It feels weird.

I've got barely any money saved, working a job i hate, still haven't traveled,  still single, and nowhere near what i expected. know i got time and age shouldn't define me but damn i did not picture my life to be what it is 10 years ago. Maybe i had too high expectations to or were unrealistic."

97,"I always thought whatever I majored in that I needed to memorize it so I could do it at my job. I couldn't have been more wrong and naive. Although it's good to be knowledgeable in your degree none of it even applies to the job I do. I didn't even realize that you don't necessarily have to get a job that's related to your major either. Took me a while to realize work is mostly about getting experience, critical thinking ,and being able to figure stuff out."
98,"in high school its all about getting into college

in college, its all about graduating, maybe getting into grad school

after that its just..... emptiness.

if you are lucky you got a job, but, all that hype and energy of ""you gotta go to college"" ""best years of your life"" etc, felt so overblown, overhyped, living the traditional  ""dream"" feels so empty and pointless.  

lets not forget the overhyped ""power"" of a degree. thats so depressing i dont even want to talk about it. it was an unpleasant surprise."

100,"I graduated last year with a degree in marketing. I had little experience upon graduation. I didn‚Äôt take any internships. I knew this was going to hurt me in the long run. I justified it by saying I didn‚Äôt have time, or that I didn‚Äôt want to work for free. Those things are kind of true, but I think deep down I knew that this career wasn‚Äôt right for me and I didn‚Äôt really want to do it. 

Since I had such little experience, every marketing firm I applied to ghosted me. If I really wanted to, I could have built a portfolio. I could have learned photoshop and after effects, but I didn‚Äôt. It was a career that simply didn‚Äôt interest me anymore. Working at a marketing firm was not something I could see myself doing. 

I took some odd jobs after college, trying to figure out what to do. An opportunity came up for me to be a painting apprentice at a collision repair shop and I took it. I have always been somewhat interested in cars and I am no stranger to manual work. I worked on a farm for many years before college. 

Honestly, I love the work. I get to work with my hands and get dirty. Working with vehicles and learning the entire painting and body repair process is fascinating. The job is extremely fulfilling and the days fly by. It‚Äôs my favorite job I‚Äôve ever had. 

Had I not went to college and went to tech school instead, or taken an apprenticeship right out of high school, I would have years in the industry under my belt and I would be making some serious money by now. But instead I have to now work my way up from the bottom. My degree is useless and it‚Äôs in a field that I am never going to be in. I wish I had known that before I put myself through four extremely stressful years. 



TLDR - Got a degree in a field I wasn‚Äôt interested in. Found a job I like that doesn‚Äôt require a 4 year degree. Could have just not went to college and have more experience in a job that I actually like."

I used to say life is great single, last thing I need is to get in the wrong relationship, now I just feel an urgency to find one. I used to say it's ok if you don't aren't doing your dream job, now I'm desperate to find it. I used to think money isn't everything, now I think it is. I know this is completely counter-intuitive.

To date, my friend's company is the only Interview I've had since graduating out of dozens of applications. Am I being unreasonable, or are their ways around this road block?

112,"Just wanted to share and gather a bit of positive perspective for those of y'all who are almost done.

&#x200B;

I'm 23 - 2 years out of school, and holy shit - Life has never been better.

The amount of freedom and resources that open up to you is simply amazing once you get out of school.

I've literally never had this much money, energy or time before. 

&#x200B;

Work: Work is amazing when compared to school, I'm always traveling and meeting new people and working on new exciting projects that I actually care about. I literally just left the Tesla factory in Fremont and holy shit, seeing how that is coming together is bloody amazing. I get to put my brainpower and effort toward something that can actually bring good to the world. I can't say school ever gave me that feeling - I feel motivated and empowered.

Money: Shit, it feels so good to not have to scrounge for every penny. I actually have the money to pursue hobbies that I care about now. Need a new lens for my camera? Sure. Need some new tool for my wood workshop? Why the fuck not. Want a gym with a sauna and towel service? No sweat. Want to travel to Aruba with the S/O? Pack your bags babe!

Relationships: While I don't get to see my dudes and dudettes 24 hours a day like I used to, this honestly hasn't been a downside to me. If anything, the fact that we don't see each other 24 hours a day, makes our weekly hangout all the more fun. Plus, the fact that we are spread around a bit just means that I now have a network of people to crash with when I visit a new city!

Time: Wait, so I don't have to spend my whole night studying for Thermo? You mean I get to do things that I find fun and actually relax and recharge?  Like binge-watching all of GOT to get caught up? Or building that train model I wanted to do since I was 8? Or painting? Or woodworking?  Best of all, I get to invest time with the people I love. I get to see my parents more and take impromptu weekend trips to see my grandparents.

Independence: I literally can not go back to having a roommate. I don't know what it is ... but that feeling of being able to come home and strip the fuck down without a care in the world? Priceless. Oh and the fact that things are always in the exact location and way you left them.

&#x200B;

It honestly feels so good. I always go to sleep excited about what tomorrow will bring.

I know everyone has a different situation, and that I am quite lucky, but I sincerely hope some of y'all can relate to some of the positive things I'm experiencing.

Does anyone else feel this way? I'd love to hear about your post-college life!

&#x200B;

Cheers,"
113,"I've been a commercial voice actor for most of my adult life. It's great fun but often lonely sitting talking to yourself all day long in a padded room (and sometimes getting paid for it). 

I wanted more from life, so I chose to attend university as a mature student to study the Japanese language with hopes of being a bilingual actor. Unfortunately, right after the entrance exam I had a micro-stroke and forgot most of my first and second year knowledge meaning I couldn't spend the year overseas. This eventually caused me to become almost completely mute for several months due to acid reflux from the stress. I also had to switch to a degree with only three hours of class time a week and was bored out of my mind.

To make the most of things and the time I had, I decided that I would write the most comprehensive vocal exercise book (*[Speak and Be Heard: 101 Vocal Exercises for Voice Actors, Public Speakers and Professionals](https://www.amazon.com/Speak-Be-Heard-Exercises-Professionals-ebook/dp/B07XGS22NC)*) possible. I'm now hearing that it's helping people restore and build confidence in their voices and was even a #1 best seller on Amazon Australia for a couple of days. As of yesterday, it's also sold a copy in almost every country and I couldn't be happier.

If I hadn't had all that free time at uni, I would probably have never helped those readers. This isn't the plan that I had in mind nor am I at where I wanted to be, but it has given me other options for later life. *Plus, giving out a book works as one hell of a business card.*"
114,"My professors laughed at me yesterday for longing for a 9-5. All I want are some hours a day where work doesn‚Äôt follow you home, is this even possible now? I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be as miserable as I am in college for the rest of my life, smartphones have ruined everything"
115,"Maybe some of you job+gym goers out there can help. I‚Äôve been getting the same amount of sleep every night since starting my 9-5 Monday-Friday career a month and a half ago which is 6.5 to 7 hours a night but now that I‚Äôve been lifting and doing HIIT several days per week, that same amount of sleep doesn‚Äôt seem to be cutting it. Today and yesterday I almost fell asleep behind the wheel going to work. When I‚Äôm at work, my performance is suffering immensely.

Do I need more sleep than I used to now that I am regularly exercising?"
116,"I‚Äôm just happy that I survived the first week, and I‚Äôm loving my working environment so far. Although it‚Äôs not related to my degree, I‚Äôm still thankful because I‚Äôm learning something new everyday. It‚Äôs a job and not yet a career. This is only the beginning though, and I know that someday I‚Äôll be able to establish a good career for myself. I‚Äôm planning to further my education, but I‚Äôm still trying to decide until now if the path is law school or a masters that is related to my college degree.

Nevertheless, I‚Äôm not going to rush it. I now know that good things take time, and we all have our own pace. I‚Äôm just happy that I am now in the middle of something that I was only dreaming about a year ago. ‚ù§Ô∏è

117,"So I am graduating from university and my peers are very ambitious and want to go to grad school or enter the workforce and have prestigious careers.

I have been doing some reflecting on what I want out of life and I just can't see myself as a career women. In this day and age, both genders are expected to be put in this position of working for a career and I've felt this pressure from my family and friends. Mainly now my friends, I've talked to my mom and she's supportive of me either way (very lucky). 

I am fortunate enough to have a SO who loves having a career prospect and is very driven to work. He already has a great career lined up and I'm very proud of him. But for me, I just dread the day I have to work long hours... In the environmental industry it's very common to work 10-12 field days.

All I want is to have a hobby farm, raise animals, have some kids in the future and like have a side business. I have some creative skills and maybe I can do freelance environmental work in the future. Just none of my peers share these values. All they want to is live where the action is, work high profile jobs or continue in school. 

I literally just want to escape haha. Anyone else???"
118,"I got a B.A. in anthropology with honors, PBK, a bunch of conference presentations, etc. but my life feels at a standstill right now. I'm working a shitty job that only requires a high school diploma, and I feel judged for it. Meanwhile, my friends are working for the government or research groups or social services doing things I'd like to do. I'm afraid to talk about the details of my job because I don't want to be seen as one of those stereotypical liberal arts graduates who deserves to do nothing but work at Starbucks because I didn't graduate in something STEM. Now that COVID has fucked everything up, I feel increasingly helpless, like I'm never going to advance in life and I deserve that. 

I know I want to get a PhD in medical anthropology because I have a topic that's a passion of mine, and that and my partner are the only things that keep me going. But almost everyone in my life thinks I'm an idiot for even considering it even though I've generally done more research than they have. I just want people to accept and respect me the way they did when I was in college and achieving goals they actually valued."
119,"Of course we wish we still had all those breaks but I'm  talking about going from the next grade up. In school you knew one class would be this semester and then you'd  go to the next grade the following year. It gave you a sense of time and structure.

In the real world its complicated and doesn't quit work like the school system. I remember i stayed at the same job for 2 years without a promotion. Took me a while to realize hey ,nobody is gonna tell you what to do, you're  gonna stay like this unless you do something. Made me a little upset because i felt I wasted a lot of time. I was so used to the school schedule that i had no clue how to actually decide for myself."
120,"i miss when summer felt like summer, being done with college has made it feel like this span between June and august(well September) are just more months and meaningless.

121,"Do not forget to congratulate yourself. I technically graduated from college earlier this month. However, it did not feel complete. There was no graduation, no graduation party,and my invitations were not sent out on time. I am also stressed out about this pandemic and the economic consequences to follow. 
However, this morning I remembered that I accomplished something amazing. I am the first male to graduate in my family from college since my great uncle graduated in 1977. I worked hard and I earned this degree and even though I am scared I know no one can take that away from me. So if you are graduating this semester dont forget to give yourself a pat on the back. We earned it."
122,"I feel like most of the posts I read here discuss feeling lost after college and reminisce about how fun/easy college was.  But I feel like a minority in that it's the complete opposite for me.  College was fucking hard for me.  I felt like I was working my ass off non-stop between classes, homework, a part time job or two, and clubs.  Even going to parties and maintaining a social life took a lot of energy. 

That's not even mentioning the stresses outside of the school environment too, such as family issues and financial stress especially.  I can't count how many times I had to check my bank account before putting gas in my car.  I tried to be as frugal as possible by doing things such as living in a six-person house so the rent wouldn't be too expensive, cooking at home instead of eating out, etc. But in the end, working part time as a TA and as an intern at a government agency just didn't pay all that much.  

In the meanwhile, since graduating and starting work, it's as though so many weights have been lifted off my shoulder.  I have time to do the things I want - rock climbing, playing video games, cooking more complicated meals, and so on.  I can actually put time into my relationships with my family, friends, and dates.  My job is new and interesting every day, and most importantly it stops at 5 PM.  I can leave it at my desk and just come home and relax guilt free.  I don't have to check my bank account every time I want to do something.  For the first time ever, I can pay both my needs and wants, and even put money into an emergency fund, pay down student loan debt, and even invest for retirement.  Is everything perfect now?  Of course not, but I no longer feel like I'm constantly putting out fires in my life.

I apologize if this post comes off as a humble brag. But I feel like I'm going crazy reading this subreddit. Do others have similar experiences and changes in their lives pre-graduation and post-graduation?  I would love to hear your thoughts."
123,I‚Äôm just trying to not feel as alone with my current job
124,
125,"I just recently graduated in June and have just started by job search. I was in no rush since I am currently working at a job not in my field. However, I find myself literally crippled by fear when I think of applying for jobs in my field - fear of not getting a job in my field, the fear of losing my current job, the fear of not being good enough for another job, the fear of working at a job that I hate for the rest of my life; to list a few. I am overcome with anxiety every time I sit in front of my computer to apply for a position so I just procrastinate and then feel useless and trapped. Has anyone else been through this before and if so can give me some advice so I can overcome this?"
126,"Currently I‚Äôm just in the process of putting my stuff away and writing in my journal. I‚Äôve had this since senior year of high school so it‚Äôs actually amazing that my entire college experience is in this notebook. It‚Äôs just crazy to me how fast this went by. I wish I cherished it more. 

I‚Äôve had about 4 job interviews, now I just need to set up days and times to go to there for an in person interview. So as for work I‚Äôm just waiting around.

My only concern with this brand new chapter in my life is having to build a new routine. I‚Äôve been so used to school my whole life that now it just.. ended just like that. I‚Äôm not planning on going back to school for about 2-3 years, especially because these jobs (primarily research assistant at hospitals) require at least a two year commitment. I want to gain more experience first, lower my student loan balance enough that going back to school won‚Äôt kill me as much, and get used to adulthood. 

I used to love to read, and I actually just ordered a new book. I‚Äôm hoping to get back into that hobby, and I actually have a whole bunch of books from high school that I was looking to reread or finish. That‚Äôs pretty exciting (for me at least lol!)

Anyway, if any of you have any advice to offer for this new life I‚Äôm about to enter that would be great. I‚Äôm planning to stay home for quite some time as well so I can save up as much as I can for my own place. Congrats to all of us for getting our degrees!"
127,"I know a lot of you will think I‚Äôm a psychopath, but I feel this emptiness inside me because I have no outside work (homework) to do after I go home from my financial services job. In fact, it‚Äôs prohibited that we take anything home to work on. 

In college, I went to class all day and worked on homework all night. Now I just work all day and it doesn‚Äôt seem right! (I know that rhymed and its awesome reading back).

Does anyone else share these feelings? Or am I the only one who misses the sense of accomplishment by working on something school/work related all day long?"
128,"I posted here a few weeks ago basically saying how I was really nervous for life after undergrad, especially since I don‚Äôt really plan on going to grad school anytime soon. 

I had a conversation with one of my friends that I‚Äôve known since freshman year and still close to this day. He‚Äôs an RA in our freshman dorm that we love so much because of all the memories held in there. We talked for a veryyyy long time about our time here at undergrad, what we wished we had done differently, our plans for after graduation, etc.

It honestly had me rethinking about my fear of life after college. I don‚Äôt really have anything to be scared about anymore. As much as I‚Äôve really enjoyed and loved my entire college experience (except for junior year, it was horrendous) I‚Äôm clocked out lol. I‚Äôm taking 7 classes this semester while also being supervisor at my job on campus, I‚Äòm over college. It‚Äôs been fun and all, but my mind is ready to leave this chapter behind. I‚Äôm excited to see where my career could take me, especially since my professor knows I‚Äôm really interested in forensics and she‚Äôs told me of some opportunities that alumni had.

I get so happy and sad looking back at the past 3.5 years. Happy because I have grown and changed so much as a person, but sad because I remember moving on campus like it was literally yesterday. This has gone by way too fast, and it really did shake me to my core. But now, I‚Äôve learned to accept it.

129,"I did the whole comparison bs after school. I've come to realize no matter how much you do someone always does it better. They're smarter, taller, more attractive, more educated, make more money, travel more, etc. It's a game you'll never win no matter how hard you try. You have to be happy with yourself eventually and say you're enough or else you'll always be miserable. Even the people that are better than you don't always have it great, the grass is always greener. Also, they're just living their lives, what they do has nothing to do with you. 

So next time you see your friend go to Europe on instagram don't feel bad. That's what they're doing, it has nothing to do with you! There's millions of other people doing the exact same thing but for some reason we care about the people we know the most. It doesn't matter."
130,
131,"It's for a job that I am easily qualified for (1-2 years experience and I have 3 summers worth of relative internships), at a large company and industry that I like, whose office is literally within walking distance from my home. I've seen the posting up since I was a sophomore at college. I applied for it when I was a senior and got ignored, then a year later (a couple months ago) and got rejected. And I've noticed this with pretty much every job I've applied  for since graduation.

This is just me venting and not really asking for advice, but it's just really annoying and depressing constantly seeing the postings up for jobs that I want but keep getting rejected from. Yes I know I was probably pushing my luck a bit by applying for that job twice, yes I know I shouldn't get personally attached at every job I apply for, and yes I know that if the posting as been up for this long it's probably a crappy job with high turnover. That's not my point, I don't care that the job might seem perfect to me now but in reality it might be terrible. My point is that all I want is a chance.

""You miss every shot that you don't take"" but the way I look at it is ""You can't even take the shot unless they let you onto the court."" Yes I know and understand that the people doing the hiring don't always want to take chances on just anyone. But I also have to make student loan payments.

**EDIT:** I also posted this in the comments but unsure if it'll be seen or answered much. Didn't expect this to get so popular, thanks for the support!

For those that have been suggesting it, yes I have tried reaching out to both HR and a recruiter there. Never got a response. Only phone number I could find was a generic office number, which lead to a receptionist giving a very tired ""We'll reach out to you if we are interested"" answer. I even tried to visit the office in person, my parents own a flower shop so I went down there at the beginning of December to drop off a poinsettia plant along with my resume and cover letter. It was actually a secure building and I got lucky because an employee thought I was a delivery guy and held the door for me. The receptionist thought the plant was really sweet but then her expression and tone immediately changed when I handed her my resume and cover letter.

Some have mentioned that I should keep applying for the job any chance I get, so I wanted to ask about that. So, the company has its job portal website where people look at postings and apply. The first time I applied my application was forever ""under review"", and I would keep checking up on it to see if it ever updated. Until one day, my entire account on the job portal website was deleted, which I thought was kind of odd. I didn't think much of it so I made another account and applied again. This time though they actually reviewed and rejected me within a couple days of applying. They never sent me an email, I didn't find out until a week later when I checked up on it after dropping off the poinsettia plant. Since then, my application still shows up as ""reviewed rejected"", and it won't let me reapply for the same job. I'm guessing my only way around this would be to create a whole new account, but I'm not sure if that is advisable."
132,I have 2 friends who both want to be veterinarians. They go to the same school which costs a total of roughly 36000 a year before any awards. When I asked about veterinarian pay they both told it‚Äôs not good. So when asked about student debt they both were willing to live in debt for their foreseeable future. How can they think this okay. Is it normal for Vets to be in debt forever

I haven‚Äôt told the one friend I have about everything I‚Äôve experienced because some of the abusive things my mother has said to me are downright humiliating. Example: She‚Äôs shat on me both to my face and behind my back about not having a job, and has told me I have no right to buy wine (with my own money) when I don‚Äôt have a job. I barely drink btw. 

I used to be pre med, but to be honest in. November of last year I lost all motivation to study for my MCAT retake. And I don‚Äôt even have the same passion for medicine or the human body that I used to. But the problem is that I don‚Äôt have a passion for anything else either. I am good at a lot of things but nothing excites me. I barely have the energy to get out of bed most days, as cliche as that may sound. 

This is extra scary for me because of the debt. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna pay that off I don‚Äôt get into a high paying profession. Before the plan was to be a doctor. But now? I don‚Äôt know. 

My mother keeps asking me what I want to do with my future. And I hate it. First of all I don‚Äôt want to discuss anything like that with her after how she‚Äôs treated me. But more importantly, I‚Äôm too scared to tell her I don‚Äôt know. She‚Äôll start yelling at me. And I can‚Äôt take that anymore. It‚Äôs also way too much pressure for me. I keep racking my brain about it every day, and coming up blank. 

I‚Äôm not even sure what my point is in writing this. I just could use some emotional support."
135,"I (22M) just finished undergrad at a top 10 school. I did everything ""right"".

Solid GPA with two business-oriented majors. I did internships and networked and was in business student groups, all the things I thought would set me up for success. In October after grinding out tons of applications, I got a non-technical role at a household name tech company. Salary and benefits and perks, I thought all the years of hard work and mental exhaustion had paid off. I didn't care about getting rich, but I thought ""Great, at least I won't have to count every last penny"".

Not anymore. I'm left with 6 weeks of severance pay (appreciated as I need it) and a long look into the abyss. 

I was claimed as a dependant last year so I didn't get stimulus money, nor do I expect to get future stimulus money. I don't qualify for unemployment insurance and my usual escapist fantasy of being a bartender isn't even viable now because everything is closed. 

It's possible to make no mistakes and still lose. That's life. I get it. But what do I do now? Fortunately my parents are willing and able to house me during these extenuating circumstances, and I'm debt free. Put into perspective, most Americans would still kill to be where I am and I'm humbled by that fact. I don't deserve any of these advantages, I was given them by luck. But losing my job is a massive blow to my mental health and sense of independence, both of which were already shaky to begin with.

I've been living with my family for the past 6 weeks and it's been draining. I looked forward to returning to my college housing to start work (remotely) next month. Now I might be truly stuck at home.

What do I do now?"
136,"My office is just a group of people who all refuse to do their job and instead spend their time complaining about what they would change but never 
taking the initiative to do anything. Nobody I encounter seems to take any fulfillment in their job, and I find it so depressing to be surrounded by people that sit in front of a computer 8 hours a day/5 days a week just to look forward to sitting on their ass all weekend. How are your office lives? 

TLDR are all offices just groups of unhappy people there for a paycheck?"
137,"My lease ends in 2 months, and I won‚Äôt have enough money to move anywhere else. I have applied to over 150 jobs in my area. I have hunted people down on LinkedIn (and I have a fucking premium account). I have visited places IN PERSON to deliver my fucking resume to someone. I have met people for ‚Äúinformational interviews‚Äù to learn more about the industry that I can‚Äôt fucking get into. I have emailed my professors asking for guidance and they don‚Äôt give a shit. Everyone keeps saying ‚Äúit will happen eventually‚Äù but that‚Äôs not good enough. I tried waiting tables for a while and the restaurant closed 3 weeks later hahaaha FML. College was a waste of time, no one cares. No one will give me a chance. I‚Äôm about to take a job in fucking sales. Can‚Äôt wait to hate my existence for the next 50 years.

edit: y‚Äôall are so supportive. i just needed to rant at 2 am when the world was crashing down around me. the advice i have been hearing for 6 months is pretty annoying to read but i respect the time you all put into your replies. maybe one day I‚Äôll be able to post ‚Äúi got the job‚Äù. until then, depression. and cats."
138," 

Unless you found your dream job I'd say most 25-35 year olds are just getting by moving from job to job trying to find themselves. I wish somebody told me that once I graduated . That it's ok not to know what you are doing at 28. I really thought something was wrong with me until I met others who felt the same exact way!

It was always you needed to have your life in order by a certain time, have this amount of money, get married, have kids, and buy a house. I realize how much bs it is now. There is no deadline for success and everyone is going at their own pace! It doesn't matter when you graduate, find your passion, have kids, or get married. Screw society man, all the shit I've been fed since I was a kid is one big lie! Nobody has it figured out. People are just living!"
139,"I know this is broad but it seems like it's the trendy thing to do if you're a single college grad. Sometimes I get envious of my friends living in LA, SF, NY, etc. and how they must be living the life but I also don't know how most people can afford living in the city without being broke. My feeling is that a lot of people stay there for a few years, experience the city, get it out of their system, and then move out to a more affordable area to start a family."
140,"It's been 1.5 years since I graduated, a lot of my dreams have either one person or the whole class. I'm too afraid to ask my peers. It's haunting me and makes me anxious at times, it happens so often I can't catch a break"
141,"I'm in my late 20s, and a lot of my friends are in that age group. In our group text, someone texted a funny but sad tweet about college debt, undergrad degrees, and working shit jobs.




Everyone laughed, and replied something like ""fuck, why did I even got to school again?"" and ""too relatable.""





I definitely agree with my friends. I was not knowledgeable enough to evaluate the job market when I was applying to college, graduated with a degree that was kind of worthless, worked a crappy job, and eventually went back for my MS in something in demand and got a good job.





For me, it's crazy to think that my biggest mistake in life can be traced to events just over ten years ago. I also recognize how fortunate I am to be in my position, as many of my friends could not get out of working dead end jobs."
142,In school at least you knew you were going from one class to the next and after the year ended you would go to the next grade. School starts in August and you'd be out by May/June. I thought that was really helpful because at least you knew what kind of time frame you're on. In the real world you can go wherever TF you want and nobody is gonna tell you either. You can be stuck doing the same job  and not realize you're going nowhere till the years pass by . I guess the corporate ladder gives you an idea of where you can go but not everyone wants to do that. I feel if there was a clearer path  at work we'd all be a little less uncertain about the direction we are headed.
143,"I used to know everyone on campus and be involved in almost six organizations. Everyone was my friend, and I could make a new friend anywhere I went on campus.

Now that I‚Äôm married, have a full-time job, and moved out of my hometown, my college friends don‚Äôt contact me unless I do it first. Some of them are part-time workers, some of them are still in college, and some of them are full-time workers. Most of them are single.

I also feel like I have less and less friends. Most of the time, my friends are too busy to hang out or they hang out with other people. I just feel lost because I can‚Äôt make friends as easily or have that social environment.  I know everyone goes different paths and are busy, but it‚Äôd be nice if I wasn‚Äôt the one who always reached out to others.

Making friends in the workplace/as an adult is so different. I just feel lonely and want to find others to connect with. After college, it has been hard to adjust to this new, less social life. :( anyone else feel this way?"
144,"Granted with this pandemic, circumstances are different; *A lot different,* but as soon as I left was when COVID hit and things changed drastically for me. I've learned a lot and wish I had done some things differently. Here's what I've gathered from this past year:

&#x200B;

1. Networking is so critical; they weren't lying when they said this. You could quite literally end up meeting with the Dean of a top university, getting top tier advice from someone who's in the field you're interested in, help someone grow their network/business, make a new life long friend, etc. There's a whole variety of opportunities you can gain just from knowing someone because they happen to know someone who also happens to know someone. I know it's pretty difficult not knowing where to even start, so honestly they were also right when they said you need a LinkedIn account. People will literally reach out to YOU! Most of the time it's bs, but other times it's something you can use to your advantage. For example, I helped out one of my friends from undergrad get a job working in a lab because someone from LinkedIn reached out to me for job opportunities. I already had a job when they contacted me, but I knew that my other friends could definitely benefit from this. You can also research some companies you're interested in and reach out to them. Trust me on this. Build your profile immediately.
2. Mental health, oh you SOB. That's another critical thing because it can be the one to make you or break you. I imagine we all learned this the hard way during this pandemic, I surely did. We are all in different situations so I totally understand that this piece of advice doesn't apply to or work for everyone. If you are in an environment where your are quite literally mentally suffering, please find a way to escape and make things better for yourself. Whether it's at home, work or school, prioritize yourself. Find someone to stay with, search on indeed every single hour of the day, transfer schools if you need to. There's nothing worse than being in a place where you know you are not thriving and you can't do anything about it because you don't have the means to do so. There's *always* a way! It's out there somewhere. Again, I know this doesn't apply to everyone so take this piece of advice with a grain of salt
3. If you plan on living on your own, I 100% promise you cooking your own food is a hell of a lot cheaper than ordering takeout. That $100 you spend on groceries lasts way longer than the $100 you spend in 1-2 weeks ordering out. Also keeping in mind that the money you spend ordering food could've been used to get those paper towels that you ran out of. There's always something that needs to be bought and your money is better spent there. I'm not saying you can't order takeout; sometimes I am too lazy to cook so I just want some chinese that will last a few days. But ordering it *all the time* will not only kill your bank account but also your arteries later down the line which brings me to my next point
4. Eating well and exercising is a lot more important than you think. You don't need a gym membership or to go on some diet (unless you have a goal); you can totally do workouts in the comfort of your own home and eat tasty food that is still healthy. My hips have been killing me lately and it's mostly because I lay in my bed all day whenever I'm not at work, so now I need to go to a doctor to make sure everythings okay. Which again brings me to my next point
5. If you can, stay on your parents insurance until you're 26 (if you're in the US). I have health insurance through my job so I took it, and now I'm having to pay for co-pays, medications, and I have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for getting a strep test at an urgent care. I didn't have to pay a single penny for anything in the past. It sucks.
6. Save. your. money. Something will inevitably happen and you'll have to pay out of pocket. Don't ever think it won't happen to you; always have an emergency fund.
7. The people that you once thought would be in your life forever actually won't, and that's totally normal. It doesn't mean you're a bad person,  things don't always go our way and that's just life.
8. Life goes on and you have to go with it. You could be at the absolute worst point in your life, and you still have to get up and go to work because bills have to get paid. It's really tough out here, especially with people losing their loved ones to this virus. My condolences to all of you that have had to go through this.
9. If you want something, you HAVE to work for it. If you sit around waiting for things to happen, you will be severely disappointed. I learned this the hard way
10. This is probably a bit obvious, but seriously do cherish every moment with your loved ones. You never know what could happen
11. If you're planning on working directly after finishing undergrad, start applying to jobs around March. Trust me on this, the earlier the better. You're honestly going to apply to about 70+ jobs and only hear back from about 5, get interviewed at 2 and pray you get one. So after you finish reading this, fix up your resume. I got my advice from this subreddit and some Google searches so start there! Also, as much as we all hate writing them, a cover letter is **really important**. Some jobs (mine included) might ask you to write one anyway. They're so tedious but really boost your chances of getting a call back
12. Try to spend less time on your phone. Watch ""The Social Dilemma"" on Netflix. I don't know about Androids, but my iPhone notifies me of my daily/weekly average screen time. I was averaging 7-9 hours PER DAY; that's a whole work week I spent on my phone. So now I have time limits set on my social media apps and I have the majority of my other apps disabled at night so I'm not being on my phone just because I'm bored or can't sleep. It's really hard at first, but now I am averaging 5 hours a day on my phone which is a significant improvement for me. I try to read more books and listen to podcasts in place of social media, it's been helpful!
13. Please, for the love of everything out there, TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH.
14. Your skincare routine doesn't need to be 12 steps. Your skin will honestly do so much better with fewer products.
15. Get proper sleep; 7-8 hours per night. If you're having serious trouble sleeping, try drinking some tea that is meant to help you sleep, meditate, do something that requires enough energy to tire you out. I personally don't like taking melatonin; it gives me very strange dreams and I hate becoming dependent on them because then if I don't take it I won't sleep.
16. Unapologetically be yourself and do whatever the fuck you want no matter what other people say. It's not their life it's YOURS and you 100% have the right to do as you please even if it makes others upset.
17. Those of us who grew up with foreign parents need therapy. We're all messed up.
18. Never thought I would say this but your posture is really important. I hunch my back SO MUCH now it's like a muscle memory. I then have the nerve to ask myself why my back hurts so badly.
19. Listen to your body. Know your limits. If you ever end up having to go to the ER and they don't take you seriously, raise hell. If you're trying to pull an all-nighter studying for that final, just go to sleep. You honestly will not retain that information you're trying to study while your brain is telling you to go to sleep.
20. Don't dwell or look back so much on the past. I'm still trying to work on this myself. Look forward and plan ahead, don't try and chase past feelings or who you were before; they were left behind you for a reason. I'm not saying you can't look back at old memories or pictures and be nostalgic, I still do this. However, there is a difference between reminiscing on the good ol' days versus dwelling on a certain decision that you made that really ruined everything. It happened, it's done, it's over. You gotta move on and do better for yourself!
21. Be considerate of other peoples feelings and situations. Just because you didn't personally go through it or understand it doesn't mean you get to invalidate them. You're not a God.
22. Get a journal. I've kept journals since high school and it's really nice and nostalgic reading them from time to time. It reminds me that I have grown into a better version of myself, and also I can still replay certain memories in my head. 
23. Lastly, this pandemic made me realize a lot of the nasty stuff we used to do. Stand so close to each other, go bowling, go to the mall where we touched an endless amount of clothes and shoes and then had the nerve to go eat at the food court with those same hands without washing or sanitizing, a lot of people didn't know how to wash their hands properly, restaurants never properly disinfected their spaces. Life is surely not going to be the same after this."

I spend so much time worrying about getting my life together and it gets me nowhere. I spend so much time worrying about it and it's just bad for my mind. I need to find that inner child again who ran so blissfully free at the park. Anytime I see kids I remind myself hey you used to be like that. What happened? Why don't I have that much fun anymore?"
146,"How do adults deal with life kicking the shit out of them and move on?
I graduated high school in May 2018. I did theatre all four years and couldn‚Äôt have a job because I was very involved. As soon as I graduated, I started working at subway. It wasn‚Äôt a bad first job, it was easy and I learned quickly what I was supposed to do. I was very unhappy there though because I would ask for more hours and they would give them to me for the coming week but they would drop down soon after. Six months later, I quit. The only way I was able to get enough money to pay for my car and food and gas was to be ‚Äúon call.‚Äù Meaning I had to be ready to go into a job I hated at any time. I was super good at my job and was acting as a shift lead/ night manager without the actual promotion or raise. I found another job and that‚Äôs why I was able to quit. I worked at this job for four months. I should have been promoted to manager, they were training me for it. I learn very quickly and do an efficient and effective job. Because of drama with the gm acting like a high school girl, I got fired. Their reasoning? I‚Äôm too intimidating. Me, 5‚Äô1 with a generalized anxiety disorder and clinical depression. It was a lie. My coworkers told them they weren‚Äôt intimidated by me but the manager told me they were and she said people called out to not work with me which, of course, was also untrue. I was out of a job for two months when a job at petco fell in my lap. I love animals and hate the food industry so this was a dream come true. Flash forward a month. I‚Äôve been hired, haven‚Äôt been scheduled at all, and the two managers have confirmed with me multiple times that I was in fact hired. The only communication with me and the managers have been purely because I called the store. Neither answered the numbers they gave me, call or text. I just called in and quit because I‚Äôm down to $91 and I don‚Äôt have time to be waiting for them to get their shit together. I have a car payment, I pay for my food despite living at home because I‚Äôm vegetarian and my family won‚Äôt pay for alternative meals for me. This is understandable because my whole family loves meat but I‚Äôm very broke and last night had a dinner only consisting of fried rice. I also have to pay for my meds and many other things. 
Since leaving high school I‚Äôve also had many family issues, a horrible breakup, all the work bullshit, and have been dealing with my meds being altered. 
TLDR
I have to find another job now and I‚Äôm just feeling very hopeless. 
Does anyone know how to find a job quickly, how to be better with money, literally any advice."
147,"I don't know what it is, but there seems to be a lot of negativity in this subreddit. Maybe it's just today. I want to ask you: what has gone well for you after school?

I'll start. I graduated uni 2 weeks ago and I had the best week I've had in a while. It was full of travelling and good food. I finally started up my YouTube channel after putting it off for a year. Now, I'm back home in Mongolia, writing this post at 5 am and feeling extremely grateful for my experience in school, both the good and the bad aspects of it."
148,"I am 22 and a senior in college and I did not want kids and I do not think I am going to want kids in the future. However, all my other friends are already planning their pregnancies or getting pregnant. One friend even asked me to be her sperm donor and of course I said no. However, every time I say no people just look at me like I am weird for not wanting kids. Has anyone else had that reaction?"
149,"I graduated high school in 2018 and I have been working full time since then. I am extremely disappointed about this whole ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù process. Sure I could have gone to college and spent my days binge drinking but thats just delaying myself actually growing up, also I don‚Äôt want to be in debt so early in life. I miss the social aspect of high school which is funny because I absolutely dreaded school. Now I miss having hundreds of people my age to talk to and relate to. Everyone went their separate ways even my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I really don‚Äôt want to work a miserable job for 45 years, 5 days a week until I‚Äôm old and frail. I haven‚Äôt found my ‚Äúpassion‚Äù only thing I enjoy is traveling and skiing which that as a job simple isn‚Äôt feasible. I just feel stuck and disappointed and it‚Äôs frustrating. I‚Äôm starting to get a nihilistic pint of view which I know won‚Äôt be good."
150,"Just graduated this Spring and started full-time at my company. It took me six years to graduate university with a degree in engineering while going to a commuter school while living at home and working so I never had that traditional college experience but I still really enjoyed myself. I enjoyed the complete independence that I had. I enjoyed staying up late working on assignments with friends or just people watching in between classes. I enjoyed the never-ending possibilities of where I would end up and who I would meet along the way... Now I have to be at work from 8-5 even when I don't have anything to do. I am not particularly close with my colleagues and the conversation has become so repetitive. I feel like all the joy and wonderment of the world has left. I haven't seen my engg friends since school ended; most them moved away anyway. I feel like I have no time anymore too. After work, I am so tired I just crash: Nap, eat, watch tv, and get ready for the next day. 

I feel like the world has completely ended and I just want to go back to when I was 18 and do it all over again. :("
151,"Of course this might vary from country to country and I do live in Asia, but I was wondering if other people have also experienced this. 


In college, it seemed to me that all I needed to do was to be myself. I played squash and played keyboards in a band. I was a decent student too (though not the best). I was (and am) decent looking, and I take care of myself physically although I am on the skinnier side. 

It seemed to be enough. I was happy, and I was quite popular too, surprising given how crap high school was for me. I had a couple of good relationships as well, and all seemed well. 

Now, it seems to me that none of what I mentioned matters anymore. Instead, 'prestige' at the workplace, how much money one earns, one's job seems to matter more than anything as far as dating is concerned. Heck, even non romantic connections are nicer to you when you tick all the right boxes

Oh, and god forbid if you're taking some time off or are not sure what you want to do in the future. The very same people who used to be close friends now seem more concerned about the organization I work for. 

Nearly all my female friends are dating older guys at their workplaces. Both my exes too, btw. Not that this should matter but a couple of them have made some rather condescending remarks about my job and how their BFs are doing so great and maybe I should talk to them for advice - like no, I am happy where I am, why should I move to another firm/industry? 

The guys in the other hand are more direct and keep on asking me stupid stuff like ""when are you going to move to a better place"", etc. even while knowing that I'm happy where I am. 

I'd be happy if these people were genuinely concerned about my well being, but it's the condescension that annoys me. So what if I don't make as much as other people? So what if I'm figuring things out? Why should that be the focus of everything? Why the f is everyone so judgemental? 

Moteover, if anything I'm actually a 'better' person now. I was a bit of an ass earlier, but my second breakup in particular opened my eyes and I realised how I was not that great a person at that time. Now, after having introspected and improved myself (although that's always continuing) seems like I shouldn't have bothered in the first place.

I don't know tbh, maybe I'm the one who hasn't grown up and I'm getting this all wrong.

PS: I do have a few really great friends who don't judge me, thankfully - I am very grateful for them, really."
152,"My first job was a disaster, working at what was listed in many news articles as one of the worst companies to work for for several years running. One of the most atrocious Glassdoor ratings. I thought it was a joke until I worked there for about a year and it was just terrible. Now working a much ""better"" company and while it is much better, the working hours are terrible. We are expected to work two or three hours of overtime every day, never allowed to work from home compared to my previous job, and this weekend, we are expected to work 12 hours on Saturday and Sunday. it feels like we are constantly expected to cram more than 8 hours of work into an eight-hour workday as well


the culture of my team is we are always to skip lunch, but we are not paid for lunch. Isn't that ridiculous? My entire row at work Skip's lunch every single day and works through lunch. But officially the department policy is that we are not paid for lunch, so we must take a lunch. Working through lunch does not allow us to leave one hour earlier. So in other words, we are loaded with so much work to do that we are inevitably going to eat lunch at our desks and skip lunch everyday, but never get paid for that extra effort, and penalized if we leave an hour early for working through lunch"
153,"Random thought here. I was in college for 6 yers and it truly felt like 6 long years (never once did I think, damn, 4-6 years went by quick). But now, it‚Äôs somehow already been 10 months since officially starting and damn, it flew by tbh. Idk what it is, maybe it‚Äôs the routine of doing the same things every week?
Does anyone else feel the same way? I‚Äôve been trying to travel to get out of my state but even then time is just moving quick."
154,"I see so many young people hating on themselves feeling like they aren't good enough. If you're 30 and still finishing college what's wrong with that? Nobody in their 20's-30's has it all together unless you're famous lol. The one's who do are faking it with appearances.

 It's really just the beginning of your journey but people put deadlines on when something should be accomplished. You should only feel pressure if you're pro athlete or considering children. There's an expiration date on that but if you suddenly want to become a doctor at 35 nothing is stopping you except your beliefs on when it should've been accomplished."
155,"as the title states, are students emails always a thing or do they ‚Äúexpire‚Äù after you graduate?
lowkey trying to see how long i can keep using these student discounts lol"
156,"I don't know if I've gotten over it.  I'll never have that many friends and time to spend together ever again. I'll never have summer, winter, and spring break. I miss wearing clothes I actually wanted to wear. I miss having my parents as a safety net. I miss having teachers I could look up to.  Basically I miss the whole structure and community school provided.

Sure I'm making money and I can do more things than I did when I was in school but I look back and think what have I become? This whole adulting and living in the real world is taking a toll on me, it's so lonely. Nobody gaf about you as an adult, everything is on you now.  I just want to go back when times were simpler and all I cared about was trying to get girls to like me lol."
157,"Anyone in a completely different field,  related field, or doing anything at all that‚Äôs not their degree and enjoying it? With my civil engineering degree I just feel so much self imposed and social pressure to use it since I worked so hard to get it. But now that I‚Äôm in the field I‚Äôm really not liking it. I‚Äôve looked into a bunch of different areas and I think I would enjoy them better.  The jobs I‚Äôm looking at aren‚Äôt completely  unrelated (still science based that requires a degree)  just not exactly engineering. I‚Äôm just timid to make the change

I know that sounds ridiculous, as it‚Äôs way better than college where I was usually doing homework; but when the week is over I‚Äôm usually exhausted and don‚Äôt do anything at all over the weekend. 

For the last few weekends I‚Äôve been procrastinating on stuff I really want to do but don‚Äôt actually do when it comes time to do it. Like going and looking for furniture, going to the gym, chores, etc. I kind of feel like I‚Äôm wasting my free time and was wondering if anyone had any advice."
160,"I started my first full time job out of college one month ago and I‚Äôm already feeling burned out. I‚Äôm getting paid a dollar less than what I was promised (which isn‚Äôt a lot anyway), no offers of health insurance even though they told me I would get it when I was interviewed, I feel I can‚Äôt take lunches because I feel like there‚Äôs too much work to be done, and I‚Äôm not really having luck making friends with my coworkers. The work itself is okay but I‚Äôm dealing with a lot of small town politics which is stressful for me. I don‚Äôt get vacation time for one year. I often have to work extra hours and last weekend I worked both days. I feel like I need a vacation since I never took one after I graduated college in May 2018. I don‚Äôt even know what the solution to this is. Get another job? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll just be more of the same. On top of everything I‚Äôm also doing some freelance work outside of work because I want to freelance write full time. Help.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your encouragement. I‚Äôm definitely going to start looking for other opportunities"
161,"Am I the only one here after college who has literally zero friends? I graduated back in May of 2020, so the pandemic made it worse. I have no one texting me, and I don‚Äôt go anywhere on the weekends. I just stay inside of my house, 7 days a week, looking at reddit and watching Youtube videos.

I tried joining different groups/clubs/and organizations during my time in college, but I could never find other people similar to me. 

The past couple months have been really tough on me, just living my lonely life, with no one around me. 
How do I make friends after college during a pandemic?"
162,"I graduated from college nine months ago with a major in English, minor in Spanish, and a Certificate in Paralegal Studies. I did a legal internship shortly after my graduation and had been looking for jobs in the meantime. After my internship ended, I struggled to find any meaningful work for months. Then, I got a temporary job at a bookstore. Then, the same law office that I interned at called me back and said that they wanted me to come back and actually work for them. I have been working there for the past few weeks and I love it. I went from being chronically depressed and anxious and sometimes suicidal to actually enjoying life again."
163,"A couple of weeks ago I interviewed for a position. I received an email that they wanted to continue the process with references, which is a good sign as it‚Äôs the next step in the potential hiring process so to speak. Someone from HR told me they would call me sometime between 10:30-11:30 this morning. No big deal. I set aside that hour plus some extra time just in case. 

It‚Äôs 1 pm, and they still haven‚Äôt called. They emailed me at 11:30 to ask if I‚Äôd be available if they called me, I replied I was (the reply was right after I got the email). I‚Äôve been waiting by my phone for 2.5 hours now. I work independently at the moment, and have appointments I need to get to soon. 

Why is this a thing?? I emailed them again as a follow up with no response. If I was this late to anything for them, they would refuse to hire me in a heartbeat. I know I‚Äôm probably not their priority, but it feels like such a blatant disrespect for me and my time. Even if today was a bad day, would it be too much for them to just let me know? Is this common? Idk I‚Äôm just frustrated. This is a rant/ sort of question as to whether or not this is typical.

EDIT/UPDATE: About 5 hours later, finally got a call. Luckily it was good news, they offered me a job! Turns out they had people in the office doing technology upkeep or something. So computers/phones/ internet were randomly unplugged or shut off here and there. Which is why she didn‚Äôt get some of my emails and the schedule was off. I‚Äôm trying not to judge that this is how the company usually is, as this is one of the bigger hospitals in the country so how HR operates may not be representative of the group I‚Äôm working in (in a research lab)."
164,"I'm 23 years old. 

For my entire upbringing I had really bad Social Anxiety. It greatly impacted my social life and activity level. I would always get very nervous and uncomfortable in social situations and around other people. Because of this I had a hard time building friendships and socializing.

As a child I never wanted to play with other kids in the neighborhood because I was too afraid to do so. When I was in school, I never hung out with anyone outside of school. I just went to school and came home everyday. I didn't have a social life, I had no friends outside of school, I didn't work, I participated in no activities, etc.

I went to college fresh out of high school. I spent 3 years there. I didn't finish. I was studying Biology. I struggled in my classes. I ended up losing my scholarships because I couldn't maintain the GPA requirement to keep them.

When I was in college, I did not have the ""college experience"". I spent most of my time in my dorm. I did not really socialize with anyone or make any friends. My mental health still wasn't in the right place. I was still struggling with Social Anxiety.

I left University and rounded up an Associate's degree from my local community college. I began working in a cafe. I've been working here now for almost 2 years. It's my first job. I put off working for a while because of Social Anxiety. I'm currently making $16.00 an hour and I work full-time. I have $5,000 saved up in my savings account and $2,371 in my checking account.

I've went to go speak to a therapist to work on my Social Anxiety and other issues I was dealing with. I started attending private driving lessons through a driving school and got my license at the age of 22. I also had anxiety about driving which is why I got my license late.

My job has given me good exposure to people and socializing. I feel a little more comfortable around people now than I did in the past. I also have to just give credit to growing, maturing, learning, and developing coping strategies. I feel like I've come a long way and I'm still making improvements. I'm still trying to work on building friendships and having a social life outside of work.

However, I look back at my past and I have so many regrets. I missed out on having a fun childhood. I missed out on having a fun high school experience. I missed out on having the ""college experience"". Those years are supposed to be the golden years of your life. I'll never get that time back. I'm getting older. I'll be 24 in a few months. 

Social Anxiety robbed me of all of this. I decided at around 21-22 that I'm not going to allow this condition to affect my life any longer, which motivated me to start making changes.

I just wish I would've started making changes sooner in my life.

Sorry for the long post but I felt like I needed to vent."

166,"I graduated over six years ago and I am virtually unemployable. Not even McDonalds or Target will touch me with my patchy resume.

The reason being I have often found it hard to motivate myself to work when I can‚Äôt do anything with my degree and will end up stocking shelves or delivering pizza. Now I‚Äôm at the point where not even those employers will take me, and I‚Äôll have to turn to sex work if I want to survive on my own. I have worked many Mcjobs but have rarely ever stuck with one job for very long.

I‚Äôm not looking for advice just asking if any other liberal arts grad (who majored in a humanities subject) ended up totally lost and a failure after obtaining their worthless degree."
167,"I graduated with a BFA in Emerging Media - a fancy way of saying I learned the dev pipeline for animation and 3D modeling for digital media like games, movies, etc. 

Being in FL, there‚Äôs not much in terms of local employment except EA Tiburon, Universal, or Disney. Even if you wanted to be a part if those powerhouses, you‚Äôd eventually have to relocate to somewhere like CA, NY, WA, TX, etc. 

I want to prepare myself for the sort of things to expect when it comes to moving out of FL to relocate for work, but don‚Äôt know where to start. Obviously the cost of living is higher everywhere else in the USA. But I‚Äôm also not opposed to moving out of the USA for work either.

Anyone have some sage advice? Anything is appreciated! :‚ÄôD"
168,"Back then, I‚Äôd get panic attacks. I had low self-esteem and was with a group of friends who belittled me.

I even had people manipulate and lie to me.

I took a gap year after high school graduation. Thought that I would never get past high school and its wonderful and worst moments. Thought I wouldn‚Äôt change.

My best friend from high school doesn‚Äôt seem to contact me anymore. I always have to contact him. I stopped. Life goes on, with or without him.

I am in the second year of college now. I met a psychiatrist 3 months ago, and it‚Äôs been the best thing ever. The meds have lessened my anxiety and panic attacks.

My confidence has increased and my stresses have decreased. I am even learning another language well.

I have a small circle of friends and acquaintances, and all of them are nice.

To everyone not knowing what to do after school, it usually gets better."
169,"I'm very embarrassed, unhappy, insecure, unsure about my life currently and the last thing i want to do is tell my friends about it. I don't really want to know how others are doing while I'm struggling. Maybe it's comparison but i think everyone feels sort of the same. Its a weird phase  and i feel everyone wants to focus on themselves right now."
170,"Just over a year ago, I dropped out of law school. I was insanely depressed, completely dependent on amphetamines, and hated the pretentiousness of my classmates. Between the cliques, gossip, and being stuck with the same people all day, it honestly felt like I had regressed back to high school. On top of that, the amount of debt I was accumulating (even with a scholarship) was staggering, and all I kept reading and hearing was how the ""golden days"" of law were over and the job market was absolutely brutal. My best friend, a recent graduate, confirmed all this and said he hated his life.

The problem for me is that I had wanted to be an attorney my entire life. Ever since I was young, I was the one in the family who was going to be a lawyer. I was smart, outspoken, a great writer and public speaker. In college I did every legal-related extracurricular you could imagine. So to not even finish a year, get hooked on amphetamines, and drop out...let's just say it completely broke me as a person.

After I dropped out, I took a consultant position with a lobbying firm and did extremely well...but was still dependent on amphetamines. Finally, my depression got so bad I lied down in my bean bag chair one day and refused to get up for nearly a week except to go to the bathroom. My mom would bring me food and water and check up on me throughout the day.

I told my parents I needed to get off all my medications, namely the amphetamines and benzos, and checked myself into rehab immediately. I texted my boss there was an emergency and I needed to take a sabbatical. Long story short, being surrounded by junkies and gang members (I was rooming with some Latin gangbanger) scared the shit out of me and I left after a week, promising to go to NA.

I kept my promise and stayed clean, and regularly attended NA and an outpatient treatment program. I met my girlfriend during this time, and I'm in the happiest relationship of my life and can't imagine life without her. I remind myself I wouldn't have met her if I hadn't dropped out.

I never got my consultant job back. Even though he approved the sabbatical, my boss was salty and ghosted my request to return to my job. I found another job for a small software company as an analyst and absolutely hated it - my boss and I agreed it wasn't a good match so we parted ways.

The Corona pandemic was in full swing by this point and I couldn't find a decent job. Finally, my father convinced me to come work at the family business. I always told myself I was too good to accept a handout of a job from my dad, that I would find my own way through the world, but I was really low and didn't see another choice. 

So, nearly a year after dropping out of law school, I found myself working in an auto garage. We do complete automotive reconstruction so I've learned vehicle assembly, how to fix sheet metal, welding, how to read automotive diagrams, how to unload tractor trailers, drive a forklift, etc.

At times I feel ""too good"" to be doing what I'm doing, and at other times I absolutely love the physical labor and how it gets me out of my own head. At the end of the day, I feel a certain satisfaction that I've accomplished something.

I saw a new specialist and was diagnosed with Bipolar (I was previously told I was ADHD) and since I started my new meds I haven't had a single depressive episode or panic attack - a massive victory for me.

I go to the gym at least four days a week now, eat healthy, and spend more time with my loved ones. I've also started a couple of hobbies (brewing kombucha and plants).

I think I'm still very much in an identity crisis, and don't really know what this life has in store for me, but I just wanted to share my journey, especially for those of you who are in a dark place right now.

I want you to know that a year ago I felt so awful every day I was 100% POSITIVE I would end up killing myself. And here I am today feeling good, taking care of myself, and maintaining a healthy, loving relationship with an amazing woman.

HANG IN THERE!"

There‚Äôs just not enough money for me to visit them as often as I would like. The hobbies I had, rock climbing, gym, hiking, have all gone to hell because nothing is here to do that with. $70 for a gym? Nah fam. I‚Äôm just. Ugh. I‚Äôve never been so lonely in all my life.

176,"Hey guys. I'm 22 years old in my final year of college. How do you deal with the crippling depression that comes with knowing you majored in a field that you don't actually have a passion for?

I majored in Business with an emphasis in Finance. While I do have a mild interest in finance I don't actually feel like I'm very good at it. I'm in my final year of college and found out that I have ADHD which kind of secures the deal that finance may not be for me. It's sad because I still am interested in Finance but I just don't feel like going to college has fed that interest.

I don't have any debt so that's nice but I just don't see how I'm possibly going to find a job after college. I've commuted to school so I've made very few friends. I've failed at securing an internship. I hate all of my classes. I just feel like I didn't get what I wanted out of college because everyone promised it would be the best years of my life when in reality it's been the absolute worst period of my life.

So what's next? Any advice or pointers someone could give me on how to find a decent paying job after college that isn't going to make me hate my life? Or even just general advice on what to prepare myself for?"

I‚Äôm 22 and a senior in college rn so my college status and soon to-be exit from undergrad is definitely an important factor, but I was just curious what other people thought and what their experience has been. I‚Äôve only ever had a checking account and a savings account, and I think I‚Äôm sort of grateful because my money management used to be total garbage (it‚Äôs much better, I‚Äôm almost too conservative with my money at this point). But I just overheard a girl my age say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go spend money I don‚Äôt have,‚Äù and it just made me think, ‚ÄúI wonder what that‚Äôs like and how it‚Äôd effect me?‚Äù 
What‚Äôs your experience been and would you say having a credit card is too great a risk?"
182,"Hey, so I want to start off by saying that I understand the transition to working life is inherently difficult. Office politics are a norm everywhere, your coworkers aren't your friends, etc. I've heard it all. That being said, I feel like I'm having an especially...abnormal experience? I'd appreciate some perspective on this.

I moved from the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest for this job. I had interned here, fallen in love with my interviewer (we spoke for an hour vs. the allotted thirty minutes), & I landed the internship before I even flew home.

When I interned last summer, I was excited as hell to be doing the work I was given, but there was always a little inherent awkwardness between me & my team. There's a tremendous age/life gap between me & the youngest person on my team (I was in college, everyone else was 29-40, most were married). I'm the only person of color on my team, and I could tell they were uncomfortable whenever I talked about my ethnic culture or language. I was also very shy. But I was excited that they'd taken a chance on me, excited to learn, & I wanted so badly to do a good job. I would take any revisions I was given & rework without a second thought. My manager told me she would give me the job offer before the summer even ended. While I was hesitant about the lack of people of color in the office, the location, and the differences between me & my team, I loved that everyone was very friendly (Midwesterners are!) and I wanted more responsibility there. Plus, I wanted additional opportunity to work with the woman who interviewed me, as I really looked up to her. So I took the offer.

I started my job last month and I'm having a really, really hard time. There's a lot of factors now that I didn't experience as an intern. I have a new manager, and while she's very supportive and kind, the things I were told were employment benefits (teleworking, etc.) she only allows with certain exceptions. Our benefits packages are relatively expensive. Our 401K only matches with one year of vesting. I haven't had much work to do for five weeks, as many projects have already been delegated and they don't tend to reassign things here. Another manager told me I'm expected to work 9 hours, while as an intern I worked 8-8.5. People love to gossip; I've watched someone leave a room, just for another person to talk about them without skipping a beat. I found out from a former coworker who's a POC that my interviewer was racist and made their time there very difficult. We have open offices now, without windows and with very dark lighting (I'm in advertising, and the designers need this to be able to accurately assess their work. I get that, but I'm a writer, so it makes it hard to work).

With the open office, I've noticed that it feels like I'm being watched (Is this normal?). People clock my screen before they look at my face when they stop by. I don't have much work to do, so I'm struggling with trying to find different ways to look productive. I usually worked in our cafeteria as an intern, so I've been going down there to write (There are windows!) and to take a breather from feeling like I have to keep a relevant screen open, even if I have nothing to do. But people keep making comments about it, and I don't know if I'm overstepping my bounds as a new employee. My manager mentioned that it seemed like I wasn't at my desk much; I explained it helped me work more productively, and she said she was okay with it. But when I stayed late downstairs to catch up with a coworker, people expressed concern. A colleague dm'ed me with shock (""OMG! You must have stayed so late"") & the next morning my manager had a similar comment (""I heard you stayed late! Are you overwhelmed?""). I mentioned I was heading out one afternoon and my coworker asked when I'm getting in. I'm just...so confused.

On top of that, I'm having trouble connecting with my team. People are polite, but they're very closed off. I'll mention their interests (that other people have mentioned in passing) and try to express my interest as well, but it doesn't really grip. I'm not really sure what it is.

People aren't sitting next to me in meetings. When it happened the first few times I thought I was being sensitive, but then I noticed it would happen every meeting. I mentioned it to my former coworker who's a POC, and they explained the same thing had happened to them, in addition to having trouble connecting with her colleagues. They told me they wish they'd warned me about the workplace, but they decided against it because I had seemed so excited about the job.

I feel like work is bearing down on me so much right now. I'm experiencing chest pains throughout the day and into my night. I'm having trouble sleeping. I feel so stuck. I don't feel like I can quit because I signed a contract for a year (the bonus has already been paid), but I'm having trouble even getting through each day. Weeks 2-4 I told myself I would do myself to make things better, that it would get better, I would try to connect and build bridges with my colleagues‚Äîand I did; I really tried‚ÄîI've been asking for more work from all my coworkers and setting up meetings with people I haven't met before‚Äîbut once Week 5 concluded, and I spent that Friday with absolutely no work and no one to talk to, I've lost all my spirit to try.

I understand some of what I'm feeling is probably due to this being my first full-time job, ie. adjusting to an open office, office politics, putting on a smile every day even when it's hard, trying to build bridges with people I have little in common with, being shy and navigating small talk 24/7. I think a lot of these things are common in any job. I understand that offices change, and my manager now is going to be different from my previous manager, where I had a lot of flexibility with what I did. I understand that I have to accept how the perks HR sold me as an intern simply don't exist in the way they were presented. I understand that while I have little work now, that could change any week now (I'm still crossing my fingers). But the gossip, the cliques, the nosiness, and the weird atmosphere around race, how nobody has anything to say when I mention anything remotely related to my race or family background‚Äîto the point where I don't talk about it anymore. (It's a part of me! Why do I have to hide it?)

I also moved here for the job, a whole fifteen hour drive away. It's only been a little over a month. Even if I wanted to quit my job, where would I go? Who would take me with only a month's worth of work experience? The job market here is considerably smaller than where I'm from; I've noticed that ever since I've started, I no longer get job solicitations on LinkedIn, which I'm assuming is due to my location.

What do I do, Reddit? Do you have any advice for me? Should I keep trying? What should I do differently?"

184,"A lot of my friends right now are worried about their internship/grad school/university/job offer/etc. falling through in the midst of this craziness right now. I see this happening all around me.

**I want to say that none of this is your fault. Your plans falling through is not a judgement of you as a person. It's not a judgment of your value or how hard you have worked. This isn't your fault.**

We are experiencing history being made in an insane time where the government in many countries have told us to not leave our houses. Only essential activities are being conducted in the majority of the world. A huge percentage of working age people are currently unemployed and food banks are seeing demand like never before.

If your job offer has been rescinded because the company is trying to tighten their budget, this is not your fault. If your plans for grad school have fallen through because you don't feel like paying thousands of dollars for a year of online courses, this is not your fault. If your part time job has let you go because the restaurant has closed down, this is not your fault. If you need to move back home to your parents because of economic or health reasons, this is not your fault. If you need to pick up a job you might not have considered 6 months ago to make ends meet, this is not your fault.

The truth is that this year is a write off in a lot of ways regardless how you or I feel about it. Give yourself the time and space to grieve, be sad, or be angry. I've felt those things too. But we might as well embrace it as much as we can instead of wallowing over what could have been and fighting reality. I do recognize that it's easier said than done but once you accept this, you can make the best of this weird situation.

Take it easy. Maybe indulge in that hobby you haven't touched since high school. Maybe do some decluttering and cleaning if you're into that. Maybe take some free online courses or pick up a part time gig delivering food. Or maybe just watch netflix and nap all day. There is no wrong way to spend your time right now and go easy on yourself. ***We'll get through it and those big plans you had for yourself will still be there when we emerge from this mess.***"

But I was wondering if everyone feels this way? Is it common to just feel extremely lonely after university? I'm worried my whole life will be like this and I'll just never have a close relationship with another person again.

So far, out of my hundreds of applications, I've only gotten one single interview (technically two rounds of interviews but with the same company) and obviously I didn't get the job. Every day I try to apply for jobs but most of the time I get ghosted or automated email. The other day I got a rejected from an Events job that I was really interested in who didn't even have any education requirements, just to be over 18 years old. I know one should not get too personally attached to any job application, but I take all these ghostings and rejections personally because it's my only way out of a bad family, home, and work situation.

I do not have the best relationship with my parents, and I very much want to move out ASAP and have the independence that I use to have in college. My father is narcissistic with temper issues, and my mother has been developing dementia (I actually did not know about this until I had moved back home, my parents had basically hid it from me in order for me to focus on school). My dad's temper often worsens my mom's stress and well being, which in turn feeds back into his temper. I often feel like I'm walking on eggshells around my dad, constantly anxious and worried that the smallest thing is gonna set him off. The worst part is, I suddenly got forced into working for the family business because my dad got into a petty fight with my older brother and fired him on the spot. My brother also does not have a good relationship with my parents, and he had helped and done a lot at the family business. He was the support beam that kept the business afloat, but then that responsibility got dumped onto me. It's not that I don't want to help out, it's that I was suddenly expected to learn how to do and take care of everything by myself because obviously my parents don't know how. On top of that it has become more abundantly clear that my parents rely on me a lot, and it frustrates me that they (specifically my dad) complains about needing help, but then also fired the one person who was helping him with everything. No, he will not ask my brother to come back nor does my brother want to come back, he already moved out and lives on his own years ago and is just glad to be away from it all now, and I don't blame him. I'm constantly on edge everyday because of my dad's temper while trying to hold up responsibilities that were just dumped onto me, day in and day out. It's been incredibly draining and the fruitless job hunting on top of that makes me feel seriously depressed and trapped.

I feel attached to very job application not because I necessarily want that specific job, but because I feel it's the only way for me to get out this bad trapped situation. And when I don't hear anything back or just get an automated rejection, it hurts. I've tried all the advice, rewriting my resume and cover letters, asking for recommendations, etc. But it just feels like nothing is working and that I don't have any control. And every morning I just dread getting out bed just to deal with the same bullshit all over again.

**UPDATE:** Damn I didn't expect this to go off at all lol It was honesty just a rant post and wasn't expecting to hear much, but thank you everyone for your kind words and advice. I'm glad to see so much support and validation here, it gives me a bit of hope that things will change. I still haven't given up on getting a job but it is none the less still draining. But it is true, it only takes one."

I‚Äôm currently not working because my anxiety has been god awful the past few months, and now I feel like I‚Äôm going to lose all of my teeth and it‚Äôs not helping the anxiety.

196,"Last year, I graduated college and moved away from all my friends to a new city, and life just hasn't been the same ever since. (I realize this post reads a bit dramatic...but I'm feeling particularly nostalgic).

While I still have fun from time to time, life seems so boring, unfulfilling, and joyless to me now. I work, eat, sleep, watch a movie, read, etc., but I miss the meaningful discussions I used to have late at night. I miss getting incredibly high and going *nuts* with friends at a weird bar downtown. I miss the feeling of spontaneity and joy that came out of those friendships. I miss reading great books and discussing them with professors.

My life isn't ""bad"" on paper. Thank goodness I have a job during this crisis, but leaving college and my friends seems like such an unrecoverable lost. And I guess I'm just looking for a little hope.

Even though I really have tried to make friends my joining clubs, going out, etc., **I find it incredibly hard to connect with people who don't have the same sense of humor/personality/interests/etc**. I do have a pair of coffee-friends, friends with whom I'll hang out for an hour or two, but I miss the intensity of my friendships during college -- we could stay up all night hanging out, and it was just so much fun!

Without the joy that comes from those relationships, all I have left is work -- which seems so meaningless compared to studying literature, philosophy, and politics.

Like I said, I'm looking for a little hope, a little guidance, and perhaps a few concrete steps that I can take to have a joyful life again."
197,"I don't know if it's as a result of being raised with narcissistic parents that heavily sheltered me, but I am so uncomfortable in situations where drugs or alcohol are really casual. I'm 23 now, and I never grew up going to parties and things with people my own age, so I kind of ended up watching people do this stuff through the lens of social media. Whenever I'm at a get-together with alcohol, or a bar, or anything like that, I feel like... a little kid at a bar. Like I'm not supposed to be there. It isn't even a guilt thing. It's not like I have some looming feeling of ""I'm going to get in trouble for being here"", but more like, ""This is an adult-thing. I'm not ready to do this and I don't think I'll ever want to do this. Why is this an 'adult thing'?"" I really miss being able to go to a friend's house as a kid and *knowing* there'll be no alcohol. Every time I start to get to know someone, they always offer to bring weed or alcohol or to go drinking somewhere, and I really just want to have some innocent fun with people man.

I'm not even saying everyone has to not curse or talk about ""adult"" topics. I'm just so uncomfortable when I want to invite people over to play video games or boardgames or something and they're like, ""Sure, I'll bring the booze."" Like please don't. Why can't we just have fun?

I have absolutely nothing against people that smoke or drink or anything like that. Part of it is that I have PTSD due to a past relationship and I hate the smell of weed (it triggers panic attacks). A larger part of it though is that I kind of miss that ""innocence"" we had as children when we went to a friend's house. That we're laughing so hard until we're almost crying because of something silly someone said, not because we're drunk or high and ""everything is funny"". This all bums me out a lot because I don't want to be seen as that ""lame"" person who doesn't want to partake in things. I think a part of this too is that I was never allowed to go to friend's houses once I hit middle school, or to parties, or even go to the movies with friends. Now that I'm free from my mother (I was kicked out at 17 and have been living on my own ever since), all I want to do is *live.*

When I go places and everyone is intoxicated, it feels like we're subduing that feeling of living with a substance. This isn't the case for everyone, but substance doesn't make me feel more alive... more like I'm wasting my hours in a haze. It's very isolating because making friends as an adult is all anyone wants to do. When I'm not intoxicated and I'm dancing, or excited about a new video game, or running in the woods or feeling really in the moment, *that* makes me feel alive. When I'm sitting at a table of people I like and we're all laughing and I look up and notice everyone around me, and we're all just having fun, that makes me feel alive. It makes me really sad, because I haven't had that in a long time and I don't know how to get that again. That guilty feeling I mentioned earlier about feeling like I'm not supposed to be somewhere... I feel like this also comes from being treated like a child who can't take care of myself my entire life and being *thrust* into adulthood unceremoniously. I feel like I was skipped from Level 2 to Level 20 overnight and I hate it.

**EDIT: For those of you that have been supportive and kind, I really do appreciate your words. I feel like it needs to be said for some of the more skeptical people in the comments that:**

**1.) Another reason I don't like alcohol or drugs that I did not mention for the sake of brevity is that I had a** ***very*** **physically, sexually, and mentally abusive relationship a few years ago, and the smell of alcohol and weed reminds me of him (the reason behind the PTSD I mentioned earlier).**

**2.) I do not mind occasionally having a drink, and I do not mind people drinking around me from time to time. My main issue is people** ***always needing to drink no matter where we are or what we're doing*****. That there seemingly has to be beer whether we're playing video games, pre-gaming before a movie, going hiking, etc. I'm okay with friends doing it from time to time, but I'm not okay with people who  think I have to ""get over this"", or who want to goad me into drinking and aren't okay with me just sitting and enjoying the company of others without drinking.**

**I do not think I ""have to start drinking to learn to like it"". I am not ""infantilizing"" myself just because I don't like to partake in substance. I teach homeless youth how to program. I pay my bills. I counsel and consult people even older than me on how to get jobs using social media. I mentor. I just don't like drugs or alcohol having to take part in every part of my life. There's nothing ""weird' about that. Guess I should have posted this elsewhere.**"
198,"I'm glad college gave me what I needed to advance professionally but right now I just want a ho-hum job (ie routine, not cutthroat) even if it pays less. After graduating from a competitive program, I've realized that I just don't care about the rat race. I just want to be with my family (esp my dog) and in a job where i can put in as little effort as possible so that I can focus on things that matter to me. My job is certainly not my identity.

Anyone else feel the same way?

\*not saying that graduates from non-competitive programs are not dope (they are), it's just the ""go go go"" culture (recruiting, expectations, pressure to publish, etc) was very immediate and pronounced where i was"

I hate the whole hey how are you doing, so glad to see you thing. I know you but I dont anymore. I shouldn't  make a big deal about it but I do."
201,"Yeah, I did what nobody around me thought I could. And it was horrible. College sucked ass and was a struggle the whole time. I kinda ran away from home so I refused to ask for help from parents but I put myself through school to make a point.

And my last finals week was the last time I touched my laptop. During school I was constantly on my computer, which makes sense because I studied data science and computer crap and finance. All I ever did was on the computer. 

Even touching my computer gives me anxiety now. I might boot it up tomorrow. Its hard to say I'm a computer guy still if I haven't booted up my computer in months (I see it every day). 

Is it normal to have an aversion after school to what you've put soo much time into studying?"

203,"22f here. I will graduate in December with my BBA in management. I love to travel and I really want to take some time off to travel for a few months before starting a career. After seeing a lot of my family this weekend they all were asking what I was going to do after school and telling me I should be applying to jobs now. I'm still very unsure what exactly I want to do career wise after graduation. 
Has anyone here taken a few months off after graduation to travel? If so, did you have a hard time getting a job once you came back and when did you start applying for jobs? Any advice is appreciated!"

I've also had so many friends take this time to move across the country, find new jobs, further their relationships in a way that they've wanted to for awhile but COVID expedited. Stories kind of inspiring? Idk shared them in this podcast. But want to hear about anyone else's experiences or thoughts?

205,"I just had an in for a job where I did an informal interview and they asked for two references. After giving two references they told me the references were excellent and they were recommending me for hire. They also told me to follow up if I haven‚Äôt heard from them in 2 weeks. That was more than a month ago now, and two follow ups later. I hate being ghosted in recruitment practices. Especially after doing an interview or giving references (which is a waste of more people‚Äôs time). Why are applicants not respected in any way? Feeling very fed up in my current job and was hoping this would be another opportunity. 
 
Sick of being ghosted or not being respected."
206,"Title says it all. I'm moving back in with my parents (huge financial relief) in order to save money and get to a safer part of the world. The city I live in is getting too dangerous with the panic surrounding COVID-19. I've not lived with my family in 6 years. I feel like a failure for having to move back in and having such a lack luster career, or lack thereof. 

How do I keep my autonomy will living with my parents and still abiding by their house rules? The house rules are honestly super chill just no adult sleepovers and that kinda stuff (not that there is anyone I'd do that with right now anyway) I just have a gut feeling that I'm going to be a burden to them rather than a help, even though there's a lot for me to do there to help with my parents business. It's  a HUGE adjustment for all of us.

They say the first two years after college graduation is the loneliest and I'm feeling that so hard. Can't even say goodbye to my friends because my family is high risk for the virus. Just really feeling scared, and like I am a failure after there were such high hopes for me to do something better than I have.

Edit: seriously the advice I‚Äôve gotten has been AMAZING! It‚Äôs just what I needed to feel alright. There‚Äôs definitely a ton for me to do to help out, and earn my keep with my family. Just have to fall back into the routine of the kind of chores there are on a ranch v. living in town. Using this time as a reset button. Not many of us get the chance to start over. Thanks again to all!"
207,"I want to share my experience on education and hopefully get some help or advice too.

I am slightly autistic and throughout my whole life a kid or student I have always been quite gifted at maths. 

From elementary school to high school, when I came back home my occupations were either gaming or going on YouTube to watch more gaming yet despite doing very little work I did fairly well in my GCSE exams mostly by doing the revision at the last minute. In sixth form, I occasionally did hard maths questions but it was more of a hobby than revision. Anyway, when exams came down, I got the grades I needed to get to the university of my choice, things were great and I was happy....

Well now things have turned around quickly. It turns out hard work is something pretty valuable in our society and all my hard working friends are doing much better than me at achieving things that our society would deem as successful. My parents are now in debts and  I said ""I'll get a job this summer mom dw"" around 20 times but I still haven't gotten a ""regular"" job. I use most of my time self teaching and studying chess/poker nowadays but poker is not seen as something employable despite being a really mathematically complex game. 

I feel like there is no place in the world for people like me, I'm lost, I don't know where to start."
208,"Hello after grad people! I am about to go to college, and plan on attending either graduate or law school after, and then hope to pursue an career in law or politics.

I know body modifications are taboo to them, but would getting a second ear piercing really change anything (i am a girl)? They seem to think so."
209,"Meaning, if you're working towards being a doctor or a lawyer, waiting for that big beautiful golden shining moment where you're accepted into a top school, graduated from that top school, celebrating your achievement... well, guess what. After that big day you still have to wake up and be a doctor or a lawyer.

Make sure you actually want to practice the law. Make sure you actually want to *be* a doctor. Don't sign up for that shit because you want to be ""successful"" in the eyes of someone else! Especially if this is stemming from some type of resentment (ie ""I'll show them). Long after your success has been celebrated/recognized and you've gotten used to a higher standard of living, you will still have to Wake. Up. Every. Single. Day. And. Be. A. Fucking. Lawyer. And if you end up hating it, you are going to feel more lost than just about anyone else because you have that thing everyone wants and it still isn't making you happy.

No disrespect to these two professions at all. I am 1,000% sure plenty of people love what they do within these fields. I'm just saying, I was never taught this growing up. There was always an end goal and never a focus on what lies beyond the fleeting moment of recognition after completing said goal. I really hope kids today/in the near future get exposed to this line of thinking, because while it sounds kind of depressing, avoiding it until you're 30 has and will continue to absolutely DESTROY people (yep, I'm talking alcohol/opiods/suicide).

On top of that, learning this early in life also helps us wrap our heads around loss. The pain of a loss might never go away completely, but again, life is ephemeral. We can reorient ourselves and continue pushing forward into the unknown with a cool head. And honestly, that might be the very best part about being a human. It just seems so completely counterintuitive to what we *thought* we were preparing for since the day we were born.

Thoughts?"
210,"Recently I had a job interview with a small Private school for an administrative Assistant position that seemed perfect for me, I'd like to think I did good and that the job is basically mine. but because I'm a dumbass when I provided my resume I wrote the wrong phone number and I'm afraid that they'll call me back on that number.

211,"I have interviewed with 5 companies because I‚Äôm graduating in a month and no one has asked for about my gpa. In fact, I have only seen a handful of jobs requiring a gpa, and all they wanted was a 3.0.

212,"I feel like we don‚Äôt talk about post-graduation depression enough and I kinda wanted to start a conversation about it because I just realized that this past year, that‚Äôs exactly what I have been going through

I am one of the few people that had a really amazing college experience (except for junior year, that was terrible). I lived in a strict household so I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do a lot of things. when I finally got to college, I felt so free and liberated. I got to do EVERYTHING that my parents wouldn‚Äôt allow me to do without a care in the world; that feeling is honestly indescribable. I have made lifelong friends, connections, networks, grown into a better version of me, learned so many things about myself and the world around me, college was everything that I wanted in life. 

then suddenly, 3.5 years went away in the blink of an eye. while I was having the time of my life, time was speeding up in front of my eyes without me realizing it. I feel like I didn‚Äôt cherish the present moment enough. before I knew it, I went right back to the household that I wanted to escape from in the first place. obviously as a college student who only made $13 an hour, I never made enough money to be able to save up for an apartment; I had no choice but to go back home after finishing school. now granted my parents aren‚Äôt strict anymore, they‚Äôre very chill now, but it‚Äôs little things that they did that made coming back home miserable. 

however, I am VERY fortunate because very shortly after I finished undergrad I found a job within my field that I love so much. a pretty nice starting wage and my coworkers are amazing, I couldn‚Äôt ask for anything better. I had graduated a semester early, so I would come back in mid-May for my ceremony and senior week. then, COVID hit. we all know how that went and how it‚Äôs still going. just like that, I never got my graduation ceremony and senior week was obliterated.

COVID surely didn‚Äôt make any of this better. I imagine that if this pandemic never happened and I got my ceremony and senior week, I wouldn‚Äôt have felt this way for the past year. that‚Äôs not how it played out, and hell maybe even if I did get them I would still feel this way. at the end of the day, I miss college regardless. I miss my friends. I miss walking across campus to visit them. I miss the terrible college food. I miss that feeling of freedom and not caring. I miss everything about it. it‚Äôs been really hard accepting the fact that college is over. I had my time, and now it‚Äôs adulthood time (which sucks btw). I can‚Äôt reverse time and go back to 2016-2018 as much as I want to, it‚Äôs literally not possible. I have to move on and make new memories; hell, probably better memories than college

I can say that I moved out of my parents house last fall and I mean, I can finally do whatever I want. one night, my roommates and I took a spontaneous trip at 9PM to go to another state to get krispy kreme donuts. I had to be up early for work and I didn‚Äôt care. I had SO MUCH FUN and their donuts are so good. had I been back at my parents house, they would not have allowed that at all. I have had some great times since moving out, and it‚Äôs ALMOST like college where I could do whatever I pleased without a care. but despite that, paying bills suck. making food sucks. remembering to eat sucks. commuting to and from work sucks. living with roommates sucks. the thing that I wanted most when I came back to my parents house ended up not being what I imagined it to be. I have learned that the real world is not kind to you at all. just because you are a good person doesn‚Äôt mean that good things will always come to you. you will be so broke you can‚Äôt buy food and have to eat cereal for breakfast and dinner. your car will break down so badly you need to buy a new one and have to take public transportation to work. toilet paper and paper towels runs out so fast you have to buy new ones damn near every week. your apartment might have a mouse infestation and it‚Äôs gross. your heat doesn‚Äôt work and the landlord isn‚Äôt answering your calls or texts. you pinch a nerve in your spine and now have a $150 copay to pay for an ER visit. SO MANY THINGS COULD GO WRONG AND YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO FIX IT OR LIVE WITH IT. I didn‚Äôt go through this bs in college; someone else was responsible for it. I only had to worry about work and my grades. now I have to worry about my eating, my health, paying bills on time, keeping the entire apartment space clean, budgeting, keeping my mental health in check, so many things. this real world shit is so booty and I want nothing more than to go back to being 18-20 year old me. she was fun, outgoing, free spirited, care free, overall a ray of sunshine. now, I can‚Äôt even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. I have dark circles under my eyes, i‚Äôm always so tired, my diet isn‚Äôt great, my back hurts, finances are rough right now, it all SUCKS. 

I feel like I‚Äôve had this annoying, constant void in my chest that I have never been able to shake since I left college. I know it‚Äôs not healthy to miss college like this and believe me, I am trying to find a therapist. they‚Äôre all either not taking new patients or don‚Äôt take my insurance. in the meantime, I‚Äôve had to deal with this on my own and it‚Äôs been difficult trying to grow out of this post-grad depression. on top of that, the worst part about this is the fact that my whole life and identity was based on school. after that it was like, well who the hell am I? I always prided myself on my good grades and now that that‚Äôs gone, I felt kinda useless. I felt extremely insecure in my skin because I wasn‚Äôt good at anything else except school. 

so this past year hasn‚Äôt been great, and life right now is still sucky, but some great things have still happened along the way that I can‚Äôt forget about. because one day i‚Äôm going to look back at this year and beat myself up over not cherishing the good memories. for example, I am going to launch my own business soon this year. I am taking the MCAT and preparing to go to medical school in a few years. I got vaccinated. my parents and my loved ones and I have never caught covid. I am healthy. my boyfriend and I are reaching three years this year. I may not have had a great year, but I still have to be grateful because everything could be gone in a quick second. 

I say all that to say this: for those of you who feel the same way I do, it gets better. I promise. the feeling really sucks, but there is more to life than the fun you had in college. you are more than your grades, your GPA, your degree, you are more than that! college isn‚Äôt going to be the only great thing that has happened to you, there are bigger and better things that come after undergrad. it‚Äôs going to be okay, we got this."
213,"For reference, I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. I thought I would find ‚Äúthe one‚Äù in college but it never happened, and now I realize how much I took college‚Äôs opportunities for granted.

Now I have a job where I work alone, can‚Äôt go to bars or clubs because COVID, don‚Äôt have many friends and especially not friends of the opposite sex...there is no opportunity at all.

I‚Äôve lost hope."
214,"When we were in school we thought we had our lives all planned out: graduate college, find your dream job, earn a lot of money, get married, have kids, buy a house, and everything would be fine! There are certain things you can control but most of the time you can't. You really have to go with the flow and handle what life throws at you each day. I remember I was frustrated and asked myself why is this happening to me?

I feel like the problem is that it was engrained into our minds how our lives should and shouldn't look like from an early age. Now that things haven't gone exactly the way we expected it's making a lot of people doubt and feel bad about themselves. You can have plans and take action but certain things are just out of your control. We're figuring out life everyday.   "
215,"So I finished Highschool a few years back and I'm studying Law in college now, to be perfectly blunt I chose Law on a whim, I never had any interest in being a lawyer and only chose that career path in my last year of highschool because:

1. It's one of the few courses that doesn't have math
2. I was playing Ace Attorney at the time and thought being a lawyer seemed cool (yeah)

Needless to say after some time I started feeling like this wasn't for me, but now being only an year away from finishing a course that should land me a decent job I feel bad giving up on it, especially because there's nothing I really want to do.

It's so weird for me to talk to people about how they always knew what they wanted to do. I have things that I like to do but none of these are productive, I like playing videogames but I'd never want to torture myself making one.

I always assumed that the reason why I half-assed and gave up on everything was because it was not something I REALLY wanted to do, now I'm not so sure.

Am I just lazy? Do I just lack motivation and that's why I wll never find something I want to do for the rest of my life? Do other people also feel the same way but just swallow it up, happy that they at least have a decent job? I honestly don't know."
216,"So I'm a Marketing major and I feel like all I really learned was terms. No hands-on experience whatsoever. But when I look at the job description of Marketing jobs, they list a bunch of stuff on the description/qualification section that I never even learned, and pretty much all of them require at least a year or two of Marketing experience. 

I pretty much got lazy and messed up not applying for an internship my last 2 years of college. Plus, I've been doing full-time summer school for my last 2 years and most internships are during the summer. I'm going to start applying now for an internship for the Fall, but I haven't found any local companies doing internships around my area. 

I do however, have at least 2 years of customer service experience. My GPA is 3.29 as well, which is pretty decent. 

Any advice on how to get a job without much experience? :/"
217,"Did anyone else realize school was bullshit after graduating? You spend about 22 years freaking out and stressing over arbitrary measures meant to find whether or not you can follow directions effectively? Most of these subjects you learn about in school will not help you in your work/career/profession/etc. And you only had 3 months out of the year to not deal with it, and that's only if you were a mediocre student. The retards and nerds had to take summer school, either to make up for really bad grades or because their parents made them

And after those 22 years -- or 26 or even 30, depending on what you studied -- you just wageslave until you're in your 60s, doing shit you have no passion for and barely having any time to spend with loved ones

I wish I was a mediocre student with better social skills instead of being a nerd with poor social skills. I wouldn't have had to had worry about making my parents feel proud or wouldn't have dealt with the insane amount of college debt I have. Connections would've helped me a lot more and would've gotten me perhaps farther where I am right now, it took me about 5 years after graduating from college to figure out what I was good at."

221," Has anyone else experienced a crazy amount of burnout right after graduation? I worked really hard in college, graduated in 3.5 years, had 4 internships, networked, had an active social life, studied abroad, etc etc. I graduated in December and am experiencing a burnout and depression like I‚Äôve never felt in my life. I feel so turned off from the career field I was working towards and don‚Äôt have the motivation to even attempt to get a job. I really don‚Äôt have the motivation to do anything productive anymore. I had been planning to move to a new city for the past few years but now that idea seems terrifying to me and I've put those plans on an indefinite hold. I feel like I‚Äôm not capable of achieving things anymore even though logically I know that I can. I‚Äôm really not sure what to do. I‚Äôm working part time, going to therapy and trying to work on myself but nothing has really helped. I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm going to be stuck in this state forever and am worried it‚Äôs going to set me back a lot or ruin my career."
222,"Hi all,
For those who graduated this summer, congratulations! For those who have been graduated, you‚Äôve come this far, be proud!
I‚Äôm writing this because almost a year ago is when I made my reddit. I more specifically made this reddit to actually read through this subreddit and others about post-college depression. I‚Äôll be honest, I graduated last May and started my first full time job out of college last June. Those two months post college were amazing. Going into my first professional job was hard. The position was demanding and had a huge learning curve. I felt out of place around my coworkers and didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd click. It was hard. I never was a depressed/anxious person, but this job and post college really did a number on me. I had the WORST depression/anxiety from July-December 2019. It got to the point where I considered quitting my job, going back to college, or worse- ending my suffering because nothing felt good anymore. My anxiety was over the roof and I couldn‚Äôt leave my house on my times off. 
Sometimes it gets better for others, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. My job told me this profession is hard and it takes 6-12 months for things to click. At the time it seemed impossible. Now I look back and I do agree, it took a while and I‚Äôm more confident than ever. 
I did a lot to get myself out of that rut and ‚Äúgetting over it‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enough. 
- I reached out to another redditor who posted on this subreddit and had the same stresses as me and she‚Äôs one of my best friends now. She‚Äôs at a different job she loves compared to her first one post college. 
- I started therapy. THERAPY IS OKAY. THERAPY HELPS. I started in October and I wish I would‚Äôve started sooner. When my therapist and I talk now, it‚Äôs not about my fears of meeting friends, finances, and retirement, and children... It‚Äôs about other things that seem very little now. We reflect on how things have changed and I‚Äôm so proud. 
- Be more active. It‚Äôs hard. We‚Äôre adjusted to sitting at a cube now and don‚Äôt wanna move, but being active, finding activities and eating clean can help your health physically and mentally. 
- Take vitiating D and think about getting a sun lamp. A sad lamp is what I call mine. I turn it on in the morning at work and post lunch. It changed my mood a lot. 
- Positive affirmations are a life saver. I carried a book of positive affirmations with me almost everywhere and read a few everytime I felt down. 
I hope not many of you have to suffer post grad depression, but if you do, I feel for you. It was hard to get myself out of that dark place and I‚Äôm thriving now."
223,"Basically the title. I‚Äôm 2 years post grad, and left a well paying finance job at a BB to work in strategy at a media/tech company last year, which I convinced myself I was genuinely passionate about...at the time.

But I still don‚Äôt love it and find it kind of boring and honestly kinda stressful. I‚Äôm learning I guess, and it‚Äôs cool abstractly, but every day I kind of dread going to work. Sure work life balance is better, but what am I really doing with the extra time? I try to stay busy with hobbies, but ik that by leaving finance my earnings potential has dropped in the long run, and I don‚Äôt mind spending more time at the desk if it will actually result in career advancement.

The more people I talk to, albeit all millennials, the more I‚Äôm realizing that everyone kinda hates their job/isn‚Äôt satisfied regardless of the industry. And if no one really likes their job/the work they do (outside of people in STEM who are doing real research/saving lives/developing actually important technologies or people working at NGOs etc.), shouldn‚Äôt I just pursue the careers that are most lucrative? 

Maybe it‚Äôs the existential depression/dread of millennials or something, but it kinda feels like this. I also recognize it I‚Äôm in a pretty lucky situation to even be able to worry about getting meaning from work, but I‚Äôm kinda lost. Does anyone else feel this way/has gone through this?"
224,"I understand that most people have new things to focus on and some moved to new cities. 

It's just disappointing how obvious it is that some people refuse to put in the slightest effort to chat with old friends.

Nowadays, I would strike a conversation asking about how life is when I see some interesting update on Instastory from a **close friend**. A lot of them are eager to talk about themselves. And poof. End of conversation. 

So apparently nobody knows how to sustain a normal, two-way conversation anymore. I'm not even expecting a long chat, just a few texts catching up on life. 

Moments like this makes me feel unappreciated and alone. I recently had a conflict with my best friend of 8 years who has been ranting about her work life for 2 years. 80% of our chat is a one-way conversation. I think she knows her issue but she hasn't changed her ways which resulted in a conflict. In 2019, I have shut down a lot of toxic relationships and I fear that this might be the next casualty because it's weighing me down. 

Moments like this also makes me feel thankful and more appreciative for what I have no matter how little. Thank goodness I have my best friend, who is my boyfriend. I also have a few friends who actually stuck around and they pleasantly surprised me because we were not super close during school. Graduation is a filter that shows you who are the real friends. It might not be the ones you hang out all day in uni or those who have known you for almost a decade."

226,"I have boardgames to play, books to read, podcasts to listen to, tv to watch, friends to hangout with, and thats just fun stuff. Iv'e got errands to run, doctors appointments, cleaning, getting enough sleep, exercise, etc. All the while the looming fear of death is there urging me on to do ""everything"" while I can (a bit morbid YOLO?) It's great but exhausting and confusing and i'm not sure what to do."
227,"Graduated college last year with an accounting degree.

Found a job immediately after with above average pay for the entry accounting profession. Quit after two months because of culture and couldn't accept the ""real world"" realization.

Tried to pursue a a CPA license, flunked the my first and only section so FAR (pun intended)... Felt demotivated after that.

Found a second accounting job working for a non-profit in December. Lower pay, but felt like a family. Just got slayed off, because of the economy. Sad, but grateful to the people and the opportunity. I'll probably cry tomorrow and have a short period depression.

Besides applying for new jobs and unemployment, can someone spare some wisdom for me?"
228,"I feel the  advantage is that it allows you to apply for jobs that require a degree, you have a higher earning potential,  and it makes you look more desirable but once you're working I really don't see the point of it. Unless you're in a specific field most jobs you learn,gain experience, and you're good to go. Sometimes I feel non-college grads could be doing what I'm doing but I guess if having a degree gives you the advtange/opportunity over them then I guess that degree was worth it."
229,"Now that I am not in college and around people my age, what are some hobbies to met people?"
230,"I know networking is important and I always hear ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about what you know but who you know‚Äù but has anyone gotten a full time job in their field after graduating college without knowing anyone and just applying? I‚Äôm currently in college and I‚Äôm majoring in computer information systems and I will graduate in December. Honestly I‚Äôm introverted and reserved so I haven‚Äôt really made any relevant connections but I‚Äôve been to career fairs last year (fall 2020 and spring 2021) and throughout the previous school year and summer 2020, I made numerous calls and sent numerous emails to IT companies for potential internship or learning opportunities and I seemed to come close to landing something several times but COVID kind of ruined it. Also I still applied for internships as well.

So, I understand that networking and knowing somebody is important but has anyone gotten a full time job in their field of study without this and just applied for the job without knowing anybody?"
231,"Not sure if anyone can relate but, I am a college grad that works during the school year at the local charter schools so I looked into a summer job at a day camp. 

I work with college freshmen and sophomores. One is telling me how they wanna rush a sorority and others telling me how they graduated the other year from high school. I feel so old when I tell them I‚Äôm 24. I‚Äôm so used to being the youngest employee at the charter schools. 
 
Again, not sure if anyone else can relate. I just wanted to vent. Hope everyone has a great day."
232,"I‚Äôve just sent a bunch of emails to various people. I feel a little bit afraid and anxious for the responses. The notification sounds give me mini heart attacks each time. I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs come to this stage. 

Does anyone else feel that way too? Maybe it‚Äôs the fear of making people angry or inconveniencing others. It‚Äôs kinda my job to be the thick-skinned, annoying person but I think i‚Äôm way too sensitive."
233,"as a guy who is going to graduate high-school in a year, I feel lost. 

I can't decide on a career path.

I feel like whatever I choose might not be right, and that I will end up wasting 4 years of my life after graduating high-school.

It's a weird feeling of confusion, and i can't do anything about it and it's so frustrating.

The amount of thought process I go do, the research, the people I asked in those fields, and questioning the subjects I took.

I can't grasp my head around it, and it's so goddamn infuriating."
234,"I don't know how else to describe what I'm feeling. I just got laid off on Friday, so I'm unemployed at the moment, but I am keeping my head up and searching for new opportunities.   
However, when I was employed, I started to notice that a lot of my coworkers, colleagues, and bosses were ""fake.""

Now for those of you that are not in with the terminology, essentially, being ""fake"" means to play a part, to act as different than to your true self, and portray a facade. I don't know exactly if there is such a thing in career opportunities, but I most certainly felt this way in many of my jobs. 

For example, they would act all buddy-buddy to me in various encounters that I've faced with them, or separately. But hold a different view of me outside of work, at outside related events. Or vice-versa.

This goes from coworkers, all the way up to senior management, and it just seems like everyone is playing a part, and throwing off a personality that is not genuine, or humble, or helpful. 

&#x200B;

I can only assume that they are doing this for either a promotion, for a raise, for money, because it almost certainly feels as if they are suffering when they do this, and once they leave work, they play bat for another team. They rarely show emotion, they seem robotic, they're always saying yes to every opportunity, and they never speak out. I mean... they're a sheep!

Maybe it's just my imagination, but I certainly can't believe that anyone likes to this way 24/7.   


Have you encountered this in your life?"

I can't just 'go back' to school for that one part, since it was pass/fail, so i've been trying to get certified through the state, but getting certified through the state is impossible, i'm ready to quit teaching altogether. I need a FT/PT job in my field to get certified, but my state only hires teachers with NYS certification.  The only teaching jobs I can really get is subbing and i burned out as a sub, plus only subbing jobs in my field will count, and there's barely any of those each week. my health acted up and i switched to temping at an office.

I'm broke, trying to figure out what to do in the meantime. I rely too much on my parents. I wanted to work overseas, teaching and traveling, but my health isn't great atm and i need money before i can go anywhere. It'll take over a year to get certified. I could prob find a job in China asap but idk.

Life didn't work out the way i thought it would. I'm limited but at the same time I can do anything. It's just I feel like a failure for going to school, not getting what i went for, and now not really wanting to work in the field I went for. I just need a job I can feel proud of, something I can feel fulfilled with... I can't stop beating myself up over the past. but i can't move on.

Of course I‚Äôm not to nice I don‚Äôt let people walk on me or anything like that. The thing is I don‚Äôt have any friends. Once my personality when from dicky to nice everyone kind of dissipated faster than when Thanos snapped his figures and no one really pays attention to me anymore.

242,"I've been out of college since May, just about 10 months or, and have been working what a lot of people would consider a great job about a month after that. I graduated with a degree in computer science and have been working as a developer for one of the largest Human Capital management companies on the planet.

I don't do normal developer work all that often and my role has shifted into more meeting/planning/scheduling work with development added on the side, which is what I *thought* I didn't want to do. But as I work this current position, I just can't help but think I don't know what I really want to do. I thought that I had wanted to do something with computer since I was a young age, and that really hasn't changed. I want to help people, and to help change the world for the better, but I sure as shit don't feel like I'm getting to do that here. I've have heavily considered leaving for a new company somewhere (which presents issues in of itself). But I feel like it would wind up being the same thing. I feel like I enjoy not actually coding, and want to pursue a more manager-like career path, but, at least at this current company, that puts me on call 24/7 which is something absolutely do not want to do in a career. I want to leave work and leave it at work. 

I also feel like I hate the concept of working a lot. Because of the time devotion to it. I had a realization during an anxiety attack that I hate it because it takes time away from me spending time with the people that I love. But when I admit that out loud, I feel like it just makes me sound lazy. 

I've been mildly looking at other companies elsewhere, but it could easily just be the same thing if I go there. I've considered trying to start my own company, but I have student loans to pay that really can't be put on hold which deters me from it or finding a new job that pays less.

I'm sorry for the mini rant and the rambling, I just feel very lost and unsure of myself right now and wanted to find some people to talk who might experience the same thing.

Sorry, quick edit: Ironically, I enjoy doing a lot of things that aren't computer/development related. DIY woodworking/electronics stuff, being outside (lol), meeting and talking with people. Stuff that isn't directly related to development or computer science from my understanding."
243,"I know change is hard. The transition from from college to post-grad was HARD, and that was with everything going ""well"". So for the ones entering the real world facing viruses, rising unemployment, and a crashing market, do not think that will characterize your whole life. 

Though it may be a silly platitude, do not forget that things will improve."
244,"Joined this subreddit over a year ago when I was having trouble transitioning to life after college and figuring out what I wanted to do. Wanted to post in here to show that it CAN be done and it truly does take time, a lot of work, and a good amount of luck. 

I graduated at the end of 2018 with a degree in web design/development. Right after graduation I had an internship lined up with a great organization helping with their website and email marketing. Quickly realized that the aspect I enjoyed the most, design, was only about 15% of the job. Most of the job was just web maintenance and fixing bugs in the code. Although when I got to design images for their email campaigns that's when I found work to be actually enjoyable. So near the end of the internship I switched my focus to graphic design and started out on building my portfolio. 

By September 2019 I was back living with my folks with no job, an average at best portfolio, and barely any responses to my hundreds of job applications. My anxiety got worse and it led to some bouts of depression, always feeling like the idea of getting a job in this new area of focus was impossible and that I messed up big time. But after slowly and steadily creating more work to add to my portfolio and revising my resume, over time I started to get interviews. Many times I would get to the final round of the interviews only to receive an email 2 weeks later that they went with another candidate, or hear nothing back at all. This happened about 8 or 9 times with different organizations over the course of the following months, until just this last week I got the call from a company saying they would like me to join their team.

Looking back there were times it truly felt hopeless, I would wake up and apply to 5/10 jobs a day and get no leads for months, but all it takes is one. If you're reading this and really don't feel like it can happen, just have a little faith. This whole process you're at the mercy of these companies you are applying to so it feels like you are helpless, but just keep improving yourself and keep applying and your time will come."

246,"Ever since I was little, it was ingrained in my head to go to college and graduate. That‚Äôs all I worked for. I‚Äôve finally graduated college and I‚Äôve been going through this weird phase in my life like now what? I feel that because my mom always said to graduate college, that was my sole purpose for living and now that I‚Äôve done it I‚Äôm really lost. The transition from school to a job has been a little hard and I‚Äôm looking at the good things about no longer being in school, but some days are hard to adjust. 
Has anyone dealt with this? How did you get past this? What do you feel like your new goal/purpose is?

Update: I ended up finding some good hobbies. Started learning how to crotchet so I can make scarves for the homeless. Also got a part time weekend job mentoring high schoolers from where I went to high school. Still feeling hopeless sometimes, but definitely not as much as I did when first posting this!"
247,"I think I've been misguided. Yesterday was my 27th birthday. I'm single, I'm unemployed, don't have any kids and I'm living with my mother. I'm on unemployment and still make more then her while she's working. She doesn't speak much English, and emigrated to this country when she was 19. I can't even begin to imagine the struggles she must have faced when she was 19. I could barely take care of myself at 19, or go to college without the support of my mother, so how she left all of her belongings and just did it, is bonkers to me. 

I graduated college in 2016, with my commencement speaker as Michelle Obama. You can probably find her speech on YouTube if you look hard enough. I felt alive when I was 22. I felt even better at 19. And 17. 15. I thought I could be famous and successful, and rich and have much more then what I've currently achieved in life.

I don't have much hope for myself. Most of my colleagues are employed, have a family, much further in their career, and here I am, unable to start, not unwilling, and unsure what path or direction to take.

I don't know what to do, and I feel left behind, and let down by a promise that maybe my life is not going to be as high and mighty as I once thought.

It‚Äôs weird to think the thing you‚Äôve been working on for your entire life has finally been completed. In order to stay sane this whole time I‚Äôve just not focused on graduation because it‚Äôs always been a goal so far out and out of reach that it was never something I actively thought about.

I feel like I can finally be an adult now. Somehow I‚Äôve been lucky enough to land an internship at a great place and talented enough to get a follow up offer and I start soon. This is something I‚Äôd always been working towards but somehow never thought I‚Äôd actually get. Like I would have flunked out before the finish line or died in some tragic vending machine accident. I wonder when it will all start to feel real."

I am unemployed and still don't have a college degree but seriously want to get one and stop depending on my family. They have done so much already. I am fairly good with computers so I  guess I am gonna get that one. I just wanted to ask if anyone else keep getting reminded of those memories. It's really painful for me for some reason I don't know why. I was not bullied, the school was good and I was, an below average student? Maybe? I mean I never failed, I just got passing marks that's it. I think this is what I hate the most and I keep getting reminded of it. Being average! How do you guys deal with this?

252,"Hi everyone, I'm 24 and I've been out of school for almost 2 years now. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design and I've been working at a local print shop making minimum wage for about a year now until today. Before that I was working at a Value Village. I'm starting to feel like a failure already.

First got fired at Value Village for accidentally missing a few shifts. I know it's my fault for missing them, but they handed out shifts in a confusing way when I worked there and I fucked up and missed them. I should have been paying more attention, but I was fired out of the blew without and prior warnings. It took me 7 months to even get that job.

The print shop was a small business and I got fired because was making too many errors too frequently in my work. I'm heartbroken because I felt like I was trying my best there but it just wasnt enough. I was friendly with all of my coworkers and tired to get along with everyone. But I was constantly parinoid about getting fired when I was working there too from getting fired the first time. I really did my best to spot my errors and correct them when I could, but no matter what I did I still seemed to miss them. Part of me also felt like I could be doing more than what I was doing there, but there was a voice in the back of my head that said ""if you cant get this stuff right, then you wont be able to get any other design stuff right either.""

I'm also sort of stuck in my hometown. I went to school near a big city and lived there while I was in school, but I'm very close with my family and quickly became homesick near the end of my time at school and decided to move back home instead of staying near the city. I feel like I sort of fucked myself when I did that because theres a lot more opportunities in my field there but I felt a compulsion to go back home, especially because the student housing I was in was awful because no one but me gave a shit about the place.

It was also expensive to live near the city as well. I was lucky enough to get this job at the print shop where it seems like it's the only print place in the area that cares about design. But I fucking blew it, I tried and I tried but it wasnt good enough.

 My boyfriend also lives an hour away in the city that we both went to school in, and now I'm panicking trying to decide where the hell I'm going to go next. Hes just started his first job in his field in October and has been commuting on the train to get to work. I'd love to move in with him but I'm constantly panicking about how we could afford it.

The student loans, car payments and bills and everything is going to hit soons and I'm terrified. I feel inadequate because I did really well in school, but now that I'm out I feel like I havent done anything right. I havent had a sketchbook in over a year because I havent had any new ideas. I'm fortunate that my parents are very supportive and care about me a lot, but I still feel like I can't do anything right."
253,"I‚Äôm 22 year olds and I have wasted the last four years. What should I do? 

Most of my peers have either graduated or about to graduate. 18-22 just passed by in a blur. After high school, I enrolled in community college. I dropped out after a semester due to a lack of interest. From the next three years, I was directionless. I spent the years hanging out at Boston libraries, moving out with my parents to a new town, and just doing absolutely nothing. I registered for an online degree program, but it‚Äôs a scam (not in the sense that you had actual fraud) that charges me with ridiculous backloaded fees and puts random holds on my account, which prevents me from completing my degree in a linear timeline. 

I‚Äôm just a leech and loser at this point. I‚Äôm not depressed, but my life is depressing. I live with my parents, I don‚Äôt have a driver license, and I feel the innocence of my college aged years has passed me. I don‚Äôt want to spend the entirety of 20s on campus or in a dorm. I don‚Äôt want to spend the next four to five years worrying about my GPA or staying up all night to write research papers. I‚Äôm done with college kids. In all honesty, I rather not spend my 20s with a bunch of hormonal teenagers on campus. When I hit my mid 20s, I don‚Äôt expect to be the Man. However, I want to put my foot in the door and live in an interesting life. I know I want a career in finance or business so I‚Äôm not undecided about a career path. 

Any sincere advice?"
254,"(on mobile with a cracked screen, forgive the formatting and any typos)

I am (was? won't be for much longer) a graphic designer in a small start-up for a year post-graduation, but I was called into a meeting on Friday where I was informed that we just don't have the money to keep the company afloat with the ~20 employees we have, and the company's being cut down to less than 10. Myself and many of my coworkers are out of a job at the end of the month.

I now have two weeks left of employment, during which time I need to scramble to get my resume and portfolio updated, as well as look for freelance work or a new job. It's awful timing- my lease is up in a month and a half and I'm trying to renew and move into a bigger apartment with my partner, which means I have to re-prove I make 3x the rent. But very shortly, I won't be able to prove that at all. Not to mention there's always expenses, bills to pay, etcetera.

I guess, does anyone have advice or even just commiseration for being suddenly laid off? Those of us being laid off are getting excellent recommendation letters from the CEO and one of the chief officers getting laid off is going on a networking tour of the city to try to find us all new jobs, but I'm personally not sure if/how I should pursue filing unemployment, what steps I need to take personally, etc."
255,"Hi. Very tired but soon-to-be graduate here.

The last two years of my diploma program have been the most taxing years of my life and I'm in a position where, more than anything, I want to take a break for an extended period of time. The good thing is there's always a steady amount of employment opportunities for the field I'm studying, but I also wonder how taking an extended hiatus would affect my potential employment.

I want a break because much of the quality of my life has heavily deteriorated from being in school. In the last 2 years I've lost 20 pounds, suffered from an eating disorder due to stress and have frequently lost control of my mental health/become a shittier person. I'd *like* to start working, find a job, and earn money straight away, but I wonder how detrimental this would be for me and if it's a better idea to just relax for a couple months.

Has anyone graduated from post-secondary and taken a break just to recuperate and recover from school? What were your experiences like and did you see any immediate/long-term advantages or disadvantages?

Any discussion is appreciated, thanks.

EDIT: I'm overwhelmed by the supporting words and hearing all your guys' stories. Thank you so very much."
256,I know I shouldn‚Äôt be too hard on myself considering the circumstances... but I can‚Äôt help but feel incredibly disappointed that I don‚Äôt have a job yet. I just feel like the job market is so competitive right now that even the hope of getting a job in the near future seems grim. Is anyone else feeling the same?
257,"Hi y‚Äôall! I just graduated from university this past spring and I finally landed a full-time analyst position at a consulting firm. When I received the offer in October, I was told my start date would be flexible and I can establish a date as early as January. I followed up with them recently to set a concrete date, and they told me due to project demand the earliest I can start is March‚Äîmaybe even June. 

What should I do?

It‚Äôs currently December and I was hoping to relocate to the city where the job is located next month. The apartment/housemates I found are pretty nice. I‚Äôm not sure if I want to lose it; I have enough in savings to cover rent expenses. Currently I live at home, without a source of income. I‚Äôve been keeping myself busy with volunteering and job apps.  Since signing my offer, my plan was to relax during the holidays a bit before starting work. Now I feel like a complete bum, back where I started. 

A few options I thought of are:
* Move into the new place and use most of my savings to cover rent costs. Hopefully, I can find a temporary retail job.
* Use part of my savings to travel (I‚Äôm not sure for how long) and do online learning (like coding or new language).
* Stay at home. Try to find a temporary job or a different job altogether.
* Some other combination of the above items (if there‚Äôs an optimal combo lmk).

I really don‚Äôt want to keep living at home. My college/connections are far from where I live; I feel incredibly unproductive and lonely. The new city is closer to my network of resources.

Already, I visited the office for a networking event and met plenty of people. I‚Äôm extremely grateful for landing this job. The recruiting process was very competitive and the pay is really good, far better than the average new-grad salary of my major.


Edit 1: typo

Edit 2: Also, the apartment I‚Äôm looking at is far below market price in the city. I found the place through connections and it may be hard to find something similar in the future.

Edit 3: 
Thank you everyone for your input! I really appreciate everyone‚Äôs advice on working out a course of action.

After speaking with my parents, we think it‚Äôs the best option to secure the apartment and they‚Äôll help me with some of the rent until I get my first paycheck. I am tremendously grateful to have their support. No longer do I feel as pressured to find a temp job anymore, though I will probably take a gig I found through my network in the meantime. Everyone I‚Äôve shared the situation with has been very helpful and I feel extremely fortunate. 

I asked my recruiter if I can start early and am still waiting for their response. They also sent a form where I can rank my preference months, which I submitted with March being first priority. I‚Äôve heard from multiple friends in the company that they normally give the first preference anyway.

If budget allows, I might do a small trip within my means. I‚Äôm definitely a planner/spreadsheet type of gal, so I may have freaked out considering something didn‚Äôt go to plan. Thank you everyone again for your patience and kind suggestions :)"

I've also recently got drawn into investing with my measly savings, inspired by the Gamestop fiasco, but that has only exacerbated the problem as now I can't focus on my job as I am constantly checking on my stocks.

260,"We were all at the same place during school. Now that we are all out everyone is going in all sorts of directions. The comparison is high, the anxiety, and worry about where your life is headed but you're just in the beginning phase of what you are about to become. 

You just can't see it yet because you haven't gotten there  but I promise you'll be ok. If you're still working minimum wage while your friend got a lucrative job at Google I promise it won't be like that forever.

261,"Hi all, I just graduated with a degree that I can‚Äôt really use unless I go to grad school (molecular biology). I moved out if my parent‚Äôs house to get on my feet and am supposed to be applying to grad schools now. My whole life i bounced back and forth between wanting to be a scientist and wanting to be a high school teacher, and now I am worried that I am going to commit to a program that doesn‚Äôt enthrall me if i get my PhD. I‚Äôm also worried that if i get my teaching certificate I will always be feeling like I‚Äôm not living up to my potential. I am just plain lost. Have any of you been in this boat? Particularly those of you who had this feeling of having a potential and worried about disappointing yourself or your family? How did you end up finding happiness? Do you have any regrets?

EDIT: I‚Äôm passionate about molecular biology, but I‚Äôm much more passionate about politics and philosophy, although I have no formal education in the latter. I feel like getting a teaching certificate will allow me to feel like I am making an immediate impact on the world while also allowing me to explore philosophy and whatever I want to do in my free time, meanwhile getting a PhD would pretty much limit my life to my specialization. Am I completely misinformed?"
262,"5'8"" male. Throughout most of college I hovered around the 160-170 range and got in enough exercise by walking around campus and occasionally going to the gym. The dark side of this, however, is that I had a lot of insecurity about my appearance which always lingered in the back of my mind. Now that I've graduated, I think I've gotten over a lot of that insecurity, but as a result I've pretty much avoided the gym or any intentional exercise, and my diet has suffered as well. I weighed myself yesterday and I was 205 lbs. I've heard people say that mental and physical health go hand in hand, but the times where I was in the best shape of my life I was also the most stressed and sad. Some of my best life experiences have come within the past six months while putting on the extra weight. Overall I'd say I've been doing better mentally since finishing school. I never liked exercise or working out. Often when I do I hurt for days afterwards (probably due to DOMS), and it feels like a waste of time. I'd really rather use that time to do literally anything else. But I know there will come a point where I have to address my weight- I just don't feel like I have the time working 40 hours a week in an office and doing the best I can to cook my own meals."
263,"I'm a recent grad who recently graduated and moved away from my roommates and back to my parents while I work/find a career job. 

This weekend I went back to the city I went to university in for a Halloween party at my old roommates place, but even after a month of less than regular communication with my university friends, I already felt a disconnect in even the most basic conversation topics. I don't know if I just miss the crazy social student life or I just fell into a routine and became boring while their life went on. Has anyone felt this estrangement when going back to your old colleagues? Is this something a lot of grads to through? How do you keep up wth people while working full time and only being able to go out weekends?"
264,"It's kind of the IT thing to do. I think we all want to move to new cities to see and feel different things. I've lived in 4 different cities since I graduated school and I notice the novelty always wears off. Same restaurants,bars, hiking, sports teams, and events. Besides the weather, culture, and landscape big cities all start to feel the same after a while. Maybe it's a good thing and it just means I experienced and know that city well."
265,"Very few books has been written about the people working in Chinese factories, and most of them were written by journalists. I thought it might be interesting to share the experience as someone who has been working in factories for 15 years.

My first job in a factory started in the summer of 2003, I was 14 and had just graduated from middle school. My parents had been asking around trying to find me a job for weeks before the graduation. We needed the money. One of my cousins helped me get the job. It was a biscuit factory in our town, about 40 minutes bike away from our house.

I started as a temporary worker making moon cakes. The pay was Ôø•10 a day, approximately $1.40 dollars. Moon cakes are a special occasion food people eat during mid-Autumn Festival, which lands on the 15th day in August on the lunar calendar.

Given it‚Äôs a seasonal food, the production site for it was set up temporarily as well. It‚Äôs under a shed that connects 3 buildings. The roof of the shed was about two-stories high, and only about 35 square meters (315 square feet). A long table was placed in the middle of the shed to lay out the majority of the processes for the making of the moon cake. 4 or 5 baking ovens stood by one side of the wall, the other two sides had bags of raw ingredients for the moon cake.

Making a moon cake is quite similar to making dumplings. Get the dough ready, roll out each wrapping, wrap up the filling. The differences are that wrapped moon cakes would be placed in molds to get shaped and brushed with a layer of egg yolk before baking. It‚Äôs a very simple process, so we had multiple people sitting side by side doing each step to speed things up.

All of the work was done manually. Despite a few fans that sat the corner of the shed, some workers were still sweating from the heat from the nearby baking oven or just the labor they were doing. A lot of the sweat dropped on the food we were making. And when the fans rotated away, flies lands on the ingredients. The idea of having moon cake has never excited me since then.

Preparation for the stuffing happened on a smaller table next to the big one. We were basically making three kinds of stuffing. Peanuts with rock sugar, red bean paste and fruit flavored stuffing made by white gourds. My job was to carry the semi-ready stuffing from a nearby warehouse onto the table. It was all done manually as well.

It was easy to carry peanuts and fruit flavored white gourds as their packages were smaller and lighter. However carrying the red bean paste was a lot harder. They were packaged in metal cans that weighed about 20kg. I could barely lift it by one hand, so both hands had to be used. It was too heavy to carry and I had to drag it across the floor.

I was not used to carrying stuff that heavy and had to take breaks from time to time.

Once my hands and back got used to the carrying, I was able to earn little breaks for myself. Sometimes I would help Mr. Liu, a man in his middle thirties worked at the smaller table, mixing and kneading the stuffing. Other times I would go over to the next table and learn how to wrap the stuffing while chatting with the people there.

We had about 20 workers working in the shed. Most of them were villagers in town, working in the factory allowed them to be close to home and care for their families. Two other girls were my age, just got out of school as well. There were 4 older girls in their late teens and early twenties. They used to work in other places outside of the province but moved back home because their families were working on matching them up with boys and marrying them off. It was not a wise thing to do to let your daughter work too far away from home when she is old enough to get married. Who knows if she would ran away with a random boy to a place far away from your hometown. In china the boys family is expected to pay a significant dowery. That has changed in more developed areas, but still remains to be the cause in many remote and undeveloped parts of the nation. Raising daughters costs money and almost every family was waiting on her wedding day to cash out on the investment.

Our work started at 8am in the morning and finishes around 8pm in the evening, with short breaks during the day for meals. Working 12hours or longer in a day was not easy, especially most of the time I had to stand and walk around, but I was happy, I was no longer a mouth needing to be fed in my family.

In the early 1980s, we still used the communal farming system. The village owned the land and every family works on the land together and got a share of the harvest at the end of the season. That system was replaced by all the land in the village was divided and allocated to each family based on the number of members in that household. When someone past away, that family loses a share of the land, and that piece of land would be redistributed to the new born. Normally my family should be got distributed an extra plot of land, because I was adopted, people in the village committee did not think my family deserved to be given the land. My family adopted me because of the kindness of their heart, otherwise I‚Äôd have ended up like many baby girls at the time, being dropped at the side of the road left to die. I think it was a very unfair thing to do, people‚Äôs kindness should not be awarded with cold indifference. I‚Äôll never forget the helplessness and anger in their voice when talking about it.

I actually gained weight shortly after working at the factory. We had a chef who cooked for all the workers and everyone would get a small bowl of dishes and all-you-can-eat rice. Heading to the kitchen was always happy moments for me. I no longer needed to be mindful if we have enough food for everyone and could simply indulging myself in enjoy the food. My family worked hard in the fields to grow whatever crops we could, but land was limited and food production yield was low, as a result food was always tight. The thought that now I have this job that I can earn my keep and even bring home cash made me happy.

Moon cake production would go on for a few weeks and I knew I was hired for that only. I wanted to get hired for biscuit production to have a more stable job. I figured if I work hard, people would notice that I am a hard worker and would consider me when the opportunity came. And it worked. I was asked to join the people I was working with to start another shift for the biscuit production when the moon cake production came to its end.

Working on the biscuit production line was more intense than the previous one. Biscuits were baked through a tunnel heated by coal and the cost of stopping the line and let coal go wasted was unthinkable. So instead of taking time off for meals, we took turns for meals. The number of people working on the line was the same number of stations on the line. In other words, someone had to do two person‚Äôs job if someone gone off for meals or bathroom breaks. Most of the time we‚Äôre able to manage, but when production was not going well and we really could not afford anyone to leave their station, we had to wait and miss our meals.

Despite the shift ended at 8pm, most of the time we could not get off when the clock hits 8. Mangers of the factory would arrange truck(s) arrives 10 or 15 minutes before the end of the shift. And the rule was people working on that shift needed to load the truck. We‚Äôre feeling exhausted after a 12 hour shift and no one liked to work an extra hour or two to load up the truck, but we had to do what we were asked to do. Job opportunities in the town was very limited, it‚Äôs not like we had a lot of options.

When we were finally let off, people would either go home or shower and sleep in the factory dorm. I got to watch a bit TV (there was one TV in the whole factory where we used to sat together and chat) or stand on the dorm balcony and let the evening breeze dry my hair before going to sleep. I started to think about my future in those rare moments. Going back to school did not seem very likely, but as start of a new school tern approaches, my craving got stronger, especially seeing kids my age showing up at the high school next door.

I was the top student (out of about a thousand) for the middle school entrance exam. However, my parents did not see the value of me continuing my education and were counting down the days to my middle school final exam so that I could go off and start working. Given most the parents would end their daughter‚Äôs education after middle school in our village, I understood the prospective of continue my education was very thin. Girls would move to another household and became someone‚Äôs wife and daughter-in-law when she got married, and that would be the new family she needed to care for. So the earlier your daughter starts working, the more time you get to have her making money for your family before that inevitable day comes. That‚Äôs the unspoken thought of most villagers at the time. So they‚Äôre not encouraged to invest in their daughter‚Äôs education.

I made very little effort in answering the questions when sitting through the exams and the grades reflected that.

Mom came to visit me at the factory one morning. I had just finished a night shift and had gone to sleep. She woke me up and wanted me to try on a pair of new high-heels she just bought for me, which I felt weird. But maybe that‚Äôs her way of helping me transition from a girl to a woman. I was too sleepy to be bothered, but she was persisting and telling me now that I am older, it‚Äôs time for me to dress like other girls. I tried, but it did not fit, despite mom kept squeezing my feet into the shoes. My sleepiness went away in the moments of squeezing and pushing.

I asked mom if I could go back to school and redo the final year of middle school. I promised I would study harder, get good grades. ‚ÄúWe just spent our money on building the new house and we don‚Äôt have money for that‚Äù was the answer she told me. Tears came out my eyes on hearing that. I told her I could collect my wages from the factory and if that‚Äôs not enough, maybe we could borrow some from our relatives. She did not like my proposal. ‚ÄúIf you go back to middle school but failed to get in high school, you‚Äôd waste a year of your life‚Äù, that was her response. I promised I would get in high school. Then she told me I would be too old to get marry. I did not quite understand her logic, if I got into high school, I would graduate before turning 18. How that would make me too old to marry? I sensed the conversation was not going to the direction I wanted to go and more tears came out. Mom started crying too. In her tears she told me she could not make that decision for me and left soon.

I went back to sleep in my tears. The thought of living my life like other girls in our village did not excite me at all. Working in the factory for a few years before marry someone in town. Have one or two kids, tending the fields while caring for the younger kids and elderly in-laws, as the husband would migrant to other cities or further places for jobs throughout the year. The more I thought about it, the harder it was to stop myself from crying. I really did not want to live my life that way, but I did not know how to turn it around.

266,"UPDATE: Never mind y‚Äôall. I didn‚Äôt even have to worry about negotiating because the job was a SCAM. Whoo chile, dodged a bullet. 

The listing said the salary would be from $28-$34 per hour (around $58k-$70k per year). A couple of days ago, they emailed me to schedule an interview and said the salary was $25 an hour. I‚Äôm not gonna lie here - that salary is not bad. It‚Äôd put me at $52,000 per year, which I think would amazing for a first job out of college. 

But to me, it‚Äôs the principle of the matter.  I feel it‚Äôs a bit disrespectful to offer lower than advertised. Especially since I meet all of their requirements, and I have a bachelors degree when they only require a high school diploma. 

More than that, I‚Äôm wondering if this speaks to an integrity issue. If so, it gives me a bit of pause and makes me nervous about the idea of working with them going forward. 

Thoughts? Is this a red flag?"
267,"I just recently started my third year of college and thanks to taking AP classes in high school I now have the option to graduate a year early with a degree in Economics. However I also have the option of staying for a fourth year and also getting two minors, one in sociology and one in business admin. Thankfully I do not pay full price for college due to scholarships and finical aid but it also isn‚Äôt completely covered either.  Would staying the extra year and spending a few thousand extra dollars be worth the two minors? Or should I just take my degree in Economics and have that extra year?"
268,"It just feels like after graduating from college, life is so tough. And I don't mean pandemic tough. But I mean nothing is going right for me today. I made beans in the slow cooker and they came out mushy and not like I imagined them to be from the videos I have seen. I burned my cornbread on the stovetop, which was my fault since I don't own an oven. I got a rejection from a company I was interested in. And my date, bailed on me.

It just seems like nothing I do, is ever correct. Why am I so unlucky?"
269,"I've been working in this job for months already, but last week I was offered a fulltime position. What a feeling to sign a contract with no end date on it! It almost didn't feel right.

270,"I recently graduated university back in August and have been looking for employment since then. It came to the point where I'm desperate to find something. Recently, this recruitment agency (this agency called Coders Data if anybody knows or heard of them) reached out to me with an opportunity that seemed really good.

The guy on the line told me they will work with me to fix my resume and interview prep me. He also told me that I will work with their clients on projects and since they are not under contract with their clients, I can leave their projects at any time, and here's the kicker: they require me to pay a $700 USD security deposit which they promised me I will get it back as soon as I get my first pay check. 

I was a little hesitant when I heard this. Since I just got out of school and have barely a year of internship experience, i didnt know if this was normal or something I should avoid all together. 

Any advice will be appreciated. Plus $700 USD is something I just dont have at my disposal.

EDIT: I also want to add that they require me to pay this security deposit in case I leave a project midway."
271,"So, I was super fortunate to get my dream job out of college with only a week or two of nervousness. 

I went from having two years of co-op experience to being a salary employee overseeing 2 interns of my own, another engineer and a retirement age machinist within a month and while I'm doing great, I definitely feel like I'm faking it until I make it. 

But that is ok, because our metrics are off the chart at the moment and my boss and the president have sat me down and said they are ""surprised at how well I have handled the responsibility""  and are ""really excited for the future of our group"". 

Has anyone oversaw someone much older before and have some tips? This person is literally triple my age and is clearly very good at what he does, although made a 10k mistake yesterday and had to come admit it to me.

273,"Let me just preface this by saying that you‚Äôre *not* stupid to be unemployed. It's a competitive market right now, and finding a job is tough and demoralizing. That being said, I really do care‚Äîand I want to see every single one of you in a job you hopefully like. 

I'm a recent Marketing grad (2019) who worked in a career center in college. Right now, I‚Äôm working in political/nonprofit comm and before that, I worked in retail marketing. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time on career development, and the #1 skill I've honed is writing (so content/copy for ads, email, social, blogs, some print, etc.), but I've also been in digital and email marketing roles. Here are my top tips to my fellow recent grads for job-searching and networking in marcomms:


**Reach out to your previous professors.** My head of Marketing connected me with several alum who had recently landed jobs at digital marketing agencies. I didn‚Äôt end up going with any of those agencies, but it was nice to connect with people who were so passionate about what they were doing, and to see what options I had available to me. And when you land a job, pay it forward‚Äîreach out to your school with openings from your company.


**If you have the time, volunteer PART-TIME for a nonprofit.** This is my biggest tip for building experience while you search for something full-time (or if you're still in school!). I don‚Äôt believe in unpaid internships as much as the next person who believes in fair labor, which is why I recommend volunteering for nonprofits‚Äîto me, it always felt less exploitative than trying to prop up a corporate content mill. Those working at nonprofits are also extremely kind for the most part, so it can be a wonderful reprieve to help others while working with great people. It can be as simple as 2-7 hours/week doing a local nonprofit's social media or content writing for their blog/newsletter. If you have photography/graphic design skills, let them know! If you don‚Äôt have experience with email marketing, digital marketing, writing, social media, etc., this is a great time to test-drive anything new that you‚Äôve never tried before. 

These types of gigs have low barriers to entry as well, so it‚Äôs a super easy way to get experience and fill resume gaps (most job app formats won't require you to list the number of hours you worked). Put this experience down as *Work/Relevant Experience*‚Äî**the first three experiences on your resume are most important**, so don‚Äôt invalidate your hard work by placing it too far down you resume.

A personal anecdote here: My freshman year summer, I volunteered for ~6 months with a social impact start-up to write 4-6 fundraising pitches a week that ended up raising over $500,000. Five years later, that experience was directly related to the work I do now. 


**Internships are much more low-barrier than a full-time job.** If you can afford it, taking on one more internship is a great way to prove yourself to agencies that see your potential but often don‚Äôt want to risk hiring a more inexperienced candidate. I know some top students from my uni who took on internships after graduation before moving into prestigious full-time roles at agencies and startups. Many internships can also be great pipelines to getting hired‚Äîask your recruiter what a potential pathway could look like.


**If ads, writing, design, social media aren‚Äôt for you, consider your options (because you have them!).** If you‚Äôre detail-oriented, copy-editing or digital production for digital + email campaigns is something you could try. If you‚Äôre a people person and/or enjoy client relations, look into sales or accounts management. If you want to look outside marcomms roles completely try: recruiting, project management, HR, events coordination. When I worked at a large retail company, we had Marketing majors go into Merchandising and Pricing Analysis. It‚Äôs all about spinning your understanding of business and leveraging soft skills on your resume. So on that note...


**Rewrite your resume, and be aggressive.** I‚Äôll use bullets because there‚Äôs so much to be said here:

* **Start every bullet with a verb in the -ed tense, and be consistent.** Don‚Äôt suddenly switch to -ing (Ex. ""Led a project...‚Äù should be followed by a bullet that reads ‚ÄúCollaborated with‚Ä¶‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúCollaborating‚Äù). It‚Äôs distracting for the reader.

* **Flesh out every bulleted sentence.** My peer mentor taught me that if you fold your resume in half vertically, every bullet should be long enough to pass the middle line of the page‚Äîto make sure you‚Äôre painting a complete picture of what you did in your role. A resume is only one page‚Äîdon‚Äôt let that space go to waste! 

* **Show off ALL your soft skills.** Did you regularly update clients on your progress? Did you collaborate? Coordinate? Organize an event? Lead a project? Evaluate results? Pitch new ideas? Present to management? Start each bullet with what you did. 

* **If your GPA is below 3.5, leave it off.** They‚Äôll ask if they need it (but they won‚Äôt). 

* **List awards under the roles where you made the magic happen.** If you won any awards/recognition (Ex. Our work on XYZ led to my team winning Project of the Month) or made any numerical impact (Ex. Raised over $20,000 for an event), this should be your last bullet for that role. 

* **PROOFREAD.** An error-free resume is especially important in marcomms! 

* **List your skills.** Include every relevant program you‚Äôve used (Ex. Salesforce, Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, *any* content management system‚ÄîMailchimp counts) as well as what you have experience in (Ex. Email Copy, Email Marketing Campaigns, Facebook Ads). I‚Äôve seen recruiters on LinkedIn complain that people were leaving these off. If you have Excel skills, list them specifically (I put VLOOKUPS and PIVOT TABLES on mine). When I interviewed with a digital agency, the President was curious and asked me about those skills since I was applying as a writer, and I explained that I wanted to prove I actually *had* those skills, since my resume was mostly writing roles. At the end of the interview, she gave me the position.


**Cover letters matter for small firms.** The smaller the agency, the more likely they‚Äôll read your cover letter. And since you studied communications/marketing, it‚Äôs expected that your letter can demonstrate your written skills and ability to build a convincing pitch. But a Big 4 recruiter (professional services, not tech) once told me that they toss their letters, so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about a compelling CL as much if you‚Äôre applying there.

The core of a strong CL is this: In your opening, identify: What relevant skills and experiences do I bring this company? (Think about: What is the company looking for, and how can I show them I *am* that person?) In 1-2 paragraphs, illustrate 1-2 examples of how you drove results in prior experiences using the STAR method. Then, in your conclusion: how does working in this particular role/at this company help further your professional development? What are you looking to learn? 

I can go deeper into how to write a compelling letter if anyone would like! But at the crux of it, that‚Äôs what it entails.


**Buff up your LinkedIn before reaching out.** Before you even reach out to recruiters, build your network. Add every single person you know on LinkedIn. Recruiters aren‚Äôt going to want to respond to you if you haven‚Äôt fleshed out your experience on your page and have virtually no connections! And summarize every single experience you put on LinkedIn with at least one sentence that starts with an active verb. That being said...


**Do NOT show up to a company with a resume asking for a job.** Why is this advice still being passed around? If this works in other industries, it‚Äôs definitely NOT how marcomms works.  


**When you do reach out, be specific.** When networking, send a message on LinkedIn detailing how you found them, what piqued your interest about their career, what you‚Äôve done so far to advance your own career in that direction. Then suggest a specific date and time (Ex. Monday for a brief 15-min call at 10:30am or 2:30pm) and politely ask for a convo to learn more about their experience. If you‚Äôre job-searching, use the same format, but instead of talking about their career, talk about what piqued your interest about the company + the position that‚Äôs open.


**You might be directionless, but do NOT let onto that.** Do any of us have any idea where we might be in five years? Not really. Or maybe you want a job so badly, you‚Äôll take *any* role. That‚Äôs okay, but *under no circumstances should the recruiter know this*. Your job is to present yourself as an ambitious, driven, hard-working candidate that‚Äôs the absolute perfect fit for the role they‚Äôre trying to fill. Think about it: would you want to date someone who didn‚Äôt know what they wanted? Someone who was willing to date *anyone*?‚ÄîProbably not. 

So sit down and be honest with yourself. Create specific parameters for what you want in a career. This could relate to industry, environment, or function. 

* **Industry:** Does fintech excite you? Sports management? Hospitality? 
* **Environment:** Do you want a workplace that strongly values work-life balance or is fast-paced? A younger company culture or one that‚Äôs more family-oriented? When I applied to my most recent role, I told them I wanted to *advance progressive causes in a fast-paced, data-driven environment*.
* **Function:** Are you really excited about ads, because you love connecting people with the products or services they need most? Client management, because you love working with people and driving results? Let them know! 

And the best part‚Äîwhat you say across different apps can *change.* If you‚Äôre eyeing a Digital Editor role at NPR but also a Marketing Coordinator role at Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods, you can represent yourself as a detail-oriented news-junkie or someone passionate about athletics who has a keen understanding of people who buy tennis rackets. Both can be true‚Äîyou‚Äôre just exploring two paths that interest different parts of who you are.

Good luck, guys. And my DMs are always open if you want any personalized help."
274,"Thankfully, I finally got a job offer from a company and will be working there a few weeks after graduating in May. Besides salary, are there any things I should really consider before accepting this offer?

276,"Hey people of Reddit, has anyone experienced stagnation in their relationship? In terms of building each other up in your careers and/or personal development?  What did you do about it? My boyfriend (25M) says he thought we'd be somewhere better by now (he called it winning in life?) and we have been dating two years (I'm 24F).  


Both recent grads, I have a better job than he does, and the idea was that he'd try and get a new one almost immediately, but its been almost a year already."
277,Also what is your advice for people who major in something only for the money?
278,"I'm turning 19 in a few weeks and I'm also beginning the process of signing a lease on an apartment and moving in. Ideally, it'll be an apartment with either 2 or 3 roommates, but if the price is right we might go with a house or a bigger apartment. I have a few close friends that are most likely going to be my roommates, but all of us are first-time renters so this is a little intimidating. So I have some questions:

- How hard will it be to get approved for a lease? We are all 18/19 and all have full-time or almost full-time jobs (3 of us at the same place). Personally my credit score is 680, which I know is good but not great, but I have less than 6 months of history. Not sure about the others.

- Is $450/mo a reasonable budget for rent on a 1300-1400 income? It roughly follows the 1/3 rule and I've done a rough budget (I will do a real one) and it seems to check out, but barely. I live in a suburban city, and the cost of living isn't super high. But I'm sightly worried I won't have enough for bills. I do have $5k saved in my bank account, and $13.5k in a college fund that I don't want to touch but if shit really hits the fan is available to me.

- What are some red flags in terms of quality of the complex? I won't be living in a penthouse, but it's going to be my home for at least the next year so I don't want to be living in a nightmare.

That's all the questions I have right now, but if you have any other advice or tips I would love to hear them. And if this is a stupid idea and I'm getting ahead of myself, I wanna hear that too."
279,"I didn't start feeling this way especially strongly until towards the end of my senior year. I majored in humanities (foolish of me, I know) because I didn't know what else to do, and for the last semester there I couldn't for the life of me understand why I did it. Even after graduating I still have no idea what to do with my degree. Looking back on it, I wish I'd gone to a school with a good music program and learned to write music, but I haven't tried writing my own music since I was 15 or 16, so I'm not sure if I would've liked it. Sometimes I think I'm just lazy, but then how does that explain my graduating with a 3.84 GPA?

I don't feel like I had the ""authentic college experience"" either. I only lived on campus for two out of the four years I was there, and in both of those years I was sent home early (once because of mental health challenges and the other time because of COVID) and I didn't spend a lot of time socializing or networking. I mostly hung out with the handful of friends that I had or stayed in my room studying, gaming, or watching YouTube. I graduated without ever being in a relationship, and although I don't really care what society thinks about that, I still get lonely and I feel like it's my fault.

I think my biggest problem right now is finding the motivation to do anything. I feel like college completely drained me. I went there because I couldn't think of anything better to do. Now that I'm done with it, I have no idea why I did it. I don't know what to do next because I don't even know what I'm interested in anymore."
280,
281,"I‚Äôve been very glum about graduating and I think what it comes down to is I‚Äôm gonna miss the community. 

Im gonna miss hanging out in the computer lab in my department doing homework and studying with friends from class, going to football games and sweating in the crammed student section, going to all sorts of gatherings and parties for student orgs, meeting new friends all the time.

Where do you find this kind of community feeling outside of school? Adult life in the US seems very lonely."
282,"To start off - I'm piggybacking off a recent post similar to this one.

So I graduated in December and I recently found a  job - hooray! Unfortunately it doesn't pay well enough for me to live on my own, so I'm going to have to stay home for a while until I'm financially capable.  Save save save. No big deal, I guess, but what floors me is how recent college graduates are able to relocate for a job or move out directly after graduating. With rent as high as it is in most places on top of general living expenses, the whole concept is utterly baffling. I know many college graduates are not going to have hefty bank accounts (me included, without question), so I always find it surprising how many are able to do this.

I know of some graduates who moved across the country for a job after graduation - again, that is utterly insane (at least in my opinion). What if the job doesn't work out (for some reason)? I don't know, perhaps I don't have that drive like many other people do?

Is there anyone out there who can explain this a little more to me? Or graduates who have experienced moving out of their parents house directly out of college? Or am I just overthinking  all of this? I guess I'm somewhat afraid of doing all of this - I think I need to take the best foot forward in some cases.

Thanks.."
283,"So, this sounds like a wishful question, I know, but if anybody has any ideas, I'd be glad to bounce around thoughts. 
Basically, for all that I've learned, studied, and am currently capable of -- and so on -- my hometown pretty much has nothing to offer me anymore. 

I'm looking to move, but as a person who is freshly out of college, and is currently just a substitute-teacher, I have little to no income, and was curious for the potential situations and scenarios where I could move on little money. 

If anybody cares about the details, I currently live in Fredericksburg, Virginia and I'm looking to either move to Virginia Beach City or Fairfax County. 
I'm a writer, foreign-languagey, social kind of person, and those jobs/lifestyles seem to be either directly south or north of me, from what I've gathered."
284,"Hey y‚Äôall, 

Just graduated this past spring. Very lucky and blessed to have gotten a good job this past month at a law firm. I love my job, truthfully. I love all the things I‚Äôve learned, I‚Äôve loved my team, I‚Äôve loved the experience I‚Äôm gaining from this job.....but I‚Äôm having a hard time with the schedule. 9am-5pm every day. I‚Äôm lucky to have some flexibility with my schedule, but it‚Äôs been difficult coming home and it immediately being dark outside. It‚Äôs hard coming home and most of the day is over. It‚Äôs hard getting off work, and if I have errands to run/chores to do/dinner to cook, I don‚Äôt usually get to settle in until 7pm or later. 

Before my job, I was the person who spent my days doing yoga, painting, journaling, skating, dancing...now I just feel so exhausted after my day. I hate that I spent 8 hours sitting on my butt and don‚Äôt have any time to move around or go out in nature.

I know it‚Äôll take a while to adjust, but tonight it just hit especially hard. I was wondering how others have dealt with this, or if you have any advice. 

Thanks in advance, stay safe out there everyone!"

Go to college: have more time, but not much money.

Get a job: have more money, but not much time."
287,"Graduated school in May and was fortunate to have an incredible job in my field after graduation right near school to start afterwards. Moved into a new apartment with my girlfriend after graduation and I just got hit hard with depression. I‚Äôve never had extreme mental illness before; but struggled with social anxiety and what I guess would be separation anxiety from my family around sophomore year. 

It‚Äôs now been roughly 6 months since graduation and I‚Äôve visited my parents/family maybe 8 or 9 times since then, from holidays and family dinners and what not, and they have visited me maybe twice (just timing of things, not an uneven appreciation or anything). Every time I leave, and I mean *every* time, I breakdown. Crying, hyperventilating, extreme thoughts of quitting my job but with no plan; the works. I just don‚Äôt want to go back to work. I hate that I have to work basically my whole life and that I can‚Äôt spend enough time with my family or loved ones. I don‚Äôt want to leave them. I‚Äôm 4 hours from them by car or train and the distance just makes that hard. 

I don‚Äôt think I can really move closer to them because my girlfriend has her job and is preparing for med school in the next year or two and moving to my parents would love her away from hers (they‚Äôre about 45 minutes from us). 

I leave today with the holidays ending and I just don‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs so hard. I get used to being away after a few days, but the first 2 days or so after leaving can be utterly dreadful. I was like this in college, but it seemed so much easier and less extreme in retrospect.

Edit: and yes. I do see a therapist about this. I don‚Äôt really think it helps a lot. I talk like 90% of the time and don‚Äôt really get anything meaningful from her that often tbh"
288,"It took me 23 years, but I finally get it. I finally get it why all dads scream ""don't touch the thermostat"". It's only been ~6 months that I pay for electricity myself as I previously lived with my parents, in dorms, or with friends where we somehow didn't have to think about electricity costs. 

Well, in April I got my electric bill for Feb and March, and was horrified to see that I somehow spent 1.2 MW, and had to pay 190 CAD for electricity. I didn't really think about it, paid the bill and moved on with my life. 

Yesterday I got the bill for April and May, and would you look at that: that shit was *just* 60 CAD and only 300 KW of energy used! Immediately I started thinking: ""wtf, I literally changed nothing?""

No, I did change one thing: I didn't turn on the electric space heater in the living room even once during that period. 

I quartered my electricity consumption! Holy crap, that's so much money saved on basically nothing!

So, now that I know what a meme electric furnaces are, my plan for the next winter are as follows:
1. Don't turn on the heater.
2. Drink a lot of tea.
3. Get a thermos to keep a bunch of hot water for more tea on hand.
4. Get comfortable sweaters and warm blankets to wrap myself in when it gets particularly cold.

No longer shall I touch the thermostat! I shall ""abuse"" the fact that Vancouver doesn't get particularly cold! I will now get to enjoy great tea even more! 

TL;DR: Electric heaters are expensive, making tea and wrapping yourself in a blanket is far more economical.

Edit: a spelling error that changed meaning has now been fixed."
289,"I'll keep this as brief as possible and give a general summary of where I'm at now. Most of my friends are still in undergrad/graduate school, so there is simply no one I can share this with.

I graduated May 2019 with a B.S. in Economics. No internships. I know, before I get yet another arrogant, snarky remark of how inferior my degree is without internship experience and how I'll be ""drinking mop water for the next 2 years"" as a user eloquently puts it, I'm fully aware I royally messed up by never obtaining one. Didn't think they were hugely important and figured my general work experience would have sufficed. I worked at a single job for 6 years, all throughout high school and most of college.

I have done the following:

* I have neurotically changed my resume/cover letter about 50 times over the course of 8 months. I have had plenty of people critique it and give me good pointers.
* I have applied to nearly 250 positions, tailoring my application package to every.single.posting.
* Tried to network on LinkedIn and at my old school by reaching out to old colleagues. Of course, they all said ""Hm, there is nothing here yet, but I'll keep your name in the hat!""
* I attended a batch of job fairs - 99% of the companies told me to apply online. Very impersonal, with the exception of insurance companies..
* I check my email regularly and bleed job boards dry. The only bites I get (most of the time, out of the blue) are from MLM's with hilariously awful grammar.

I managed to get hired at a firm (I only got this because they were bulk hiring) right before ""you know what"" spiraled out of control - I have yet to start training. I filled out all of the paperwork, did a background check, drug screen, etc. It has been three weeks and I still haven't heard anything. I tried reaching out to them just to touch basis, and no one has contacted me about the current status. If this doesn't work out......yeah I'm going to be in bad shape.

It looks like I'll have to seek temp work if this job doesn't work out, but with an imminent recession (possible depression?) in the air I'm absolutely terrified. It physically pains me knowing I have spent so long job searching and one of my friends just recently moved into a nice townhouse with his SO. I **STILL** have absolutely no idea whether or not I have this job because no one has answered my emails or calls. I'm very thankful I have a roof over my head, loving and supportive parents, but this whole process is killing me.

I've had probably 14 phone screens and 7 in-person interviews, yet somehow they all went absolutely nowhere. I'll admit I get nervous during interviews, but why is that such an issue for employers? When I say nowhere, I mean literally nowhere, as some have purposely ""ghosted"" me. I know this is common, but once you've established some form of communication, it just makes my blood boil.

At this point I'm so mentally exhausted from dealing with employers and recruiters, being egged on by so many people and have nothing to show for. I never thought my first year after post-grad would be this disastrous, but I'm all out of options. I'm absolutely broken, I can't get out of this funk, I'm sick of dealing with smug recruiters, picky employers, and everything else.

Would temp agencies be the best (only) option for me at this point?"
290,"I know they are just movies, but these movies helped me adjust and understand that its okay to move on and that you are not alone.

291,"I graduated from FIU with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in May, since then I've been job searching. Computer Engineering, as a degree program, is an interesting one. You learn electrical shit, embedded shit, and programming shit, but not enough to actually get a career in any of those things. Honestly I wish I could just go back in time and pursue SWE. I've been looking for positions as a c++ developer because it was one of the few things I learned that I could actually turn into a career. It's November and I have to accept the fact that I have no chance of getting any kind of job. I didn't know enough as a student to get an internship and I don't have enough experience to get an entry level position now. I have a few small projects on my resume and I'm working on one now, but I can't compete with people with several internships who have made entire games from scratch. There is no way for me to construct a career out of my education.

I can't throw out everything I know and start over with a more popular language because that won't get me any hireable experience. I can't got to grad school because that would require putting up with school again. 

How do I deal with being completely unhireable?"
292,"I was always really excited to start working. I thought it would feel more meaningful and engaging than school, but so far that hasn't been the case. I wanted to work for a nonprofit and help people in some way, but all the jobs I find are just pushing paper type roles. Now when I look at job boards I just feel dread. I don't want to work anymore. I don't understand how other people find jobs they find meaningful or how a job can become part of your identity or a major goal for you. I guess I'm very much a work to live kind of person, but I would like to have a job I can enjoy that doesn't just feel like a big waste of 40 hours a week of my time. I can't believe people structure their whole lives around work, move away just for work, become their work."
293,"Hi friends,
Long story short, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of undesirable changes in my work ethic after college. In college, I‚Äôd start studying/ class around 9 AM, and stop around 2 AM or 3 AM. I would feel fine, never burned out, graduated with highest honors from a top 10 school with engineering major, and had the energy for friends and going out every so often.

Now, on some days, my game plan is to get up around 6, study for mcat from 6:30 -8 am, work officially from 8:30-6:30, then study for mcat from 7:30-12. Should be pretty doable compared to my college schedule. However, instead I generally wake up around 8:30 am; work from 9:30-4 PM, eat for 1 hour, spontaneously fall asleep/ pass out in my car or on my couch at 6 pm after getting tired from overeating, and then proceeding to sleep from 6 pm-8:30 am. On weekends, I wake up to eat breakfast, and then get tired from eating and sleep all day. It‚Äôs bizarre.

So basically, I have no motivation to do anything, despite their importance. I have gone from consistently sleeping 3-6 hours and feeling great to sleeping for more than 12 hours and feeling terrible. I don‚Äôt have ~any~ friends. I never go to the gym, even though in college I‚Äôd go at least once a week. I don‚Äôt do anything other than study or work. I barely even shower, because I get too tired in the evening and can‚Äôt wake up in the morning to save my life. As a result, I hate my life. 

I was wondering if anyone had tips to get out of such a rut."
294,"I feel like I have no idea or clue what to do at 26. I felt lost at 18. But excited that in college, I would figure it out. Graduated at 22. But now at 26, I am clueless. Not to mention, this pandemic had ruined any chance of upward momentum and mobility.

What to do?"
295,"I hear people all the time saying how tough it is to have a social life after school and it REALLY REALLY is! I was frustrated, gave up, and said fuck it who needs friends? That got me nowhere and just made it worse. The key is you have to put in the effort with strangers or else people will be gone and you'll never see them again. You have to initiate and get stuff going. You can't just sit back and hope something happens. That's the problem with most people, they typically don't want to put in the effort.

I get it, relationships take time but you have to start somewhere. Once you break the ice it's not so bad. Most people are followers and will join if you do the work or have the ideas for fun activities. You have to be the leader. It kinda sucks but that's what I learned. Even if you don't care about the person or they don't care about you  initiating a conversation is better than nothing. So I urge you to talk to as many people as you can!"
296,"I was hired at a manufacturing company right after college and have worked there for over two years now. I entered the company as an entry level engineer and ended up filling a void in the quality department. I didnt mind that for a while but felt like I needed a change after 7 months since I couldnt see myself doing that for many years. At that time, a different engineering related position opened in which I applied and got the job. I did that for about 9 months. I eventually felt the need to do something different, yet again, since I wasn't feeling satisfied with the work. In that role I felt that leadership was lacking and that there wasn't much structure to my job. I applied for another position in the automation department that was open. I'm currently in that role and have been there for 11 months. I now feel the need for change again. It's hard to pinpoint the cause of my dissatisfaction with all of these different roles but I feel like I need more out of my work and career. In my current position, I don't feel like there is much structure or maybe as much leadership as I would like. I also don't feel as if Im truly working as part of a team. Maybe I just dont feel like I have been given good enough direction. Maybe I'm simply not good enough at my job yet to where I feel like I can be effective and confidently give value. My personal life could be affecting this as well since I moved to this city to work at this company, I'm living alone, and don't have a real close network of friends in close proximity. I often visit good friends only on weekends. 

One of my theories for constantly wanting to move on is that I'm leaving the ""honeymoon"" phase of these new positions. From that, a question arises. Do I push past and stick with the role to hopefully gain fullfillment out of it or is there a good chance that me and the company/these positions are simply not a good fit and I should move on? If there are recommendations to push through and hopefully get re-engaged with the work, what is good advice to do so? I currently feel stuck and regularly don't want to go to work in the morning. I can't live my life like that."
297,"Today was the last time I was together with all my teachers and class mates.
Other people would be happy about it, that they can start to work now. 
I am a other kind of person, I hate to get used to something new, I hate that it's needed to get used to all the new stuff I will have to do. 

My friends were my only motivation to stand up for the school everyday, because I'll meet them and every second I share with them isn't wasted.
But now it'll be different, I won't see them anymore, there won't be a real motivation to stand up except the money I will earn.
But even the money is worth nothing if I will fall back into the hole I fall already a few years ago. 
The way out of hole were my friends, they made me laugh and they also made me feeling better. 

I am really afraid that our friendship will break up and that every social contact I had will just pass away. And that I won't be able to find new friends or people I like because it's really hard for me to get used to someone and I'm also that that kind of people who just can get into a conversation with someone 
I'm this kind of person who's just somewhere in the background.




I will work as a electrican in a small company. 
This isn't my dream job. 
I had to choose this, because I wasted to much time to send my applications to Jobs I really want to work as.

298,"But I am so overwhelmed by all these changes. I got a great job in the creative field which directly applies to my degree and my passion, I have benefits and PTO for the first time in my life, and I can actually afford stuff. I have a partner I love who is moving in with me, and we plan to spend the rest of our life together. Great stuff, right?

But I am having a hard time coming to terms with the fact I have rocketed into the next stage of my life, and it is a point of no return. I still feel like I'm 18 but I'm not. I'm 26. I feel like I mentally don't want to let go of the age 18 while my body continues to age without me. It feels like my life is going faster and faster with every year and the mortality of that is humbling to say the least. I get overwhelmed by the idea that I might not have all the time in the world to do everything I want with how fast time is now moving. How am I going to squeeze everything in? Why does time have to move so fast?

 Does anyone else feel the same way? How do you cope with this?"
299,"This is just some general advice about college versus exploring other career options that do not require a college degree.I am definitely not criticizing people who go to college, all the power to you especially if your chosen career requires it!! I just think it‚Äôs important to remember you can be successful without a college degree. There are many paths to success, and this is mine.

When I graduated high school last year around this time, I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what I wanted to do but I knew for sure that I did not want to go to college and accrue a massive amount of debt unless I was absolutely sure whatever schooling I might get would almost positively ensure a good job to pay that off and was absolutely something I would be passionate about/enjoy. My mom has a massive amount of debt still from when she graduated college in 1999 and at this point she‚Äôll probably never get to fully retire because of it. After her experience with college I did not want to immediately jump on the 4 year degree band wagon unless I explored some other options first.

I decided to explore stuff that interested me, first sustainable agriculture. I tried to get into a few internships but they didn‚Äôt wind up working out and it takes a lot of work to just be somewhat successful in agriculture so I decided to check out massage therapy. Before checking out programs near me I knew from doing research that massage therapists are in high demand in my area, the job future looked overall very bright as more people are turning to alternative medicine. I also knew the average pay is great‚Äîeven incredible depending on what avenue of massage therapy you might specialize in. I also knew I would probably enjoy helping people and I‚Äôve always had an interest in holistic health. So I toured the school near me, their 8 month program was only going to cost 16,000. Another huge bonus!! I loved what I saw of the program and the teachers I met and signed up that day. Best decision I‚Äôve ever made.

I have since finished the program, I knew I was going to probably like massage therapy but I LOVE it now. It absolutely my passion and I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing anything else. One week after finishing the program I had FOUR interviews lined up, and I was barely even trying to find a job. I now have a wonderful job at an amazing spa and I‚Äôm gonna start saving up for my first car and hopefully by the end of this year I have a tentative goal to move out of my parents house. I have no school debt thanks to my grandmother‚Äôs small college fund that covered most of my schooling, and I have a job that I love. All thanks to just doing a little research and exploring a few other options before going straight to a regular college.

College is a fantastic option for MANY people out there, but just remember it is not the only option. Now good luck to all you high school graduates out there this year!! You got this, play it smart, do research, and figure out your life, your passions, and your interests a little before you set your course into the next part of your adventure in life and trust me you‚Äôll probably be a lot better off."
300,I of my goals is to start dating in 2021. 1 problem though. I'm 27 and never dated before. I have no friends and few family. All I do is work study and go home. I'm iffy on online dating. How do I start dating this upcoming year?!?!
301,"Hiya, i'm a 22 year old guy. I just graduated from college in June, i studied math and computer science. I've always been like, an achiever, i got good grades in high school, got into a top college, did well in college yada yada yada. Being an achiever was nice! i loved school, i loved learning, and I loved growing as a person though it all. I was very social in college while also really enjoying my coursework.

After college I got a job at a Data analyst and its,,, fine. Like it's just so fine and i don't care about it at all. In fact it feels like after 2 decades of trying and trying and trying at school and excelling constantly, i don't have it in me to care about my career. I think part of this is climate change, hard to care about your career when you think society might collapse in 10-20 years. And part is the pandemic of course. But I'm just struggling. I love my coworkers and my work is enjoyable at a basic level, you know i like the mechanics of coding and such. 

But i guess the key problem i'm getting at is that I feel like i've lost all my ambition. I don't care about excellence anymore the way I used to. Part of me thinks this is a good thing. Develop some new interests and dont just focus on your career but it seems like life after school is all career and I just don't really want it. After so long in a rigidly organized system with clear goals and demands i just don't have and f‚Ä¢cks left to give

If anyone has any advice on how to find new passions, get excited about life or anything I'd really appreciate it. I feel like i'm floating through my life with no direction or goal and I want to feel like my life has purpose."
302,"Im an unemployed 2020 college graduate that's living at home with his parents right now. All I do in my free time is apply to jobs and go out and exercise for 2 hours a day. Yet I still get 7-9 hours of looking at a screen. I feel like it damages my eyes, but do I have any other way to avoid this?"
303,"I'm (22F) about to start working on my masterthesis soon and I plan on finishing it around november this year. I have a bachelor degree in art history and I'm currently doing a master's about cultural policy. Until recently I was very positive about graduating at the end of the year and starting a job. I really wanted to get a job at a film festival or at the art house theatre in my city. Maybe a job related to education or film programming. Something like that...

Then corona/covid-19 came along...

Seems like a recession is inevitable at this point. Culture always gets a hard hit when that happens. A few day ago I read in the newspaper that most cultural institutions will get into trouble around november if this situation persists. But even if it does get better, cultural institutions will have to make cuts.

At the moment I'm not that positive anymore about graduating and finding a job. The uncertainty we live in right now is really scary to me. I believe I have a good resume, that's one thing that I got going for me, but apart from that I'm quite nervous.

Anyone else who feels the same?"
304,"I recently started my first big boy job (after almost 2 years of job hunting). It‚Äôs a good gig, way better than any of the retail and service jobs I worked in the decade before this. I make a salary that can be described as middle class, bennies and all that, and I work from home and have a great deal a autonomy. 

It‚Äôs all very strange to me, however, since the work I do is incredibly simple. I‚Äôm basically creating, signing, organizing, and re organizing PDFs all day. And then filling out paperwork about the paperwork, and checking off boxes about checking off the boxes. And then I have a couple zoom calls with coworkers where we chit chat for half an hour. And then I have a whole lot of free time to do my own thing, like personal life admin tasks and laundry.

All I keep thinking is. Why the hell am I being paid twice as much as I ever made working my ass off in kitchens, to sit around pushing paper for 20 hours a week in between errands and chores at my house? Which, by the way, are bullshit regulatory documents that literally nobody is ever going to read. And I think everyone else in my department is equally chilling most of the time. But all of us *had* to have a college degree to get to this position??

All I can think of is ‚Ä¶ is this what the ‚Äúprofessional world‚Äù is? Is this what the middle class is? A college degree is just an arbitrary line in the sand where once you pay a bunch of money for it, you‚Äôre suddenly granted a comfortable salary to do mostly nothing? 

Is this really what the adult (corporate) world is? Is it all really bullshit and nothing matters? 

I feel an incredible amount of guilt about all this, too. There are people doing far more important work (teachers in particular) and are paid less to work longer and harder hours. Same thing for low-wage workers in restaurants, stores, etc who are literally keeping our society running. 

These are mostly rhetorical ramblings. One distinct question I do have, however, is: is it just an unspoken rule that folks who work from home are just chillin or doing personal chores 30% of the time? If so, why is this unspoken and why isn‚Äôt anyone talking about it? Or, is this atypical and wrong and am I taking advantage of my company?

EDIT: I wanted to come back and check in a month later. Turns out I was in some sort of just-hired honeymoon phase. My job and work schedule is nothing at all how I described above. Now I am swamped with projects and am regularly working 50 hour weeks to try to get everything done on time. I'm discovering that being ""salaried"" is actually a scam. The ""40 hours"" a week is actually a *minimum*. I have to work until the work is done, but I do not get paid for time I work beyond 40 hours, effectively lowering my wage. Not only do I not have that free time during the work day I describe above, but I also am losing a lot of my personal time to work and not getting paid for it."
305,"I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôve been out of college for about 4 months now and still currently unemployed. Due to the pandemic, I moved back to my parents‚Äô house. That sums up my situation atm. Now to my mental situation. 

I feel like I was a sim in The Sims 4 and somehow the player forgot to select aspirations for my life. I don‚Äôt know what I want. I don‚Äôt even want anything. I know I should get a job but I don‚Äôt even want to send out my resume. I don‚Äôt have a list of things I want to accomplish in the future. I don‚Äôt even have a dream. People (at least those I know), some has a very clear plan for their lives, milestones they want to reach. The others also have something they wish for for example love, wealth, family, an excellent career, a wonderful partner, or well, even just beauty.  At least they want something. I just don‚Äôt. For the last couples of months. It feels like if my life somehow ended here I would have nothing to regret. I can‚Äôt picture myself in any of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù future, say I have a comfortable life and think ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs good. I want to be like that‚Äù

I guess my only ‚Äúwant‚Äù atm is to get out of my parents house asap. Although I love them more than me living with them is sucking me out of any little joy I may have these days. And to do so, I gotta get a job. So yeah that‚Äôs that. But after that, I don‚Äôt know anymore. 

So my question is as the title said how do people find their aspirations, how do they go on without having one? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm living. Just surviving. And that‚Äôs as good as death for me figuratively. Having said that, don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt do anything stupid. I love my family. I‚Äôm well aware of the consequence and I won‚Äôt make them go through that. But yeah, really, I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life now."
306,"I'll admit I'm bored, I'm lacking energy, desire, that fire I used to have when I was younger. For some reason I just don't  feel like I used to anymore. I used to see the future so bright, now I dread every moment that goes by. I see kids younger than me having so much fun and wonder what happened to that person in me? Is the real world really sucking the life out of me? Is this really life? This can't be it."
307,I‚Äôve read some mixed reviews about Cornell‚Äôs online certificate programs and wanted to see what your opinions were. Currently dabbling with the idea of doing the Marketing program.
308,"I‚Äôm seeing all of these posts online of freshmen going to orientation and moving in and I‚Äôm kinda sad that I can‚Äôt get to relive undergrad. I just graduated in May and a bunch of people around me either have been saying that I‚Äôm lucky to be out of school or that they can‚Äôt wait to graduate, but honestly I enjoyed school and will miss it. From hanging out with friends who are within walking distance, to mid-day naps, to sporting events and clubs that I was a part of, to parties, college was amazing. Work has been alright, but it‚Äôs kinda hard to make new friends here, especially since there‚Äôs fewer young people. I kinda just feel like going back to grad school in a couple of years just to be a student again and maybe try to relive some more of undergrad and not have to face ‚Äúadulthood‚Äù. This has been on my mind a lot recently and has had me really down in the dumps. I know these types of posts are prevalent on this subreddit already but I just wanted to ask you all how you decided to cope with graduating. How do I get my mind off of the past and onto the future? And how do I make new friends at work when most everyone around me is way older and there are little to no new hires besides me?"
309,"I‚Äôm posting on behalf of my boyfriend who just graduated a few days ago with a degree in psych and a double minor in chem and general science. He never interned anywhere in his field and worked part time as a waiter every summer and throughout his four years in university to earn money. He currently works full time at a restaurant as a server to earn money, but he‚Äôs becoming a bit depressed about the lack of job prospects in his field and his lack of experience. I‚Äôve told him to try and do unpaid internships on the side just so he can get some experience but he‚Äôs living paycheck to paycheck and the idea of working an additional job for no pay isn‚Äôt appealing to him. What can he do to get a job he loves that pays better than serving? He‚Äôd love to work in his field."
310,"One year ago I graduated from my university with a stellar gpa, multiple job offers, and a great friend group. Most of my close friends moved to Charlotte. Coincidentally that‚Äôs also the job I was applying for was located in. I got the job offer and was told I didn‚Äôt get it in charlotte but could take it if it was in a small city in a different state. I accepted, it was one of my dream careers and I figured that wasn‚Äôt worth letting up on.

And so I moved. And found out that I‚Äôm the youngest person in the office by over 20 years. Because of that I can‚Äôt make work friends. Sure I‚Äôm friendly with my coworkers, but it‚Äôs not exactly a ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs go hiking this weekend or hit up the bars one night‚Äù when everyone else is middle aged with kids in high school or college. 

The city itself it dying with most people and business fleeing it in droves and most of the population remaining being retirees. I‚Äôve tried going to churches, clubs, and other organizations and I haven‚Äôt made a single friend. I‚Äôve kept up with my college friends though group chat but they‚Äôre all a state away. I‚Äôve even visited the Charlotte office for the job I received and it has 5 new college hires who are all super close

I know it‚Äôs not healthy but I can‚Äôt help but think how much better my life would‚Äôve been had I either gotten the job in Charlotte or taken another job. 

I legitimately enjoy the work I do. But what good is it when you have no social life, exactly zero friends (not for lack of trying to connect), and sacrificed just about everything you had to put yourself in this position.

Moral of the story. When choosing a job after college make damn sure it‚Äôs somewhere you want to live. Even if it‚Äôs the job you want. Cause if not you‚Äôll end up with a job you enjoy and a life you don‚Äôt üò™"

312,"So it's 2AM rn and it's that time of the month to feel like shit and remember how I didn't take full advantage of everything college provided. I'm 23M, i graduated with a great degree and I have a well-paying job. 
In college, i spent most of my time studying and playing video-games. When I did go out, all I did was go grab a bite with some friends and only rarely did I do actual fun stuff.
I've never been to a football game (and I went to a big football school), I went to a party only once and went to bars maybe like 5 times total. I remember feeling like I never belonged to the ""community"" and always felt like an outcast.

For some reason, it's been 2 years and I still feel that regret. When I see people starting college now, I envy them and wish I could have another go. 
Life after college is very bland most of the time. Wake-up, work, work-out, relax, repeat...college felt much more ""dynamic"". There was stuff happening all the time and the future seemed exciting and unknown unlike now.

Anyway, thought I would vent for a bit. Would love to hear your college regrets. Peace."
313,"does anyone ever like they have 0 interests and just lack any unique skills? i feel like after i graduated i lost any motivation to explore new things. i was pretty involved on campus and willing to try almost anything, and now i feel like i have nothing. almost all my friends have some unique thing (art, outdoorsy stuff, running, etc) but i feel like i‚Äôm just going through the motions. i get up, go to work, do a half assed workout and go to bed. rinse and repeat. and too afraid to fail to try anything new. i feel boring, but i know i‚Äôm not!! any advice to help get over this? any activities that some of your found in postgrad that you love? i want to find my niche again.

edit: WOW!! thanks for all the suggestions - hearing all of your journeys really inspired me to pursue some budding interests that I didn't have the courage to jump on, no harm in trying. post grad is tough."
314,"I keep getting told by adults that this is the path that most people take if you want to make money and be safe. To me there's nothing more discouraging than to hear that.  It's not that I dislike office jobs, I just don't want that to be my only option but the adults I talk seem to think so. I'm the type of person that doesn't want to be like everyone else and this is more motivation to not join that corporate life. I don't care about the money and if it means not joining the pack then I have no problem avoiding it. I'm really trying to find what I want to do, not live some typical average life."
315,"I am a finance major in Charlotte (good place to be that), and I have one more semester before I graduate. I won‚Äôt go into specifics, but the way my college experience was paced, I didn‚Äôt retain any information. I felt like I blew right through it. On top of that, when I speak to friends that graduated before me, I get lots of technical talk about things related to their job, and sometimes I get lost.

I‚Äôm afraid that I wasted my money, or that I won‚Äôt do well in any job because of incompetence. Can anyone here relate to my experience? Can anyone tell me if/how I can get over that feeling?"
316,"I graduated approaching 2 years ago now.I have a lot going for me. My own place (one bedroom apartment), i have a stable job (even if i want to break into a new field) live in a nice location, have friends, etc... But it just feels kinda... I dunno. Day by day i guess? Rote? I don't have a lot to look forward to, to plan for or work on. For school, it was always just graduate graduate graduate. Elementary, middle, high and finally, college. Now though? I dunno what to do I guess. Anyone feel similar?"

318,"Hey guys,

As a recent graduate, I found it incredibly important to actually do something with my own time. This way, I discovered how incredibly important it is to actually have hobbies. One of my hobbies became making YouTube videos - as a combination for my love of writing and sharing my personal knowledge and experience, no matter how unimportant it may seem to me. 

So, while I am incredibly sorry for the blatant self promotion, feel free to check out my most recent video on the topic of the necessity of hobbies: https://youtu.be/FZz2LNOPRPg

One thing I would like to quickly say - I would not share my video here if I didn't actually believe that the people here would find it useful. So, I am very open to feedback and would absolutely love to learn where else I can share my work to try and help even more people :)

319,"In elementary school, everyone cares

In middle school, everyone is judgmental but they care

In high school, ya‚Äôll get into separate groups but your group cares

In college, people in your major and your professors care 

In the real world, nobody cares and you are no one to anyone and someone to no one

How do y‚Äôall cope"
320,"So, background: in my country you can enter a government job by taking a test. I took one in the last year of college and entered a low paying job. I just completed 3 months there. But I can't stop looking for more tests to take. They have costs, including travel (many are in other cities), so I begun to wonder if I'm taking this way too fast. I'm 23 btw"
321,"I'm 24 and graduated a few years ago with a computer science degree. I work for a large tech company and make a very good paycheck (probably more than a doctor, I know I should just feel fortunate and stop complaining). But my heart's not really there. I don't feel like I'm helping anyone with this job and frankly get excluded from things at work a lot due to how competitive our company is (and the fact that I'm extremely quiet). My manager's pressuring me often to speak up but I feel like I have nothing useful at all to contribute. I like writing, taking time to really think about and digest things, and helping people and I feel like nothing with this role really relates to that. I've dreamed of being a teacher or doctor but am afraid of financial impacts and student loans. Any advice?"
322,"It would be nice to have our lives go how we want but it doesn't work like that. My guess is that most people here wonder when they're gonna find their purpose, when they'll have kids, when they'll get married, when they'll buy a house, when they'll become financially stable,etc. Those are probably the main things people are worried about right now. If we knew when all those things would occur I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't be panicking.

I think people are panicking because they want answers now. In reality, you're probably not going to be who you want to be until you're a lot older. Seeing yourself at 35,45, 55 when it all finally comes together scares the shit out of you because you think that's old and too far ahead. Makes sense though, I mean how many 25-35 year olds actually have their shit together? Unless you're a celebrity probably not many. I think most of us need to slow down, take a deep breath, and realize you got time. Just live and be ok with uncertainty."
323,"You want to get a job so you can learn new things, but the only jobs you can be hired for are the same job you already have.  You find a job that you have maybe half of the skills for and the rest are ones you know you could learn, but they don't hire you because you've never done it, therefore you can't do it.  The assumption being that you couldn't learn it and are incapable.  And, because you don't get the chance to learn it, you never get the skill in the first place!  It just beats you down over time and makes you second guess your ability to grow and learn new things.  It's making me feel like I'm crazy.   How am I supposed to grow a fucking career when I'm constantly denied the opportunity to learn new skills???

Yes, my career is completely stagnant.  Stuck at a dead-end job; will be doing the same exact thing 20 years from now if I don't find something else.  Needed a moment to vent.  If you have any advice and breaking this cycle, I'm open."

325,"Hey everyone, newbie to the sub here, and I just wanted to thank you all for being so open with your feelings and experiences. I graduated university in May of 2018, and this past year has honestly been one of the most challenging years mentally for me ever. I was definitely experiencing post-grad depression, but I had no idea that that was such a phenomenon with people in our situations. 

Between seeing peers already getting married and having children, along with people who already had jobs in their career field lined up to start as soon as we graduated, I was definitely having one of those ""Am I the only one?"" moments where it seemed like I was the only one in my circle that isn't on the typical ""life path"" that everyone else already seemed to be on. Having much older parents, living in an extremely rural area, and being eternally single really brought on a quarter-life crisis that I wasn't expecting at all. 

However, being able to see that there are other people going through these kind of lost situations alongside me has honestly helped a lot. Over the past month or so, I've really been able to turn my existential fear of the future into an acceptance that not everyone has every single detail planned out **and that's ok.** It's ok that some of us aren't in our dream job living on our own or with a significant other yet. As corny as it sounds, everyone's journey truly is different, so we shouldn't be ashamed that we're not where we want to be yet, and I really have all of your stories to thank for helping me realize that, truly. 

**So tl;dr, thank you all for sharing your experiences. It's nice having others to relate to :)**

*Also, if anyone has any job recommendations for someone in the Public Relations field, I'm definitely open!*"
326,How will I remember anything from what I learned from high school to pick back up to where I am?

328,"Hello all,

I am American but my mom immigrated from Ireland so I am currently in the process of getting duel citizenship. I have spent a lot of time in Europe throughout my life, and I love it. More than anything I want to live there after I graduate from university this May. The only problem is I know it is difficult to even get a job a few states away in the U.S., never mind a different country. I know my college degree won't hold as much value in another country, so I am worried about being able to find work. Ideally my dream would be to live in Berlin, Germany, or anywhere in Ireland. Also open to England. I am wondering if anyone has ever accomplished this, or how you even go about doing so? Do you simply try to contact head hunters for companies, or? If it helps I will be receiving a degree in Environmental Science.

Thank you :)"
329,"I found a job doing data entry three months after graduating which is decent. However, I can‚Äôt stand they pay. I only make $13 an hour and it‚Äôs honestly pissing me off since I failed to negotiate my pay. I plan on looking for a new job after six months. I‚Äôm trying to learn new skills in the meantime and meet my current job‚Äôs goals to make my resume look decent. So what about you guys?"
330,"Maybe this is just me but I'm no science guy. 

I attended + graduated from college at an older age (28) and found that around 23-24 (which is when I started college), I fumbled a LOT mentally. I had a really great customer service-related job that required me to be ""on"" at all times but I made really stupid mistakes relating to memory and frankly common sense. I also noticed this spilling over to my schoolwork, too. Maybe this is just a fact of aging but...at 24? I'm highly suspect that happens this early?

**tldr** I noticed that I wasn't as sharp as I was at 19-22 (ie traditional college ages) when I turned 24 onwards."
331,"I've got about a year left in college and I don't want to go back and live with my dad after graduation, because I don't get along well with him. My mom is moving out of the state before I graduate. I have a boyfriend but he doesn't seem too excited about us living together immediately after graduation because of potential financial struggles. I've been thinking of going full time with work and rooming somewhere with a few friends after graduation.

334,"I am a senior in college, about to finish my fall semester and recently, I've been feeling so incredibly sad about this chapter of my life ending. I dealt with a lot of stress and anxiety during the first two years of college due to my major and the overwhelming pressure to succeed. I finally got past that around a year and a half ago and ever since then, I've been happier than ever before. I am loving every aspect of my life, from my friends, to my family, to my grades, and everything in between. The crazy thing is that I was so incredibly upset for this same reason when I was a senior in high school. I would cry every single day about leaving my family and having to make new friends when I was already so happy with where I was in my life. I got past this because I would constantly tell myself that college would be the best four years of my life and that I had so much to look forward to. Well now that I am feeling this way again, I don't know how to get past it. I don't feel like I have very much to look forward to after college. It's not that I'm not excited for my future, but I simply cannot imagine things getting any better than they are for me now. I live in a house with my friends and I'm so incredibly happy with how everything is right now. I can't imagine not waking up to my friends every morning and having to move out of the college town only to make all new friends and start a whole new life when things are finally going so well for me. This has been killing me recently and I just want to know if anyone has any advice for me."
335,"Here's the full story:  graduated college May 2019. Applied for a job in July, landed an interview, didn't pass their computer test, didn't land the job. At this point I was supposed to move across the country with my mother that August, so my mother and I agreed it made more sense for me to stop looking for jobs until we were moved. I decided to devote my time to studying for the MCAT. (I was pre-med at the time.)

My mother's job was supposed to transfer her to the new location that month, but the transfer did not happen. Late September/early October, I started to apply for jobs again but never got any calls back. I also started learning Dutch and Portuguese. Around Thanksgiving, we finally got word that my mother got transferred to the new office and was scheduled to begin in January. December was devoted entirely to packing.

At the beginning of January, we moved, my mother started in the new location, and my family and I had to live in a motel until we got an apartment. Once we got an apartment, I had to fly back to our home state in order to be there for the moving truck we hired. By the time all of this was said and done it was the end of January. Around this time, I started applying for jobs again and taking 2 business classes online so that my student loans would stay in deferment.

I dropped the classes in April because when quarantine started, the government put federal loans in deferment until the end of September. That means I do not have a transcript to show for it if my job asks, unfortunately. (Are they likely to?) 

My point in telling this backstory is, how do I spin this story in a way that will portray me in a positive light when the interviewers ask me why I have been unemployed for a year? I was thinking of just telling them I spent the year building skills."

337,"I feel like when I was in school I was able to spend eight hours at school, two hours doing extra curriculars, a couple hours doing homework, chores, and found time to chill with friends some weekends. 

Now? I work for eight hours, come home and just barely have enough energy to walk the dog, get a chore or two done, and then collapse and zone out until it‚Äôs time to go to bed. 

How do I increase my productivity day to day outside of work? I want to be able to study for some certifications and work on writing a book and maybe fit in some more exercise. Feasibly I should have enough time to do at least two a day, but I feel like I barely accomplish a little work on two a week."
338,"Original Post Here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/comments/dfgew6/starting_to_second_guess_my_move_to_hong_kong/?ref=share&ref_source=link

So I guess this is sort of an update post to the post I made above. Despite most people leaning more towards leaving being the better option, I decided to stick it out. Although the protests have very much still been a thing the past few months (and things got really bad for a stretch in November), overall it hasn't ended up affecting my life as much as expected. There was one time where the protests got pretty intense near my office/home (and can share an interesting picture if anyone would care to see), but other than that time not so much. I sort of got used to things and wasn't so constantly stressed out about day to day life.

Enter the Coronavirus. Now once again I'm really starting to second guess things, but this time I feel like it's even more pressing. Obviously the issue is mostly affecting mainland China, there have been confirmed cases & deaths here in Hong Kong. And since the government hasn't closed off the country to the mainland (via either high speed rail or airline), there's still a great deal of fear that some of those millions of citizens who left Wuhan before the quarantine may end up here.

Now when it comes to trusting the government, it's not like I can say I particularly trust the government back home in the US. However, if something on the level of a pandemic were to occur, I'd much more trust the US government to take care of it than China's and Hong Kong's. I mean hell look at the HK government banning the surgical masks but then wearing them now, or them saying HK needs to ""consider the feelings of the mainlanders"" as a reason for not closing the border. If things were to get seriously worse, I have little to no faith in the system here to keep the people safe.

That being said, it isn't guaranteed that things will necessarily get worse. But I've never experienced THIS level of uncertainty on such a potentially fatal issue. I've already been looking at flights home and they're quite expensive even for one way tickets. Plus there's the fear that if things do get worse, would I even be able to get home? I know that's a bit on the fearmongering side, but it's scary to think about.

So yeah. Here I am again, on this sub even if it's not exactly meant to deal with these sorts of things, to gather thoughts and opinions about this situation yet again. I know since I stayed after posting the first time it may seem like I ignored everyone's advice, but I really did spend a few weeks thinking long and hard about everything and what people said. Albeit just to be doing the same again a few months later. My job here will last for only another 6 months, and although they request 30 day notice prior to leaving I do feel like there'd be some lenience due to this situation, as I'm not leaving on bad terms but fear for my safety/future. And I feel like future employers wouldn't necessarily hold it against me either. The only downside is I also just put down a rent deposit on a new apartment that I may lose if I leave (although they might be understanding as well). But yeah, any thoughts, opinions, strong declarations, or anything of the sort would be appreciated to help me think this through. Thanks!"
339,"I graduated in May, and I‚Äôve been looking for jobs since. I have not had any luck. I‚Äôve been on a couple of interviews, but they all leave me back at square one. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has any tips on what to do next. I am really lost. Depression is kicking in harder than it was at the beginning of this journey.

I live in nyc, which makes it harder to compete with others.

I just need some advice.

It‚Äôs very hard to stay positive at this point. My loan repayment will start to kick in this month, and I don‚Äôt have any income. I‚Äôm just lost."
340,"Hello if anybody who graduated from this program or a similar program anywhere, please help. I graduated in June 2019, and I don't know what my next steps are really. I think that it will be hard to find a job with just a bachelors in this field, that is well paying. To be honest, im looking at post grad options but if i can find a good job that's fine too. If anyone was in a similar position as me and has a career now, or is still searching and finding themselves, it would be awesome if you could share your experience. THANK YOU SO MUCH !"
341,"I graduated in spring with a job lined up from an internship the prior summer, but that fell through due to covid. I have applied to hundreds of jobs and hundreds of jobs since then and rejected by almost all. However, it's almost worse when I don't get rejected. Seeing an email in my inbox asking to chat or getting a call from an unknown number just paralyzes me with anxiety. Then I spend the next several weeks thinking about that and hating myself. I have had numerous jobs in the past but now that I'm in the real world there is an anxiety in the application/interview process that I just can't seem to get past. I know I need therapy but I can't get therapy without a job and I am less and less certain I can get a job without therapy. I am caught in a catch 22. I'd appreciate any advice..."
342,"I'm currently a third of the way through a trades program at my local technical college. Despite the fact that I've got the grades and a consistent attendance to show for, I've never made conversation with any of my professors as of now.

I've been thinking about this increasingly with the time I have left to spare, since I've reflected back on my own experiences of just how ruthlessly competitive the job market is as a whole. It also doesn't help my worries that my program doesn't offer a co-op option and that the majority of graduates from trades-related programs (including mine) at the school I'm attending solely get entry-level employment opportunities through academic or family connections ‚Äî both of which I lack in.

With the time I do have left, I am wondering how I can stand out from the rest of the crowd, that is my classmates, and encourage my profs into implementing me into their existing career network."
343,"Hi Folks, Long Time Lurker, First Time Poster.

I‚Äôll start by saying I‚Äôm studying Engineering in one of the smaller IT‚Äôs in Ireland. I gave first year a fair whack and got through with okay grades. Could‚Äôve been a lot better if I knew how to study properly. I feel like I missed out on the first year experience but that‚Äôs not really what this post is about. This post is about me being unsure if this course is for me. I feel like I have a case of imposter syndrome. I feel as if I don‚Äôt belong. But I don‚Äôt know what I belong to. I feel so lost in the step up in speed to second year compared to first. I keep saying to see the year out and take stock then but that seems like ages away. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should drop out and find another course to start from scratch next year or to apply for a PLC (Post Leaving Cert, a qualification below a basic college degree in Ireland that is focused on niche things like hairdressing or motor mechanics) or an apprenticeship or to keep going with third year if I pass second year!"
344,"I am almost 29 and I graduated with a BA in Art History in 2014. I went to college because I was expected to go and because I didn‚Äôt really know what I wanted to do, I majored in something that was interesting to me. I have no real aptitudes or skills or even really any interests anymore. 

I have mostly worked odd jobs the past six years. I moved to LA for no real reason (I wanted to get out of my moms basement in Iowa) and worked as a dishwasher then I lucked out and found a clerical job working for an art consultant. I did that for about a year and a half. I had a mental breakdown and I went to a mental hospital in Texas for two months.

Since then I have let myself go and have not worked much. I couldn‚Äôt find a decent job in Texas and ended up stocking tampons on shelves at Walmart for three months (I was working 50 + hours a week) just to pay my rent. I quit that job and instead of sticking around in a city without good job options for me I spent six months traveling.

Now I am back in my mom‚Äôs basement in Iowa. I work a temp job as a Census taker and spend my evenings playing video games. I wish I had my old life in California back and I am incredibly depressed.

I don‚Äôt want to work at McDonalds or Walmart (again). I want to make more than minimum wage. I was sure as hell making a lot more than that a couple years ago.

I don‚Äôt think I can work in the trades either. I tried once and I didn‚Äôt fit in with the kind of guys who typically work those jobs..."
345," I‚Äôm graduating next week and feel completely lost career wise. I‚Äôm currently a server at a popular restaurant in my area. I can make over $150-200 a night if the crowd is right. Simply put, it makes way more than any job that‚Äôs in the realm of psychology. I know I want to go back to school to be a rehabilitation counselor, but I want to take a year off. I feel getting a job with my degree will be more impressive when I apply to a graduate program, but my finances would put me in a position to save money. I also thought about doing both jobs, but I would not have a day off at and I don‚Äôt think I could handle it. With all that being said, any ideas? 


TL;DR I make more money as a server than in my degree profession, but I want to look good when I go to grad school.

EDIT: thank you guys for all of your information. I got a lot of advice I feel like I needed. As a first generation college graduate, I feel like I know hardly anything when it comes to masters/doctorate programs. So I feel like I got put in the right direction"
346,
347,I‚Äôve been feeling completely hopeless to find a career I‚Äôm even somewhat interested in and wanted to hear about some of your experiences with finding something you actually like. I know I could just google this but I think hearing it from people who have actually gone through it would be a much better help.
348,"I'm 21, about to start my final year of my undergrad, and I'm going to start applying for jobs soon. Thinking about finding a job after college where someone is actually going to be paying me for my skills is kinda surreal to me? No one in my family has a college degree or has a professional career (first gen immigrant kids wya) so I don't really know how to really navigate this whole applying to jobs thing. I feel very under-qualified for the entry-level jobs in my field even though I guess it's not like that on paper... Did anyone feel this way when they got their first job? I feel like I have imposter syndrome before even getting a job haha"
349,"This serenates with me because I'm trying to find a purpose after school. It's certainly a great motivator but I don't know how much I actually believe it. It seems to work for some but I feel for the majority it doesn't and that's a huge letdown for a lot of people. Sure, if I really wanted to become a doctor I could probably make it happen but becoming the next governor of my state? Ya probably not. I just thought this was relevant because I think people are finding out life is a lie and it's making a lot of people sad and miserable with themselves.

There's a phrase from Fight Club that seems to put it all into perspective-  ""We've been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rockstars,  but we won't. We're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, ver ypissed off."""
350,"I just graduated college and am looking for a job, but I‚Äôve also been diagnosed with GAD and depression and I don‚Äôt feel ready to put on the facade of a stable human being who can put up an image and work a professional 9-5 job without constantly thinking I‚Äôm an ugly fraud and lazy human being. I am full of self hatred, it‚Äôs always been a part of me that I was happy to let school distract me from. But now college is over and I am forced to face myself and all my demons. 

My parents own a restaurant I‚Äôve been working at for many years now, it‚Äôll be closing down next year after being 30 years in business because they‚Äôre building apartments over the shopping center where the restaurant is. 

Should I take a year to get myself together and then enter the workforce or should I just ‚Äúput on my big boy pants‚Äù and try to get a professional job now?"
351,Looking for really any advice here as I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I have recently in the last 2 months obtained a job making $45k per year. I have a bachelors degree in psychology so I‚Äôm pretty sure this is my ceiling on income. However I hate this job. This job was sold to me much different than what I was told it‚Äôd be and I just don‚Äôt enjoy it at all. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I can do with my degree to make enough money to survive and be happy. Thanks for any advice.
352,I went through school ambitious af. I scored volunteer position and internship... one after the other. Now that I‚Äôm out of school... I haven‚Äôt found a job in my field. I got a degree in museum  studies/history. I applied to retake my GRE so I can get into grad school. Maybe getting a masters will make me happier.... doing at least something museum related. I don‚Äôt have a high paying job so I can‚Äôt just move out of state. I feel stuck and confused.
353,"Tough in that you don't know what you want and don't know where your life is headed. Exciting in that you're making your own money,  independent, still don't have much tying you down, and you can do things you never could have before. I don't know what the hell is going on right now but I'm just riding the rollercoaster. A lot of soul searching and self exploration."
354,"Not completely helpless but taking a different approach to life. I tried making a plan, it didn't go my way, and it's just too much pressure  to make life the way I want it to go. Do I know what my life is gonna look like in 5-10 years? No, I'm just living day by day discovering new things about myself. Whether that gets me anywhere I don't know. I'm just kinda going with the flow instead trying to control everything if that makes sense."
355,"I've had about 20 interviews for around 200-300 applications. I have an average of 3 years experience across multiple programming languages, frameworks, etc. I've been practicing interviewing and I had an interview in Philly last week where I thought everything went great but, then was told I was no longer a candidate. Asking for feedback from any of these interviews usually results in nothing. I had someone look at my linkedin after the interview in philly and the person somehow removed himself as visible to me from ""look at who's looking at your profile or whatever"". I've had other employers that I do a screening interview and never hear back even when I do a followup email/call. Am I doing anything wrong?

Strategies I've tried: asking the interviewers questions, tailoring my resume to meet specific jobs, practicing interviewing before the interview, practicing programming problems, attempting to use recruiters to get interviews, I've redone my resume along the lines of 5 times by a professional and then by someone in the industry.

Can anyone suggest additional strategies?

Outside of starting my own company or applying out of the country, what other options do I have? would applying in Canada to employers requesting a work authorization get any responses?"
356,"Recent law grad. I know I should be proud of my accomplishments but I feel like I don't actually have any. Yes I graduated, but I don't know how, it doesn't feel real.

357,"Graduated 2019 and 2020. Applied for over 2,000 jobs. thousands of not selected or fail to meet requirements. Around 20 interviews. 6 ghosted (two of which toured the entire facility and introduced me to the president, geo, etc and then sad.... nah). Having me create content, use it, and not hire me. Doing 3, 4, 5 interviews. Driving across town to be told to come back later because someone forgot. Every single Denial email after interviews. I finally have an offer which comes with great insurance, a bonus, 401k, and has been around since the 1800's. Ive had so many ""no's"" to being the communications assistant and now I am THE second head of the communications department. I am THE specialist. not an assistant, not an intern that I ""wasn't qualified"" for.

&#x200B;

I HATED when people told me ""well maybe the job isn't for me"" because that's not fair and basically felt like I wasn't good enough... I felt like I wasted my time in college.... but I 100% know that my three year depressive funk will be coming to an end and I will be okay after literally being on the verge of homelessness. I wouldn't wish my situation on anyone but your time is coming I swear."
358,"This was probably posted here a lot but I‚Äôm feeling really down lately (as I‚Äôm sure a lot of people are with the world being the way it is), so I‚Äôd like to ask.  I graduated not too long ago, and in college I had pretty large social circle so I always had something to do. After college ended, and I ended the relationship with my then girlfriend, I lost a lot of my ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù Years later, and I have a small group of buddies I hang out with, and they‚Äôre the best friends I could ask for. However, I haven‚Äôt had a serious relationship since college, struggle to meet new people, and find myself sitting at home alone more than I would like. 

How do you meet new people? How could I find a new girlfriend that isn‚Äôt through a dating app? I‚Äôm moving in a few weeks to a small city so I‚Äôm hopeful I‚Äôll make new friends there, but at the same time terrified I won‚Äôt.

Any suggestions are welcome./r/"
359,"The title pretty much sums it up. I don't know what I'm doing, I never expected to really live this long. Recently with COVID, I got let go from a job that I was doing as a time filler for experience in a field. I don't know if I want to go into that field or a field that's pretty opposite from it (social work w/ children vs marketing/events). I had an internship lined up before the virus hit bad but bc of it, the position I was going to work is no longer available. I don't know where to start or what to do. Everything seems so daunting when looking at it and having to apply to jobs. Everything just sounds...scary. 

I feel like I'm unqualified for every position, I know it probably just feels like that because of the strong wording in the descriptions. I guess, what I'm writing this post for is to ask how you've managed to find jobs/figure out what you want to do. I feel like I'm about to start drowning and if I bring this up to my family, things just get hostile as I'm the first college grad and should have had things figured out."

361,"Hey guys. So I graduated highschool in 2017. And always planned on going to the military, but I had to lose some weight first. Well I lost the weight, then gained it all back when my dad kicked me out a month after graduation. I made it work. Got a place. Got a job. About a year ago, I started losing the weight again for the military and I‚Äôm pretty close. But it‚Äôs still going to be a while. After highschool, I did one semester of community college and I enjoyed it a lot. I‚Äôve been working a trade for about a year now and hate every single minute of it. It‚Äôs almost like no matter how hard I try, I just can‚Äôt save up as much money as I wish I could. 

I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting this. I just feel lost. I feel stuck. I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on so many life experiences by not going to uni.

I‚Äôm working a 9-5 everyday and I cannot for the love of god do work for 8 hours continuously during the entire day. I stress out and get super anxious in the mornings, maybe do 1-2 hours of work a day, and then I feel relaxed until the nighttime when I dread sitting in my own thoughts for 8 hours in front of a computer with no stimulation.

I have very little social support in my office, no one my age, and I don‚Äôt understand how people like coming into the office, like is it because we come from a world of online that people crave in person interaction now? Because I‚Äôd happily just sit in my own desk w my own light and do my work from home. 

What are some tips with coping with a 9-5 job in person after schooling online and a flexible online schedule after a pandemic?"

364,"* I got my MA film degree at a good film school in December.
* Before the pandemic, I had a job lined up once I graduated but the lockdowns have made me unemployed since March 2020.
* I am close to 900 applications since December of 2020 and I keep hearing the following: ""Your resume is impressive for your age but we will be declining to move on"".
* Every professional that I've connected with in the industry and career advisor that I've spoken with have said the following: ""Your resume is perfect but it's just the times"".
* I really want to move out of my hometown, since the jobs around here are limited, low waged, and I'm very overqualified for what is available, but I want to be able to have a job guaranteed before I move. I have been advised to ""Just move to LA/NYC and find the job"" but Idk how I feel about that risk.
* I've pretty much been chilling at my family's house and I can't fucking stand it. I miss the independence. I wasn't a fan of college but I miss doing shit by myself... Or having legit shit to do...
* I've been working on personal projects, specifically writing screenplays and novels. 
* I want to make short films but the people I used to make short films with back home attempted to stab me in the back with some shady business/legal shit involving filmmaking so I would be doing the projects completely independent, due to trust issues.
* I've had some college projects do very well recently at film festival screenings across the country. 
* I want to do filmmaking independently but I have no idea how to get the proper financing to back certain projects. During my time in film school, I was introduced to producers and financial backers for film. Pretty much, the backbone of the film industry. I fucking hated what I witnessed and realized how out of touch and fucked up a lot of these people are. I know I need them to back my projects one day but that whole business side of the industry is a complete turn off for me.
* Socially, that aspect of my life is dead. The friends I'm on good terms with and like to talk to have moved away and it's hard to message, due to our schedules. The friends and family that are around and want to talk to me are, in my own realization, toxic. A lot of negativity in general and I really want to escape it.
* Oh, six figure loan debt will kick in fully in October...
* I feel like a failure. I've done a bunch of cool shit in my life, made a lot of grounds professionally before graduating, and now I'm pretty much staring at a brick wall."
365,"We all know how hard it can be to stick to a new habit. Picking up any good habit essentially lays the groundwork for a more successful and fulfilled life. There are, however, some habits that have a trickle down effect and make the adoption of other habits a lot easier. These are Keystone Habits.

Keystone Habits are those changes to your life that create a domino effect and carry over into other aspect of your life.

One of my favorites is Exercise - Studies have shown that people who regularly exercise tend to eat healthier, consume less alcohol, be more productive at their work and sleep better, than those who don‚Äôt.

Some of my other favorite Keystone Habits are:

* Meditation
* Journaling
* Building a morning routine.

The incorporation of these particular habits in your day can have the most unexpected positive ripple effects that you‚Äôll end up being so happy with. I explain this in great depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-\_2KVEVh6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-_2KVEVh6A). Give this a try with your habit building. It can be a real game-changer."
366,"I‚Äôve been working at my current, first job out of college position for about a year and 4 months now. When I got the job I was told the program takes about 3-4 years to really know what you‚Äôre doing and get to the point where you‚Äôve become knowledgeable. The company I‚Äôm at is really good in the sense they care about their workers, I get paid well, I have good benefits and all my bosses and coworkers are willing to help me. For the first year it was a lot of training and moving through the program. Now I‚Äôm in a leadership role and I feel like I don‚Äôt actually understand a lot of things and there are a lot of gaps. I‚Äôm on a time crunch and it‚Äôs expected of me to do a ton of work that I‚Äôve never done before. Again, my coworkers are always willing to help but it feels like I should know the information and I don‚Äôt. My boss also has mentioned he‚Äôs happy with my progress. 

Is this normal at jobs? I feel like I‚Äôm a slow learner or that I give up before even trying. My mental health has been on the decline recently and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so afraid of doing the wrong things prior to deadlines. I was like this in college too. I worked hard, but was never satisfied with anything. I‚Äôm trying to work hard at my job and understand everything, even though we‚Äôre always learning and we won‚Äôt know everything. How long does it take until I feel like I fit in at the job?
I‚Äôve looked at applying for other jobs but I‚Äôm afraid if I leave I‚Äôll go through the same struggles and I‚Äôll regret leaving this job before even getting through the hard stuff. It does feel like imposter syndrome and it‚Äôs been really upsetting me and I just don‚Äôt want to disappoint my coworkers and my boss."
367,"I graduated last year and had and internship. I was the first intern in that department so it wasn't exactly a learning experience for me entirely. I did learn things, but I also had to work independently majority of my internship. It ended in April and now I'm working at Whole Foods during this whole pandemic. I feel as though I didn't learn enough and didn't get really the hands on experience to apply for entry level jobs in that field. People I talk to tell me to take classes or do try other things. I just don't feel that drive and I'm not sure how to find it. I do have things I like, but I don't practice everyday or pretty much at all. I guess it's laziness, but I'm also just afraid of not being good. Like, I enjoy writing and I try to write in a journal, but I just don't do it. I also thought of doing YouTube, but I find reasons not to. I guess I'm looking for advice, but also to talk to anyone who feels this way and what they are doing to help themselves."

I toured the unit today and everyone was really nice, but now I‚Äôm home and the nerves are starting to hit me. I keep overthinking... what if I say the wrong thing? What if I‚Äôm overwhelmed? What if I can‚Äôt handle the stress? What if....? 

I‚Äôve been excited about this for months because it‚Äôs such a great opportunity. Every time I thought about it, I would think about all of the positives... being able to work with other recent graduates like myself, gaining more experience for grad school, becoming more independent.

i had so many wonderful friends that i made throughout college. but because i was toxic and problematic, i lost a lot of them. understandable but saddening. 
i have a few friends right now. for the most part i'm content with that. i have a fiancee who is my best friend. everyone in my life is just wonderful to the core. 

but there are times, especially lately, that I cry over how i ruined all my friendships. friendships that were truly beautiful... but i was alot. i wish so much i could go back with what i know now. I'd get so much more out of college. I'd have so many more friends. 
it hurts. its hard to accept at times. i can't take back the past. i can't hate myself because afterall, life is about growth. for the moment... or last few months... I'm still realizing, feeling the pain, and learning from it. boy does it hurt."

Although they have many flaws they still did a better job than ALOT of other parents out there.)

Anyone else feel like their parents don‚Äôt give a f*ck whenever they actually achieve anything? How do you deal with this? In my family it has always been about hard work, and thats fine I guess. I‚Äôve learned a really good work ethic from my parents and they have pushed me to be my best self. Heck I‚Äôve even become harder on my self than they have ever been on me.

For context, only one of them has a university degree. And I would also like to point out that school was generally not too difficult for either of them. My brother and I on the other hand, struggle. The difference between the two of us is I work my ass off to even be considered decent and he just says f*ck it and barely passed high school. But yet somehow anything I ever achieve is just treated like a given. Like I was expected to just do these things anyways. 

When I was in middle school I really wanted to go this specialized arts high school, so I worked hard on my portfolio even though I was up against kids who had had art lessons their whole life. Then when I was accepted, it was like they just assumed I would get in. In high school a bunch of my friends were on the honour roll two years in a row and I wanted to be on it SO bad. So the next two years I worked really hard and got honour roll in my 11th grade year and 12th grade year and also got recognized for a special award. Once again, it was as if that was just expected of me even thought I struggled with school a lot and even have a learning disability. Then I wanted to go to university (which was also expected) and got accepted by two top schools and was put on the wait list for another very prestigious one. It wasn‚Äôt even acknowledged when the acceptance letters came in the mail.

Now, I finally graduated in December after working my a*s off in a VERY intense program. I graduated with HONOURS in TWO majors and have an extracurricular list the length of my damn arm! Additionally, I also managed to snag a contract at one of the biggest companies in my industry right away in February just before Covid happened. (My dad‚Äôs first question when I told him about the contract was where I saw my next TWO contracts coming from.... Also unfortunately the place is now closed and my industry won‚Äôt be back up and running for a while.)

And yet when my degree finally came in the mail today, no one seemed to bat an eyelash. I have been scrolling through social media watching my friends‚Äô parents have mini grads for them and little parties with cake and decorations or even just making a post about how proud they are. I told my mom I wanted to put the degree up on my bedroom wall and she acted like it was the dumbest thing to do. She said she never put her degree up anywhere and that most people she knows have one so it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. EXCUSE ME? Not that big of a deal? (Trigger warning) It took me 4.5 years to complete and I almost killed myself at one point... Idk... maybe it would be nice if they could just for a SECOND recognize the time and effort I put into things to be at least the small amount of successful that I am? (If you could even call it that.) 

Of course due to Covid my life is in shambles right now, but getting that piece of paper today felt at least a little good and then they had to shit on it. Anyone else feel like they work and work and work and the one person they are trying to impress never gives a sh*t? How do you deal with it? I have a feeling the further away from school I get, and the more I ever achieve, the less they will even care. Please for the love of god reprimand your kids when they do things wrong, but NEVER forget to congratulate them when they do something right! Anyone know what to do when you feel this way?"
374,"This is something I‚Äôve been struggling with since before I even graduated. In terms of life experience, college to me was basically heroin. Now that I‚Äôve experienced it nothing feels the same.

Because of covid, I was forced to face the reality of my college days being over far sooner than I could have expected.  People moved away in the middle of the semester who I haven‚Äôt seen since.

Growing up I always liked going to school and learning. I wasn‚Äôt fond of the responsibility I needed to have but it kept me honest and gave me something to work towards. High school absolutely sucked and college was going to be a new start for me.  I immediately loved it and it started what would become what I consider the best years of my life so far.

College had so much of what I needed in my life. I was on a small campus where everything was walkable.  It was a college town and kinda everyone knew everyone. I loved walking to class.  I loved learning new things and working on projects and classes with my peers. I wasn‚Äôt even that great of a student but the constant challenge and shared experience was something I thoroughly enjoyed. I was around lots of people my age, with similar interests and goals. We were all for the most part at the same place in our lives. I had a thriving social life. I was in the best shape of my life. I constantly had things to look forward to that we‚Äôre important to me. I could see friends and meet new people whenever I wanted, just by walking out of my dorm/apartment. I could walk to starbucks and get my favorite drink (rip to the cool lime refresher), and see tons of people around me that all had this shared experience. I don‚Äôt know if this is just me but something about that atmosphere just made me feel happy and at peace.  Pretty much all of my existential anxiety was gone, this is where I was meant to be.

Now I‚Äôve moved on.  Friends moved across the country, other friends stayed close by but have stopped talking to me, which is it‚Äôs own whole story. I think it has made me reluctant to try to make new friends.

But not everything new is bad.  I make great money.  I work a job I genuinely enjoy.  I live in a wayyyy nicer apartment. I have 2 amazing cats who I love. I live with an amazing girlfriend who I will marry some day. I‚Äôm in great shape. My anxiety/depression is basically non-existent.  I even have some friends around‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre often 20-30 minutes away. We tried living in the city but we hated it.

Most people in my situation would probably be happy. I am doing better than most other person I know from college, and yet I still feel like my life is missing something. I want to go back to never wondering if what I‚Äôm doing is right. I want to be 100% in the moment again. I used to wake up every day with a sense of purpose. I used to be excited for what was ahead of me.

That‚Äôs probably the best I can put it into words.  I‚Äôm not very good at writing so sorry if this was more of a ramble."
375,"It‚Äôs my second day today working full time 40 hours a week at 19/yo. This shits hard bro I respect my parents for doing this for so long and people around me, I‚Äôve read some articles on how to adjust and make it a little more enjoyable but going from literally doing nothing all day besides gymming and eating going into full time work, I think My mind and body is just shocked atm - I stare at a screen and white walls all day and once I finally leave at 6PM it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm walking out into a new world, it makes you appreciate just the simple things, the green grass, the yellow car, just colours alone have become something so beautiful which I took for granted before. If anyone can give me some extra tips on how help adjust that would be appreciated"

377,which one is better learning from others experience or experiencing yourself?
378,Earlier this month I got rejected from art school in Austria which is a bummer but my back up plan is politics. Any advice on this would help
379,"I did everything a good kid is supposed to. I was valedictorian of my high school, I got a full tuition scholarship to a large state school, I graduated a semester early, and I only had 2k in loans that I‚Äôve paid off already. 

I was so good at the structured environment of education, but honestly I have no direction. I don‚Äôt really know myself. 

I‚Äôve had this pressure to be academically perfect at the cost of perfectly understanding who I am. I never had the leeway to be lost when it came to school but I‚Äôm lost when it comes to myself. 

I want to allow myself to be lost for a while. üòî"
380,"So today I fully moved out of my college apartment, and assumed I was going to immediately find another apartment using the grad money I got from my grandma. When telling my parents this, they told me it was impossible to do so so soon because I need a 6 month income before I can live anywhere on my own. A lot of the places I was looking at dont require that type of background check, but I only realized until after I talked to them about it. I‚Äôm nervous to bring this up to them again, knowing that they‚Äôre going to make up another excuse to keep me living with them. The time I was living at my college apartment I felt much more mentally healthy & did better at school, but I dont think they understand that point or my desperation of wanting to live on my own. Anyone have any tips or tricks to build up the courage to talk to them about this again? Somehow getting them to see how beneficial it would be if I lived on my own? Anything helps. 

Thanks for reading"
381,"So, I just got my first actual fulltime job out of college in the career I studied for, it‚Äôs taken over 2 years of living at the parents house, interning, doing personal work, picking up freelance jobs, and feeling like a bit of a failure the whole way. The main thing I‚Äôm learning is that not everything needs to be measured next to something else... you shouldn‚Äôt be comparing your way of life to anyone else‚Äôs, really just do what you believe is right for yourself. That being said I have this weird feeling about this job already.

The thing is that for the past 2 years I‚Äôve basically been able to go and do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted with the only barrier being money for real expensive stuff like traveling. But now I feel like I‚Äôm starting a part of my life where I don‚Äôt have that agency anymore... and it scares me. 

I want to be able to have my own place and eat but I also would rather not give up the things i love in my life to pay for it. It‚Äôs such a childish notion but I feel like I‚Äôm on the edge of a cliff where I won‚Äôt be able to claw my way back. I‚Äôd like the option to exist without working 40 hours a week I suppose. 

Like I get 10 vacation days... 10 out of 365 to do what I‚Äôd like... that just seems so wrong to me. I‚Äôm excited about the job but I can‚Äôt shake this feeling."
382,"So I graduated undergrad with 2 bachelors degrees in May of this year, and I‚Äôm currently pursuing a career in Criminal Justice. I applied with a local police department back in November of last year and passed all their tests and am not on their ‚Äúwait list‚Äù for up to 2 years. No updates or anything, just if they decide to call. Which isn‚Äôt a huge deal, I only applied with them to get some interviewing in that field under my belt and in case no other opportunity arose. Fast forward to April of this year I get the chance to interview with a federal agency and I also pass everything they throw at me there too. But then the background check starts and it‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve heard any updates and a buddy of mine who applied about 4 months ahead of me just got a letter saying he has been denied due to his eyesight. In the meantime I‚Äôve been helping out with a family business but I needed another job so I took a job at a local airport as a ramp agent. But I feel like I‚Äôm just sitting here wasting months of my life that I should be out getting experience and working to pay off debts and living my life. Has anyone else had a similar situation? What did you do to cope with those feelings of the impending hopelessness of never getting a job in the field you want to work in?"
383,"I'm planning on going to a state college after high school, to get my degree. I want to leave my house as soon as possible, but I don't want to be tied down by the restrictions of paying for a dorm and having to share it with people I probably won't like.

Is living in an apartment feasible for someone in my boat? If I were to room with someone (I have someone in mind) and split the cost, and we both worked jobs outside of classes, is it doable? And if I have to do it on my own, would that be doable? Or am I thinking too big, and is it more advisable to just shut up and go the normal route?"
384,"I worried that I was behind  my friends but it's all relative and is completely pointless to feel so. Everyone is just living their own life according to the way they like living, What they do has nothing to do with you. This has helped me focus on myself and not compare. 

Your real friends won't care how much you make, what job title you have, or how big your house is. Even if I do encounter those type of people I find they aren't the best to be around. I'm way more happy now that I've adopted a non race to the finish line mentality."
385,"So I will be graduating with my BA in English this May. My goal is to go to grad school to become a school counselor. However, I was going to take a year off to regroup and get my finances up. I was just wondering when exactly should i start applying for jobs?"
386,"Hi, I am a 20 year old man who just dropped out of college and my parents just kicked me out of their home and I am not welcome back and I do not currently have a job or a solid resume. I was a computer science major and I would like to search for some kind of opportunity in the field but I have no idea where to start. I am currently staying in my old apartment for a limited time stressed out of my mind at the moment trying to find out what to do before I starve to death or become homeless. Can somebody please point me in the right direction or tell me what I might be able to do? I know it‚Äôs a very rough situation but I trust that I will be able to make it out of it."
387,
388,"I‚Äôm really curious as to what a lot of you guys are doing post college. What do you do for work now? What was your major? Did it go according to plan? More importantly, are you happy? 

There‚Äôs a lot of negativity in this sub reddit which makes sense as a lot of you guys come here to vent. But I think it would be cool to post how you‚Äôre doing so that people can see that they‚Äôre not alone or hopefully comments here can help everyone believe that it will be okay

Edit: it‚Äôs so interesting seeing how you guys are doing! Upvoting all the responses and replying when I can/when I have something to add. Positive and negative experiences ARE welcome, because ultimately those experiences are things everyone will go through after graduating"
389,"Leaving college, I thought I would miss the heavy partying, going out, getting wasted all the time. But honestly, I just miss coming home on a weeknight and sitting around with my close friends shooting the shit. Watching movies/sports, having a drink or 2, playing video games, that‚Äôs the stuff the I miss the most. When you work you have to plan everything social outing far in advance, it was great being able to text the buddies and they‚Äôd all be over within 30 mins."
390,"How long has living with your parents been? And how has life been for you overall? What do you look forward to every day and what do you do? Any new hobbies?

Just curious. This will be me at the end of April.

Note: I have a good relationship with my parents and I don't mind living with them at all. I'm just curious."

However, I don‚Äôt feel that great overall. I  am just always remembering the good times from my youth and currently don‚Äôt feel that excited over majority of the stuff I do. During my studies I was a very happy and enthusiastic person, right now I don‚Äôt feel that way.

Did any of you experience the same thing? If so, what was your strategy to overcome this issue?

Thanks a lot in advance :)"
393,"I have a job that I wont advance in anymore, and isnt going to benefit my long terms goals like I thought. Im looking everyday for something else but what I find is the same situation with little to no opportunity to advance, with the same or even less pay. Im tempted to relocate to a new area, maybe even across the country just for a fresh start, but that‚Äôs a big risk and if its the same situation out there, I would burn through my savings and have to move back anyway. Im really  scared of trying to move out of this bubble but there are days when Im tempted to say screw it and take a leap of faith, because im even more scared of never getting out. But then the feeling passes, I try to go about it logically and plan to do something and after reviewing how bleak it seems, end up doing nothing.  


 Since im barely making enough money to survive right now anyway, I'm still living at home with my family, which sucks. My social life is basically non existent because of this as well, I'm too embarrassed to bring people home to this and I have next to no privacy even if I wanted to. My circle of friends is starting to drift apart now too, it dawned on me recently that Ive gone months without talking to some of them and when I do, its very brief and takes  weeks to plan out. The real irony is, when we do get together this is all we talk about. As awful as it it to say, it makes me feel better to know everyone is feeling the same as I me. Everyone, even the people I thought were doing better than me, admit to feeling lonely, bored unfulfilled and even depressed. Everything about our futures seems so bleak and it feels like everyone has accepted that we're all royally screwed and to give up is the best action. Its like something is off with our generation, even the basic expectations we expected (a well paying, enjoyable career, owning a home, a balanced work and social life) seem like fantasies now. In fact, I've been told this multiple times and I swear to god if one more baby boomer chuckles and rolls their eyes at me for complaining about this I'm going to pull my hair out. Im told all the time that enjoying your work is a ""millennial fantasy"" and it's only there to pay your bills. Which might be true for some people, but even when it comes to enjoying life outside of work, Im hit with ""no, you wont do that either. its all work and settling down from now on. You should also start a family and buy a house ASAP.""  Even if I wanted any of that right now, the logistics to do it just don't seem to be there and won't be for a long time, and then im treated like an asshole for pointing this out.

I used to think people joking about how much adult life sucks was just a joke, but it seems like something everyone around my age just accepts. I used to tell myself I'm a late bloomer, that if I stay on my path and work hard I'll get over this rut, but now I'm not so sure and I worry im just making excuses. I just don't feel like a real, successful adult and that I never will. Yes, I know the whole ""nobody feels like that, everyone is just faking it"" mantra, but there's more to it than that. I legitimately worry that everything will plateau as mediocre no matter how hard I try and we're just supposed to be ok with it?

 I know its unhealthy to compare yourself to others, or compare the advantages that other had in the past to what we're dealing with, but how can you not? Am I alone in feeling like this that something is just ""off"" with our generation, or do you think is there legitimate reasoning for it? Do you really think your working/adult life supposed to be about giving up on your dreams and just surviving? I just feel like no matter how hard I try Im going nowhere, wasting time and being encouraged to give up and I think, if that's the case, what am I fighting for?"
394,"After a bout of being with the wrong group last year I decided to leave and it seemed on and off I had some magic power of getting friends easily. But now it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm almost unmotivated? I want friends still like the rest of you all. But now I am an adult. I think I posted here about this before but got hate because for health reasons drugs and alcohol are no good in any amount lol(Even secondhand,) so what do you all recommend?"
395,"Anyone else not cut out for a 9-to-5? I'm slowly but surely coming to this realization, that I'm just not passionate about a 9-to-5. I hate it, in fact. Staring at a computer screen all day, analyzing budgets and numbers on Excel. I can't believe I worked so hard in college to just end up spending 40-hours at a desk, answering e-mails and this is all my life is cut out to. I feel so depressed..."
396,"I usually don't make a post about myself but here goes.

I graduated last year, during the pandemic. It took me a few months, but I got a job. The pay is not good, it isn't bad, it is still more than I have ever made in my life, but I should be earning more given my education. But whatever, when I got the job they said that within a few months we would receive promotions to full-time employees and get benefits.

The people I work with were excellent. We all work from home but I developed solid friendships with a number of people there and we ended up hanging out in real life.

The work I do is not exciting, it's very repetitive. But that was fine with me when I started. I don't want to say I enjoyed going to work, but it was not a drag at all. In many ways it was kind of a blessing since I was lonely at that time in the pandemic.

I paid lots of attention in training and paid lots of attention to my work. My boss was encouraged by my productivity and quality. He pulled me aside and said he was strongly pushing for me to be a manager. He said I was one of the best workers in the whole department. Excellent I thought, not only will I become full-time, I will be in a better position than I anticipated.

Unfortunately after a few months, the company stopped hiring new recruits. No new recruits meant no more need for managers, so no immediate promotion for me. I was bummed, but whatever, in a few months I'd get converted to full time maybe not as a manager, but at a higher position than I was.

Months go by and things start dragging. The person in charge of my employment says that they have a plan for conversions and that it will go into effect starting that quarter. The quarter passed and nothing happened. That same guy starts cancelling the meetings we're supposed to have every week. When he can be bothered to hold meetings, he just says there's no news. So we're all waiting to get full-time contracts and time just keeps dragging on.

Eventually it comes out that my bosses boss isn't talking to the guy in charge of my employment. So no new information is coming in. Eventually my bosses boss realizes people are getting antsy and holds a department-wide meeting where he tells us what is going on. He puts on a happy face and basically says ""A lot of you guys suck at your jobs, any questions?"". This pissed pretty much everyone off. No one was mean to his face but people asked him, as politely as we could, ""So, we're not getting contracts anytime soon?"" to which he said that because of upper management changes, and our work quality, and the alignment of the stars that no, contracts are not forthcoming.

This sent everyone over the edge. Of course, there is no department venting area we can go to, but everyone I've messaged has said they're fed up and looking for new employment, including me. It's a shame because I really liked my job when I started.

The other thing is I've completely neglected my work. My stats are going through the floor because hey, if my good work isn't going to pay off, why work at all? I'm supposed to be working now but I'm on Reddit whining instead. I just hope I don't get fired before I find a new job. They probably won't fire me because there are a lot of shit employees here who still have a job so I should be good. I just feel worthless because I'm not doing my work and worried that I will lose my paycheck.

Sorry for the long post, I just needed somewhere to vent. I'm not trying to say all after-college employment is bad, the place I did my internship at had a great work environment. Just that don't let yourself be led-on by empty promises."
397,"22/F/Desi who graduated 2020 with an art degree. I knew the competition was fierce for those in the art field, but I wanted to do something I was passionate about as opposed to suffering day-to-day. My university experience wasn't all that great due to personal circumstances bringing my performance down, but I still stuck to it.

Now it just feels like misfortune is my middle name.

When the pandemic hit, my once estranged sister told me she was pregnant with twins. Knowing my portfolio wasn't up to par with industry standards, I took this as an opportunity to take a break from job searching and help her while also working on projects to improve.

At first, it was good. I was lucky to land an internship and selflessly devoted to my sister and her needs. I thought it would work out. Along the way our relationship improved and for once I got a semblance of what it meant to finally have a family. 

But as soon as I mentioned the prospects of moving in with her it seemed the problems started to accumulate. It reached a head when she found a glass of water left out, blamed me for her almost spilling it, we bickered back and forth, and then she hit me with ‚Äúyou moving in won't work out anymore.‚Äù

I felt insulted, taken advantage of, disregarded, and more. My mistake to essentially put my life on pause for her, but I helped her during her pregnancy and after they were born, cleaned and kept her company, hung out with her and my other niece, and all of what a normal family member/sister would do when no one else would. My other sisters ostracized her and me. No one was there for her or excited for the babies than me. Those on the father side made empty promises to come over and help.

We patched things up and I was able to live here, but not without a loss. If I had known she would treat me this way I would've looked for a job more seriously. I can't help but feel pathetic that I wasted a year and then some for her to disregard my generosity and selflessness in this manner. 

Even more pathetic that I applied to retail jobs and got a callback much quicker than any of the ‚Äúbig boy‚Äù jobs I applied to. But I needed a job quickly because she wanted me out despite all I've sacrificed for her.

Applying to a retail job also feels demeaning. I wasted my four years to suffer some more in retail. The minimum wage isn't enough to live by so I have to rent out a room, something I have never done before.

I didn't expect my post-graduate life to be like this. My high school peers landed into some accredited companies, my uni peers are freelancing while being cushioned by families and here I am, being chewed up and spat out by my sister.

Sure I can suffer at the retail and ‚ÄúhUstLe‚Äù after working hours but to be slaved away by unsatisfactory conditions (pay/customer service/etc) and making ends meet (when I do move out), I know I won't be able to achieve my dream job like that.

I'm starting to lose hope."
398,"So I‚Äôm not sure how many people experience this, but I‚Äôm a year and a half out of school, and just over a year in my first job. I can‚Äôt really complain. I‚Äôm in a good situation, and my life should be fine by all means. But I just don‚Äôt have any drive or ambition like I use to in college. I use to always want to start on my own thing. But now I don‚Äôt even have a clue what I want to do with my life. I more or less feel like I‚Äôm lost. I‚Äôm not sure if any of you have felt this after your first year.

I have no other job experience. And I don‚Äôt even want to work in this career field anymore but don‚Äôt know what I want to do next. How do I tailor a resume for non major related jobs? How do I find out what career I want to do? How do I test the waters of careers if my resume is blank?
400,"About a month ago, my girlfriend of three years and I broke up. Two of those years were in college, and then another after. We had planned on getting married this year, but things didn't go as expected and we delayed marriage talks. Later on, due to us not being able to compromise on some things, we finally split up.

&#x200B;

General loneliness and other bad break-up feelings aside, I've really been struggling because it feels like I missed my chance of finding someone to spend my life with. I'm not ready for another relationship yet, but it would be nice to be able to meet some other girls and put myself out there. However, it's hitting a point where it seems like every girl I come across is married or engaged, and it really makes me feel like I missed out on my best opportunity to find someone. Especially since I'm not in college any more.

401,"I graduated undergrad in Dec. 2020. Since then I have been working jobs unrelated to my degree and feel like I have lost all sense of purpose. My whole life I have always had an end goal in mind; in high school it was a diploma and in undergrad it was my BS degree. Now it just feels like I live to work. I wake up, go to work, come home, cook, clean, and go to sleep. And repeat. It‚Äôs horrible. I was stressed in school but at least it was for a reason; I got something at the end. Now I‚Äôm even more stressed and depressed and there‚Äôs no end goal in sight. How do people overcome this?"
402,"I graduated less than a week ago and have plans for graduate school. For some reason, whenever I see a movie or show or other media about the start of college I crave the feeling of being a freshman in undergraduate college again. I think about being able to do high school again and get ideal grades and get into an Ivy League school.

I think of applying the life knowledge I have now and not wasting as much time and money as I did. I feel like life may be downhill from here because I didn't do college right to begin with, even though I didn't do that bad of a job in college at all.

What should I do? Where do I go from here? How do I feel okay being an adult?"
403,"I mean this in the most sincere way and am not tryin to come across as a dick, but why did people in this situation go to college? When I was looking at my university and major choice the number one thing on my mind was the career I would have following it. At least the way I saw it, college is the first part of your career and shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly in choice, both because of the present and future cost and rewards associated with it. I don‚Äôt need a concrete answer of course, but would enjoy to hear some perspectives on it."
404,
405,"I'm just happy that once I'm off the clock I can just go home and not have to worry about work anymore. No more staying up late at night on the weekends, writing essays, or doing homework. This feeling is so new to me since I've never had it any other way for the past 15-20 years. It's an absolute relief!"
406,"I am about 3 years out of college with a BFA in Illustration and Design. I simply never thought I would make more than 30k a year. When I got my first design job, I was making a measley 11 dollars an hour. I worked there for a few months, and got a new job as a designer making 20 an hour. I thought that was amazing. 40k a year! Wow! 

Over the next 2.5 years of me working there, I got 10k raises every year, which is amazing. So I was now making 60k a year. But I honestly never considered that I would be feeling underpaid. The raises were amazing! The salary was great! I was content working there. But I realized I was wrong.

I started to hear whispers of the job field going off, and started to look more into my position title specifically, and realized even from the beginning, that 40k was too little in the first place, even 3 years ago, before how the job market is now. I am also a woman, and through talking to various coworkers, I definitely noticed a discrepancy in how they pay men and women at that job. I should've been started at 60k. I was blinded by the company's fun startup culture and the fact that I was going from 11 an hour to 20 an hour - it seemed so good at the time! Especially when I had wrong expectations about my field in the first place. So I was essentially way behind where I should've been. I brought up a ton of research and made a very professional presentation to my boss, my HR department, and showed them the numbers and was asking for a raise to 75k. They said it was too much, not possible, not matching their numbers. I heard of some raises other people got that year at my company - 30k, 50k, people got huge raises, but I was asking for too much after all I got was a 10k raise. I had done amazing the last year at work, all my reviews were awesome. I decided to redo my portfolio, which took me a few months to build it up from scratch

Within a few days of me redoing my portfolio, I got a message from a recruiter. And another one. And another one. I did not have to apply anywhere, and got 4 interviews within the first week. Cut to a month ago, I got a job offer for 120k with a bonus of 5k. I was right. I was being underpaid. And when I left my old job, they were very blindsided, despite all my efforts to try to get them to right my pay before I started looking.

Now, I made my last day at my old job 2 weeks ago, and I don't start my new job for another few weeks, giving myself some time off in-between. I am honestly still in shock. I loved my job - the people, the work, everything but the pay. It will be a risk to leave, but how could I turn that down? Not only for the money, but the career advancement. And now I get time off too. 

Anyways, here we are. Don't undervalue yourself."
407,"I‚Äôve always been extroverted and outgoing and I‚Äôve also always taken pride in being adventurous and spontaneous. I just love being able to do fun, creative things and make good memories. I became very depressed over the course of the pandemic and I found myself having suicidal thoughts at one stage. I‚Äôm now trying to make up for lost time and I‚Äôm desperate to live my life to the fullest. 

A lot of my friends just don‚Äôt have the same philosophy. When we were at uni, we used to talk about the things we‚Äôd do when we didn‚Äôt have the pressure of deadlines and exams looming over us. Now that we‚Äôve graduated, no one seems to want to actually do anything. Whenever I call or text to make plans, they either just want to stay home or they always seem to have some kind of internship/work responsibilities. I quit my (unpaid) internship last month as it was having a detrimental impact on my mental health. I currently work a low paid, but fulfilling, minimum wage job and I sometimes feel my friends look down on me for that. My shifts follow a ‚Äútwo days on, two days off‚Äù pattern since the work is quite physically demanding. I have more free time than them as a result. I know that this is all probably just a part of growing up, but I‚Äôve not seen them in a month because they‚Äôre all so preoccupied with work. There must be more to life than just going to the pub every now and then. Where did all the spontaneity and lust for life go? I just miss the days when everything, whether it was going on a hike or just going to the supermarket together, was an adventure. 

I know this probably feels like a really pathetic post, but does anyone else feel the same way? How do I find people who carry that kind of spontaneity with them after uni?"
408,"hi
i'm 19 and I'm not going to college this year I've got a whole year to do what I want right now, I have two jobs right now to earn money, but I'm afraid I'm only gonna spend this year working
Do you guys  have things you would have liked to know at 19 because right now I feel very lost 
i don't have any things passionate about and I'm just afraid I'm going to look  back at this time and I think I just wasted a hole year 
So let me know because right now I‚Äôm scared of the future"
409,"I started working 3 months ago as an entry level software developer. It's my first job after graduating college and I started right before the quarantine began.

I've been finding working extremely challenging. Partially working from home, but mostly the transition from school work to work-work. The work is challenging in a way that is nothing like school prepared me for, and I can't help but feel frustrated and dumb, or even that I dont deserve my job. 

Tl;dr Any advice on transitioning from school work to the work a 'real' job requires"
410,"Hello all,

As the title reads I have come to a fork in the road. Continue to be miserable day in and day out and one day blow my brains out, or seek life after school. I am a Biochemist by trade, with a BS in Biochem and a MS in Biomedical Sciences. I was at or near the top of my class in undergrad and middle of the road in grad school. I got into a decent medical school last year and I regret it now. I am 26 so I am a bit older than most of the students in school who are fresh off undergrad. 

&#x200B;

I just want to know what there is out there for me should I choose to drop out and seek other things. Will my degrees land me a job or am I going to be stuck working minimum wage while my student loans choke me to death?"
411,"I keep hearing that the twenties are the best time to date, and if you don't find a romantic partner now then you'll be struggling later on in your thirties because all the ""good options"" are partnered up, etc. Same goes for pressure to get married as more and more of my peers have been doing so, especially during covid, as well as the biological clock for having kids. I'm not sure to what degree the aforementioned statements are accurate, but I have been hearing these same warnings all my life from many different people, so forgive me if I've internalized them somewhat.

I am currently in my mid twenties, just graduated undergrad, and there are so many things I still want to do in my twenties that would mean I have to put serious dating (looking for a life partner) on hold until I'm around thirty. For example, I've always wanted to spend part of my time traveling, or doing an extended volunteering program abroad for several years, then return to the US and focus on my career. Getting into a serious relationship before taking on something like this just isn't feasible as I will have to spend all that time away from them (having done long distance in the past, I refuse to do so again).

However, I'm hesitant to strive for these personal goals because of the ""warnings"" I mentioned in the first paragraph. The thought of getting into to the (serious) dating scene post-thirty and potentially having the most compatible partners in my age group removed from the dating pool by then, and having to either settle or just go through life without a partner, terrifies me. 

That is my biggest anxiety regarding my twenties.

Does it make sense to scrap some of my more ambitious goals in order to take dating seriously earlier on in my twenties, and ensure I don't end up alone?  I'm wondering if these concerns are valid, and whether others feel some semblance of them too. If so, please feel free to share."
412,Ive decided to take a gap year after high school but now with coronavirus and everything I don't really know what to look forward to or what to expect. I would have probably traveled or joined local groups but sadly those things aren't really an option now. So what is something I can do during gap year. I dont want to just waste my time.
413,"Graduated a month ago with an IT degree. I have been applying on/off for a year and nothing more than interviews but that's an improvement compared to spring 2019. I have gotten offers for sales/marketing jobs that interest me but I really just want to work IT. However, IT jobs don't want me... I lack experience and have made my resume as attractive as possible. Been studying to improve my technical skills but it doesn't happen overnight. I'm a genuine person so my family/friends have noticed that I have been acting different lately. Waking up to rejections in such a ""growing"" field is really getting to me. Does anyone have any suggestions/tips to help my mindset? I know this situation isn't unique but being the youngest in my friend group and seeing everyone else find jobs kinda sucks."
414,If you're like 25-35 I feel it's this weird in between phase. You're not a kid anymore but you don't feel like an adult yet. You're too old to be living like you're still in college but you don't feel like you have much in common with older generations. Some people are still single and some people have kids. You don't have the same sense of community or direction like you did in school. Less people to guide you or look up to. It's a lonely world for young adults.
415,"This is a strange question but I got offered a job months ago before my graduation in May, and I will be start this coming Monday. I am grateful I was given the opportunity but ever since I got the offer I kept wondering ""How did I get this job?"". The interview for this job was a 3 part interview, and I don't think I displayed any trait of the type of person that should receive this job. I really want to know why the hiring manager chose me but I never found the right time to ask. Is it ever bad to ask this kind of question to a manager? How does one even bring up this question to their manager?"
416,"I never expected life after graduation would be easy, I knew it was gonna be rough. What I didn't expect was all my hard work I did prior to graduation basically mean nothing, on top of all the personal/family issues I have to deal with.

* I worked hard in college, graduated with a relevant major and minor, interned for three summers and even worked remotely while at college at a company in my field and did very well there.
* Company I interned for has started downsizing and letting people go, so couldn't offer me anything. Said they would recommend me but haven't seen anything come out of that.
* Been applying for jobs non-stop since graduation last May, my last and only interview was back in October, don't even get rejection emails most of the time.
* Took every bit of advice I could get, one person's advice often contradiction another's. Have re-written my resume and cover letters more times than I can count. Still don't see any improvements.
* Currently living at home with Dementia ridden mother and a father with anger and verbal abuse issues.
* Currently working for parent's flower shop business that's slowly failing, where I mostly just get chewed out by father or handling problems that father can't be bothered to deal with. If I literally wasn't there my parents would be hopeless, and they've already pushed away most of my family including my older brother so I'm all they have left. They've been trying to sell the shop for a while, but no one is interested in buying.
* Gets paid below minimum wage under the table in order to keep business afloat, most of which goes towards student loans and savings. At this rate I still won't be able to reasonably move out in a long while.
* Business has been particularly slow lately due to Coronavirus, may also be losing business because we are a Korean owned business. 
* Have a feeling that I'm especially not getting responses to job applications because of Asian last name, maybe I'm just being paranoid but considering I never hear back or know what I'm doing wrong, it could very well be the reason now.
* I know because I'm young and relatively healthy I am the least susceptible to Coronavirus, but I also don't have health insurance and live in the USA so it's still scary.
* I also have a past of severe depression and anxiety, and because I don't have health insurance I can't afford seeking professional help. I also wouldn't have the time either because I'm too busy trying to keep family business afloat everyday.

Overall, I just feel hopeless and tired everyday. Honestly what I really want is to just finally move out and be as far away from my parents as possible. I can't take the constant stress and verbal abuse at home and at work, day in and day out. But I can't do anything because I'm trapped trying to prop up this failing business where I don't make enough money to move out soon. Unless I can get a different decent job, which I can't get because I'm not getting responses to job applications. Everyday suicide just seems more and more like an appealing option."
417,Still don‚Äôt have a job and still feeling a little bit hopeless but I just want to thank all the kind people here for the support and advice. It inspired me to contact volunteer groups near me to build my resume and I also applied to more jobs. Haven‚Äôt heard back from anything but at least I‚Äôm trying! Hopefully something good happens.
418,"I hate my life. After I graduated, I was desperate to stay in my uni town, but I had no place to live and no job, so I had to move back in with my parents. The move back pretty much drove me insane, and I've been miserable, lonely and depressed ever since. My parents are hyper-strict and they don't want me anywhere they can't keep an eye on me. All my friends are off living actual adult lives, and I'm just stuck here. I got out in 2017 and moved to a different city, but I got stuck in a demanding retail job and had to move back in July last year because my health was suffering (I have two chronic illnesses on top of everything else). And now COVID's ruining the possibility of me moving out at all. I'm angry and frustrated and I feel like I'm wasting my potential. I wish I knew what to do."
419,"I graduated from a good University in July with a Bachelor's Degree is business and entertainment. Since the entire industry is shut down right now, I have no idea when I will receive a full-time position. The thing is, I have a very good resume and I feel like all my internships have gone towards nothing. Regardless, I have no idea what to do with my life right now and I'm feeling insanely depressed about it. I feel like I am at the ""middle stage"" in my life where I literally have no motivation or anything to live for. I just wake up day after day doing nothing, with the exception of going to the gym and hanging with my dog. Can someone please offer some insight on their similar experiences?"
420,"This is more of a rant that I have to get off my chest. I graduated March 2019 and started to look for a job. By May I had a few side jobs (Bar back, tutor, paid internship) where I felt confident enough to move out of my moms house and live with some college friends in NYC. Rent was 975 a month split 3 ways (it was basically a paycheck and a half) and I barely made ends meet, but I was determined to hold out and find a permanent job. 

In September I got incredibly lucky. I found this temp to perm position for a study abroad company in Manhattan, paid well, and promised a full time position at the end of the term. By January 2020? I felt like I had my life in order. I met a girl from work who was also a temp, we had gone on a few dates, and like I felt like things were finally stable. Then Corona happened. If there is any field that was hurt by COVID, it was study abroad lmao. March came along, no permanent positions were opening up, they asked if I'd like to stay on an extended contract. I said sure because what else could I do? May comes around, Girl I was dating couldn't renew her lease or contract, and moved back home to Georgia. We kinda stopped talking after that. I also couldn't renew my lease because my temp job just wasn't enough money, so I had to basically fuck my friends over and move back home. But I still had a job right? August comes, and my company fired 60% of the staff. All that's left is a couple of departments and a few temps to help with a skeleton crew. Shockingly, they ask AGAIN if I want to extend my contract until March 2021. Again, I say yes.

It's October and everything is like messed up you know? I am incredibly grateful I am able to keep this job, incredibly grateful that my mom has the funds to house and feed me rent free. I'm luckier then my friends who graduated March 2020.  I know compared to many my position is ideal. But damn guys. My life feels like its been completely sidetracked. All the plans I had last October are completely void now. I feel like all the steps I've made have been for nothing, and I'm back to where I was last March. I don't think this company will ever fully hire me, I've been applying to other places but nothing is working, and I have this gut feeling by March 2021 I'll be in the same place I was March 2019. 

Thanks for listening"
421,"Applied online around January. Did 2 interviews, got called back and told they were going to follow up with a 3rd interview and were considering me for ‚Äúmultiple positions‚Äù. 2 weeks later, absolutely nothing. I called and emailed 3 times. Like why do these employers think they have the right to put people through this awful interview process and then just flip off communication like it‚Äôs a light? Should I leave a bad Glassdoor review or wait until they get back to me or what?

I‚Äôm really confused as to why you say it‚Äôs a positive experience, we‚Äôre considering you, then radio silence."
422,"From my interview to now working for 2 weeks, the job is going as expected, although busier than what I expected. More work is fine for me. 

But what was unexpected and unwelcome is my boss not wanting to train a new graduate. She threw me in, expects me to learn something after seeing it once, and screams when things don‚Äôt go right. Everyone has learned on this job by making mistakes and getting yelled at badly by her, not by actually learning. 

It‚Äôs so disappointing. I don‚Äôt know how I could‚Äôve pre screened this during the interview because no one would admit to her bad attitude."
423,
424,"I just got my high school diploma two days ago. At the beginning of high school I realized that after I graduate my life is just fucking over for good. I don't have a plan for the future and I don't have the motivation to have a plan. I never thought about college once because I just don't give a shit about my life. 

And it's because of that that I will spend the rest of my life working minimum wage at McDonald's 24/7 wishing I was dead the whole time. I will never have free time to enjoy myself again. All of my friends will be off at college, getting jobs and then starting a family and they won't have time to talk to me anymore and no one will give a shit about me at all.

I'm barely going to make any money because no one gets a good job with just a high school diploma. I'm going to live in a shitty run down apartment with a 47 year old alcoholic roommate who sleeps on the couch drenched in his own piss and sweat while I sleep on the cold hard wooden floor. After a few months of that I will waste the little money I have on drugs and become homeless and die of a heroin overdose at 19 years old.

I've always imagined life after high school being horrible and seeing the posts on this subreddit just confirms it. I am too depressed to put any effort into being the slightest bit successful and I'm going to lose everything. I'm practically a dead man at this point."

426,"**Background**

I graduated back in May of 2019 with a Management Information Systems degree, with a minor in Finance. I‚Äôve been looking for jobs the past few months, but the best I‚Äôve gotten was a phone interview, and declines. With the phone interview, they stated they would send me to the second stage of the interview process. It‚Äôs been nearly three weeks, and that seems that‚Äôll be non-existent. Because of how the months have gone on, my parents are beginning to become frustrated with me. With this I‚Äôm presented with three options for how I should go about my life.

&#x200B;

**Option 1**

I interned back in the summer with a local business. They stated that they enjoyed my time when I was working for them. As well as, they said that I should come back. I ended on good terms with them. But the problem is‚Ä¶ It has some problems that I‚Äôll break down with bullet points.

&#x200B;

*Pros*

* First full-time job
* Satisfies my parent's needs
* Use of my degree
* Can start earning a paycheck and establish savings
* Short commute of only 15 minutes
* Can finally seem like I have a purpose / can establish myself

&#x200B;

*Cons*

* Company morale is abysmal
* Management is questionable ‚Äì seemed as if people were walking on egg shells
* Former employee said you should seek something better
* No guarantee I‚Äôll be able to return

&#x200B;

**Option 2**

Seek temporary employment at a local store. I know someone who states that they are looking for work. If I were to take this position, I would be using my days off to focus on becoming a business analyst by learning Python, Tableau and other programs.

&#x200B;

*Pros*

* A job
* Quick commute
* Can start establishing a savings
* New environment, new management, new experiences
* Hours will most likely be in the mornings and afternoons. No late night shifts

&#x200B;

*Cons*

* Degree not being used
* Typical near minimum wage job
* More than likely will only be considered part-time employee
* Loss of time to work towards finding a better position / learning on how to become a business analyst

&#x200B;

**Option 3**

The last option is to not seek employment. Continue to push out resumes and learn on how to become a business analyst. Or continue to submit applications to existing positions that I feel I could be a potential candidate for in my current position.

&#x200B;

*Pros*

* Can seek a job that I would be interested in
* New work environment, new employees, new networks
* Full-time employment
* Use of my degree

&#x200B;

*Cons*

* Parents becoming more frustrated with me
* More time will be required in order to find a position
* No income
* My frustration will ever be increasing as the months go on without finding something

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Those are my three options. I‚Äôm not too sure what to do. I want to be able to help my family, so I don‚Äôt seem like a useless person leeching off the backs of those who raised me. I need advice. Please help me.

427,"Hi guys, I'm new to this community but I'm not sure who else to talk to and I'm pretty desperate at this point. 

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Economics and looking back on it, I have a lot of regrets. I'm starting to realize I don't even like Econ, and I only really picked it because I thought it would lead to good money. But I have $40k in debt and I feel like I have nothing to show for it. My mental health wasn't exactly the best before the pandemic, but as you can imagine it's made things much worse. Last spring, things looked like they were finally turning around: I had an internship lined up at a great nonprofit, I was set to graduate in the summer, and things felt alright. Then Covid happened, the internship dried up, and I had to push back my graduation date.

Fast forward to now: I have my diploma, but I work a boring entry level job that has nothing to do with my degree. I don't really have many friends, other than my boyfriend and I don't really talk to my college friends anymore. I feel like I've hit a dead end and my mental health has never been worse. I don't think I've ever been this unhappy in my life. Hell, I don't even know what I want to do anymore. 

I thought about joining the Peace Corps or something similar a lot when I was younger, but I always talked myself out of it for one reason or another. I guess I'm just looking for some kind of experience to meet people, learn a little about myself, maybe even pick up some new skills and travel. I'm really open to anything, and I wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions to get out of this rut I've dug myself in to. 

Sorry if this is kind of long, but I would really appreciate any kind of advice or suggestions!!"
428,"I graduated undergrad in 2019, and lived at home since then, with plans to move to Brooklyn for graduate school in the fall. Due to covid, and the online semester, I will not be moving till December, so I have 3-4 months of living at home.

This past year living at home has been miserable. I have a good relationship with my parents, but I feel like I am still treated like a child. This makes me end up reverting to old bad habits and mindsets I've been moving away from.

Does anyone have any advice on living with your parents? Tips? Things we should talk about? Experiences?"
429,"Hi, everyone. I (23/M) graduated from college in May 2018, and I live with my parents & my brother. I have a full-time job, and I like several things about it (i.e. the commute, schedule, some of the people that I've met at work). I can't reveal too much about my job, though. 

However, (with all due respect to my parents; I love them, and I'm grateful for what they've done) living at home feels like a step back in a lot of ways. During my time in college, I was on my own, and I had the freedom to make my own decisions. I met a lot of great people at my college, and I could find people that shared my interests. At least, I know that my college days had people who were willing to talk about music with me. 

Currently, though, it feels like I've drifted away from several of my college friends. Other than today, I haven't spoken to/hung out with several of my college friends/acquaintances in months. I haven't seen my best friend from college in more than a year, and he has a girlfriend & a job. Nothing against him, but I don't know when I'll be able to hang out with him, and my best friend from college doesn't live close to me. 

There is one college friend that I've seen more than once after graduation, but he is the only college friend that I've hung out with more than once, after my graduation. None of my college friends live close to me, and I have to rely on my high school friends if I want to hang out with someone that's close to me. 

Also, I can't be a true adult, since I live at my house. My job is fine, but a lot of the independence that I had in college is gone, and college has turned me into a different person. Moving out isn't an option for now, and I like music & classic films. I can't really talk to my parents & my siblings about bands such as the Mars Volta & Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and it feels awkward to like bands such as Husker Du, Wire & Joy Division.  

I've talked to people at work, and I've gotten phone numbers from my co-workers, but I haven't made true friends from work yet, and I'm wary about introducing some of my co-workers into my personal life. 

I'm single, as well, and I know that my immediate family wouldn't be into older films. 

Do you guys have advice for me?"
430,"As the sidebar says, this is a place where people can discuss life after school (high school, college, and beyond). Here you can discuss and ask questions about the social, emotional, career, and overall lifestyle transition and challenges that come after graduation. People who have not graduated are also welcome here.

Thank you all for your support thus far! I am hoping we can create a nice, supportive community.

431,"I was a Computer Science major that needed to keep a 3.5 for my scholarship.  I was programming and doing homework around the clock.  No time for fun or weekends.  Constantly burnt out.

Yesterday after work, I engaged in an old hobby I haven't been able to do for four years.  I live in my own 2BR apartment as opposed to the 3BR I shared with five other people.  I don't have panic attacks about my code not working.  I have money to treat myself with.

Sometimes it gets a little lonely, but I will take the loneliness 1000 times over the stress that I felt in college.

I am free."
432,"Hello all, I am graduating in May and am returning back to my hometown for a job. I will graduate towards the end of May so I will start my job in June. I have always planned on moving out after college to my own apartment. I love my family but I hate living at home sometimes (during breaks) because of how I revert back to my highschool self when I live here. I get very depressed, I dread talking to my family sometimes, I get anxiety whenever I hear someone walking by my door. I get annoyed at how my family eats unhealthy, how they don‚Äôt know how to make decisions. Etc. I just get a lot of anxiety when I am home. 

My dad keeps lecturing me about saving as much money as possible while I‚Äôm young so that I can have a good future for myself. He wants me to live at home and pay off all my student debt as quickly as possible and save up as much money as I can. While I get that, I just really want to live on my own. I‚Äôll be making $62k a year and I have ~$30k of debt which is very high for starting and very low for debt I think. I am extremely grateful for everything my parents have done for me I am just conflicted. I am a people pleaser and have always done what my dad expects of me (engineer, golf scholarship, etc.) and I am tired of it. 

So, what would y‚Äôall do? I will be in the St.Louis area for living.

***EDIT: Thank you everyone for all of your great responses!! I truly appreciate it and it has really made me think hard about where I want to see myself in the coming years. With that being said- I have another scenario to add. Basically another thing holding me back is I would love for my SO to come live with me for 3 months this summer if he gets an internship here. I think he could live with me in my parents house if we really needed to but I don‚Äôt want to subject him to that low key harassment and awkwardness of my family. (also my family is very catholic and he would have to live in a separate room basically) If I move out- I would have someone helping me pay half rent for 3 months. (He still has another year left in school after me). Obviously I am going to discuss this with him but your advice has brought up so many great points that I haven‚Äôt thought of yet! Basically- if he doesn‚Äôt get an internship here/ decides not to find a summer job here then I will just live with my family. He can totally find a summer job here or get transferred from where he works now to somewhere here. 
Someone also brought up a great point that I could plan more travel if I live at home. This is a great point- I could save money to visit with friends and to visit my SO more in college next year while we are doing long distance- any thoughts on this? Also- I know supposedly we aren‚Äôt supposed to make decisions based on boys or whatever but I‚Äôm an adult and I love this guy and he‚Äôs in my future (yes things can change but that‚Äôs not where we are right now)

**Summary: live with parents after graduation (Job in hometown) or rent an apartment with boyfriend for 3 months and then alone until he graduates in a year?**"
433,There's a case for both sides. If you live with your parents you can save a lot of money till you can live on your own. Unfortunately you still have to live under your parent's rules and you'll be scolded by most people.  Maybe you might struggle more financially living on your own but you'll have your own place. What's your take on this?
434," 

What I liked about the school structure is you always knew what the next step was. You stay in a particular class for a certain amount of time, you know when you'll get a break from school, you go on to the next grade, and eventually you graduate. There was predictability and I knew there was an end goal.

I find myself in the real world just being stuck in limbo with no direction, goal, or certainty of what's to come. Ya you can't predict everything but there has to be some certainty in your life. You can waste your life at one job for years because there was no end goal to reach. You don't even realize it until time passes.

Maybe I just haven't found the the right job but I can't stand this uncertainty of where my life is headed. I'm kind of bitter to that nobody told me and I have little guidance from anyone to direct me. Now it's just well you figure it out. Ok thanks."
435,My senior year of college got put online in 2020 and my internship got canceled. All of my senior year plans and contacts with professors were ruined as I went back home with my abusive family and graduated with no job lined up. I considered doing grad school but hesitated about the about of debt (got accepted but no financial aid). My family doesn‚Äôt like me leaving the house or even leaving my room and I haven‚Äôt worked or talked to people since. I‚Äôve applied for some jobs online related to my degree but haven‚Äôt heard back. I tried to find internships but they all require you to be a junior or senior etc. I‚Äôm completely lost and it feels like my work in school was for nothing

437,"For me, since I was a kid, college was always 'it'. 'oh its so far away, I don't need to worry about it'. And then I got older. And older. And here I am. I've graduated. I have a job. I'm doing well. But I'm unsure what to do with my life. Do I travel? Do I get new hobbies? Do I move? There's so many things to do. But I can't figure out what to do either? What have you guys done in this situation?"
438,"After turning 18 during this time of a pandemic, I have taken some time and realized that high school was not it for me. I first started off great enrolled in honors level courses with cross country and track & field mixed and even started  a pretty good social circle. Sophomore year, I ended up dating, grades dropping, and even took money out of my parents to go out and spend money on gifts. Junior year we broke up, I got depressed, joined way too many different social circles, and even flunked out of my honors-courses to join regular classes. Senior year, full senioritis hits. I merely didn't do anything to save my grades, smoked, and even started a photography instagram for the hell of it all while I was smoking (which although the photos came out great, there was little to no success out of it). Now as I hit the age of 18, I have merely nothing now. From a 3.5 to a 2.35 GPA student who always blew his parents money on weed and film with almost no friends. Some even say I'm too smart for my own good. Everyone knows I'm smart to a certain extent but I never applied myself to put in the work or get help when needed. I was completely blind sighted by the fact and now as I see students around campus going to their Universities in their little dorms, it just makes me really sad and almost a complete scumbag due to the fact I really never developed a true social circle, work ethic, balance, or even study skills. I've been looking at the Phi Theta Kappa's scholarships to help pay off for the in-state universities here just so I could make my parents proud. I don't know though. Is this worth it? How have any of you guys controlled hitting rock bottom?"

I really want to move out, but if I do that I can't get a car and if I get a car I can't move out. After graduating community college with an associates in Web & Interactive media I haven't found any relevant jobs. I got super depressed right after graduating and couldn't find any work I qualify for. I'm not even sure if I even want a front end development job or if I can handle one. Even if I do jump back in I have to spend another huge chunk of time relearning, plus employers are gonna see a 3 year gap from when I graduated and started looking for work. They're going see me as either lazy or mentally unstable. I thought about doing art commissions as a side business, but building a social media following is impossible. I feel like I have no skills or talents or charisma. How do people just know what to do with themselves?"
441,"After graduating in September, due to circumstances I‚Äôve been forced into taking a gap year. I had already had an early acceptance into my dream university before I even completed my exams, despite this I managed to receive a much better ATAR than expected (despite not even needing it due to having an early acceptance to university) and proved my parents wrong that hey I‚Äôm kinda smart at times? 

Regardless, it‚Äôs been a couple months into my gap year and I‚Äôve been doing a lot of thinking, I really don‚Äôt want to go to university... Thanks to COVID I haven‚Äôt seen any one my own age this whole year, however I‚Äôve been able to channel this loneliness and emotional uncertainty into my music. 

The course in which I‚Äôve been accepted into is for music production however as much as I know it would be useful, I‚Äôm just not sure the whole university thing is MY thing? Naive as it sounds I‚Äôve been really working on music and am figuring out how to publish my music and hopefully start getting stuff out there. 

Ultimately, I feel like I‚Äôm ready to be thrown in the deep end and push myself with this aspect and was wondering if anyone has advice in whether or not university is something I NEED.

448,"Let me just preface this by saying I just turned 27 two days ago, and this is something that has been on my mind lately. As a so-called millennial, I feel with the advent of the internet and technological boom, that it has been much harder to find a job. People bounce around, stay for a year, and switch jobs frequently. My generation does not like to take a lot of flack. They have ulterior motives. Their in jobs less frequently, or don't like to work.

When my parents were my age, they had and held jobs for many years. Some even retired in that first job of theirs. They had kids younger, they were simply full of bliss. They created jobs or built companies.

I always wonder if life was much easier when the internet was not available. It seems because of the internet, of course, we have found success, but we have also seen incredible anxiety, depression, and much more worry.

I'm sure they probably felt the same way I did now, but I suppose the times were different.  
But not having been a part of that generation, I can't be too sure. So I'm hoping those older than myself can chime in."

So last week i graduated from ""high school"" (FWI, i'm not from the US). I'm finally free from the chains of a school system, and i'm staring the feel the ""freedom"" that such a happening can give, and its both really sad, but also a very exiting time. I'm not gonna see my friends as much i used to, witch really saddens me, my core happiness comes from being around other people, and just making memories.  And now i'll just see them a few times a month, at most. but i don't want to be sad that this phase of my life has ended. i want to be happy that it happened. but my question to y'all reading this is, what pieces of your ""old life"" as a student still in school, remained in your life as it is right now?

455,"I work in advertising, specifically media. I'm only entry-level, despite being out of college for a couple of years. I love my job and my field, but there's not a lot to do. When I was a barista, I was often busy. It was physical labor, retail, but I could feel at the end of a long workday, that I really truly did accomplish something, whether that was making sales, or the act of making a beverage to drink and serve to the public, but I did feel I was important to the team.

Here at my agency however, I'm where I wanted to be when I was a barista. But, finding I'm not motivated. I have less work to do then when I was a barista, and for all of the talk in agencies about having too much work to do, and everything being due yesteryear, I can't find a single thing to do. I've asked my supervisor and my director, they say it's coming and just wait. Be patient, but it's been three-months, and here I am redditing at work. 

It's hard to look busy and constantly trying to act motivated, when you have nothing to do. I wake up, look at my 3-emails that came in and mentally log-off for the day. 

What do I do?"
456,"*mainly a rant*
24F in Los Angeles area, saying life is tough here is an extreme understatement. Just like most of you in this sub, I followed everything by the book we were given.
Go to college, get a degree, attend resume seminars, practice mock interviews, apply to jobs, accept jobs, and work hard.
I got my BA in Communications and studied all the right things to say during interviews. It worked, I got a job as soon as I graduated. I was making $24 per hour with full benefits as a recruiter and had the highest numbers of hires per month, every month in my company. Yet I still couldn't apply to any studio apartment within a 15 mile radius from my office because my income after taxes is not 3x the rent, mind you, they required us to work in the office even when the job can 100% be done remotely. On top of working 8 hours a day, I was doing a 40 minute commute one way from my mom's place. Sheesh 47 hours per week towards a job that underpaid me.
The best thing I got out of the job was insight that I should have received from all my past career counselors. As a recruiter, I would post on Indeed a job for HR, payroll, or marketing and I would get 100 applications overnight (during peak covid layoffs I would hit 300 applications). But when I posted a job for Nursing, Dental Hygiene, or Physical Therapy and I would get 2-3 applicants in a week. I'd be lucky if someone hadn't already hired them by the time I reach out.
With those numbers, of course supply and demand, the STEM positions were getting paid triple than the business and marketing positions. I asked for a huge raise because I reached my annual review with a high rating. But the raise they gave me was only enough to match inflation so technically I didn't get a raise, and companies get away with underpaying because someone else is willing to do it..
Started going back to school again, 3 weeks in now and majoring in Nursing this time around. If only they told me sooner that it was my only choice to live comfortably in California I would have done it the first time around.

Edit- this is a rant, I'm okay on the advice guys, Im truly happy with my decision and so are most of my classmates. Half of the people in my class all have their bachelors already, had a job, learned the same lesson as me and now back to school :)"
457,"I chose my degree without a set job in mind because I wanted to graduate as a STEM major. To prove to myself and others that I was smart enough to do it. Seriously.
 
After I got my degree I went into different programs for things and kept dropping out because I realized I don't want to work in the science field. So basically years and thousands of dollars (including college). Useless.

Now I'm in a job that still doesn't pay enough to allow me to move out from my parents'. 

I want to tell 18 year old me to have just pursued the field she was interested in despite the prospects of low pay (graphic design).

I don't want to wake up anymore. I have headaches all the time. 

This might be the year I kill myself. 

I don't know what to do. Going back to school isn't an option rn because I want to have a full time job that will support me first. 

Please. Someone help me."

It seems like there's people doing so much more and better than I could. So I don't know... Sorry I just needed to get this out of my chest"
459,"I‚Äôve been interviewing for this small company. It‚Äôd be my first job out of college, and it‚Äôs taken me a long time to even land an interview at all. To be honest, both of the interviews I‚Äôve had have gone well and the interviewers seem to like me. The problem is, there are a few things about the position/boss that make me uncomfortable: 

1) They seem to not have figured out how I‚Äôm going to be paid.  

- This is an on call, part time position (10-20 hours a week). However I‚Äôd have to be available from 8-5, for any calls that came in. 

- During the first interview they said 1 call would equal 15 mins of pay. The second interview, when the subject came up again, they said ‚Äúwe‚Äôd have to talk about that because what if a phone call is only a one minute voicemail?‚Äù They also said that when I‚Äôm not on the phone that I‚Äôll need to use an app to track how much time something took in order to calculate my pay. 

I get the concept of being paid for the actual amount of time I spend on work, but it all just seems unsteady and the lack of assuredness on one of the bosses‚Äô part worries me. 

2) I don‚Äôt have a good feeling about one of the bosses. She seemed to like me during the interview but,

- she talked badly about a previous employee to me during my interview.   
She said the job requires you to be able to stop what your doing and go into service mode immediately (fair), and some people can‚Äôt do it (also true). She then went into how she had a girl working for her who was ‚Äúbrusque on the phone with clients and no shade but that person does not work for her anymore.‚Äù (Yikes.) 

- she‚Äôll send multiple emails if she doesn‚Äôt get an immediate response. I‚Äôm talking, emailing again about the same thing within less than 24 hours. And in these follow up emails, she‚Äôll say stuff like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre still interested ... if not, we understand‚Äù 

- she‚Äôs come off a bit brusque in emails as well. 
Ex: my computer froze during our first video interview. During the few minutes we were disconnected, she sends me an email that starts with  ‚ÄúI think you know you‚Äôve dropped.‚Äù I know everyone emails differently but that felt abrupt to me. 

Tomorrow she wants to talk on the phone. I have a feeling she might offer me the position. I‚Äôve been out of college for a year and haven‚Äôt found a job yet so this would finally be something. 

Plus, I‚Äôve wanted to work so I can start saving money to get away from my emotionally abusive mother who‚Äôs shat on me in the past for not being employed. My family is also no longer taking social distancing seriously. My goal was to get two part time jobs to equal one full time income (if nothing full time came through) and get my own place. 

But with all the stuff I mentioned, my gut is screaming that taking the job would be a bad choice. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve worked before and I‚Äôve never had this sense of dread about a job offer or boss. Besides, if the job is on call, how would getting a second job work? 

I‚Äôm scared that if I turn down the job though, my mom will shit on me the next time she gets mad and my friends will lose sympathy for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do."

462,"I see a lot of posts about people not having an easy time after college, which i can understand, but are there people here who are really excited about it (or even better people who enjoy it currently)?

the idea of working 9-5 sounds so appealing. i feel like with college I never truly felt like i had any free time, just time i was taking away from working on assignments/studying. i guess the best way to describe is i felt ‚Äúguilty‚Äù.

but with a job you do your work and you leave, and the rest of the day is up to you. im planning on getting more into rock climbing when i move to DC in the summer (i started climbing in my last semester) and i honestly can‚Äôt wait. work, then go home and do things i enjoy with nothing in the back of my mind.

and thats not forgetting the financial independence. i was fortunate that my dad set aside money for college for me, so i wont have any loans. i‚Äôm hoping i‚Äôll enjoy things more because i earned the money im spending, and not because something was given to me.

and the scheduling/routine of everything i think will help me a lot too.

i hope that all made sense haha, but anyways yeah im super excited :)"
463,"After graduating, it's natural for many people to just lose contact. Maybe they're moving back home, or starting a new job. Perhaps they are traveling or going on a mission.

465,"I graduated with a BA in psychology in Spring 2019 at the age of 21. I‚Äôve been out of college now for about a year exactly with a degree but still work for Trader Joe‚Äôs. I got the job almost 5 years ago when I first started college just as a part time job while I was going through school. Now that I have graduated I have transitioned to full time. I do enjoy my job (anyone who has worked for Trader Joe‚Äôs can relate when I say that it really is a great place to work), however, I can‚Äôt escape this feeling that I need more out of life. As if I‚Äôm not thriving enough. 

I feel that I haven‚Äôt found something I‚Äôm truly passionate about enough to want to do for a career. I like my current job but I don‚Äôt see myself making a career out of Trader Joe‚Äôs. However, I haven‚Äôt found something yet that I‚Äôm ready to make a career switch for. I‚Äôm happy for now but I‚Äôm afraid of ‚Äúgetting stuck‚Äù there in the future. 

In my free time I will spend some time on sites like LinkedIn and Job Monster looking at/ applying for jobs that may sound interesting. So far nothing has really ‚Äújumped out at me‚Äù where I had this gut feeling it was something I really wanted to do. That being said, I have applied for jobs and had interviews in different fields. The common trend of all those jobs is that they all revolve around some sort of customer service. I enjoy helping others and I feel I possess advanced social skills but I am unsure if customer service is truly what I‚Äôm looking for out of a career.

I like psychology and have considered grad school but my problem with grad school right now is I do not know what field of psychology I want to pursue (or even if I want to pursue psychology as a career at all). I was able to get my bachelors degree without accumulating a lot of debt so before I go through grad school and put myself $30,000-$50,000 in debt, I want to make sure I‚Äôm fully committed to whatever I‚Äôm in school for. 

All through college I told myself that I had time to figure out what I wanted to do but now here I am one year after college and still no clue. I feel fortunate that I have a job where I‚Äôm currently happy but I think this can only keep me feeling satisfied for so long. I guess the advice I‚Äôm asking for is, has anyone felt similar and can relate? How did you find the perfect career (for those that love their job)? Are there things I‚Äôm doing/ not doing that could better help me find where I want to take my life from here?"
466,"So I'm a 17M graduating High School in 3 months. I have no idea where to go or what to do.

I don't have family or friends to seek guidance on this so I'm asking Reddit of course, naturally. Most of my family have stayed in our little hometown and have gotten married, kids, 9-5 job, etc at a young age. I have never wanted that life but I also don't know what to do with my life so you see the little pickle I'm in. I don't have someone to mentor me. My parents have been too busy working on their own lives to even prepare me for this. I've lived with my grandmother all my life and she didn't do much either. She did put a roof over my head and food in my mouth so I'm grateful for that. 

I want to travel to NYC and go into a acting school. Now I don't expect to be the next A-list actor in Hollywood, I just like the community and lifestyle they live. The only problem is I don't even have enough money for a ticket to New York if I were to be accepted into one of the schools. Also NYC is a very expensive place to live and even more so when my entire family is dirt poor. If I did get to New York; get a full time job and somehow afford a apartment there, acting schools are expensive. 

I am jealous of most big actors because their families are usually people that have been in the business and started them out as actors at a young age or family that were finiacially stable/free. Not hating, they still worked hard to be where they're at but I wish I was given the same opportunities they had at a young age.

So I thought about a local college but I don't know what I want to go to college for and don't want to go just to go. Building debt at 18 isn't a very keen idea for me personally. A community college would be cheap but still have no idea what to go for. 

Now I'm stuck thinking I'm going to have to stay in my hometown. I thought about getting a part time job,investing all of my time starting a drop shipping business, and getting acting experience through local work/plays. But I'm afraid I'll get stuck in my hometown forever trying to do that.

Thank you for your time"
467,"I (26m) have come to the unfortunate realization that after college there really is no type of opportunity like study abroad as an adult. Unless your company lets you travel or you can find a job abroad that pays like an American one.

It makes me sad that I never took the opportunity to do it in college. I regret it every day of my adult life now. But alas."
468,"I graduated a couple years ago from a university in a relatively isolated town that does not offer much to young people/ college grads. As a result, upon graduation most of my friends dispersed to other more promising cities to start their careers, like NYC, Seattle, LA, SF, Boston, etc.

I did the same and moved several states over, far away from my family and hometown friends, to pursue a new start in a bigger city, where I knew next to nobody. After being here a few years, I still find it challenging to build and maintain new friendships.

On the other hand, I know several people who attended schools in cities like NYC or Washington DC, and after graduation, simply stayed put and found one of the many jobs the city had to offer. It‚Äôs no coincidence that most of their college friends did the same.

I can‚Äôt help but feel a bit jealous that I have to struggle so hard to make friends while these contacts of mine graduate and basically have their friendship network built-in from the start. They are roommates, hang out every week, and sometimes even hop on a train to spend a weekend visiting their other friend groups in nearby cities, since the east coast infrastructure is so well connected. It‚Äôs even more difficult for me considering how easy it was to make lifelong friends in college and how much harder it seems to be to do so post grad.

Not sure where I‚Äôm going with this but I guess I‚Äôm just feeling lonely that all my good college friends are dispersed all over the country and that maybe I could have had an easier time if I‚Äôd just picked a school located in a central city somewhere."
469,"So I graduated in May this year after slogging for over 7 years because of mental health problems so I already feel like I've fallen way behind.  Now that I'm done, especially in this economic climate, I feel like I made a terrible choice with my major. I didn't enjoy most of it but also there are practically no mechanical engineering jobs in Australia that doesn't require to be a permanent resident or citizen. As much as I don't want to continue with mechanical, I want to get a PR and that would require me to have a mechanical engineering job (point system and everything). And if I have to leave I'll end up in Sweden. I don't mind it but I'll feel like an outsider there and no friends. Also I get intense seasonal depression which is a big reason for me to not go back to Sweden.

But even if I didn't do mechanical engineering, I don't know what I'd want to do. I've no goals or career interests. So chose a STEM degree for safety sake. Maybe should've done computer science.
I do want to help people but talking to people constantly drains me. That's why I didn't choose any people centric career path. However, I'm decent at management and negotiations. Or at least I can somewhat get it done.

With the pandemic and impending feeling of doom in a country that I wish was my home but isn't, job hunt didn't go well and then I gave up. I haven't applied to anything in 2 months cause I don't feel fit for any mechanical roles but I don't have skills for something else either. I've been putting off modifying my resume even, and then my mental health took a dip and it's all gone south.

I'm trying to do some coursera courses in supply chain analytics and just data analysis and BI cause I think it's okay. Still don't think I like it per se. I also don't know how much depression clouds all these judgements.
Maybe from there I'll delve in more data analysis or ml or cloud computing? Idk. They all seem either hard or dry. So upskilling in my own time doesn't feel good or useful.
But if I shift career paths, it would mean I won't be eligible for a PR. So odd cross road. And starting over in Sweden terrifies me.

But also even if I'm upskilling, I feel scared like it's pointless. I don't think any career would really be fulfilling for me so it's far far fetched. So I basically want to do something that gets me a PR and then financial independence.

I know im rambling. But basically I've no path or any idea how to navigate all this."
470,"It's not that I can't talk to anybody, I can certainly do that, it's just harder to make close friends. People are in and out of your life so quick nowadays. I have no problem talking to random people I see at social events but it's hard to get it further than surface level talking. 

It's more natural when you see people over and over again and become familar with them . There's no room or time for a relationship to grow which is absolutely necessary. I feel so helpless and lonely."

I‚Äôm currently entering my first yr of university after transferring from another because of financial reasons. I do have some interest in what I‚Äôm majoring in and have a career goal in mind, but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm 100% set on yet. I compare myself to my friends who are majoring in stuff like engineering and business and envy how they seem to have way more options, whereas I, who not only has a more limited selection in terms of jobs, is also not 100% interested/set on anything. This has really caused a lot of anxiety concerning my future. 

I know there are some people who say at the end of the day, your degree, what you study and your gpa ultimately don‚Äôt matter, but is that really the case? Every time I try and tell myself that I‚Äôm on my own path and to stop comparing myself to others, I always end up comparing myself and envying what I don‚Äôt have.

473,"I got a job in the heart of my birth city (Chitown)  where a lot of my friends are moving to. Its a two year training program so luckily they‚Äôll teach me on the job and Ill get paid a generous salary on top. 

However, I feel like Im gonna miss out. For example, ive always wanted to be a freer spirit than Ive ever had the opportunity to do. I had plans to go live in europe for a couple months post grad but those fell through with corona. Im not sure why, but California specifically seems like the place I should be. Everytime I tell someone I want to move to San Fran or LA they tell me im crazy and LA sucks and Id be homeless in san fran. They‚Äôre probably right, but at 22 I feel like Im in the prime of my life and I dont want to blink and miss it.

Dont get me wrong; I got a couple things that will keep me busy in my free time. My friend is an aspiring musician and he asked me to manage him in Chicago. I got a few hobbies I want to get into, like VR coding and music making on my synth, but Im just worried im missing my opportunity. 

Ive always been jealous of seeing these kids on social media just pack shit up and live in a house of strangers and grind. Its an easy way to push yourself as a person and also make friends and live life experiences along the way. Ive gone my whole life listening to the advice of my parents. Now that Im at the end; I feel the need to jump and I just dont know if I can or should."
474,"I graduated from college in December 2019 with a degree in Occupational health and safety and landed a job at the beginning of March. Before I graduated, I had already lost a decent amount of interest in this field but I was so close to graduating, I felt I couldn't switch. Now that I've gotten a job in this field, I've lost any kind of interest in it. The hours are uncertain but usually long, I'm not really being trained on what I was brought on for and I'll be having to move 3hrs from home for when that project starts. 

With this, at the end of my college career, Graphic Design really interested me. A good buddy of mine has a job in it and even with the monotony he told me about, it seemed right up my alley. My college offers online courses for it so I could probably just tough this job out while doing those classes to pay for it while also paying my student loans. 

I'm sorry for the long-ish post. I just kind of want some insight on if this would be a bad idea. I did some research into it and it'd only take me 3-4 semesters to complete the program if my previous credits carry over and I take 15-18 hours a semester and possibly do summer classes to shorten it further.

477,"Apologizing ahead of time for how lengthy of a read this may be... sorry Reddit!

So a little bit of background - I'm 23 years old. I work as an Accountant for a manufacturing company handling mostly Accounts Payables tasks and I'm also a part-time grad student for a Masters of Accounting program at a local state university. Got my current job several months after graduating from college and been there for a little over a year now. So far, I seem to have it alright. However, I just can't help but feel like i'm completely lost with my life.

I'm currently having doubts regarding my career path and whether the Accounting area is for me. My current role, while it pays alright as a recent college graduate, is extremely repetitive and monotonous. 9- 5, doing the same tasks everyday, etc. Accounting is also a pretty dull field to go into, in my own personal opinion (no shade to anyone who flourishes in the field though!!). I decided to go into Accounting earlier in my college career because I had no clue what else I wanted to do with my life and I was pressured by the people around me to pick a path, or a major in this case, that would lead to financial and employment stability. I was also, and frankly still am, insecure about my intellectual capability that I went ahead and decided to pursue a path that wasn't as hard as engineering, healthcare, etc. So, the business area it was! But I digress.

Anyway, what i'm trying to say is that after having gone through college, gaining some work exposure, and now in a master's program for a field i'm not particularly even excited about... I just feel like i'm completely lost with my life and I still don't know what to do or what any other alternatives, if any, there are. I feel like i'm just going through the motions and doing what is societally expected of me.

It also doesn't help that I'm so lonely. Oh my god! I could write a whole book on this. But to keep it short and simple, I don't have many friends. I have a group of 3 friends from work that I hang out with occasionally and a friend from undergrad that I hang out with during the weekends. But, I live alone and mostly 24/7 I don't interact face-to-face with another human being. Covid has definitely been a factor to this, but even before Covid I still felt lonely. All of my family lives out of state, so I'm all alone in the Mid-West. Haven't been able to see relatives for almost a year now for obvious reasons. So, just so you guys can have an idea of what a regular day for me looks like, it's: wake up, go to work until 5 (work from home currently), walk and play with my dog, cook dinner, and work on school stuff. My weekends have been mostly filled with running errands and catching up on school stuff from the week past. I've been trying to be cautious due to Covid, but it's been starting to take a toll on me mentally for the past month. I feel burnt out and unmotivated in general.

So, you may ask, what the reason for writing this was... but it was simply just to rant to internet strangers who could relate to this or to give out useful advice (highly appreciated!). If anyone has gone through something similar before, I would love to hear anything you would have to say. I also want anyone to know that whom may be dealing with a crisis in life, you are definitely not alone! I guess I'm going through a quarter-life crisis to say the least."
478,"It's completely normal to feel the blues after college during your first few years in the work force. Some days are better than others, but the transitional pains are OKAY! It's suppose to be this way. Remember the first month during college? You were terrified away from home and without your high school friends. You were meeting new people and nothing felt familiar. You simply missed high school and your family. Same things applies to post grad life. I remembering PSY learning that you tend to only remember the good times and over emphasize it, when in reality, there were also days of depression during college. You had moments of sadness while in college! While working 8-5 is vastly different from being 5 mins away from your best friends. The stress of finals, projects, and homework are gone. Yes you have work, but you get paid. It's all about balance. Find things you enjoy doing and accept that life will be a lot slower than you imagined. College just distracted you from reality, use this introspection to better yourself. In the same way you drifted away from your hs school friends during college, the same will happen. Go out and meet people. Find new hobbies and talk to everyone. The greatest thing about adulthood is you **don't have to hangout with people in your age group.** Your friends can encompass anyone from 18 to 80 year old. Some of my friends are 4-5 years older than men and it's awesome. They offer lots of wisdom and have faith that in due time you'll find your stride. Best of luck!"

480,"I‚Äôm (23M) on my last engineering semester, working on my final project and doing my final required internship at a big company with high chances of staying there after graduating. 

Most of the days when I‚Äôm on my way home from work, I start thinking about how regular college life was easier (doing stuff, going on dates, enjoying hobbies, etc), and how this 9-5 office routine is going to become my life from now on, and it makes me really sad, leaving me on the verge of tears when I get home (which I hide because I don‚Äôt want my mom freaking out)

How do I cope with the feeling that I have so little time for myself on weekdays, and that life is gonna be like that for a long time? It doesn‚Äôt help that literally everyone complaints about it and how ‚Äúyou need to enjoy college while you can because after that you‚Äôre gonna start working blabla‚Ä¶‚Äù

Is everybody really that unhappy?

Sometimes I think I should work a couple years to gather money and simultaneously work on art stuff (I like to make music and write stuff, stories, poems,etc) or become a cook (I‚Äôm kinda good at it) or travel around the world and fake my death/dissapearance to start from scratch because I feel like it‚Äôs either dying in an office or making the effort of living out of something that really moves my heart."
481,"I have been an anxious mess this past year. No jobs due to covid, and the ones I‚Äôve interviewed for I‚Äôve been turned away. I‚Äôm terrible at interviews to the point where I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get a job. Thinking about going to grad school but my confidence has gotten so bad that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get in so I‚Äôm debating whether even applying. Very stuck at the moment and feel helpless."
482,"I have a bachelors in applied arts and science, which doesn‚Äôt do much for me outside of checking off a college box. I‚Äôm really interested in going back to school for computer science.

484,"So I graduated college this past May with a degree in French. A lot of people told me one of two things: 1. ""Oh wow, if you know another language you'll be able to work anywhere! Language opens a lot of doors !!"" Or ""study what you want in college, jobs just want to see you graduated, it doesn't matter what your degree is"" and I have found both of these are simply not true. 

Languages only open doors if your language pair is rare or in demand. French > English, not so much (doesn't help that my level isn't exactly fluent either, so I wouldn't be comfortable translating medical or legal information for example). On top of this, most translators are freelance and I really don't want to be self employed 

Regarding the other point, a lot of jobs that I'm looking at the requirements for need a business degree (or related degree based on the company, like hospitality management for a hotel) of some kind. And when I apply anyway cuz ""the requirements are flexible"" they tell me actually no you need this degree to even be considered for the position, even with a current employee's recommendation. 

I only have work experience in shitty customer service jobs and I guess I'm scared I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life doing it. My abilities and who I am on paper don't match at all.

As a female I don‚Äôt have any close friendships and it makes me sad.

If you asked me how life is after college, it‚Äôs kind of meh. I look back  and think why the fuck was I so ugly and insecure?! Why didn‚Äôt I polish myself up and go out of my way to change and talk to people? University is about taking risks not being in your comfort zone and change. No more of this ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to try hard to get people to like you, just be yourself‚Äù, bitch I was myself and made no friends, I should‚Äôve taken more risks and put more effort into people because now I have no friends and it‚Äôs biting me in the ass. Stop with the surface level friendships and go and deepen the friends you have now. Go and do whatever the fuck you want!!! Meeting people pays off, it‚Äôs your fucking 20‚Äôs.

Now I‚Äôm just some sulky bitch who has barely any female friendships. I don‚Äôt know who I hang out with, or what I do in my spare time. I have no identity and very little hobbies that I can share, not to mention trying to find a better job is difficult.

I‚Äôm just floating and I miss being around people."
486,"Hello guys, I graduated in December 2019 with an electrical engineering degree. When I graduated I got a job in the same city of my university, working with embedded systems. The work is easy, but it doesn't pay very well. This month I got an offer to move to S√£o Paulo (largest city in the country) working as a data engineer with good pay and benefits. I talked with my current employer and they made a counter-proposal with a better pay for me to stay.

I'm torn between staying in the current job or accepting the new one. There are 2 aspects that concerns me, the professional and the social. 

The professional:

During my undergraduate I really liked embedded systems, I did a lot of projects to learn more about it, but when I got a job in it, it lost its appeal to me. I did a little internship related to data engineering and found it a little bit interesting. However, I don't think that any of the two will bring me satisfaction at the moment. Another issue is that I think that a data engineering career has better prospects than one in embedded systems, there are a lot more jobs in data engineering than in embedded systems in my country. Also, my current job is very easy and I don't learn/have an interest in learning new things in it. In the new job, I don't know if it will be hard, but I know I will learn a lot of things.

The social:

During my last year of undergraduate I realised that my social life wasn't that good, so I partied hard during that year to compensate and it was awesome. Staying in the current job will allow me to continue to live in the college party scene, which I love. However, it won't last long(maybe 1 or 2 years), because my friends will graduate and I will probably have no one to go to the parties with me.

With the new job I will move to S√£o Paulo, which is something that I already wanted to do sometime in my life. It is a big city with a lot of things to do and I get excited about it, but I fear that I won't find awesome parties like the ones in college.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

I can't decide between staying in my current job and enjoy the last years of the college lifestyle or change jobs, move to a big city and make my life over there.

Any advice would be appreciated."
487,"I graduated college in May of 2020 with a degree in Computer Science. I was mainly focused on programming during my time in college. I can honestly say I made some of the dumbest decisions and I was completely indecisive to the point where I‚Äôm working at a retail job, and I‚Äôm still living with my parents with no way of moving out.

All I did was go to my classes, do my homework, study, and play video games. I never took the opportunity to network, figure what I want, and plan for the future. The only experience I have is more on the research side and not programming. I did a one week research camp where I made an analysis comparing the geographical effects of natural disasters. My senior project was researching sickle cell. None of what I did was in relation to my major.

In terms of getting a SWE job, I hate the process of practicing coding and doing a ton of things that may interest me at first, but after a while I get bored and frustrated. I often avoided coding because I hated the time and stress I needed to put in to get a nice job with it and my interest in it just goes away after a while. I know you probably think I‚Äôm lazy because of that, but I seriously don‚Äôt know what I want in terms of a career. I‚Äôve tried to take courses in Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, JavaScript courses, Comptia A+ courses, front end development courses, and now I‚Äôm dipping my toe in data science. I‚Äôm just hoping something sticks at this point. So far, I take initial interest in a topic and become optimistic about learning and getting a potential job, but then all I think about is how long do I have to struggle in this process, and then I quit because I‚Äôm sick of putting in the work while my colleagues are getting jobs in their field.

This feeling has made me extremely depressed to the point where I almost took my life. I‚Äôve gained weight, my eating had been shitty for the past few months, and I honestly hate myself and my life. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm lazy or depressed. I don‚Äôt know what I want in my life and I don‚Äôt know where to turn."
488,"Hi! Thank you for reading this post!

I am a senior at NYC graduating in May 2021. During my time at college, I mainly took on work study jobs round the university and didn‚Äôt really work outside besides from one small internship that I did with a small CPA firm(ps I didn‚Äôt want to be a CPA).

Graduation in like 5-6 months and I can‚Äôt shake the work of potentially not finding a job after college. I will still be living with my parents for a few more year so I don‚Äôt need to work to about being able to afford housing in NYC just yet. But, I honestly feel like I failed in life because I‚Äôm graduating now at a time where I am suppose to know what I want to do in life but I have not clue at all. I have talked to my career advisor but all she says is that I would be proud of my resume now and that I don‚Äôt need to worry.

I want to believe in her advice but I can‚Äôt help but work  especially since all I‚Äôm hearing is how everyone else is landing jobs while I still don‚Äôt have anything set for after graduation yet. I am also worried that even if I land a job that it would be a job that doesn‚Äôt pay well. My family is not well off and the fact that they are okay with me living off of them even though I‚Äôm done with college already makes me so guilty.

These past few months have been emotionally draining with school and I'm starting to feel hopeless about things.

Obviously, it's been a great improvement since I've moved out but I still have urges to literally hop on a bus that leads to no where and just stay there or book a flight to another country (obviously can't cause of covid). I'm just tired of life and want to change everything. I don't know if it's just all the assignments I have right now piling up that's causing this escapism or just me being emotional.

490,"""Live, not survive."""
491,"I am so burnt out and I‚Äôm only 22 and just have lost all hope and faith in life. I‚Äôve been in therapy for a year and its helped in some aspects but the feeling of hopelessness and frankly not wanting to live has not gone away. I‚Äôve been working full time for over a year but in a variety of different positions. I did 2 full time internships back to back while in college, started working full time as soon as I graduated, and then switched to another company less than a year into that role because I was on the verge of suicide from burnout.

The industry I‚Äôm in (tech-related/IT/Business Analytics) doesn‚Äôt really provided much guidance or on the job training. My internships were more finance/planning related and I found I actually learnt more in my short time in the internships and was provided with much more direction than in my full-time entry level roles. The entry level roles I‚Äôm in were marketed towards new grads but I have not been provided with much guidance if any at all. 

I just feel so disappointed in myself because I genuinely have absolutely no idea wtf I‚Äôm doing and have zero interest in my role. I cannot bring myself to care or be remotely interested. Everyone around me seems so overwhelmed they send emails out very late into the night and I just do not want their lifestyle but it seems that‚Äôs what you have to do to be able to afford to live. The thought of working a corporate role for the rest of my life just makes me feel so helpless and genuinely makes me not want to live. I‚Äôd rather die young than continue to do this for the nest 60 years.

I know I sound annoying and whiney but I‚Äôm just so upset that the years of studying and money I spent to get through college just lead to this life. I genuinely do not want to do I have no passions or interests anymore. I used to have some hope for my future when I was younger but now I have none and just have completely given up on life. I just do not see myself ever being happy or being able to do the things I want. I really just do not see much of a point and just try to space out to get through the day. I used to be so ambitious and got amazing grades and amazing feedback in my internships but now that the reality of full-time corporate America hit me I just have given up. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do it.

I'm entering a period of time in my life, where I feel no longer satisfied by the idea of a 9-to-5, and don't know if I ever felt satisfied by it. I know it's the American Dream to graduate college, get a 9-to-5 and then be successful. But most successful people, don't actually work 9-to-5, but longer. I find I'm more excited about saying I work a 9-to-5, then I am actually working one."
493,"As a new crop of recent grads heads out into the workforce, I'm passing along some advice I wish I had had as a junior employee:

**No one cares about your career like you do.**

During the first few years of your career, a lot of your time is going to be focused on figuring out how to make it through the day. And it will probably take a couple of years for you to feel like you have a clue about what you‚Äôre doing in your chosen profession and several months to settle into a new job.  Putting your head down and focusing on the day-to-day *job* is necessary, but make sure you act strategically when you can so that when you do pop you for air, you like where your *career* is headed.

It is so normal to feel aimless at the start of your career!  For the first time in your life, you might not have a concrete goal.  You had been on a clear trajectory: graduate high school...get a degree or other qualifications...get a job‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶what?

You might not be able to answer that question, and that‚Äôs okay.  But don‚Äôt let the total newness of life upon entry to the full-time working world stop you from taking control where you can.  Because nobody cares about your career as much as you do. And it‚Äôs up to you to take it where you want to go.

So, even when you have little to no autonomy in your daily work life, here are a few things to try:

**Take on new work strategically.**

Obviously, you need to do the work assigned to you. But keep an eye and ear out for opportunities beyond your current daily grind. Get to know colleagues on your team and speak with your formal and informal mentors and supervisor about what they‚Äôre doing and where your department is headed.

Want to work with a particular person? If you see a gap in your schedule coming up, reach out to them and ask if they have any opportunities.

Interested in a particular type of work or project? Figure out who in your office works on it and ask to get involved.

Just remember to get your supervisor‚Äôs OK before taking on new work that‚Äôs outside of your normal duties.

**Get involved outside of your job.**

Join a networking group for young professionals or an organization dedicated to your career. These can provide leadership opportunities for you before you are able to take on those roles in your job, and they help you make connections for the future.

**Attend office events.**

You will stay engaged in your company, make connections, hear about new and interesting       projects, or at the least, just enjoy some free food and drink!"
494,I just graduated high school and i‚Äôm sad and i don‚Äôt know why. I think it‚Äôs because I just don‚Äôt want to grow up. I want to stay the age I am right now with my family and friends. I don‚Äôt want any of us to drift apart. I want my older friends back. I don‚Äôt want to grow up and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I just want to go back in time and relive the moment one last time.

But I can‚Äôt quit. I need to save up and move out of my country, that‚Äôs my goal. Anyone can give me some tips on how to get by for at least 6-10 weeks? Because that‚Äôs all the time I need to save up the money. 

God my head hurts."
496,"Hi all. I graduated in May, working full time (from
home). I am also back home living with my parents to save money. But I am quite literally losing my mind here. I‚Äôm older now so I‚Äôm starting to notice things I didn‚Äôt pick up on as a kid. Their behavior and the way they communicate is toxic and I can‚Äôt deal with it. In college I was used to having my way and living life on my own terms. I can‚Äôt do that at home. The other night I was getting ready to to a friends birthday party (small gathering in his backyard) and I was bombarded with ‚Äúwhere are you going? Whos going to be there? What time will you be home? Etc etc‚Äù. Im 22, I shouldn‚Äôt have to live like that. I understand I‚Äôm living under their roof so I should be respectful but sometimes its just too much.

Also, I am being paid very well at my job. So a lot of the bills and responsibilities I decided to help out with. However lately I feel like I‚Äôm being taken for granted and used, essentially. They ask for money sometimes, for personal things, and I give it up freely because they‚Äôre my parents after all; but, after a while it‚Äôs almost as if they only talk to me nicely when they want the money. Any time outside of that, they are stern or nonchalant in how they speak to me. During this pandemic I don‚Äôt go out much, so I‚Äôm really confined to my house and backyard but it‚Äôs still just too much. I‚Äôve saved a good amount of money which is the only good side to everything, but other than that it‚Äôs not great rn. I‚Äôve considered seeking virtual therapy sessions in my area because I honestly need a mental check up. Being here has been so taxing and I don‚Äôt know how much I can take. 

At the end of the day, I love my parents but I have truly had enough. Any ideas on how I can just make the best of my situation? Anyone feel the same since they graduated and moved back home?"
497,"I graduated a year ago and was lucky enough to get a job almost immediately in the field I wanted, working to regulate the environment. Since then, I have realized this really isn‚Äôt my calling and I hate sending/receiving regulatory emails and calls all day. It feels like I don‚Äôt make a difference and the pay is terrible, there‚Äôs little opportunity to move up and no external incentive to do good work. This leaves me unmotivated and bored. I am creative and have always wanted to create art (as a job) but I know that‚Äôs not always feasible on its own. I want to do marketing or graphic design for an environmental company, something that can educate the public and not just be boring, stuffy, governmental environmental work. I have found it hard to approach this, and I‚Äôve barely worked at my job for a year. Is it possible to switch from the government to something completely different? I feel so boxed in and sometimes hopeless because my degree is Biology and Chem. Any advice is helpful."
498,I keep seeing this question pop up on this thread and decided to make a video on *How You're Supposed to Feel Lost in Your 20s.* I'm not sure when it became an expectation for every 20 year to have their lives figured out so early on. It's an impossible task. We went from having this awesome period of expectation to this daunting feeling of feeling left behind. I hope this video helps some of you who are confused during these arduous times. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxKzWKBWr3U&t=50s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxKzWKBWr3U&t=50s)
499,"I‚Äôm a 21F with a bachelors in psychology. I graduated with a 4.0 and have worked since I was in highschool. I have quite a few fields of experience, but I feel like it‚Äôs impossible to get a job. currently i‚Äôm working at a job I hate. I sit and wait for a phone to ring, which it rarely does lol. I‚Äôm not using my bachelors at all. I really want to do something with my degree but more with indirectly helping people. 

I apply for so many jobs and never hear back. Does anyone have any tricks?! I feel so defeated when I apply for so many jobs and hear back from 1 if i‚Äôm lucky. My resume does have key words and has been through softwares (as a school requirement lol)"
500,"How do I stop feeling trapped?

&#x200B;

Not sure how to describe what or how I'm feeling. It comes and goes, but lately it's been stuck in me, eating at me, and especially around late nights. I can't stop thinking about making a legacy, about promotions, about jobs, and life. I'm not depressed, maybe I am, but how do I stop feeling like guilt-tripping over choices and decisions outside my control? 

I guess I feel trapped, trapped that I can't escape my financial situation, trapped in my home, trapped as a prisoner. No one wants to believe in me, and I don't have any friends i can turn to. What do I do?"
501,"So Im 22 years old and graduated with my bachelors in fall semester of last year, and now after not being in college I just feel empty. Like something is messing in my life, when I went to college I always was happy to go learn and meet people that are going through the same or similar situation as me. And I loved interacting with my professors because they gave me new perspectives in life. 

Now that I finished and all that is gone, I feel out of place and don‚Äôt know what to do. I have an unstable job as well, will I already have a date in which they will let me go (around April), and now I‚Äôm just out of sync with my life. I miss being in a classroom with people in my age range and interacting with them.. I try to stay optimistic but is like my social life just diminished to zero now, anybody feel the same? God I graduated without debt from college but I‚Äôm thinking on getting student loans to go for my masters just so I can feel at home again. The sense of community that college gave me was the best thing that life could have gave me."
502,"I don't have trouble meeting people. I have trouble making real lasting relationships. I hate how I'm always meeting people on the go and then I never see them again. I'm not gonna try super hard to be cool with someone just so they can be in my life, it doesn't work like that. 

I need to see people on a constant basis and then it just happens naturally. Easier said than done. Feel like the only thing that I have hope for is finding a romantic relationship , otherwise friends are just not gonna be in your life regularly."
503,"After college graduation, I jumped at the first opportunity to start making money which turned out to be a horrible job. I didn't have much luck until I started networking with others (family and alumni) which eventually lead me to an amazing management opportunity. The search took some trial and error but it all turned out! 

While networking with alumni worked best for me, was there anything specific that worked for you when finding a great job/career right out of college? We recently released a post to help other graduates find a job after college and would love to add to it! [Here's the Post](https://www.thejub.com/millennial-career-resources/how-to-find-a-job-after-college)"
504,"I have a degree in Pharmacy, money is good, work isn‚Äôt what I call ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù, don‚Äôt want to spend my life in working in this field, but my work experience is only in it (almost 2 years), 

To start a business in handcraft goods? Or study for a trade? Perhaps study college again in art/architecture?"
505,"I‚Äôm about to graduate from a great university with a BA in public policy and a minor in computer science. I‚Äôm passionate about social policy but I also want to exercise my quantitative skills. I don‚Äôt know what to do with public policy. I don‚Äôt really enjoy working in grassroots unfortunately and I really want to go to grad school for public administration/public policy or pursue a JD, but both of those would be after I work in the field for a few years. I‚Äôm just not sure what sort of jobs I‚Äôm qualified for, other than working as a coordinator for nonprofits. Any advice is welcome."
506,"Hi all, I am a recent graduate in college. Now that I've graduated college, I need to start paying for phone bills and car insurance. Thankfully, I had a wonderful uncle who helped me pay for car insurance and phone bills when I am in college. I was wondering about what are the best options for phone bills and car insurance. 

&#x200B;

Phone: I currently have a line with verizon. They only have unlimited talk and text plans, so if I do that I'm looking at 40-60$ every month (depending on whether I want to have no data GB or 2 GB). In all honesty, I don't even think I need unlimited talk and text. I always snap my friends, or using messenger. What are some of the other data plans that you guys use?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Car insurance: This one is tougher. I'm thinking about giving my uncle money and staying in his account. He paid for my cousin, himself, and me in terms of car insurance. We have state farm, and I currently pay \~450$ for premium because I had one accident about a year and a half ago. If I separate my car insurance with him, the rate is higher because I think they give discounts for family insurance. That's one reason why I'm still in his account. Another reason is because I am currently driving his car. Since my uncle's car is relatively new, he wants to have full coverage. Thus, another option I'm looking at is saving up for my own car, and then buy a cheaper insurance plan that doesn't have full coverage. What are your guy's experience? Since I have zero to no experience with real world payment, I suck at knowing what's best for my situation."
507,"College is important in a lot of cases. A lot of the top paying jobs require a degree. But when you are barely a legal adult and have probably never even lived on your own, you don‚Äôt really know that much about yourself.

Humans are complicated and it can take a long time for you to truly find yourself. Despite this, every high school teacher and counselor will preach college like it is a requirement if you want a shot at being successful. Which in some cases, it is. If you want to be an aerospace engineer, obviously you are going to have to go to college. But if you don‚Äôt know what you want to do after high school, that‚Äôs ok. You don‚Äôt have to have some crazy job right after school. It might be beneficial to take a year or two (or three) off and find yourself. Find what you really want to do and what you are passionate about. At that time, if college is the right choice for you, that‚Äôs when you should go. When you know exactly what you want out of the experience.

Both my wife and I went to college right after high school. She ended up going to college a second time, this time to peruse a degree she was actually passionate about. College put a ton of pressure and stress on my life. I had no idea what to do after I graduated it made me suicidal. Jumping right into college didn‚Äôt do any favors for either of us.

I think we as a society should be more supportive of the fact that college right after high school isn‚Äôt always the right choice. For some people, it‚Äôs never the right choice. Life is crazy and it takes time to find yourself. No reason to put so much pressure on yourself at such a young age."
508,"Anyone a few years out wish they tried harder and/or chose a different career path? 

Part-rant, part-disgust at myself. I truly believe that anyone can change their life. It takes effort, dedication, commitment and hard work. I'm not privy to that, I know. But I just have to rant a bit, to get my thoughts straight, and perhaps hear it from someone that's not myself, because I think I've been beating myself up and putting a lot of pressure on myself.

I graduated college in 2016 and while I wouldn't say I regret choosing the major I did, I wish I tried harder. Perhaps even in a different field. I didn't get a job immediately after graduating, and even though I have one now, I find my interests post-graduation have changed. In fact, they change often.

A nearby college, in the same network of colleges I had, was much closer to my home during years of attendance, and had two potential fields that I am now interested in. 

The thing is, I'm much older, so it's difficult to pay for the tuition, especially since I'm still minimum wage and close to entry-level pay. I don't have the funds, since I've exhausted the first bachelor's, which they covered for me, due to being low-income and poor.

But now, I'm just sitting here, contemplating my life choices. Was everything I did for naught? 

I'm almost scared to make any hard life decision now, because I know that it would take effort beyond grief and repair, and if I just chose it from the off-set, perhaps, I'd be in a much better place. 

I'm not afraid to work, I just feel so far back behind my peers in comparison and don't know if I even want to take the extra effort. I just got a full-ride for my master's degree, building upon the same major I studied in my undergraduate. 

That's nice and dandy, but the fact that I have to get a master's, when most fields, and graduates getting jobs just have a bachelor's, shouldn't that be a wake-up call? My field doesn't even require a master's degree, but here I am.

I just wish I could re-do everything."
509,"So I just saw this post in r/casualconversation that, initially, really resonated with me. This user was saying that they would do anything to go back to before they got j to their career. That it felt nice to be needed, have money, etc., but the phones were always ringing at work, there are too many meetings, etc. I completely get that - I worked my ass off to go from homelessness to get to where I am in my career now, and I'm so happy I have resources and money and all that, but I feel like my life isn't my own anymore, I have so little time to be a human being with any desires, etc.

But of course, all of the top comments were really dismissive and bitter.

Someone said something to the effect of, ""Well if you'd 'do anything to go back', just quit your job then."" and the OP goes, ""Well I can't do that - my old job was bartending and being a waiter, so I wouldn't enjoy that very much."" And he was getting torn up in the comments with shit like, ""Well I guess you wouldn't do anything, then."", and, ""The grass is always greener, isn't it."" The guy was very clearly having a small moment of vulnerability where he was expressing his feelings about his current predicament, but everyone knows that if you have money and a stable job, you're never allowed to be upset or overwhelmed, and if you are, you're an ungrateful little shit /s.

Similarly, I'm at senior level in my career, run a nonprofit, have a business, and have a part time job at another global nonprofit, everyone talks about how good I must have it. How proud I should be. But I am probably experiencing some of the worst burnout of my life. I used to be homeless. This is objectively better than my life used to be from an economic standpoint. But I'm also only 25 and never get to be a fucking 25 year old. I don't go out with friends. I have video games I can never play. When I'm scared and confused or frustrated, or even on the verge of tears, instead of people having empathy for me since I'm this young like they would with their own 25 year olds at home, it's just, ""You'll figure it out! You're so competent, you always figure it out. :)"", or, ""Well I know things are rough, but you can't stop now! What you probably need is more work to throw yourself into - that'll make you feel better."" Like you tell people over and over how tired you are and all you get is that cope-y bullshit.

Not to mention, it feels like everyone wants something from me. Because I don't spend as much time with friends, and so much time working, a majority of my time is taking calls where people want some work shipped, or need me to unblock them on something, or want me to review their resume. That last bit is especially frustrating - when I attempt to make new friends, 70% of them hear what I do for a living and immediately ask me if I can look at their resume, give them career advice, hook them up with a job, etc. From then on, the tone of the relationship is that I'm a resource for them, so even during my off hours, I can't turn mentorship-mode off. I know the world needs help; Its why i started my nonprofit. 

I can't entirely blame people for seizing any opportunity they can go look for help - it's what I did and how I got here. It's just that there's no one to help the helpers. Any time I do fail, its just, ""Well maybe ya shoulda did more of X."", and I get absolutely no grace like people would give themselves, or give other 25 year olds. I'm in therapy, and it helps, but that's once a week and this is a nearly every day struggle. **Adulthood is people convincing you that you need to suck it up, ad-nauseum, until you die, while those same people don't suck it up as much as they're instructing you to.** And the moment you have a mental break, all those vultures talk about how, ""If they would have just said something, id have been there for them üòî"". Bullshit.

I'm beginning to just lie to people... I don't tell anyone what I do, and am learning to be as vague as possible about my life. It feels shitty and like I'm still not being authentic, but at least it's helping me not feel like people just want to be around me for my resources."
510,"This has a different meaning to everyone but this is my take. I think I was expecting more after college. It's not even that life is that difficult, the difficult part is feeling like I'm striving towards something. It's just get up, go to work, come home, go to sleep and repeat. Not necessarily a bad life but I think I'm more disappointed at the monotony  of it all.

I'm looking for some excitement and a reason to feel a live. I remember when I was younger it felt like the future looked so bright and I was gonna live this amazing life.  Now that I've gotten here I've plateaued on my growth, happiness, and overall enjoyment in life. I'm just stuck in this constant state of dull. There's a massive void and I don't know how to fill it."
511,"I graduated college a few years ago, so I remember when I was first venturing out to find a career entry level opportunity, I always started the tell me about yourself portion of the interview with the schooling I went to. 

While I'm thankfully still employed and grateful to be working, I am still searching for my next role and opportunity. I'm not a manager just yet, but I'm not exactly entry-level anymore, as I have a few years of work experience under my belt.

Which got me thinking.. how long can I continue to bank the school I went to?

I didn't go to some fancy ivy league or state school. I went to a small city college and graduated humbly with no debt. Most of my real life discussions seem to think and the unspoken rule is that as long as you're paying off loans, you can continue to promote school.

But I've always felt at a certain point, maybe manager level or supervisor/director or beyond, your schooling no longer is a part of your speech, since you have so much to talk about in your work career and trajectory. 

  
Thoughts?"
512,"Hi /r/LifeAfterSchool, honestly, life has been terrible since I first graduated September last year, but I'm sure most are familiar with the very common situation I find myself with, so let's skip it.

The problem is my friend talking to me like my situation isn't the norm and it kills me.

We went to different schools, but he graduated in June, and graduated 3 months later.

He had a full ride to school (University of California) through scholarships so he left it debt free, and his first year's salary is 70k/yr.

He talks to me, and shows me all the cool stuff he buys (balenciagas, expensive stuff), and I'm all like ""...nice"" and I wanted to confront him about my situation at one point and ask him to stop acting like he was the norm but I have absolutely no data to even back it up.

Exactly how many people in America ever leave college in his situation? Less than 25% with a salary as high as his?

Does anyone have any data on this type of stuff so I can just talk to him about how not-normal and how lucky he is?

Thanks a lot!"
513,"God does post grad life feel like I‚Äôm going through the motions. During college I always had something to do, whether classes, going out with friends, etc. Now that I‚Äôm graduated and back home (haven‚Äôt started fulltime ‚Äúadult‚Äù job yet) life feels so dull and monotonous. I think having a full calendar and schedule of things to do was able to distract me and now that I have so much more free time I feel purposeless. I wake up, goto the gym, work a deadend part time job and play video games. Rinse and repeat. I see my friends every now and then but not as often as I was in college. I think it‚Äôs contributing to my depression. Has anyone been able to move past this? I‚Äôm not sure if I should find more hobbies, friends, or just be at peace with a more boring life now that college is done. Does it get better?"
514,People complain how stressful work can be but lets not overlook how boring it can be to. I really thought there was going to be more to it. It's got me thinking I really went to college for this? Granted every job is different but to me the mundaneness is what kills me more than a challenge. I actually prefer a challenge. I need some more zest and passion!  I can't be like this for another 25 years! Maybe I should just appreciate that my job isn't that difficult but I feel I need more of a reason to live for.
515,"Fresh out of college I got baited into this crappy job. I stupidly signed a contract with them for 2 years this contract stated if  I quit or got fired I'd have to pay them 25k.  I spent a year with them and ended up hiring a lawyer and quitting. 

 After that, I spent 4+ months interviewing and getting turned down because I don't have enough experience. I got a job confirmation a couple of months ago, with a government contractor, which required a security clearance. I filled out a bunch of forums for the security clearance and then was told to wait.

Today I recently started emailing people because I was getting worried about how long everything was taking. I finally get a reply back with ""we don't have any open roles at this time"".... WTF. 

How do you stay positive while looking for a job after school?"
516,"Don‚Äôt compare yourself to people your age or younger, especially if you are starting out. Compare yourself to people four to five years out. To be honest, I think this sounds like excellent advice. Although I do have some regrets regarding college, I am glad I wasn‚Äôt surrounded by ludicrously talented teenagers. Doing so might‚Äôve wounded my confidence a lot. Your guys‚Äôs thoughts?"
517,"I‚Äôm a college senior with a 4.0 and a triple major. I realize that‚Äôs a statement most people online don‚Äôt believe me on, but I promise I‚Äôm not trolling. I have 2 semesters left, but I‚Äôm about to finish degrees in microbiology, history, and Japanese. To make a long story short, I had to choose a science degree if I wanted my parents to pay for my college (hence microbio), I have always loved Japanese/studied it for 6 years beforehand (hence Japanese), and have recently fallen in love with Japanese history (hence history).

When I was a kid, I loved microbiology and dreamed of one day getting a doctorate in astrobiology. I still want to do this, but I doubt it will make me happy. Science is cut throat, especially in a pre-med major, and I can‚Äôt remember the last time I enjoyed microbiology. I think I want to do it because I hate the idea of failing my childhood dream, as though somehow giving up on it goes against destiny. Idk; I‚Äôm just weird about it.

Recently, I‚Äôve realized that with Japanese I could teach English/Japanese to Japanese/Americans, and I think I‚Äôd love teaching, but given the person I love wants to stay in America, I probably won‚Äôt have many opportunities to be in Japan.

I‚Äôve recently accepted that I love teaching. I love history, and I think I‚Äôd enjoy being a history professor, which would also require grad school. My history professors at my university seem to have dream jobs in my eyes. I love writing and am exceptionally good at it; I‚Äôd love writing books and academic essays on historical subjects. I‚Äôd also enjoy interacting with students.

So those seem to be the 3 most obvious paths for my life based on my degrees and desires. Now, I‚Äôm asking for your advice. How would you go about choosing; what factors would be important to you if you were in this situation? How much should I worry about money and job security when it comes to pursuing happiness? Should I hold onto my original dream and greatest love of microbiology even though I haven‚Äôt enjoyed it for a few years? 

Which would you choose?"
518,"With so much going on, how do I live and lead a happy life?

&#x200B;

There's just so much going on in the world right now. Pandemic, disease, death, politics, being out of school, how do I lead and live a happy, care-free life?

I just feel so lost."
519,"I'm from the UK, I have a bachelor degree and a PhD in a STEM subject. 

As my graduation date loomed unfortunately Brexit hit my field really hard and the majority of companies moved overseas and went for European candidates. My field is big in America however I was rejected from all applications as I would need a visa etc and they had other candidate closer to home. 

As my rent was upon me and my partner and I don't really have parental support I knew I would have to just take any old job. Not even McDonald's would hire me, as soon as companies saw Dr they would shut the door. I ended up taking a recruitment job which I hated. Everyday someone would ask me, ""why did you do a PhD and then just work in recruitment"" constantly I would be judged by my old peers and complete strangers. Also the job didn't match my skills set at all, it is all about talking to people. I was used to doing very complex analysis and I would say I'm for sure close to the spectrum in some way, also finding people jobs in stem when I couldn't find my own stem job, just rubbed salt in my open cuts everyday. 

I tried getting out of recruitment however it turns out that it has its own stigma and employers just didn't understand why I would have taken that career choice, and that I was clearly not a serious candidate who wanted a STEM career. 

At the 2 year mark of finishing my PhD I had sunk very low into a depressive state, I had nothing to show from the years and years I spent in education I was ashamed of myself and I thought about killing myself daily. If it wasn't for my partner I doubt I would be alive today. 

By the 2.5 year mark I had made over 400 applications, and finally a company called me back. It was a tech company working in an area I had never studied or work in before. Their Glassdoor reviews were horrific and I knew it would be a terrible job, however it was a stepping stone so I took it as tech was a great Industry to get into and I could forge a new path. 

I cannot describe how toxic the environment was, if anything the Glassdoor reviews were a softer view of what was actually happening in the company, however, I could totally see myself working in tech so I kept my head down and just started to gain some experience in this new industry.  unfortunately as covid-19 hit the owner went even more crazy and again I found myself unemployed. With only three months experience at that point, no other tech company would touch me and I was back to square one. 

This time there were no jobs to apply to and I thought I was so fucked, even the recruitment industry was dead. And then one day a recruiter called, offering a job which was basically what I did my PhD on, I couldn't believe it, I quickly checked out the company, it was a real company with a real role!

After three rounds of interviews and a presentation I received a call from the recruiter to say I'd got the job. I completely broke down with uncontrollable crying, with nearly three years passing I thought the ship would have completely sailed by now and that I would never make it in science. 

This past week leading up to starting I've never felt so happy, I feel back to my old self and I've never slept better. I knew job hunting was hard but I really wasn't expecting what I experienced. 

If you are going through something similar please reach out for help from a professional, friend or family member,  I dread to think what I would have done without my partner."
520,"I'm really concerned about how I'm going to get by financially after graduation. I honestly have no idea how I could find a job relating to my major and think I might just have to work a retail job while interning to get more experience, while also possible working on a certificate program (more debt) to even get into the field of my major. 

As of now this is my first year living ""on my own"" (roommate, not in a college dorm, not having as much help managing my own finances, more bills now) and I'm really worried again honestly about how I'm going to balance rent/utilities/car payment/groceries/gas and other things I'm probably forgetting. I don't know how people make it work everything seems so impossible rent is just so much everywhere and it all just adds up and up and I can't see myself making ends meet on my own much less improving myself so that I can actually find a job utilizing my degree

522,"I genuinely hate going on LinkedIn. I always feel like i am failing at doing something meaningful with my life while other people in my network/I went to school with are getting promotions and seem to have an actual career. I have tried the whole networking thing and staying active on LinkedIn, but didn't seem really good anywhere. I wanted to work in sports, but felt more like a pipe dream.

While i don't expect everyone in my network to want to help in terms of possibly finding jobs, people seemed to interact with me when it benefited them; when i worked as a media planner at an advertising agency and they wanted to set up a meeting to try to get us to buy ad space. 

Never assumed that nearly 5.5 years since leaving my media planning job that I  would still be  struggling to find a job that isn't working in a restaurant. I quit that job at the end of July because i was i am burned out and  miserable at where i work.

There has to be an industry/company out there that will value what i  bring to the table. 5+ year of experience in various roles in the  marketing and hospitality  industry; AV Tech, Brand Ambassador, Event  Operations Team Member.  Majority of these roles were either part time or  seasonal.

Around this time every year i feel like i am just trying to get through. Right now i don't really have a job other than hosting Trivia twice a week. I am debating on doing Amazon's  mechatronics apprenticeship:

If you're not friends with your colleagues, why not?"

525,"My friends and I just graduated from college. In the weeks leading up to graduation, like most people, we started to worry about whether we were going to slowly lose touch once everyone started working.

We thought about ways we could stay engaged in each other's lives, and spent our senior spring building [Beehive](https://www.askbeehive.com/), a social app that makes it easy to keep in touch with your friends by filling your day with quick, spontaneous phone calls.

Whenever you have a free minute, like if you're on a walk or waiting in line, you can post a topic on Beehive. Your friends will get notified that you're available and can call you through the app.

My friend group has used it to talk about our day, the news, life advice, or plan meetups in-person. It's already helped us feel more connected, form deeper relationships, and pass the time, and we think it'll become even more useful now that we graduated. I wanted to share it here in case you and your friends are interested in trying it out. And congrats to the class of 2021!"
526,"Hi everyone, hope you're doing well. I'm a December 2020 Business Management grad, looking for something to do that I'll *enjoy.* 

Out of college, I started a job in insurance because I was promised stellar earnings (on a commission basis \[red flag!\]). After three months, I was spending more than I was making and I absolutely hated it, so I left. No ragrets. 

Since then, I've been lacking in a sense of direction. I'm about 50 applications into my job search (in business related fields, mostly), but I'm not certain of what exactly I want to do. I've looked into travel/volunteer programs like Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, which pique my interest. I've also considered uprooting and relocating, but I don't have enough money to comfortably do so without a job. I love traveling, classic rock, movies, and anything outdoors - specifically hiking.

So, if you didn't pursue something related to your degree, what did you do? Or, if you did pursue something related to your degree and it didn't work out, what did you do? I'm looking for ideas. Any related topics are welcome."

I recently graduated from University in May and I am currently looking for a full-time position in the entertainment industry. While I am looking for a job, I am working postmates in my college town. 

I wanted to post because I am feeling very depressed about the future. On one hand, I have no idea when a full time position will become available to me due to the pandemic. On the other hand, I am constantly thinking about what my life will be like once I do take a full time position. I am dreading working a 9-5 job if I have to. It seems like at that point, there is no motivation to move forward in life. I will have left all my best friends in college and from my home town. I hate being alone and I know I will have to once I move to a brand new city. Once I get a job, I know there will not be time for me to do anything else because all I will be doing is working. That sounds like a pretty miserable life to me. Once I start my job, I work every day for 8 hours and repeat every day? I do NOT want this to be my life. College was an incredible time for me and now I realize just how much I took it for granted. 

In addition to this, the thought of slowly losing connection with my family and best friends haunt me. I‚Äôve been friends with the same three guys since pre-school & I feel like we will slowly lose touch since we will be spread across the country. 

How can I become motivated about my future life rather then dread it? A part of me wants to just say fuck it & pursue a non 9-5 job, which will be high risk. Can someone please share their thoughts below?"
528,"I chose to go to a university out of my home state in order to escape some depressing family relations and start anew. After the first semester, I was hooked and I knew I would not go back. And I have expressed that to my parents all along, but even a year and a half after graduating it stills feels like they think I'm just trying it out.
Anyone else here move to the state where you went to school? What's your experience?"
529,"Just for some background: Before COVID-19, I worked as an Administrative Assistant at a local publishing company. I also graduated in May with a B.A. in English. While I really enjoyed my job, the way the company handled communicating with me during the pandemic was alarming. I had to reach out to them multiple times until they finally got back to me and laid me off.

Since then, I've been looking and applying for jobs and paid internships. I have also been on unemployment which has allowed me to save a tremendous amount of money. I'm still waiting to hear back from a few companies, but I found out through an old coworker that the publishing company I worked at is hiring. The position is basically my previous job with a few added responsibilities. However, the hours are short (15-20/week) and the pay is hourly.

A part of me believes that I should go back despite how I was treated. But with the possibility of the unemployment stimulus renewing, should I just wait to hear back from the other jobs I applied for? I'm not looking to find a job by tomorrow, but I know that I eventually want to find work that will provide me with practical experience in my field. Many of the positions I applied for were paid internships that would give me this needed experience. The publishing company is an ideal industry for me to work for. Nonetheless, I'm not sure if I would be given the opportunity to grow with them after what happened.

An update: Coincidentally, one of the internships I really wanted just got back to me and told me they selected someone else for their internship program. "
530,"So my graduation was yesterday and as much as i‚Äôm happy to come to the end of this chapter, i feel kinda sad. Sure school wasn‚Äôt my favorite place but that feeling that I‚Äôm getting old and life doesn‚Äôt get better haunts me. Also all my friends are traveling for different reasons and from my experience, school friendships are so hard to maintain especially if it‚Äôs long distance. That thought that i might encounter a picture of one of my friends on social media or in real life and just think ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs been a really long time since we talked‚Äù just makes it bitter to me. I keep thinking about what if everyone got ahead with their life and forgot about all the memories and time we spent together 
How did you guys deal with that?"
531,"So, I'm still a student (22F) in college. I've always struggled with my degree, and I got into a bad depression when I got into college. My degree is 3 years and I'm in my fourth and still gonna need more 2 to finish it. By then I'll be 24. I would like to study a masters abroad, and if everything goes well until then I'll finish it when I'm 26. 
My concern is: is it to old to leave school at that age? I already work a part time job in my area of study so I'll graduate with some experience but still, most people I know are already doing their masters degree and are close to be independent. I'm just thinking that by time I finish I'll be almost 30 and it just scares me to think of that number idk. 
English is not my mother language so I'm having a hard time expressing myself, hopefully you understand. Thank you"
532,"I graduated like 3 days ago. And bro like, that‚Äôs it. Whether they were  friends I was cool with or those that I weren‚Äôt, I probably will never hear from them again/see them in person.

It sucks but it‚Äôs true"
533," I'm 24 and graduated college this last spring. Just going to college was a dream of mine. I'm a first generation college grad, I was born into poverty, and my parents suffered from drug and alcohol abuse. I've overcome a lot to get here. 

Well I felt lost after school and didn't want to end up back in my hometown. My best friend from college was moving out west with her bf and I decided to take a leap of faith and move out here too. I have an Aunt who is well off and offered me a place to stay until I get on my feet. So we drove out here in August and I'm staying in Washington while my friend are in Oregon. 

I graduated with a BS in Public Health and didn't think it would take long to find a job. Well....I was wrong. Six months in and I still can't find a job and I've applied to hundreds of places. I struggled to find work even with minimum wage jobs. I struggled to find housing and the rent in Portland/Vancouver is insane. My friends are struggling with finding jobs and can barely afford their rent too. I can't get my foot in the door anywhere...

My Aunt isn't mad because she understands but I have to move out by February for her own personal reasons. I'm moving back home this month and have a decent job lined up. I don't want to but I have no choice. I feel like such a failure. This makes me think my degree wasn't worth it and I'll never escape the life I was born into...."
534,"Anyone else having a hard time making friends after college/university?

I have zero friends, so I joined an adult sports league in order to make friends, and still couldn‚Äôt make friends. After the game is over, everyone goes off and does their own things, they aren‚Äôt looking to make new friends. What do I do now? 

Everyone has their own friends, their own lives, girlfriends/boyfriends/and their own friend groups. They aren‚Äôt looking to take in new people. What now?

Anyone else in the same situation as me?"
535,"
I‚Äôm an upperclassman (not graduating yet for a bit, though) who came into college with a pretty good grasp of what they want to do with their life. I still have a good idea of what I want to do, but I‚Äôve been thinking lately of other possible career paths I can do with my major I haven‚Äôt really explored yet.

I‚Äôm studying polisci/public policy/public health/ethnic studies and have a lot of experience from interning at non-profits, so I was looking into non-profit/social impact consulting. During my research I saw that one of the Big Four consulting companies has a pretty lucrative contract with ICE, which made me really uncomfortable. I know non-profits are definitely NOT perfect but the idea of working with ICE/something equally in opposition with my morals...

I guess it‚Äôs just scary to see that your career could involve causing so much harm? I‚Äôve talked about it with my partner (engineering student) and they agreed they would never apply to a weapons manufacturer but I don‚Äôt think any of their professors/advisors discussed something like that with them.

Whenever I see career advice given to students I rarely see people instructing us to look at ethics or warn us that our desired companies may be doing some really shady stuff. Did you all ever worry about stuff like this? Did it influence your job search during your senior year/post-grad?"
536,"Hi! So I graduated feom college in May. I lost my last two months at school and I didn't get a graduation. My teachers at school have always told me to stay in contact after graduation. I'm notoriously bad a keeping in contact with people if I don't see them everyday; I just have no idea how to begin a conversation. 

I have a contract for the end of February that should last a month or two, but other than that I'm looking for a stable 9-5 or grad school. I would really really love to reach out of my teachers - not even for advice I just miss them and want to see how they're doing. But I have no idea how start a conversation. Any ideas reddit? 

TDLR: I have horrible social skills and anxiety and I don't know how to reach out to my old professor."
537,"I‚Äôm a senior about to graduate college in the spring. I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have a full-time position lined up and just signed a lease on an apartment. Everyone is telling me I should be so happy and excited -and I am- but I‚Äôm also terrified. No one seems to understand why because on paper it seems like I have my life together. 

I‚Äôve really made the most of my time in college. My days are filled with school work, organization meetings, hanging with friends, and working as a resident advisor (RA) in a dorm. At times it‚Äôs been stressful, but overall I thrive and embrace all of the amazing opportunities around me at college. 

Knowing that I will be moving into an apartment alone, away from my friends and no longer a part of a bunch of organizations, leaves me feeling numb. I feel like so much of who I am is rooted in my involvement and being a part of a community and once I graduate, I‚Äôll no longer have that. I‚Äôll have my friends still but I‚Äôll be further away and I know I won‚Äôt be able to see them everyday. I guess I really don‚Äôt know how to handle ‚Äúsettling down‚Äù and being off-campus. The concept of having free-time is foreign to me as I always fill up any gaps in my schedule by hanging with friends, working ahead on classes, chatting with residents, etc.

I‚Äôm looking for advice of people who have made a similar transition- how did you adjust after graduation? What do you do after work and on weekends with your free time? Advice on living alone in a non-college community?"
538,"I am 2 years out of school and working a coordinator job at a nonprofit. Every day, I need to give follow-up calls to a large number of clients and business partners, which was fine at first because people were generally civil and sometimes even thankful for the reminder calls, but recently, more and more people have been impatient on the phone, and some people simply hang up the phone before I could finish my introduction. The first few times that happened, it stung a bit, but I recovered quickly. But as the same thing happened again and again, it's beginning to take a toll on me. Now I'm pretty sure I'm burnt out. I spend maximal time on my other work duties in order to justify spending minimal time on these calls. I stare at the phone numbers for who knows how long because I'm scared to dial. Since I'm more scared that my boss would be mad at me, I usually end up making the calls anyway, but it feels like pushing a boulder up a hill, and at the end of the workday I'm so exhausted I just want to sleep. 

My boss has questioned me about the decreased number of calls, and I explained that I sometimes get discouraged by the clients/partners. Her response was basically ""Yes it can be a discouraging job but we need those clients"". Her other advice (which I've heard a hundred times from other people) is to ""grow a thicker skin/don't take it personally"" and ""kill'em with kindness"". I can do the kindness part, but the first two, I don't even know how. It seems like some people easily pick up the skills of ""not taking work-related rejections personally"" and ""separating personal emotions from work"". I still want to be nice to our clients, so I doubt that separating my empathy/emotions from work would help me do my job better. Plus, I'm naturally sensitive to people's feelings, so if I have to leave my emotions out of work (whatever that means), I feel like that's the same thing as telling half of myself ""you can go die now"". 

I know interacting with unkind customers is an extremely common theme in the job world, so I was wondering if any of you could give some words of advice, or just share your experience dealing with the same problem, even if you haven't found a good solution yet. Thanks, y'all."
539,"I worked in retail, worked as an assistant hs football coach,  stadium usher, and volunteered at a food bank. While I got experience I didn't make a lot of money nor do I feel like I have direction and am taking advantage of my college degree. Those are just average jobs that don't require a degree. I feel like a complete fuck up at 32: still live at home with my parents,  went lengthy periods of  unemployment ,  haven't worked full time, and feel like I haven't really accomplished much.  It's probably subjective but I feel like a complete loser."
540,"(TLDR at bottom) I just want to preface and say that I was somewhat spoiled during my college years. Sure I had a nice scholarship, jobs and internships each summer, and built a decent resume. But my parents supported me since they were well off financially so I was able to graduate without loans. I went to an in-state school; everything around dorms is convenient, when I lived at home, well, parents were there, and friends were always nearby.

And after mass-applying to jobs during COVID I was pretty lucky to land one with high salary, and interesting work content and environment, except now I'm suddenly living alone hundreds of miles away from my parents and friends. I feel overwhelmed.

Now I have to choose healthcare plans and other insurance/benefits stuff given by my company, learn what to do for 401k, learn how to do taxes differently now that I'm not a dependent, do all the chores myself without falling behind schedule, juggle around social life and company politics and my own personal career track, learn about car maintenance, etc etc.

Even worse I'm not that experienced of a driver; sometimes I spend an extra second wondering if I have the right of way at an intersection and get honked, or I make a turn that's a smidge too tight. I just got into a minor car accident with another car because I had dew on my windows, thought I could just use my wipers without defogging and it turned into opaque frost and I panicked; I and the other person were both unharmed, but the damages to my car were moderate and I had to navigate through claims and repairs and everything. (Cherry on top: Said person is my coworker. I feel really awful.)

On the outside I seem to be adjusting; I made a couple friends first week at work, I've learned how to take care of bills and insurance. I've learned to cook a few simple dishes, and to budget and estimate how much I can spend/save per month. I did my insurance claims, and arranged Uber and carpooling. 

But I always feel like I'm forgetting something, or doing something wrong. And I feel like I call my parents too often with stupid questions. Any other fresh grads with little life experience feel this way, and how did you conquer your fears?

(Maybe once our cars are repaired, I'll treat the other coworker to food or give him a gift card as yet another apology. God I feel bad.)

TLDR: A bit sheltered in college, with parents and friends in close proximity. Now living alone. Struggling with adult things and navigating through complex things alone. Also not a great driver and got into a minor car accident. Not sure how to conquer my fears."
541,"I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of anxiety lately and just a lot of reflecting on my life in general. I graduated from college in May and started working full time at a financial institution (so think corporate environment) in June. Many of the people at work are older than me and keep to themselves. The ones that are young, I just have a fear of asking out to lunch. Idk why I‚Äôm like this. I guess I always was. 
But anyway, I don‚Äôt have many friends from high school and the ones from college dont live close so I end up spending my weekends alone. And during the week, I spend alone and just talking with my girlfriend who works 300 miles away. I have a shy personality but open up once someone gets to know me. I just need that initial push to meet and interact with new people. I‚Äôm in the New York City area and would really like some advice on how to meet new people my own age."
542,After 6 years I‚Äôm finally going to have my bachelors degree. But the pandemic isn‚Äôt over and life as we know it is all in transition. It just feels extra awkward.

543,"I am so happy I found this sub. I am having a quarter life crisis. I (25F) just graduated from University of hawaii with BA in anthropology last week. i‚Äôve been here for 3 years living alone and have had really no quality friends, I spent most of my time towards the end alone.   I had a really really bad last few months here, with break ins, losing friendships and everything else. I started antidepressants and have felt very sick since, making everything harder. 

my agreement with my mom in highschool was that I *had* to go to college, and in return she would pay half my rent when I moved out of the dorms until I graduated. i graduated from a school in florida before transferring to hawaii, and my boyfriend cheated on me with 4 of my best friends and then married my rooom mate, so i fled. i was doing okay in hawaii and then covid hit, I lost my job like everyone else, and turned into a sad hermit lady. i blew through my savings and now i have to move back to the east coast by the end of the month because I can‚Äôt afford the rent on my own and didn‚Äôt have enough time after graduation to find a full time job. every one i applied for was a rejection. so now i‚Äôm in the middle of shipping 30 boxes of shit home and trying to either selll my car or ship it home because I can‚Äôt find any cars for sale at my parents. 

there‚Äôs no job opportunities (anthropology) for me in hawaii or at my parents from what I am seeing. I have no friends at my parents, everyone from HS moved away and got married. my mom is making me move into the basement because I have a cat and she hates my cat. she‚Äôs getting a carpet put in, so that‚Äôs nice I guess. I have to fork up $3k for shipping my life to NJ and another $2k ~ for my car. 

I feel like a total loser, moving into my moms basement at 25 years old. my mom told me i‚Äôd be better off going to a mental health facility for 90 days first. this is not how I pictured my life to be at this point. my internships I applied for fell through. I will keep trying but still it‚Äôs not encouraging. I know I feel alone now, but can‚Äôt help but feel like being at home will make it worse. my family is dysfunctional and my little brother just moved to the west coast so I won‚Äôt even have him. :( 

leaving hawaii is so difficult for some reason man. i‚Äôve been so miserable here, but I feel like the moment I leave is when I become a real fucking loser. I don‚Äôt have the chance to meet guys at home, I already know them all. and I know I can save up and move somewhere else, but I don‚Äôt want to be anywhere. I can‚Äôt think of a single place in the country that would be worth me having to move out on my own and start over, for the 3rd time. i‚Äôm in such a hole. 

tldr : moving back home after school feels like a death sentence but no other options"
544,"Title is pretty clear, but anyways I am in my mid-twenties and living near a large-ish city. Most of my friends live further away so I am trying to create some sense of community closer to where I live. Corona makes everything more complicated, but does anyone have any tips on meeting people close to my age 20-30?

I know the usual go-to is do things that interest you, but I don‚Äôt have any interests that lend themselves to group activities. I wasn‚Äôt into sports in high school or college so that crosses off a lot of adult sports leagues (a lot of them aren‚Äôt running with Covid anyways), I‚Äôm not particularly into arts and crafts, and I don‚Äôt really love the outdoors to join any hiking or outdoorsy groups. 

In college I was super active socially, I was in a sorority, I was in college government, and I even gave tours. But without an adult activities fair I‚Äôm really out of ideas. Making friends at work is also out of the picture as I only have like 10 co-workers and they‚Äôre all over 40 and married with spouses.

547,"I‚Äôve been living in various cities since I moved away from the village I grew up at 17. But my best friend loves to remind me that I am a farm girl in our conversations. I happily accept it. I have never explained, and he probably does not know how long it took for me to embrace that part of my identity.

The first time I learnt I could change that identity was at the start of middle school. The class teacher was telling us that if we pay a fee of Ôø•2,000 (about $270), we could buy a city hukou for ourselves. That‚Äôs almost a year‚Äôs earnings for my family if we‚Äôre lucky.

You may have heard about hukou in China. It‚Äôs a household residence registration system. I understand in the US your residence moves as you move from state to state and where you pay your taxes. It does not work that way in China. 

To start with, there were two classes of hukou. City hukou for those work and live in the city, or rural hukou for farmers. Given the economic development in cities was much better than rural areas, a city hukou allowed its holder access to considerably better educational and employment opportunities. In short, it gave you better prospects in life. Naturally, everyone wanted to have a city hukou. However the assignment of city or rural hukou would be decided based on your parents‚Äô status. That is to say, if you parents were city hukou holders, you would be assigned with the same and vice versa. 

Only a lucky few managed to upgrade their status (just like an airline, lol). Getting good grades at school then later employed by government or its affiliates could be one way. Another was marrying someone who holds a city hukou. It‚Äôs possible to find a good match who happened to hold a city hukou, however I‚Äôve heard many stories about people, usually women, marrying for the wrong reasons. City hukou was like the green card for those who aspire to have a better life for themselves. Fortunately, with the development of economy, the advantages of city hukou has faded away and marrying for it only happened to some among my parent‚Äôs generation. Side note, how can you expect to be treated as an equal partner if the distribution of power was unbalanced when you walk into the relationship? 

Anyway, back to my classroom in year 2000. Buying into a city hukou sounded like great opportunity, but was not one that my family could afford. So officially I stayed as a farm girl until age 27, despite the fact that I stopped farming at age 17 and moved to various cities thousands miles away from our village. I was working at factories instead of the fields. 

The opportunity to change the status of my hukou came later. By then, the Chinese government had relaxed its policies and I was able to move my residence to Shenzhen, one of the most developed cites in China. To attract a competitive workforce into the city, policy makers had designed a credit system to allow people claim points based on their educational level, employment situation or if s/he owns property, etc. in the city. It was through that system I finally dusted off my farmer identity legally. 

Nowadays, a rural hukou is seen almost the same as a city one with the adjusted nation-wide government polices over the past two decades. But the label of farmer remains looked down upon in Chinese society to this day. The majority of the farmers still run subsistence farming and that limits the production efficiency and their income. They remain at the bottom of the economic ladder and are usually associated with poverty, low education and rude behaviors in the sub-context of conversations. 

I‚Äôve never tried to hide the farmer part of my identity, but tried very hard to run away from it. As hard as I felt poverty, lack of opportunities in life and harsh treatment towards women were behind me. The work ethic I developed through working under the sun or rain from sunrise to sunset in the fields throughout the year helped me conquer difficulties beyond the village life. That is the gift of being a farmer. And it is precisely that gift helped me construct a better life for myself. 

It may take years for us to move beyond whatever disadvantages we find ourselves in, the important thing is that we keep trying. I was not able to see it then, but I am able to see it now. The view on the other side of the tunnel is much better. And best of all, I get to be in the company of friends who appreciate my core identity ‚Äìa farm girl.

548,"Okay, before y‚Äôall say, ‚Äúno‚Äù immediately, let me explain.

During my junior year of high school, i discovered health and wanted a career in it and of course i was applying to colleges. I wanted to pursue nursing(RN), clinical laboratory science, occupational therapy, nutrition, or physician assisting. My self-esteem and confidence is non existent. I believe i was not smart or good enough to get into these careers, so what is the point? i told myself that many times to push me away from the industry. 

When college came, i went to a community college first and hooped around majors not related to health because i was afraid of touching that. I spent 3 years in cc and transferred and in my first year at a university. As a result, I am a business major planning of going into HR because it seems stable enough and i believe i can tolerate. I did an internship last summer and been on interviews for another for the upcoming summer, but been unsuccessful. I am so unmotivated to do my business classes. I never liked business, i picked it just because. 

Now, it been almost 4 years and i think i am ready to pursue this. My plan is to drop out from my university(after this semester) and become a cna, phlebotomist, medical assistant, or dental assistant and work for a year to get experience(and achieve other personal goals) and then go back to school for vocational/practical nursing, vet tech, ultrasound, radiology, surgical tech, or dental hygiene. 

Do y‚Äôall think this is a good idea? Should I really drop out? I have a plan, so it is not like i‚Äôm going to be sitting at home doing nothing. Please let me know. Thank you for reading.

Edit: thank you to the stranger who gave me my first reddit award:)

Another edit: i will force myself to finish this degree, joining a business/hr related club and finding another internship. and try my best to get a job something related to my degree and see what to do after that. thank you for your thoughts. 

i missed 2 weeks of work already throughout my 4 classes(~5 assignments), but have time to bounce back. hopefully all works out üôèüèΩ"

551,"Hi all.

My deferment for my student loans has ended this month, and I've been devising a way to pay off my loans as quick as possible just to get them out of my hair. I was pretty lucky and ended up with just over $2,000, split between two ""groups"". Group A interest rate is 3.760%, while Group B is 4.450%. 

I have a choice of paying by account or by group. My minimum from my financier is $50, but I'm able to budget $100 per paycheck. My main question is: is it beneficial to pay down the higher interest rate, or just pay them both off at the same time?"
552,"I have been extremely burnt out from high school. I overworked myself and were in a stem magnet program that threw hours of homework at me every single day. Freshman year I took a level course that was treated like a college class. On our first research paper we got a 45. That environment was pure insanity. The majority of my time after school involved homework and academic related clubs. I had little little to no social life outside of school, And I‚Äôm really hoping these next four years will be better. The social scene at my school was awful. Most of everyone I was around and knew from school did nothing just like me. Their maturity level just wasn‚Äôt there in addition to that. I almost didn‚Äôt get invited to prom because someone decided to still fuel some drama from a break up that happened freshman year that I had forgotten about. These past few months to fill this hole I had to meet people that go to other schools, which has worked out pretty well. I am going to a big university next year. I‚Äôm hoping to push myself out of my comfort zone, and enjoy a fresh start. I just truly want to know if it will be a better experience."
553,"Hi, so a quick background:

I graduated August 2019 with a degree in Environmental Science. Since then, I have been living in Ohio with my parents, and was steadily applying for jobs from August-March. I had moderate success, a few interviews but nothing materialized. Since the COVID pandemic, I decided to turn my focus to grad school. I enrolled in a Kaplan course and have been motivated to increase my GRE score to get a GA to a master's program with a focus on Coastal Science.

This morning I received a job offer for a position related to my degree in Immokalee, Florida. The salary is \~$32,000/year, with great benefits, including tuition waivers.

I have not shared this information with anyone. I have already had the discussion with my parents that if I decline a job offer, they will cut me off. They are very adamant that my priority should be finding a job before going to grad school...but since I haven't had any luck securing a position, they have supported the idea of graduate school.

As far as my own feelings about the offer, I am not excited about the position, or the pay. I would likely have to live in Naples, commute to work, and the cost of living in Naples is far higher than my salary. 

My plans if I don't accept the offer are to continue striving for a high score on the GRE, and applying to master's programs to get a degree in Coastal Science.  I have several schools in mind, my GPA is solid, I have a semester of research experience, and I have a list of professors to reach out to for recommendation letters. I would like to save up $15,000 by January to aid in any relocation expenses and help get me started. Ideally, I would begin grad school either Spring/Summer/Fall 2021, depending on the program.

My life is at a very decisive crossroads, I'm confused and honestly a little upset. This is NOT how I wanted to feel about my first job offer. I'm going to reach out to some of my friend's parents for advice, since I can't exactly talk to mine.

Thanks for any insights you can provide.

Edit to add: I am working part time in a restaurant where I‚Äôm making a range of $12-$15, sometimes $18/hour. (Depends on tips)."
554,"I don't know what happened. I was late to the ""game"". I had this dream to become a musician and ended up working low wage jobs and living with my parents till 25. Then I had a reality check. I needed to get out of this town and make a living wage. I got a BS in IT and moved the hell away. 

I've been in the new city for about a year and a half. Ive dropped my dream of being a professional musician. It felt weird because that's what I put my identity on for a long time. Then I started feeling unfulfilled by my work. I feel trapped in a timeloop. Every week is the same. I got no passion for my job.

Then recently I got a crush on a girl and it didn't work out. I started spiraling. I'm 28 nearing 30. I suddenly got weird baby fever and I'm a dude. I don't want to have kids so late that my parents don't get to enjoy them. I also want to be married for several years before having or adopting kids. 

I know for women the pressure is even harder if they want to have biological kids. I'm all for adopting. 

But something about this year has been so weird. Like such a strong desire to get married and have kids and stuff. 

And I'm considering going back to college part-time because I'm so unsatisfied with my career. Thinking Public administration - a MPA. 

But I've been scared to do it because it feels like another way to postpone things. But I can date and stuff while in college right? Definitely if it's part-time and I already have a career that I'm just trying to move out of eventually

It's been a huge weight on me. I was hoping when I graduated things would just make sense and I'd get married and yada yada. Quickly realizing that I have no idea what I'm doing.

I wasn't even going to stay in this city for long, but know I'm thinking I'm here for a long time. Which I'm okay with know. 

Just feels like a life crisis. Lots of anxiety and fear of being alone. 

I'm seeing a therapist to sort through things as well. It feels like a massive weight dropped on me this year."
555,"Hi all, 

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science in 2019 and immediately started working a financial services company. The wages are decent but there's no room for advancement and the company culture is very rigid and pretty unforgiving. 

I'm considering going back to school for IT starting in January to re-orient my career as it's something I enjoy and there's lots of room for growth in the field. 

I have enough saved up to pay for the degree up front and can survive working part time in the interim. 

I just feel a bit silly leaving my decent paying job to go back to school but I think it'll pay off in the long run.

Any advice or guidance would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Edit: I should say that I will be pursuing an Associate's in IT rather than a Bachelor's."
556,"As of yesterday, it has been one full year since I have graduated from college. One year ago around this time, I was anxious and unsure of what was to come next. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was ready to undertake the challenges of adulthood. At that point, I felt like school was the only thing that I was good at as I had practically been doing it my whole life uninterrupted. The mere thought of the real world made me extremely anxious. For many months, I was unsure of what to do or how to cope. Last summer, I got an internship at a law firm. Even then, I was still incredibly nervous and unsure because everything was all new to me. I struggled with the fact that I no longer had school as a safety net, so I felt like I had no purpose or sense of direction. I now realize that that was stupid of me to think. As much as I miss the fun college days and being able to hang out with friends on a whim, I must say that I enjoy the real world a whole lot more. I am now working at the same law firm that I interned at. I actually enjoy what I do and who I work with. I also enjoy getting paid. As a huge bonus, I have learned more at my job in the past 3-4 months than I ever did during my entire 6 years of college. I am even enjoying thinking about the future right now as I am currently saving up for a car. The thing that I once feared the most is now what I am looking forward to the most. Even with all this craziness going on, I am still making more and more accomplishments each and every day. I am proud to say that adulthood is nowhere near as bad as I thought it was going to be. Though it may not be perfect, I am willing to make things work for my own best interests."
557,"I‚Äôm about to finish my bachelors in Chemistry this upcoming December, and then I walk the stage in May 2020. This is really weird, I literally JUST. MOVED. ON. CAMPUS. AS. A. FRESHMAN. Now i‚Äôm a senior, one semester away from finally getting my degree. Time went by way too fast honestly.

On one hand, I can‚Äôt wait to no longer have the workload and studying my ass off for exams. On the other hand, I‚Äôm going to miss my college experience so dearly. I wish I cherished this experience more. Freshman and sophomore year were amazing, but junior year was horrendous. I‚Äôm hoping my senior year goes really well this time, I have to get my GPA back up after mental illness took over junior year and destroyed it. Well, maybe I‚Äôm being really dramatic cause I still have a 3.2 overall but my cumulative was a 2.9 when I had a 3.5 up until then. I‚Äôm trying to aim for a 4.0 ü§ûüèæ

I still keep in touch with friends that have graduated since my freshman year; they all tell me that the real world really sucks. Now that I‚Äôm dealing with anxiety and depression, I‚Äôm honestly afraid that once I start working I‚Äôll get so bored and lonely. Literally ALL my friends, both from college and home, will still be in undergrad. When I come home in December, it feels like I won‚Äôt have anybody to hang out with. My boyfriend is moving 45 minutes away from me at the end of this month, and even so when I come back we‚Äôll have different work schedules and I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll be able to see him.

I‚Äôm also really worried about work. I do plan on applying for jobs in November so that way when I come back I have a job lined up for me. In my city, jobs in my field are pretty easy to get. Since there‚Äôs literally 100s of labs, they‚Äôre actively looking for college STEM grads. I‚Äôve heard from alumni that it wasn‚Äôt hard for them getting a job, but i‚Äôm anxious about it because my university is primarily a teaching university, so there‚Äôs not a lot of opportunities for research. So, I don‚Äôt really have a lot of experience except for what I‚Äôve learned in school. I just did an internship at another school this summer, but it was computational chemistry (I didn‚Äôt pick it, the program placed us where they saw was best fit) so I‚Äôm not sure where that will take me. I‚Äôm just nervous that employers won‚Äôt hire me because I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience.

Right now, my plan is to take a year or two off to work, and then go to radiology school for two years, work the field for a little bit, and move out of state. I‚Äôve been eyeing California as the state to move to. I might even go to PA school, but that hasn‚Äôt been fully decided yet. I‚Äôm just nervous that time won‚Äôt be on my side, I always feel like I have to do everything at once to get it over with and have extra time to myself to do whatever. 

My question to those who‚Äôve graduated and felt the post grad depression, how did you keep yourself happy/entertained? I‚Äôm afraid that when I come back I‚Äôll be so fucking sad that I‚Äôll fall into another depressive state. I just feel like I won‚Äôt know what to do with myself after December."
558,"Are you glad you did it?

Years ago I graduated from a trade school, decided I needed more out of life, and now I‚Äôm about to graduate with a Bachelors in English Literature with a CELTA certificate so I can teach English as a second language. The idea of this job is very exciting for me. But now I‚Äôm realizing as I get older I would like to have a family. Maybe it‚Äôs just my perception, but I feel like if I don‚Äôt make excess money, I‚Äôll be doing a disservice to the family I hope to make.

Essentially I‚Äôm considering going for a Masters in something more profitable. I have interest in things other than English Ed so maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.  I want to know if there‚Äôs anyone out there who has picked a job for the profit and how they feel their life has turned out because of it."
559,"I'm 25 and ive been graduated for 2 years. i went to college in a really small town so i moved to the closest city. it's about 3 hours away. i have a handful of friends ive made over the last two years, but I hardly ever see them. for a long time, everything was shut down bc of covid and i was working weekends, so i didn't really think about going out or seeing friends a lot. i kinda just got used to being alone most of the time. i definitely didnt like it, but it felt normal.

in the past few months I got a more normal M-F schedule and have been going out a bit more and I've realized how isolated i used to be. now i feel the urge to go out and hang out with people every weekend and if i don't I get really sad and lonely, which never used to be the case. I feel like i'm wasting my 20's every time i stay home on friday or saturday. I feel like I see people all over social media going out all the time, but then my actual friends seem to never want to do anything. 

I don't even know what's normal anymore so I'm curious, how often do you go out and do stuff with friends? am I expecting too much by wanting to do something fun every weekend? do you see your friends only every now and then or often? I'm so lost and confused about it"
560,"I hated the rigid routine of school days with a burning passion and for as long as I‚Äôve been half sentient I was waiting to get off those damn timetables and be free. It‚Äôs a huge reason I wanted to pursue something in the arts, where I‚Äôd be self employed. 

‚ÄúTry catching me now, timetables, you bastards!‚Äù

Well, I was wrong! a decade on from my GCSEs and I‚Äôve been trying to put together a timetable for years. Turns out being accountable to nothing and nobody makes it really bloody tricky to actually get anything done. The icing on the shit sandwich is that it turns out if you don‚Äôt belong to an organisation, if there‚Äôs nobody above you in the hierarchy to enforce shit, then any routine you try and put into place has no weight behind it besides the faltering weakling of your own unprepared willpower.

Curse you timetables! Curse you! You were right."

Given this, I'd love to hear if others felt their time was more important and when they stopped caring about money."
562,"What careers/professions are you are most interested in?

What are the real questions you want to ask people who are in that role?"
563,"So I just transferred to my current college last fall after a year off. I was already struggling with making friends, due to commuting and time management before the online switch. And now that everything is going to pretty much continue online at my campus this fall I feel pretty much stripped of the social aspect of college. No new friends, no ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù, I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to balance joining a club due to the workflow. 

And I haven‚Äôt been able to get to know the professors who could potentially point me in the direction of internships.

I still have friends at home but I guess I‚Äôm more concerned for the impact on job opportunities on top of the social ones. Of course I wanted to meet new people socially but I think there‚Äôs not much to say about that haha.

I don‚Äôt want to wait longer to get my degree. So I‚Äôm just trying to feel better about this situation if anyone can offer any insight post graduation. Maybe those who took online classes have more to say about this?"
564,"Hey guys.  
I just wanted to reach out to you guys since I am in a little bit of a life dillemma.  
I gratuated from Business School in 2018 with a B.S.c in International Business, the main reason I went down this path is that after college I really didn't knew what to do so I choose the most interesting (in my opinion) subject I could find in my nearest university. While I was studying I found out that my passion lies in music production so I started producing alot and after gratuation I went to LA for a short producion course and I loved it. At that point I found out that this is my passion and  I really want to move back to LA to pursue my music carrier full time but moving there is quite expensive (since I live 13 hours by plane away) and uncertain and I can't handle to much uncertanty. So my common sense is telling me to just find some interesting Masters degree since I feel like that could be a little bit of a safety net for the future if the music thing doen't work out. I'm now in this dillemma that my girlfriend is moving abroad to study and I really don't know if I should go with her and take some masters degree there or pursue my passion and move to LA and learn more in the music field which is much much more risk. The other think in this equation is that she kind of don't want to live separately in the opposite country so I feel like the music thing would be a double risk in that sense. What do you guys think?"
565,"I just finished my bachelors degree in Journalism this week. I hate my degree. i didn't realize till it was too late for me to change so i stuck with it and got a minor in psychology as well. I wanna get a masters in creative writing at my same college. But i also wanna do it own my terms. I would like to take a semester off, get experience that i barely have, better my writing (school made me lose motivation to write for my own benefit) but my mother (who i live with) thinks it better that i go straight into the masters after this semester. The thing is, i couldn't start the process while finishing my bachelors, while the only thing i could do was send my resume and my purpose statement but i could barely do that when i had so much work this semester. I'm gonna call tomorrow and see how much time i have to apply for the masters before the trimester starts but.. i don't want to. I want a break. i want to find my passion for writing again. I want my masters but mentally im not there. Somehow...i feel like i've failed at life. It's like everyones ahead of me. i feel like a lazy person because i want to take a gap semester. I love my mom, i know she wants the best for me but damn...im tired. im miserable and im depressed."

567,"Morning everyone,

I'm writing this not to say woe is me. I'm writing because I truly am scared that I'm trapped in the life I have now.

I'm exactly one week out from graduating with a B.A in Communication from a small private Christian university in northern Indiana. I'm lucky enough that the retail job that I've been working at for four years was willing to take me on at $17 an hour, allowing me to live by myself. I feel trapped in this life, and because I didn't get any job in my field right out of college that it's never going to happen. I applied for over 70+ positions across the country and didn't get an interview back. I already feel like giving up and being stuck in retail forever, with a degree. My university stunk at networking, and the career connections office wasn't much help. Even the people helping me for being on the spectrum have since stopped emailing me (VR services). I have no idea where to go or who to reach out to and I feel trapped in a dead-end job that won't ever make something of myself."
568,"Hi all,

Just found this sub, and thought it might be a good place to look for some encouragement. I'll keep it short and succinct.

When I came into college, I was pretty alone. I had a hard time making friends in high school, and had a ton of self-worth issues. Over the first few years of college though, I made friends, and good friends at that. Ones who I knew had my back and knew me well, and who supported me no matter what. We didn't do everything together, but we were a crew that went through life together both in the good things and the bad.

Even before the pandemic though, certain events transpired that made me loose a lot of them. A lot of it was my fault, and I really hurt some of them. Then the pandemic hit, and the rest of them either stopped reaching out or I'm only able to talk with them once every now and then.

Now, a few days before I graduate and in a (borderline) post-pandemic world, I'm walking away with basically no friends from my time at school. I'm getting married to my best friend later in the year, but it's hard thinking of having a wedding and celebrating that without those who I very recently counted as my crew and my second family. I'm not excited to graduate by myself either.

I'm just feeling hopeless and defeated, like I won't ever find that kind of community again and that my mistakes cost me something one-of-a-kind. (And hurt that the others just abandoned me.)

Maybe there's not a lot of encouragement here-maybe other people feel this way?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I've gotten so many encouraging comments, and I'll try to respond to each one soon. In the meantime, take this as a very grateful thank-you. I know you all are strangers, but the words have genuinely made today better. :) "
569,"My ten year high school reunion will be this summer and I‚Äôm not sure if I should go. Seeing some people would be nice, but I feel like I‚Äôd mainly be going for egotistical reasons. What are your thoughts on reunions (high school or college)?"

571,"I realize I just need help‚Ä¶I am just tired of everything;  (life, being miserable everyday working a job I hate just to make a paycheck, feeling like I can never catch up and I am always behind the 8 ball. Tired of feeling like no matter how much effort I give to everyone and everything is it all worthless in the end. 
tired of being angry at people that I don‚Äôt even know whether they are more successful an me regardless if they earned that success or not. Tired of being envious of other people.

572,"I studied Macro Economics in college 2 years ago and learned all about how the Federal Reserve works. But now during the Pandamic, I literally can't remember any of it.

Why did this happen and what should I do?"
573,"(Or at least I think it‚Äôs burnout - this could be the wrong word). 

Since the beginning of high school, I‚Äôve been extremely busy. In high school, I did sports, clubs, and a ton of AP classes (which apparently don‚Äôt even count for anything but that‚Äôs another story). My schedule started by arriving at school at 6am and leaving at 6pm. Where I would then start homework. On top of that, one parent was battling stage four cancer and the other spent the whole time taking care of them so I was basically mom #2 to my younger siblings. And I would take 9 hour shifts on weekends and then work 48 hours/week all summer. 

In college, things didn‚Äôt change much. At this point both of my parents were unemployed and college is expensive. Because of that I tried to overload my courses to get done faster, work a lot at my job, and also do unpaid intern and research work so that I can actually apply for jobs.

I feel like I just got over that hump (am still applying for jobs and working but school is basically at the finish line) and I realized how miserable I was for long stretches of time because I was overworked. 

I want to enjoy life. I want to try new experiences. I want to wake up content like 45% of my days at least. Idk maybe that‚Äôs a tall order but I really want to be happy.

But at this point, I feel that I‚Äôm unable to say no. To set boundaries and set aside me time. I also feel like I‚Äôm a personality-less robot. I have no hobbies or anything because I‚Äôve never had time. I‚Äôve never even been in a real relationship.

I don‚Äôt know how to start rebuilding my life and avoid falling in the trap of a dull, overworked life for the rest of my existence.

How did you guys turn off the go-go-go panic of college without shutting down completely? Have you established a work life balance? Have you learned anything about yourself since leaving school?

Sorry, didn‚Äôt intend for this to be so long."
574,"For those employed, I often hear this a lot. It's all about being in the right place at the right time or meeting the correct people.   


For our short time on earth, like many others, I imagine there are quite a few of you employed and many unemployed by the pandemic, through no fault of their own, of course. So keeping in mind that with time, we will all find new occupations, in what rather particular or un-predictable ways did your presence at an event, or knowing someone, lead to a job? 

  
What I'm trying to do is start a discussion and hear about other's experiences in regards to what they did that led them to a connection, and in particular an employment opportunity. What I think is most damaging about the COVID-19 pandemic is how networking has faulted to a hard stop completely.   


Most job applications are now automated, and through a computer. So when things get better, I would love to go back outside and actually meet new people. But, for starters, how did you being in the right place at the right time, or knowing someone, lead to your current job?"
575,"Im 21, graduate end of April but they'd need me to start beginning of next year so would probably have to split my courses amongst next semester and an extra spring semester, anyone do that and think it's worth it? They just got extra headcount and want to use it right away.

Honestly my original plan was to take 3-4 months off after school to get a break since after that I'll just just two week vacations as long as I have a 9-5. But because of covid, idk if I should just take the job since the job market might be rough.

I feel like I'd regret taking it and not having a break but I'd also regret not taking it. I was thinking I could always just come back to this company after I graduate if there's a spot available in their job openings since the people really like me, but I guess that's not guaranteed.

EDIT: Sorry a better title would be ""Got a fulltime job offer at **my internship** but requires me to start in my last semester, worth it?""

For more background I interned here last summer fulltime, as well as this summer, and now currently working 20 hrs part time while in my second last semester of school. It's been way too draining working part time with online school though so my original plan for next semester was to focus on school only"
576,"Hey'all!!!

I'm turning 25 and I'm kinda stuck about what my next step in life should be.

I graduated from uni in 2017 with a degree in Statistics. I've been pondering about doing a masters (online masters too) but I don't wanna be a broke student. I also don't want to be stressed with work and school. Heck, I'm not even sure I want to do a masters anyways, especially if it will out me in school loan debt. Id have to deplete my savings for a masters,which isn't also that significant. 

And also another thing about a masters, I don't want something difficult. I want it to be fun and exciting! I was thinking maybe marketing analytics. And low commitment. Oh man, I'm so confused!

Also, can you get by without a masters? Or does its necessity increase with age when you want an executive position.

Someone please share your advice or experience."
577,"Hey, I just started my senior year of high school last week but I‚Äôm starting to worry about what I should do after. I‚Äôve always loved doing things with computers and technology but I‚Äôm not sure if I would be able to get into a course like that in university. 

The reason I say this is because I checked the pre requisites online and some of the universities want a physics, biology, and chemistry course with above an 85% average in all of them. The thing is, I haven‚Äôt completed the grade 11 physics, biology etc, so I couldn‚Äôt even start the grade 12 courses if I wanted to.

This is why I‚Äôm sort of stuck... I don‚Äôt have the pre requisites and I don‚Äôt know how post secondary works as it‚Äôs never really been explained thoroughly. I‚Äôm also really interested in working abroad but don‚Äôt know if that would be a viable option or where I would begin with that.

580,"I work in the mental health field. The pay in general for the field is low. I recently started a job as a bachelor's level case manager for individuals with severe mental illness making $32,000 a year. I work 40 hours a week with flexible hours. When I started my new job, I stayed prn at my old job as a health technician at a residential facility. I work there overnights every Friday and Saturday except for one weekend a month. The pay there is $14 an hour. With both jobs I'll be at around $40,000 give or take depending on if I pick up any extra hours at my prn job.

I'm currently living with my parents paying no rent and my grocery cost is very low. With hardly any expenses I still feel like I'm not making enough for myself. I know money shouldn't be a determinant for a job, however, I wish I could make more especially for the high stress of my job. I also feel like balancing my health and social life with my job is becoming difficult. Before starting my case management job I was working 56 hours a week still but just at one job. I've been described as a workaholic and I know that my mental health will start to worsen. 

Only thing is that I'm stuck in my job and I don't want to ruin any ties to my current company. The light at the end of the tunnel is that if I stay with my current job's company (a large healthcare system in my state) then I'll have access to a pension after 5 years on top of my 401k and they'll pay for my schooling after 1 year of work. If I can stick it out 3 years (1 year of work until I can go back to school plus 2 years of working full time and getting my masters degree) I'll be in a much better position because I can go to school for informatics or quality assurance which will pay a higher living wage."
581,"I‚Äôve come to realize how important a sense of community is for basic sanity and mental health. I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so great about college.

I may be biased since I went to a small college, but it was genuinely nice to hang around coffee shop/libraries and run into people.  It felt cozy and warm. I‚Äôm really not worried about forming new ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but I am worried about finding a sense of community in a new place, outside of work.

I went on the hospitals website and applied to literally every single research tech position I could find. One of the PI‚Äôs did a Skype interview with me mid-December while I was in school. After the holidays and such, I went to the lab for a tour and some more questioning. I remember going in on a Tuesday and she said that she would get back to me that Friday because she was interviewing other candidates. I was really really nervous because I kept thinking that maybe she wanted the other people and not me, especially because she was concerned about my plans for the future. 

I wanted to start taking some anatomy classes at my local community college because I want to go to Radiology school to then eventually go to PA school. She reiterated to me that this position requires a two year commitment, and she felt that I wasn‚Äôt sure about my plans. I thought that would be a deal breaker for her and I was nervous that whole week. However I remained positive throughout, I did not want to put out into existence that I wasn‚Äôt gonna get the job.

She ended up getting back to me that Thursday and I was on the moon! I didn‚Äôt bother asking her why she got back to me so early, just knowing that she wanted me as her tech was enough for me. However, she did explain to me that it was up to the hospital to hire me because they make the ultimate decision. So, I had to wait for the hospital to get back to me. I had to do a reference check first and then they would get back to me with an offer. 

I waited about two weeks after the reference check. I was starting to feel really discouraged, especially because I had made the mistake of telling my family and friends and updated my LinkedIn that I got the job. I kept emailing my PI letting her know I wasn‚Äôt hearing anything back. I kept getting more anxious by the day. I contacted some people I know that work there and they said that they waited about a week for their time offer letter.

My PI then asked me to do a Skype call with someone from her team that I didn‚Äôt meet because when I went to the tour not everybody was there. I emailed her and we set the date for the call, but last minute I had a family emergency and I emailed her letting her know of the situation. She was completely understanding and so kind about it, I really admired her compassion. So we postponed the call for the following week. 

A few days later, I still don‚Äôt hear anything. I emailed my PI, and she told me to email the same woman from her team about the hiring process. She‚Äôs been working at the hospital for over a decade and has hired a lot of techs so she was more knowledgeable. So that‚Äôs what I did.

Everything finally made sense. She explained to me that the hospital had looked over my application and references and resume, but they raised concerns over my research experience. My only research experience was last summer in a computational chemistry lab, and I guess they didn‚Äôt count the research I did in my instrumental analysis class this past fall. Normally their research techs have more experience than that, so they wanted one more person to approve of my hire. So therefore the purpose of the Skype call was for her get to know me better. She did say that she could tell I‚Äôm very professional based on the way I handled a difficult situation and that my PI has said great things about me, so I felt really confident about this job. That was about a few days ago.

Yesterday, I finally received the good news. I got my offer letter!!! Finally, I got the job I‚Äôve been wanting for so long. I turned down a lot of calls and interviews in hopes of landing this job, and I‚Äôm really fortunate enough to say that I landed a job within two months of being home at a really great hospital. I know that people struggle after graduation finding a job and most of the time it takes months. I don‚Äôt know how this happened to me to be honest, does this happen often? I mean, my PI said that she was desperately looking for a tech and she was one of the two people to contact me with an interview out of the 70+ research technician positions I applied for on the website. It‚Äôs just crazy to me how this has all went down. It‚Äôs a good salary too so I‚Äôll hopefully be set to move out of my parents house by the end of the summer and pay off a good amount of my student loans. 

So for those of you that feel discouraged not finding a job in their field, please don‚Äôt give up! Stay consistent, constantly stay in contact, stay positive, fight for that job, take what you can so you can at least have money, and more importantly take care of yourself."
583,"Hey guys, I graduated high school last year and have recently just landed a full time job, the work is good and I‚Äôm learning new skills but I can‚Äôt help but struggle to cope with not having as much energy and free time as I did before. I get home from work and all I want to do is laze around. part of me wants to get covid so I can get a little break from work. 

I get that this seems like I‚Äôm being dramatic and everyone does this but I can‚Äôt help but feel sad that this is what the rest of my life is going to be. So how do you guys find it?"
584,"I graduated from college this year. My senior year I was remote due to covid. I also broke up with my long-term girlfriend (who I started dating at the beginning of college) during fall semester of last year. So it was kind of the perfect storm for huge periods of my life coming to an end. My plan was to attend law school, but instead took a gap year and I‚Äôm currently working. I am naturally introverted, but college was a time when I really challenged myself to spend time out of my comfort zone. I made a lot of friends and was really involved. 

Recently, I came back for my alumni weekend. I had an amazing time seeing everyone in person after so long, and it honestly felt like I had never left. Afterwards though I found myself extremely depressed. For a short time I felt like I belonged again. I felt wanted and appreciated, just to go back to my hometown to be alone. I don‚Äôt mind my job and my coworkers are all very nice and supportive. But it just doesn‚Äôt feel like I did in college. I really feel like I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore and it becomes so hard to stay motivated or even happy. I try hard to spend time with friends, but even that is exhausting for me as everywhere I go I feel like I don‚Äôt belong. I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll never find this feeling again. I‚Äôm planning on going back to school next fall and hope it willl help, but I‚Äôm still left afraid it won‚Äôt"

586,"Bit of a rant here but I just feel so defeated. After graduating college, spending months looking for jobs with no experience, and hundreds of applications later, I finally got a call back for an interview in my field of study. I tried my hardest to stay as confident as possible in my skills and abilities, but in the end it didn‚Äôt matter. I went in for a face to face interview yesterday in front of a panel of 4 people and tried to be as professional as I could. I can describe the whole experience as being torn limb for limb by a pack of hungry sharks. I can still remember the way they combed through my entire resume in disdain, critiquing all of my prior job experiences as they hammered me with questions about my prior jobs. Most of which were in retail or service which have little to do with my field of study anyway. I came to realize that I have wasted 4 years of my life for a degree that hasn‚Äôt gotten me anywhere, and I chose the wrong major (Psychology, btw). I have never been more humiliated in my life, the only good part about this rejection is now Im sure I don‚Äôt belong in this field. I‚Äôm just wondering how I‚Äôm going to continue. I don‚Äôt want to be stuck doing customer service work for the rest of my life, so I guess back to school it is. I am most likely going back to community college to start over. I want to study computer science now, but honestly am I just making another big mistake? Thoughts? Should I keep pushing myself through school or try a different way like getting certified in a trade?"
587,"I just finished my business degree in December with an emphasis in marketing and am kinda confused/scared for whats next. 

I know I should start applying for jobs, but what if I don‚Äôt remember every little thing each company is looking for, do you get retrained, I don‚Äôt wanna seem like an idiot in my interviews.

Secondly I don‚Äôt even know how I go about looking, so I just use LinkedIn? I don‚Äôt know how hard it will be right now with the covid situation, but I feel stuck now, and just would like some advice on what I should do. 

Is it normal for a graduate to be out of work for a long time, if they are not lucky finding work? I just hope someone can ease my anxiety lol,

Thanks all"
588,"Im a 17 year old high school senior with horrible gpa and grades, I know that with my current situation i wont be able to get into any good colleges and I probably wont even pass high school. Is there any alternative school or a thing after high school that allows you to raise gpa take the state test or anything like that. Something like a second chance. So far my life has been wasted I want to change that."
589,"I'm in my final year in uni (I'm an international student in France and I want to work in the EU after graduation (7 months from now) and since classes are online and tests are breezy, I want to do a couple of courses online. I already did one on Financial Markets from Yale and my college has given us free access to Coursera for two courses which is how I did the Yale one for free as well (it costs like $150 lol)

I wanted to know from people who work in the field in want to work in ( I want to work preferably in finance but I'm okay with other jobs you get after a business major like consulting or that sort) what course would work best?  I obviously don't NEED any course, this is just to pad my resume. 

I heard SQL was a good one to have but I found a really good course on YouTube but obviously that would just teach me how to do it, it wouldn't provide any certification, but do you need certs for SQL? I figured since I can learn SQL off YouTube it might help to do a course on something else?

I also wanted  some tips in general on how to get hired after graduation as an International student here in France, my French is okay but I would much rather work in a job that doesn't need me to speak French on a day to day basis (if that is even possible)"
590,"I just recently got laid off, but prior to that, was working towards what I had considered a promotion, raise, title jump in my career. I'm kind of sad and disappointed it didn't work out, but when I was still employed, I couldn't help but feel anxious, panic, and worry that somehow this was it. This was what I had written my career job to be, and well, while I know where that got me, I also understand that somehow there must have been more. 

&#x200B;

While my main goal now is to attain new employment in an economy that isn't so demand-friendly, I realize I may fall back into the same feelings of angst and worry and panic about my career and want to make it. So I suppose the question goes, when does that feeling go away? 

&#x200B;

When will I really feel like I've accomplished all that there is to be and that my worry over getting more money, a better job, or title at work will go away? When do I stop feeling like every second I'm going to be written up, or worse, fired? 

&#x200B;

When do I stop worrying over employment and slaving myself tirelessly for the bigger man?"
591,"So to preface this, I‚Äôve had ADD (if they even call it that anymore) since I was a kid. I‚Äôve been taking medication on and off since middle school, but have always struggled academically because it‚Äôs impossible for me to focus sometimes. 

Well, since graduating uni less than a year ago and getting a remote job‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve found it difficult to just sit down and do work on demand. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I finish my work in time and thankfully I‚Äôm a bit overqualified for this position so there are no complaints from my employer. But for some reason, when I was in school I always told myself the ADHD would go away once I had a job because I would have money to motivate me. 

Well, I was wrong and while I‚Äôm not missing due dates, I constantly find myself procrastinating and since these assignments are very independent, I typically start working at like 10 PM the night before and finish early in the morning. I‚Äôm trying to get a better hold of my work ethic, but it‚Äôs just not happening and I‚Äôm worried how that will translate to future jobs when I may not have as much leeway. 

Anyways, I feel like I‚Äôm just rambling now but this has been sort of worrying now that I see my ADHD didn‚Äôt magically disappear when I graduated lol. Just curious if anyone here shares a similar sentiment"
592,"My 4 years weren't exactly the best, I would never say I peaked in high school. In fact when I graduated I was the happiest dude to grace the stage. But mentally and emotionally speaking, sometimes it's like I'm still stuck there.

When things were bad in school, I at least I got to look forward and say ""Oh well at least high school will end, once I become an adult things will get better"".

Well I graduated 2 years ago. And while some things DID get better. Like I now have a part time job that pays decently so I can buy things, I've grown up and matured and now have a better sense of who I am as a person, along with a better idea about what the world is like, I'm slightly more skilled at certain hobbies, solved some health issues I had back then that seemed insurmountable while I was a student. etc.

Socially/romantically, things never improved much, if at all. I still have most of my friends from back then, and even met a few new ones. But my dating life is pretty much dead. And almost everywhere I go, I still feel that same sense of exclusion and isolation I felt back then.

Not to sound sexist when I say this. It's just when I was in high school, I thought my dating life sucked and would improve after I graduated because girls in high school were dumb, and that after I graduated, they will have matured and smartened up (like I would), and I will have a better time dating because of that. When as an adult, that couldn't be any further from the truth.

Socially, as an adult, it just feels like running into the same exact situations I've seen in HS. It's just the names, faces, and places change. As I get older and feel more and more like giving up entirely.

Granted, I myself was in high school so it's not like I had any idea of how things would actually play out, nor did I really know how women worked. But seeing my social life (and dating life as well) improve was kind of the thing I was looking forward to the most. But I'm almost 20 and never been in a good relationship. Just like high school, every girl I fancied was either already taken or just didn't want anything to do with me otherwise.

And I often feel like I'm in ""second place"" or that girls just settle for me just cause they have no other options. No other men to abuse and take advantage of cause they're either taken or smart enough to say no. They see me as an easy target cause I'm a bit of a loner and have little/no dating experience.

With that, it's hard not feeling like it'll always be this way because I was a bit of a loner in HS. Like that's just what the rest of my life will be like. Like it's over before I even had a chance. It feels like I've been lied to.

Before I graduated, so many people said that their dating lives skyrocketed after graduation. They go from virgins to (I hate to say it) Chads cause they figured out this big secret that got them laid. A secret that I never found.

I often get angry and even sometimes feel jealous and resentful that other people had it better (and will always have it better) than I did cause they're like 6 years ahead of me in terms of dating. And everyone either meets or soon meets their lifelong SO in their late teens/early 20's so at this point I might as well either become a monk or eat a shotgun if I want to stay sane in spite of this huge disappointment.

I'm not a member of any incel communities (and I don't want to be) but holy hell, the frustration and sense of failure, and feeling like it was over before it even begun, and that I should just give up make me worry about becoming one.

I'm not gonna kill anybody. I just feel like one of these days I'm gonna lose my cool and go on a long, probably sexist tirade at the wrong time, or even worse, end up sabotaging a great future I could have just because I failed in the past. Being my own downfall.

When I tell people this stuff. They always tell me that one day I'll find love. I know they have the best intentions because I bet that was true for them. But that doesn't really help me because that's exactly what I believed when I was younger. It's because I believed I'd find love, then failed to find it after I graduated, that made me this angry, disappointed man today.

I'm still guilty of this habit. But I think my biggest problem was that I expected everything to get better right out of the gate. That I would instantly have everything I wanted just cause I was an adult. I can be a very stubborn and impatient person and it probably bit me in the ass. I know this went from general young adult woes to me being mad my dating life still sucks. But I still feel stuck in high school, and this huge disappointment that I never got everything I wanted out of it.

Lastly, economic woes. I graduated right before the pandemic. Before that, and before I started working. I believed that being a good worker and working hard would get me places. As time went by, I realized that was a bullshit lie as well since most workplaces feel like HS all over again. Where I won't fit in, and will probably be taken advantage of.

Not only that, searching for a job feels nigh impossible sometimes. I'm not really sure where to put it, but I felt like including it in there since, again, it's like I'm mentally trapped in high school.

All in all, my outlook on life and the future feels pretty grim now. I feel like my life will just be high school for 60 years, all while watching the world go to shit.

If you've gotten this far without skipping down to the bottom. Thanks. I've had this bottled up for years.

TL;DR - Recently graduated high school only for things not to work out as I'd hoped. I still feel mentally trapped in high school."
593,"I think many times we often leave a job for another, and most of the time, it's due to a variety of reasons. We were bored, we wanted to leave, we got a new job, we didn't like it, the point being that it's a negative reason we are leaving and we are glad to be starting something new.

For those that are not leaving because of something negative, but rather, because for different reasons, it can only be difficult and hard to do so, since presumably, we have invested friendships, colleagues we like, coworkers we love, bosses we hate, and companies we have an affinity for.

So in this instance where you're not leaving a job for another, how do we deal with closing that chapter of our life?"
594,"Hello, I was wondering if any of you could give anecdotal experience about your cities (in USA, before covid) that you are fond of for those of you who don't own a car? In short, I really don't like driving. It is my personal belief that Boston actually isn't very good with public transportation, as the MBTA always shut down in random odd places or was extremely late, and I had to use Uber a lot which was expensive. Public buses in suburbs were also usually only recurring about every half hour, or every twenty minutes on good days. I've looked into NYC, but it's very competitive to get work for good places, so I'm not sure and was just wondering what your opinions of your own places were. thanks"
595,"Some background info about me.
I barely was able to graduate high school due to me slacking off on school work because I thought most of my classes were completely useless.
I utilized an alternative program my high school had to obtain my diploma and my teacher worked with me to swap some of my credits to help me graduate on time (took three semesters of pre algebra and never started algebra 1) 
I'm terrible with math and science and I always struggled very hard with these two subject. English, writing and history I did well with except for my punctuation I struggled with a bit.
Now that I'm older i am able to focus much better than I used to, I'm more of a tactile learner, I struggle with visual and audio learning to a great extent.
I have no idea what I want my major to be, and my biggest fear is that I'm going to struggle and fail my classes and that I'm not intelligent enough to be able to succeed and some form of academic environment.
Any advice is highly appreciated!"
596,And how could we as a society fix it?
597,"Had my last final test today at noon. I feel ‚Äúempty‚Äù all of the sudden, I‚Äôm not sad nor I‚Äôm happy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm grateful and relieved after a hectic two weeks of submissions and tests.

Did anyone go through this?"
598,"First some background info. I‚Äôm 19, living in Finland, I was going to have my high school final exams in May 2020 (I did the IB-program), which got cancelled due to Covid-19. So basically, our final grades were chosen based on some unknown algorithm/formula, which resulted in my final grades being WAY lower than my predicted grades, hence, I didn‚Äôt graduate nor get my diploma. I have to retake my final exams in November with hopes of raising my grades. I already had a conditional offer in my dream program in a university in Amsterdam, only requirement was to get the diploma/graduate. Google ‚ÄùIB Scandal‚Äù and you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about.
So officially, I‚Äôm not a student in any facility. I‚Äôm forced to take a gap year and try to raise my grades. 

My dilemma is:
I wanna move out to my own place, but since I‚Äôm officially not a student anywhere, I won‚Äôt be able to apply for the student loan in Finland. I‚Äôm currently working at a hardware store, and I‚Äôm quitting in a month since I want to dedicate majority of my time for studying. However, studying at home is a nightmare, there are 6 family members living inside this house and a baby, the noise is insurmountable. Studying in my bedroom is impossible due to the distractions. I live in a smaller town, a 20 minute carride away from the nearest mall where I have a library and good cafes where I can study. I have my mom‚Äôs old car that I can use. The noise is most likely the least of my problems in this house, we rarely get along in my family, we fight all the time, been like this since I was young, it drains the absolute life and energy out of me, you have no idea. It‚Äôs not COMPLETELY insane, but we have our different ideologies that clash on the daily. 
I feel like my life is on pause, and moving to Amsterdam was going to kickstart my life/journey in financial independence (and independence in general). Living yet another year at home (not even enrolled in any university) seems like a major waste of time, obviously I have the November 2020 exams that I need to study for but after that, I have a good 9-10 months of me just picking my ass at home which I do not want to do. My university was kind enough to defer my conditional offer to September 2021. I do want to make money though, which is the only light at the end of the tunnel. Working a 9-5 is the only job I have right now but I‚Äôm constantly looking for other options.

Please give all the advice that you can give."

605,"I caught up with a group of friends at the bar the other night which I hadn‚Äôt seen in over a year. I feel so awful about myself and I don‚Äôt know if I deserve it 

For context. I was one of the few who went to college. A really good one actually. I got amazing grades in school. The rest all stayed in retail or trade job etc. one went to an Ok university. They all flunked out of school I studied biology instead. I had the admiration of my parents, teachers and even these  friends. In my final year I barely passed as I was travelling abroad in the US not focusing on the future, fell in love and got married . However thankfully I passed pretty well‚Ä¶

Now I‚Äôm totally lost and want to go back to nursing school. But I‚Äôm starting at square one as a CNA making an awful wage. Now my friends have all settled and made businesses, found great jobs, made real skills. And I gained very little out of my education. Maybe that‚Äôs my fault but I knew I had little future with a biology undergraduate so I‚Äôm pursuing something new. I‚Äôm back to square one and they are miles ahead of me. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel this is my fault. I focused purely on education my whole life rather than making money and now I‚Äôm just a bum who lives with his parents. It‚Äôs on me. And I don‚Äôt deserve to be jealous. I know this isn‚Äôt the right outlook but the pity and sympathy I get from my friends for my job is making me feel sick.

606,"I'm a 24 y/o female, and I'll be moving back in with my parents after two years post-graduation. I graduated in 2019 and spent the next two years traveling. In those two years, I traveled abroad, nannied, volunteered, practiced my languages, worked as a TA in a school, and took an internship. I had the time of my life,  and it felt like my life ""peaked"" so to speak. I had no money, but it didn't matter. Now I'm moving back home. Make no mistake, I love my parents dearly, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm going back to square one."
607,"First off, I want to start by saying I'm a pretty adaptable person. Growing up, my family moved over 6 times and I've learned to adapt. So that's why I came on here looking for help because I currently hate my life after college. 2 years ago I moved for a job and for grad school. In doing so, I lost all of my college friends. 2 years later and I still don't have any real connections. I've had fake friends and mean friends of plenty, but nothing compares to the friendships I formed in college (back in my hometown). I'm just missing it so much. The routine. The late-night drives. The student lifestyle. The time where we're all young and ""stuck"" in one place. Only to find out that it's 10x harder out here to find people you can trust. I don't have a life right now and that's a pretty shitty thing to realize. I guess that's what happens when you move from a big city to the middle of nowhere. I mean there is literally nothing to do here and nobody my age here. I'm losing it. It's a 3 day weekend and I've sat in my apartment for the majority of it. I am about to go into a spiral of toxic thoughts. The only ""fun"" thing I did this weekend was going to the movies and farmer's markets. What happened to this generation? What happened to being social and welcoming? We go into these academic environments brainwashed by the end of it. With the notion that all I'm ever good for and all I should set my sights on is being successful. I have friends who decided it was better to lose their friendships over a dollar bill. I get it. We all have to survive and make a living. That's not my initial point. My point is college is my bittersweet ex. That I love to hate and hate to love. What is wrong with me? Do I just miss having friends or is it something more?"

Not a chatty person but did answer people‚Äôs questions at 80% of people are earlier leaving or coming back home from class etc. 

Left work at 2 before I left sent a text to my boss asking/ suggesting when to be in on Monday and Tuesday. Got a reply agreeing the Monday time and said would discuss next week for tuesday‚Äôs times. Said ok locked up and left. 

Went grocery shopping and errands, walking home then get a call from the agency person who got my the job and pays me. She said that my temporary contract has been ended effective immediately and asked for me to go to their office to talk and also give back some keys. But not really saying why. 

Just got back from that meeting and turns out it‚Äôs not my quality of work which was great and I have on time etc. It was because I‚Äôm not a chatty person and not a right fit. I understand that I‚Äôm not a talkative person whatsoever - what really gets me is the last message I got less than 2 hours before the call. Was agreeing when I would be in on Monday and discuss the others next week. I was on the phone to my boss today too and she was giving me stuff to do. Plus this week I saw her for an hour on Monday and the other 3 days I was in this week I was there on my own, and saw a colleague I hadn‚Äôt met before for about 5 minutes. 

So now back to where I was 2 weeks ago - no job or interviews and more job applications to submit. Full time and part time."
610,"Whenever I went to school I never commuted more than 15 minutes.  Now that seems like a luxury and the norm is for people to commute long distances. I can't believe some people actually commute an hour or so every damn day! Think of all that time you waste sitting in your car and the extra gas you have to pay. You gotta wake up earlier and that's less free time you have after work. THat's the quickest way for me to start hating life. I just don't buy the idea that ""you gotta do what you gotta do to pay the bills."" BS, I'm sorry I'm not ever driving that long to go to work. Sorry if this sounds like a rant but I had to get that off my chest."
611,"I know I don't need a kid or marriage but in your late 20's to early 30's it feels like it if you want a good social life. The kid and partner will keep you busy, everything you do is around your kids, and then you meet other parents to socialize with.

Well guess what I don't have any of that so why would I want to hang out with other couples?  I just find myself in a weird position socially. It's this weird in between phase where I'm not a parent yet but I'm not 20 anymore looking to party on the weekends. Everyone my age is going in all different directions. Does this make any sense?"
612,"Comparison is something that always happens but I feel it's magnified in your 20's-30's.  Some people are making money some aren't, some got the dream job some don't, some people have a new car and some don't, I think you get the picture.  I just sense that's there's too much bragging, too much one upping,  trying to appear a certain way, and it's all because of the fear of not being good enough."
613,"As per the title, my question becomes- how can you be in a similar type of community as an adult? 

&#x200B;

Most posts in this sub end with advice that boils down to ""find what make you happy/your own path"". What if the only thing that makes you happy is being known and liked by a large, but tight nit community; like a medium to large size college. A place where you can go to the bar on a friday and know 50%+ of the people in the bar, and all of those people are similar to you, and make you feel known and ""popular"". 

&#x200B;

Is it possible to find this in the real world or am I doomed to a pessimistic life?"
614,"I was fortunate enough to attend a university that allowed me to endlessly chase my passion of skiing. After 5 years of it, I grew tired of the small social scene and moved back to my home town to switch things up. Unfortunately, corona has created some difficulty to get an entry level job in marketing and it feels somewhat daunting to start my career right now. I have an opportunity to return to my job as a ski coach in my college town that will have secure income as well as a secured amounts of fun. Feels somewhat like a regression and does not fulfill my desire to get a job that gives more direction to my future. Was hoping to get some insight as to if there is a downside to not starting my career now, 23 M, or give it some time to let the flares of COVID to settle down?"
615,"There were some crazy and eye-opening statistics around millennial careers in a Hubspot post I recently read. A few that stuck out to me. 

* *Millennials make up roughly half of the US workforce. (Adobe)*
* *63% of millennials have over $10,000 in student debt. (Padilla)*
* *Back in 2016, loans were already a huge concern to millennials as 52% were worried they'd default in the next 10 months. (UBS)*

That's right! Millennials make up HALF of the workforce likely trying to pay back the (unnecessarily high) student debt they owe. That doesn't seem lazy or irresponsible to me. 

I know millennials (I'm one of them) often get a bad rap, but instead of blaming each other, maybe we can help support one another. 

Every generation has its hardships but we can all work through them together!

617,"I just graduated high school back in May and not even a week later I got a job that pays $10 a hour (in Georgia). In life I know I want to be a Fashion Designer / Photographer, but I kind of just need a back up career for security. I‚Äôm not sure if I want to go to college. I signed up at my local community college to major in cyber security, but deep down I do not like school at all! I‚Äôm a person that needs to be throughout the day, and if not I‚Äôll get extremely bored and unfocused, and then eventually fall asleep. So now I‚Äôm here for advice, should I go to community college to get the security of a job or should keep my current job and chase my dream."

619,"It has been a year since I graduated, still struggling to find full-time. Been going through post-grad depression since July 2019, along the way, managed to get seasonal part-time jobs until Jan 2020 and have been unemployed since then. In between, I applied to job boards, networking on LinkedIn (trying to stay away now cause it is TOXIC), and nothing, no interviews, at most just phone screening and that is it. I have days where I just shut my laptop and not think of job searching and try again. But it has becoming worse, just by looking at job ads, I start to have panic and anxiety attacks and I just slam my laptop and stop doing everything. I start to question myself, my abilities, and my worth. It is even worse when I see my friends and peers are getting jobs left and right on LinkedIn (That's why I try to minimize my interactions there). I just do not know what to do anymore, tried almost everything that I can think of as well as my peers, career counsellor with their tips and advices. I just been in a spiral ever since and again, I don't know what to do. It doesn't help that we're facing the virus now, though I know a lot are still hiring despite the pandemic. I just lost all motivation already..."
620,"Let‚Äôs share some positivity and start the week off in a great way. Here, you can tell us what‚Äôs been positive in your life recently.

Have you gotten a new job? Been promoted? Made a friend? Had a fun weekend? Is there something you‚Äôre looking forward to this week?

No matter if it‚Äôs big or small, share your positivity and your successes here!"
621,"It's the weekend again. Finally, two days where you can enjoy doing whatever you like. That two days is a relief from a job that you detest; a moment for sighing out all the burdens that you have carried in the chest for the past five days; a moment to retreat into your old hobbies or personal projects or side hustles. Some of you hope that you will be able to quit this boring job someday if you have improved your craft in a unignorable level, and that when the right time comes you can transition into a new job. 

But something is not working out. You don't know what two do in these two days of freedom. You know you have skills and talents. You know you would be rather doing a job that resonates with you than the mundane job that have. But you can't do anything! It's as if you are paralyzed. You are anxious because you have only two days to do whatever you want and time seems to be rushing so fast. You are anxious because in two days you are back in the white cubicle or in my case, lifting sacks in a factory. Some of us finds that we wanna do a lot of things in the weekend. Our minds are bustling with ideas. But in the process of thinking and filtering out which activity to do first, you end up doing absolutely nothing. At the end of the day you are laying on the bed. 

Quitting seems to be a default option here but only if it were that easy. 

Does anyone relate? Go on let's discuss this. What are your thoughts?"
622,"What's up long time lurker and first post. After talking to some friends I realized that I had one of the most unorthodox college career paths and decided to share. Did my degree matter? Yes and No. It is very hard to pinpoint all my success to my degree and I also give lots of thought whether I could've done it without my degree. Long story short, I grew up in a small suburb from Colorado and decided to attend a top STEM University in CA, #1 in Computer Science and Architecture, Top 5 in Engineering & Biomed. It was a polytechnic school and I ended up majoring in PSY (liberal arts) LOL. Trust me it was unheard of and I was always the butt of the joke with my peers. Many thought I was going to be an unemployed barista post college. No one ever took me seriously, despite doing very well in school. I minded my own business and explored every possible interest I had and ended up developing a skillset in videography/ photography, despite my major in PSY. I taught myself all I needed through Youtube and lots of trial and error. Eventually I was able to pickup a job through the university and started creating videos for international, graduate, and recruitment videos during my second year. It was very strange to work alongside other student interns who's major was Graphic Design, Videography etc. Many people asked me how the hell I ended up here. I continued to work here until I developed a vast skillset and set off to start a media company alongside two other students. It was the fastest growing media company on the central coast. We started off creating videos, social media marketing, and photography for local coffee shops, and boutiques. This then grew to us doing work for wineries, real estate, event photography. We eventually got picked up by a local media firm and was officially a subcontractor for them. This all ended because I decided to go abroad and study International Relations for the EU in Spain. Decided I was tired of working 100+ doing a full time student, working an internship, and starting my own business. Eventually came back to CA and finished up my PSY degree and graduated in 2020 during the pandemic. I had no idea what the hell I was going to do, despite all this experience. I took 4 months off and bummed it in my mom's basement. Fast forward one year later. I now work in construction management consulting in DC. Yes, I went from majoring in PSY at a polytechnic school to doing videography to construction management. To all the college students wondering what the hell you're going to do post graduation, you don't have to find a job related to your major. You will be surprised at what you can do with your degree. It doesn't have to be linear; it probably won't.



Hope this helps.

TLDR: Majored in PSY at a STEM School, ended up doing marketing the entire time in college just to end up in construction consulting lol."
623,"Not sure how to phrase this, but have recently really started to miss discussing literature, art, politics, etc. with other people who were passionate about learning and understanding. I.e.

I‚Äôve been trying to get internships at my target organizations first and hope those turn into jobs, but every time I apply for an internship they either don‚Äôt get back to me or I don‚Äôt get past the interview stage. I‚Äôve been thinking about connecting with alumni from my college on LinkedIn who work at my target organizations just so I have a connection, but I‚Äôm not sure how to approach them about asking for a job or internship. I feel like deep down I don‚Äôt expect to ever land an internship in the location I want, because I don‚Äôt have any connections, and I‚Äôm frustrated."

627,I feel your 20's-30's is a very strange time.  You're not old but you're not young anymore. Some might still be single and some have started a family. I think my life was so heavily wrapped around school that I didn't know anything else outside of it. I'm living but I don't know myself anymore and feel very disconnected from myself.  I'm stuck in this very weird in between phase.
628,"Happy Wednesday, all! Just wanted to write a short post and admit something that I think we all might asking about, but afraid to admit, which is, it's okay to not know. It's okay to not know what you want to do, where you want to work, what your future plans are, etc. 

Your life did not magically begin the day after your college graduation. It started back when you were a child. So this idea and notion that somehow you were going to start living your life after graduating is not true. 

Life is not a sprint, it's a marathon, with ebbs-and-flows. Start with an interest, and do research. If you're not sure what to do, do something. Don't just sulk or lay low. Meet people. Have conversations. Figure it out. 

You've lived your life thus far, you can make a life worth living. Take dinner or any meal you would eat for example. How do you decide what to eat? What to make? It might come second-nature, but you base it off of items you've had, experiences you shared, and your mood. 

So do the same with your life. Find an interest, look into it, and decide if it's something worth pursuing. 

Just do something, anything, at all!"
629,"I've been done with college since the end of July. I got a degree in Information Systems and did not do an internship (because I swapped to the major right when covid began. Didn't even try to look for an internship that summer) as a result, I have not found a job post college. I've been sitting here since September applying for jobs getting decline after decline and I have never felt so defeated in my life. It makes me so depressed being in a position of wanting to work but no one wants me to work for them. Even with interviews whether they be in person or online I try my best to be presentable and sociable to the person but it's usually always ""thank you for your interest but...""

I really just want to move out of my parents house and be on my own. That's what I've always wanted out of my life, just a simplistic lifestyle of living either alone or with a roommate doing my own thing and not living with my toxic parents anymore. Why can't I find a job? Every old person I talk to looks down on me because I ""should just walk in and give them my application in person and talk to the boss"" like it's the fucking 60s even though I won't get through the front door. I have work experience, I have a degree, I have a (what I think at least) decent resume... yet it's simply not good enough for ""entry level"". I want to pull my hair out. Indeed does nothing.

Does anyone have any tips to maybe land something? Messaging people on linkedin like a fiend? Should I just work at a grocery store/coffee shop until I become stable? I can't be this unproductive anymore."

I will be soon graduating with a Biology BSc degree from one of the best universities in my country.  If I've ever will become and academic I'd want to become an bioinformatician/evolutionary biologist. But recently I've talked with a professor from another good university which most of the research is wetlab and genetics.   


One part of me want to take a year off from school and rest. One part of me does not want to lose time in academic career but I can not find any MSc studentships in my field in my country or I am not qualified for them. When I spoke with this professor I've kind of frightened with the idea of high responsibility and flexible working hours in lab and obligation to become very productive in terms of academic publishment etc etc. I've even think of living off grid in my village and being a farmer. And also thought of working at jobs with my BSc degree only. Actually I do not know what to do and this is only thing when I woke up and before going into bed.  


I'd like hear your advice if you got any experience over this. Thanks a lot. Have a  nice day."

I was a bit depressed after graduating college, left without job opportunities and now find myself wondering my true purpose. I wouldn't say I'm depressed anymore, but no job seems right. And if I had to be honest, the idea of trying to find a job, only to work 40-hours, for the rest of my life, seems silly. Surely, there's got to be more to life, then the desk I work with, the co-workers I'm a part of, and the company that pays me, right?

Everybody I‚Äôve met seemed to have a dream career but I never did. I still don‚Äôt. I went to college because my parents said I‚Äôd be homeless if I didn‚Äôt. Does anybody else not have a dream job?

644,"I recently turned 27 not too long ago, and didn't notice, but my facial hair has started coming in. I know this might come as a surprise to some of you, but for someone like myself, I never really grew facial hair. I don't like the way it looks, so the other day, I started looking at razors and of course, shaving cream. Then started to browse other areas, such as beard oils, or aftershave, creams, lotions, health supplements etc.

I didn't take much care of my body when I was younger. During college, I would survive on a family size bag of Doritos for lunch and be okay. Some days, I didn't eat. A combination of no money, plus a fast metabolism made me hungry at times and extremely hungry at others.

Having turned 27, I am shocked at how much it costs to be an adult. I can't even imagine the costs associated with being a woman.

What is living so expensive?"
645,"Ill try to keep this as short as I can, I just have been feeling really anxious lately and would love any sort of advice or support from anyone who feels/felt these same things.

I just turned 21, M, graduated with a BS in Computer Science this past June. GPA was 3.8. No student loans or any debt, I still live at home. I am close to getting offered a job (have a 3rd interview later today actually where I am sort of expecting to get an offer), however it‚Äôs a job where I would be really the only programmer there. Its a place where they sell/help companies manage and set up different technology systems. 

I have talked/interviewed with two different people, the first guy made it sound like I wouldn‚Äôt be doing a ton of programming which I am fine with knowing that no one else there programs, but the second guy made it sound like I would be doing a bit of programming. My education was practically all software development, but as a new grad, I don‚Äôt think I have the skills to ‚Äúspearhead all programming‚Äù as the second guy put it. With them not having really any programming experience themselves, I just think that they don‚Äôt really understand how hard and how much work even something that sounds so simple can be to make; they don‚Äôt really know what they don‚Äôt know. As a new grad all by myself, how am I supposed to know what software to use, languages to use, how to implement it, etc... the list goes on forever. Although I think it seems like a place though that I would be able to say ‚Äúi dont know/dont think i can do this‚Äù and it would be ok. I just wouldn‚Äôt really have anyone to reference or ask for help from as I would at a traditional software engineering job.

The other things I would be doing would be getting different IT certifications, being in on calls with coworkers and customers, and im not sure what else. Not sure what the pay is yet, but im hoping to find that out today.

I guess the main thing I‚Äôve been feeling anxious about is if I turn down this job, when am I going to get another opportunity for a job? Will it be any better than this one? because it could be worse. There aren‚Äôt a ton of software engineering jobs at the moment in the medium sized city where I‚Äôm at, so I‚Äôm not sure when or where the next opportunity will come up. My parents are luckily nice and understanding and I‚Äôve talked to them about how I‚Äôm feeling and they want me to do whats best for me. If I turned it down they wouldn‚Äôt be angry or anything, although if 8 months from now I'm not able to find a job they may be wondering why I didn‚Äôt just take the job. I also work as a gymnastics coach where I obviously dont make nearly as much, but I really really enjoy it. I've worked there for a little over 4 years now while in college. I actually plan on still working there on saturdays even after I get my real job because I like it so much. I plan on working there part/full time while I search for other jobs if this job im interviewing for doesnt end up being right.

I also am just worried about starting my career in general. I have worked 40 hours a week the past few summers, but thats been at a job (gymnastics coach) thats almost the complete opposite of what this job is. What is working 40 hours a week at a desk job like? I am a pretty active person, am I going to go crazy not being able to go on walks/runs multiple times a day like I‚Äôve been doing the last few years? What about my work/life balance? If I‚Äôm working from home which I may be doing at least some of the time, how do I keep a good work/life balance? I know this is something that I cant avoid no matter what job I get and I know it will be something I get used to, but its just something I have been thinking about.


I should say I am a generally pretty anxious person and I really don‚Äôt like change. I like routine, I like comfortability, I like knowing whats going on. I know that all new jobs are scary and that I wont be comfortable for at least the first few months no matter where I end up, I just want to be put in a position to succeed and I want to get to the point where I am used to the job as quickly as possible. 

I don‚Äôt really know how to end this, I just wanted to sort of get my thoughts out there. I guess just any advice or any thoughts from anyone who has had these similar feelings would be awesome."
646,I've been living in my hometown for the past few years since I graduated college. It's not terrible but it's not great either. I make the best of it and try to find new things to do but I find it to be too familiar . There's just nothing for me to accomplish here anymore and most of the people I know are gone. I shouldn't compare but I see all my friends moving to other cities/states/countries and I can't help but think I'm missing out. I'm scared that I'm settling for an average boring life.
647,"How do you break-up the monotony of life?

Life can be fun, can be exciting, but also repetitive. The weeks fly by, working 5x a week, and the fact that I'm going to graduate school, so I'm both a student and a working professional, means that my weeks will be somewhat repetitive.

Even if you aren't a student, how do you break up the monotony of life? What are you doing?"

The job is great for robots, someone that doesn't want to learn, and do the same task 1,000 times. But even if that is the case, I find I rarely ever have 8 full hours of work. Today, I spent about 3-4 hours, just  ""looking busy."" People that say this is amazing truly don't know how mentally taxing this can be. Doing nothing can be exhausting.

652,"I just recently graduated in May after the worst senior year. I live in GA but decided despite covid, I would still move back to school in Ohio after summer 2020. I lived there for 2 months doing online school and living with my (used to be) best friend. Things eventually went left when my ex and I unexpectedly broke up in October. I was already depressed from not leaving the house much but this was icing on the cake. Not soon after, my best friend and I fell out too and I found out that she was snake of a friend our entire 3 year friendship. This ended with me moving home in November and deciding to just stay in GA and finish my senior year online. At the time, it was best for the support I needed and also so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with a hostile roommate. But then graduation came and like that it was all over. I was done with college and a whole year of that experience was ripped away. 

I harp on it a lot bc my junior year was the best year I had in college, I was super involved, getting to know people and actually opening up a lot. Growing up, I moved around all the time and never had stability so to find that in college at that point was great and I was excited to finish with a bang. And then covid hit. And now I‚Äôm watching kids back at school and realizing I‚Äôll never get that back or really a normal experience in school again. I‚Äôm sad. I now work a full time job doing what I like, I live on my own and can provide for my self and my dog and even travel fully paid for work. But I can‚Äôt help but look back at times at what I missed and get upset. I think it doesn‚Äôt help too that some people seemed to have a relatively normal year at school like my ex, who went to a small school and still did everything semi-regularly. I just catch myself envying that sometimes. 

I want to believe life gets better and can be cooler after college but I get caught up in people saying it was the best 4 years of their life and that they wish they could go back. I feel stuck."
653,I graduated with my bachelors in criminal justice and can not get any job. I have gotten not one interview and I am just feeling defeated. What are some good tips to keep me going. Also leave tips on how to spend my days instead of obsessively checking my emails and laying in bed
654,"Hello everyone,

I'm new to this sub. I finished my Master‚Äôs degree cum laude in May 2021. Since my graduation, I have been in a weird funk. I have been consistently sad, angry, and feeling really down for no special reason.  It feels like I have lost everything (my friends, my social life, etc.).  I have lost interest and enjoyment in most, if not all, things I used  to enjoy doing, and/or I don‚Äôt have any energy for them. I should also  add that everything just feels pointless, and I have a general sense of  hopelessness.

I feel like losing  my last two years of college & student life to COVID (2020 and 2021 were my two last years) made this a lot worse. And now, seeing current  students doing the things I was unable to do and can never do again  (because I‚Äôm no longer a student) makes me sad as well. Post-grad depression is one thing, but post-grad depression during a pandemic is  something else. I knew it was going to come, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to  be THIS bad.

Plus, I feel bad about my appearance. I have gained quite some weight after graduation, and I feel fat and ugly now. I also feel like I aged 10 years in the  last 2. Two years ago, I was 24 and people guessed my age to be 22. Now,  I‚Äôm 26 and everyone I meet for the first time insists I look 31 (or even 32). I feel like an old, ugly, fat, gross piece of shit now. I am mourning my student life and hate my life right now.

&#x200B;

I  find it really hard to feel positive anymore about anything. I have no  life (haven‚Äôt had one for 2 years), my physical appearance makes me want  to puke, I have no job, no money, nothing. I feel like a failure. Until  a few months ago, I didn‚Äôt even have my own place.

On  top of that, it feels like everyone else is succeeding except me. Two  people I went to uni with got awesome jobs, a friend got a great  traineeship immediately after her graduation (which I applied for too  but got rejected), another person I know is moving to Sweden (which I  wanted to do as well but can't). Today, I heard from a former college  friend that she published 18 studies and a policy brief.

Of  course, I don't know the full picture and social media posts don't show  everything. But it still feels like everyone else is thriving and doing  amazing but I'm stuck. My own life is stuck and everyone else's is  speeding up. I don't know how to cope.

I  have tried being kind to myself and acknowledging my feelings and  allowing myself to be sad, and telling myself they‚Äôre valid, but I am  still struggling.

Please feel free to share your own stories and experiences, and how you cope.

Thank you in advance!"
655,"I felt I was fairly active throughout college and made a ton of contacts and buddies through my church. I personally had a really wonderful experience in college.

However, I found myself suddenly alone after graduating and realized I never made too many close friends in college, mostly just buds i hung out with out of convenience. I had focused on quantity over quality.

I do have a handful of good friends now but they are all not from my college.

Anyone else struggle with this also?"
656,"I felt like I was able to keep that lifestyle a little bit. Still had friends, were all single, no families, still carefree, partied and did stuff on the weekends. I'd say a few years after that's when it got real and I realized everyone was gone and moved on in life.

It's not even that I wanted to be in college anymore  and drink but I was not ready for such a drastic change socially. Something was just wrong and I think I was in denial that life would never be like it again. I've gone onto better things than drink but I think I just haven't accepted I can never get any of the life I had in school back ever again."
657,"Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at so far:  

I am graduating with a Health Degree in early May and I have been accepted into a teacher certificate/master program that starts late May.  

However, I recently have been not wanting to do teaching because of the low pay, taking work home, and just it not really being much of an adventure. 

My plan as of now:

1) Try to keep applying to jobs in healthcare administration or entry level business jobs until September. 

2) Join the military as an officer if all else fails

3) Ask to defer my teaching program a year possibly if I can‚Äôt get a job or into the military. 

Any tips?  Is it silly to leave my program that I‚Äôm already in since it‚Äôs likely it will take me a long time to find a job?

Thank You!

Edit: I currently are at home with parents and we are stable financially which helps because I don‚Äôt have any expenses until I‚Äôm out on my own."

659,"Hi everyone! I graduated college a year ago and honestly really miss it. I love the learning process and it was exciting to get to know new topics. I felt like the realm of possibilities and opportunities were endless for me. I got married recently and my wife and I are very happy together. However, I feel like I'm having a quarter life crisis haha. I started working as a financial advisor and haven't enjoyed it so much. My father owns the business and I'll have the opportunity someday to buy it if I build up my own book well enough (no free ride, buuuut I have a HUGE opportunity that most don't). Only thing is, again I don't enjoy it to much. I feel trapped being here my whole life and thinking that I might have to run this business my whole life, feeling like I'll always feel like the business was my Dad's and not mine. I've been thinking that maybe I want to get away and move to Alaska with my wife for a bit and try to have a few adventures before we start a family. But I've also heard that in your20s you need to grind and work like crazy, sacrifice your 20s. I just feel a bit lost. Lots of pressure (from myself) to figure things out. I'm worried that I'll end up doing something I don't like and I'll never be able to leave. Any thoughts? Can anyone relate or have any advice? Thanks!!"
660,"I'm at a bit of an odd crossroads right now as, by chance and without me realizing, I'm likely graduating a year early with my bachelor's degree in mathematics. This doesn't immediately sound like a problem, but it's completely thrown a wrench in my plans. I've spent most of college doing a lot of nothing, just focusing on my classes and a single research lab I've been working with for a year. As a result, the only practical things I know are some basic data management and analysis in a few languages. I've never done an internship, I haven't even done my GRE yet, and now I have no idea what to do. Out of some degree of desperation, I've applied to a progressive master's program, but it's not unlikely that I won't get in and I have no idea what to do past this point. Do I go straight into the job search with no experience? Do I try and find unpaid internships to give me some experience for a while before I join the labor force? Do I just forego all that, do my GRE, and apply to master's programs?"

662,"Before I start I‚Äôd like to mention that when I was 6 I was in a commercial so when I turned 18 I received $6000. This is the only reason I was really able to survive at first. 

Just after finishing highschool in so cal my parents moved to Nor cal for work. I wanted to stay in the Los Angeles area because my goal was to film/edit/direct music videos full time. 

I graduated in June and moved out August 1st, just before I turned 18. I moved in with my boyfriend (I‚Äôm gay) to Los Angeles California. 

At this point I had saved up from streaming on twitch & graduation money to get all the equipment I really needed to film high quality music videos. 

I attended concerts at smaller warehouse venues, networked with local underground rap artists, etc. 

When I started out I was charging $100 a music video and had maybe one a month.  I‚Äôm now able to charge $500 a video and get up to 6 video shoots a month.  I have 2 music videos being released soon with the biggest artist I‚Äôve ever worked with which is just gonna get me more publicity and more clients. 

Just before I ran out of my money from acting I actually got the opportunity to film for a professional esports team and made enough to pay rent. Although it wasn‚Äôt my favorite, it taught me a lot and literally came at the perfect time. 

Now I can just focus on filming and editing music videos full time. I‚Äôve gotten to film some of my favorite artists in concert and it‚Äôs just amazing being on stage with them. 


My parents worried a lot about my decision to move  to LA  and not go to college without any job but they are now very proud of me and extremely supportive. This is only the beginning for me. 

Follow your heart, at the end of the day make sure you pursue something you love. Remember, this is your life, not anyone else‚Äôs.

666,"Hi, I‚Äôm 17-year-old girl from Taiwan. I am learning English, Japanese, German and Romanian.

There is a psychological problem. I have communicated with my family for a long time because I want to be independent, self-reliant and self-reliant. Then I went to various hospitals to receive treatment in psychiatric departments many times to see how I can help me through the difficulties  Not once succeeded.

First of all, I am a road silly, I can only walk, and I can only walk very short distances, because I am afraid of getting lost, so I dare not go too far.  However, my motor nerves are relatively poor. I know that I will have to test for a motorcycle driver's license in two months, but the problem is that I am still learning to ride a bicycle because my balance is not good.  I am also very worried about these things.  Although it is very close to my home (I will study Daye in the future).

Also, your opinion of the students of the Applied Foreign Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãDepartment must be that they are very lively and outgoing. Unfortunately, I am not in reality. I am a big and introverted person.  I like learning languages, but even making friends has become one of the big problems. Even since I was a child, I have been used, excluded, and bullied. I have tried to protect myself. Otherwise, what should I do if I meet a bad guy?  ?  Needless to say, real friends. In the future, it will be difficult even to make a pen pal and exchange language together (Chinese, English, Japanese, German and Romanian). It is even more impossible to study abroad (like Japanese, Hong Kong, America, Africa, Oceania, the UK, Germany, Austria and Romania). It is very likely to be abducted by strangers. So I am trying to protect myself so that I can live safely.

My thoughts have always been negative, because I often fail to do seemingly simple things. I often feel that I am either lonely or lacking courage, so I have always been in a state of schizophrenia."

I‚Äôm currently a senior in college, planning on graduating in December 2021 with a degree in computer information systems. I know it‚Äôs still over a year away but I just can‚Äôt shake the thought of having to move back home after I‚Äôm done. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna exactly miss the college atmosphere as I just had a few friends who I will keep in contact with and 1 guy who became a very close friend and we‚Äôve been roommates the past 2 years and I enjoyed some intramural sports and meeting people (definitely not going to miss exams and classwork) but I feel like I‚Äôm just mostly going to miss having that independence, creating my own routines, making my own choices, privacy, etc. without having to worry about parents and stuff. I did live with them over holiday breaks but it‚Äôs different because I‚Äôm usually back out in a couple of months. I get along with my parents fairly well and I love them and appreciate everything they do for me. I always help out around the house with cleaning, groceries, errands, cooking, etc. but the house can be a stressful environment because they can sometimes still treat me like a kid, restrict me from doing certain things like barely being able hang out past 11:00 with friends for example, even when it‚Äôs not on a consistent basis and just every once in a while. A lot of the time I just feel so restricted and held back when I‚Äôm at home, as I noticed when I‚Äôm at home, I‚Äôm so hesitant to try and do new things because I‚Äôm just so worried about their opinion, because it‚Äôs usually negative and pessimistic but I also noticed when I‚Äôm at school, I‚Äôm way more open and energetic towards doing new things compared to being at home (this is just part of it, there‚Äôs more things). I know I shouldn‚Äôt care what they think but it‚Äôs really tough and I‚Äôm trying to work on it, by just saying fuck it. But I know it‚Äôs inevitable that I would have to live at home for a few years (hopefully 2-3) after graduating to save up money and pay off my student debt, which will be about 31k-33k by the time I graduate (will also help pay some of the parent plus loans down the line as well). I‚Äôm just kind of worried that the sudden transition of being by myself for 5 1/2 years with much needed freedom and independence and then suddenly having to live at home abiding by my parents rules and can‚Äôt do what I used to do, will become such a shock and take a toll on me mentally. I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôll be 24 when I graduate. 

Any thoughts and/or advice?"
668,"Like many people posting on here, COVID-19 is fucking me pretty hard. I had my dream position lined up at a major software company I've been working part-time/full-time for a few years. Double my degree's starting salary. Not entry level. All the benefits in the world. We didn't finish negotiations before the hiring freeze and now I'm pretty much SOL. 

My initial thought (and has since been recommended several times) is to jump into grad school. MBA or MSBA. Requirements are lax even at better schools, since standardized testing is on hold.  I've already applied at the university I'm attending for my undergrad. I already have some significant industry experience. 

Is this the best move? Should I consider an online MBA instead? Any universities I should consider over others?

I'm also seriously considering getting out of the US as soon as this blows over. I'm tired of the bullshit. I'm building my medtech startup and am looking for a position in product management, marketing, or strategy and analytics. Are there any other countries that have good ol' capitalism the way the US does?

I‚Äôve spent this time after graduation suffering from Post Grad depression severely. I didn‚Äôt know where to go after graduation, and had an extremely hard time securing a job.

I want to become an Executive Assistant, as I think that will be the perfect job for me. I do really well in support roles and helping to keep someone on track. If I had it my way, Id be an Executive Assistant or manager to a music artist. As, I love music deeply. It would do me justice to play a role behind the scenes. 

I live in NYC, and have been looking for internships at many record labels to start off, but many of them want you to be currently enrolled. So, I think I will return to school to learn more specifically on the business side of music. 

Being that this is my path I would like to pursue are there any suggestions on the type of masters degree I should pursue.

Any advice will be helpful!!"
670,"I'm a student in college with 4 more semesters to go. I'm at UC Berkeley if that matters (probably not)--when I was 19 I worked with a Berkeley 2016 political science graduate at a tutoring center that paid 15/h. No judgment to him or anyone else in a situation like that, of course. 

I am studying economics/premed or economics/data science, not sure which way to go just yet--I'll let my grade in Organic Chem 2 determine that for me. 

Anyway, something I've been anxious about is possibly not having a job after college. I'd ideally like to have a job offer lined up before I graduate, like a FT job that pays at least 45k-50k with benefits, and one where there's room for growth or promotion. 

Obviously, nothing in life is ever guaranteed, but are there steps I can take in the ~2 years I have left to make sure I have at least 1 offer that fits the above criteria? I know internships help, but besides that? I've worked in marketing, public health, and data management before but I felt some of the internships I've done were poorly managed/super basic. The only thing they've done is just given me talking points during interviews.

I talked to a career coach who basically said to get work experience and to be involved in college so you have something to talk about during interviews, and that if you are unemployed after college, to get a entry level job in something you're interested in (like tutoring if you want to be a teacher, working in a hospital to explore nursing/whatever). 

Alternatively, are there any pitfalls I can make sure I don't fall into for unemployment?"

Then after about 25 people really start going their own direction and are kind of over partying and the bar scene. People find a serious partner,  start having kids, and suddenly want to move out of the city because it cost too much and suburbs suit them better.

I'm also lazy and don't really want to do any hard work. Is it possible to just live on on an easy minimum wage job? I'm not in any debt and don't really want anything big, I don't want to get married or have kids or buy a house, I'm content just renting and being on my own.

675,"So I'm graduating in May finishing up my Computer Science degree, and while college itself was fine I'm noticing as I'm attending more school career events and higher level software classes that, I'm questioning if I really want in software development after I graduate.

I knew going in the field is competitive but every single company that advertises really emphasizes having a drive/passion in software development, teamwork, etc. I don't know if school is burning me out but the amount of energy/drive these places are looking for are way higher than I have. I don't *hate* programming but I'm just not *passionate* about it. And by no means am I bad at it, I just have to reference things a lot since I have bad memory, on top of the fact that I only ever feel like coding for 2 weeks out of a couple months, then I get bored of it and do something else. My problem is that I have a bunch of random interests that I go though throughout the year: camping, video games, language learning, airsoft, programming, etc so I find it really hard to pick a career path.

Right now, I'm kind of just sitting here applying for programming jobs that I really couldn't care about. Since I don't even know *what I want*. I just figured since I liked video games and learning about making games I'd get a computer science degree. But my problem is not knowing *what to do with it*. I minored in Japanese since I always wanted to learn a language but I can't get a job in translation since I've only studied it for 2 years so I'm nowhere near fluency. I've talked with a friend who's in both my Computer Science and Japanese classes and he said he's going to try being an ALT in Japan since he's interested in it. I've thought about doing it, but fear ""wasting time"" doing that would hinder ever going into software development later on in life if I ever want to go to that field. The job doesn't sound bad though, since we both don't care about pay in our careers as long as we have food on the table and some to save.

I'm just kinda lost as to what to do. My only ""plan"" is that if I can't find a job by September I'll just apply as an English ALT in Japan to teach. And just program for fun in my free time to build up skills to possibly apply in the future. But I'm just unsure."
676,"I don't know exactly how I truly feel yet. Maybe grateful is the right word. I had 4 incredible years, met amazing people and shared some deep experiences that I never thought I would get to endure. Sure it came with some pain and suffering to but thats what gave me so much growth since. Some would say I am the same old me as I have always been but my mindset is very different now in comparison to 4 years ago as a freshman. I know the next phase of life will be one of the biggest adjustments in life but I am ready to take on the challenge. My goal when I am an old man is to look back at my life and make sure that college was not my best 4 years. I would feel like a failure if that was the case. Man, time flies. Part of me forgot that the ending was always inevitable. I suppose we all forget at some point or another that part of the journey is the end.

It's been completely ruining my confidence."
678,"Curious to see other people's opinions.

I had a really wonderful time in college but I made the mistake (in hindsight) of not investing deeply in a few key friendships. Like I spent a lot of time hanging out in groups and events rather than really spending time with a few people and getting to know them more deeply. As one might expect, once I graduated, my social life went close to zero as I no longer was in a place of proximity. After all, college is a huge bubble where you're surrounded by colleagues of the same age and same stage of life.

It's been years since graduating and I pretty much talk with 1-2 friends from college. One of them is a lifelong friend and the other is a good friend that I keep in touch with every few months to update on life.

I also moved across the country when I left college so that also affected things. I also don't use social media since I found it to be pretty toxic for me.

681,"**1.Try to look at the world with humor.** Even if you are insulted or you are in a difficult situation, still smile and say to yourself: ‚ÄúAnd this will also pass!‚Äù
**2. Do not stay at home, resenting the whole world!** You can be sure: there is no bad mood on the street, in the company of friends and acquaintances. Proven!
**3.Bring in your life the elements of novelty.** Psychologists recommend changing sustainable habits from time to time - for example, starting a new hobby or changing the style of clothes. Pick up a new wardrobe. Nothing acts as positively on mood as the attention of others.
**4.Take life easier.** In life there is always a place for exploits, but it is not always necessary. Try to focus on what you are doing at the moment. Often this is what contributes to success. Rejoice even small successes and small achievements.
**5.Keep a sense of perspective.** Life is movement, and what seems to be a tragedy today may cause a smile tomorrow. No wonder they say - ""the morning of the evening is wiser.""

682,"I'm just sick of worrying about shit like when I'll find a wife, get married, have kids, buy a house, buy a car, be able to pay for my own vacations,have a career, and basically feeling like a true adult.  This has been created by all these stupid made up expectations. If I really stopped giving a shit I would realize I'm not in a bad place but it's that stupid number that keeps me thinking so mentally.

I just care and worry too much about all these stupid milestones that didn't cross my mind one bit when I was like 18. I wish I could still be in that 18 year old mind who didn't care one bit about marriage or kids. Now all it does is consume me all because I'm 30 now. Maybe there's some truth to it, I know I don't need to rush it, but  maybe I need to think a little more serious. Anyways it's shit like this that's ruining my mental health."
683, Its normal in your 20s to feel lost and directionless but I don't know about your 30s. Im 34 and I still feel as lost as I did in my 20s. I feel its either completely normal or I'm really fucking up at this point.
684,"I asked this in another sub, but thought it would also be relevant here.

So back when I was in college, everyone was eager to make friends. Student orientations were full of activities and carried a sense of adventure. People were always hanging out or studying together in the common areas. It was not uncommon for people to catch up with friends in their dorms after classes.

But one thing I've noticed is that people in the ""real world"" seem less sociable. For example: my current company is located in a complex shared with other companies, but I seldom see people in the common area even during breaks. Everyone always returns to their office after getting lunch. I've attended three new hire orientations, and there was no sense of excitement like in college. Although I did get the ""first day of school"" feeling at those companies, most other people seemed to act like it's just another 9-5 job.

Now I understand some people don't like to mix business with pleasure, and that apparently applies to platonic friendships too. However, my neighbors also generally keep to themselves. I'm aware that some people have their own families and less time for friends, but even the twenty-somethings in my neighborhood don't seem that interested in getting to know each other. A lot of people have moved onto my street in the past several years, and only a handful have come up to our door to introduce themselves. During the almost 28 years my family has lived here, there has been exactly one block party.

Another thing I've noticed is most people that stroll on our street have headphones on, which means they do not want to be disturbed. This was rarely the case when I was in school. Almost everyone on campus was open to conversation.

So do people generally become less interested in socializing after they finish school?"
685,"What if when you graduated from college and moved to a new city there were actual communities set up for recent graduates to go, where you could all live together similar to how college was. You could make new friends with people going through the same transition as you. The apartments or houses were actually priced to what a new grad could actually afford. You could form clubs and groups together based on interests and create a new support group for this new chapter in life. 

Coming from a recent college grad about a year into life after school, it can be hard to find your place after college. You make a life for yourself at school and make genuine friendships. But then the four years are up and everyone has to find a job and your now displaced and your friends are all over the country. You have to find a place to live and maybe even a roommate so you can afford somewhere to live. Then you start to work that 8-5 job you worked so hard to get. You are to tired to make the time that you deserve for building friendships, enjoying hobbies, and joining clubs.

If there was a community where we could all go through this together that would be so much easier. People need people. Just a thought. What do you all think?"
686,"I've recently graduated and depression hit me pretty hard. Everyone is moving on, friends are spread out across the country and the job-hunting stress is getting to me.

I know everyone goes through this but I don't really have a good support group so its hard to cope, would love to hear how other people bounced back from it."
687,"I've been directionless the last 5-6 years since college. Nothing is terribly wrong but I don't feel like I'm living the way I want. Every job I do just ends up me feeling like I'm just letting the years go by. In school it was so vital for me to know how long I'd take a class for, moving onto the next grade, and when I'd graduate. I just knew when everything was going to happen.  Now I'm just stuck and wonder if this is just the way life is ."
688,"Hi,

My life was going smoothly last year, I was supposed to graduate around february 2020, i was doing good in my career,but due to some compilcations due to COVID my graduation was postponed to july, and couldn't work in after i finished my internship in february because of some administrative complication (due to Covid also), so i was forced to do nothing in the meantime, but unfortunately I went back to some bad habits i had in the past (drugs+alcohol) and i devlopped a depression accompanied with isolation that I've been treated from in the past, fastforward even after I got graduated in july I couldn't get rid of those bad habits, until a week ago when I realized how much I am far from my dreams, so I decided to get back in tracks, but now I have this big hill that I have to climb but I have some weird fear of starting even in being sober (still have to get rid from cigarettes and bad diet), but I just feel sort of lost, between getting in touch with people and start socializing, get in touch with stuff I learned in the past, applying for jobs ...

This is my strategy in the moment:

\- Making a CV / restudy stuff I put in CV.

\- Get in touch with people ( this will help me in interviews).

\- Applying for jobs.

Should i do these things in the same time or in sequence ?

I always think of myself as an honest person and being myself is just perfectly sufficent for me, but in my studies i remember a teacher talked about being pragmatic in seeking jobs as it shows the ability of the candidate to accomplish tasks for the employer, and how the real life is not perfect (wich i suppose meaning lying), I never thought about as I was just doing good with everyting going smoothly, should I speak honestly about my depression expression ? or would  it show me as non stable candidate and elimantes me.

Sorry for the long post and for the language mistakes."
689,"I‚Äôd like to teach English abroad but to get a teaching degree (for myself) my tuition would cost $40k doing the first half through my community college on top of being an extra 4 years.

I‚Äôd like to finish as quickly as possible, but I‚Äôd also like to be considered for the job. Any advice?"
690,I feel like it's half and half with my friends at least. I feel like some have moved to a completely different place and some have stayed exactly where they grew up.
691,"I can't describe what it means to not know myself anymore, I just know something is off and haven't felt like myself. Think I tied my identity so much to school that it became a shock once it ended. Whoever I thought I was in school doesn't matter anymore. I just feel a huge disconnect with myself. Think I'm having a quarter-life crisis."
692,"I feel empty because literally all my life is that I go to work and I go home. I moved back home because of the location of my workplace and I have no friends here. 

Alone because I feel that I‚Äôm not really making friends at the workplace. I‚Äôm really trying my best but I feel that I‚Äôm not included in things. 

Idk man I have hobbies but they are really expensive and it doesn‚Äôt guarantee that I‚Äôll make new friends."
693,"I guess I feel embarrassed because college was this huge social bubble and I certainly had a lot of fun and made a ton of friends. And everyone seems to rave about how their ""life friends"" are all from college. 

I'm a little embarrassed that I only talk to 1 close friend (who didn't even go to my college but I met him in my college) and another friend that we keep in touch with every 4-6 months. 

Part of it was a 3-fold problem:

* After graduating, I suddenly found myself really alone and realized that while I had been a social butterfly, I had failed to invest more in a few close friends. As a result, I didn't have a social group to spend time with after graduating and I had to start over.
* Of the few friends I did invest in, I had a massive fallout from poor communication and arguments. It was a 2-way street and we both made mistakes. It hurt like hell but it made me more alone than ever.
* Afterwards, I moved back to my hometown across the country and so I no longer run into people from college regularly.

It's been years since I graduated and I am thankful that I have a few good friends (1 from college, 1 from high school, 1 from work, and 1 from church). That's it. But I am close to them all.

But part of me feels embarrassed that come time to plan my wedding, the invitation list for college friends will be so small. Almost makes me feel like I messed up in that golden social period I had.

Anyone else feel this way? Thoughts?"
694,"I work in events and have for the last 4 years or so. I have also worked in food service on and off since high school. I got laid off from one of my event jobs the other day because the company decided to scrap their Brand Ambassador program and not renew the contracts. Even prior to that i had been looking for jobs in other industries and i know my skill set isn't going to align with everything i apply for, but it seems so much harder to find an actual decent job when you're either unemployed or underemployed?

I am gonna go back to school for CNC and manufacturing, but the program doesn't start until August. In the mean time i still have to  find a more steady job.  There has to be an industry/company out there that will value what i   bring to the table. 5+ year of experience in various roles in the   marketing and hospitality  industry; AV Tech, Brand Ambassador, Event   Operations Team Member.  Majority of these roles were either part time  or  seasonal.

I love when i see comments such as ""everyone is hiring"". Most of the places desperate for people are food service (never want to step foot in a kitchen again)  and warehousing. Lot of jobs that I see on job board that seem to good to true, normally are."
695,"If I do get fired tomorrow, this will be the 3rd job since graduating from college that I got fired from plus two other temp jobs that I didn‚Äôt get a positive review from.  The short version of why is that I‚Äôm a very SLOW learner (book smart but hands on idiot) that makes a ton of stupid mistakes.  

I should mention that I have ADHD which can make someone spacey and act ditzy at times.  

With all that being said, its probably indicative that I need to change careers to something where I‚Äôm not expected to be doing a lot of hands on activities on a day to day basis.  The problem with moving to something where hands on activities isn‚Äôt required, is that it mostly means customer interactions and I generally despise working with people.  The only other thing I could of is being an economist which might not be such a bad thing if for the super conservative corporate culture (which would be intolerable) that comes with it plus having to go back to grad school.  I‚Äôm currently 36.  When does my life start?  Any ideas on what I should do or just suck it up and just find the first decent paying job you can find and be miserable in my job for the next 30 years?"
696,"Long story short, I hated much of my time at college. The process of building my resume and getting my degree has left me a burnt out husk who can't wait for the predictability of working life.

I'll be starting my first degree-relevant job in a few weeks. The pay seems comfortable, and it doesn't seem like I'll have to stay late very often. Last summer, my internship gave me a taste of working life. Despite being paid peanuts, having no homework and no short-notice group project meetings on late nights or weekends was immensely relieving. I could make plans a week or two in advance now? This is amazing!

However, many other posts on Reddit paint a picture of drudgery and isolation, suggesting that I will have no energy to use vanishingly small amounts of free time for anything other than laying in bed and wishing that the universe's false vacuum would collapse. Am I being too optimistic here?"
697,"22/m Just graduated with really nothing to show for it. I was a B student throughout college (3.2 gpa) and have had little experience, clinical and research volunteer a couple summers only. My plan was to apply to grad school since the beginning but after covid I've been so burnt out and disinterested in learning that I don't think I could do it again or at least wait a year (strongly discouraged by family that say I wont go back to school if I do that LOL) 
Every job I look at requires years of experience, or skills that I didn't really attain during college so now stuck looking at retail jobs/gig while living at home.
Its only weighing down further on me because Ive been getting nudged to Med school like most people in my family but I'm nowhere near competitive for that and feel like am going to end up becoming  the Liberal Arts barista stereotype.

698,"I loved my major, and my field now that I‚Äôve graduated. But I feel like I don‚Äôt know enough about the world. For example, I kinda know how the brain works, but also not really? What motivates humans? I‚Äôm trying to find ways to learn from RELIABLE sources, not random online courses. 
My local CC has of course put all their courses online, and almost all of them are asynchronous guided modules. I could finish all the required Psychology courses in just the spring semester. Has anybody enrolled in courses at a junior college after finishing college? Was it worth the money? Did you feel you learned enough?

700,"Hey all, this is pretty much a direct copy of a post I made a few days ago but I was hoping some more kind Redditors here could guide me in the right way.


I‚Äôm a Health major who, due to no longer feeling passionate towards pursuing a career in the health field, has just recently decided to change their direction towards the business field. Unfortunately I had this realization too late, and since I have only two semesters left to get my degree, it wouldn‚Äôt be financially-wise to change my major so late in the game. As a health major, I‚Äôve taken absolutely zero business classes and I‚Äôll actually be taking my first one geared for business majors next semester learning more about excel. It‚Äôs supposedly going to be a comprehensive course, and I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll become an excel wizard! Of course, this is no where near comparable to what a business major would learn... I‚Äôm wondering what those who have graduated and applied for jobs and what those who are currently applying for jobs would say about my situation? Would I stand a good chance in getting my foot in the the business world or are businesses looking specifically for those with business degrees?


I‚Äôve heard that many businesses don‚Äôt necessarily look at your degree for certain positions like HR or some administrative positions, and if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôd feel more relieved but I have no one in person to ask about this. The only thing I could sell about myself is a good work ethic, experience managing my fathers small business, and knowing a few languages including having certification in the Japanese Language Proficiency Test at the N2 level.


I‚Äôll try to see if I can get an internship this summer, although I‚Äôve heard paid ones are hard to come by and I need to work to pay my rent. I‚Äôll also be visiting career fairs at my university too to get an idea of what‚Äôs out there. But I was hoping I could get more information before I talked to businesses and could get a clearer picture of what options there are for someone in my situation."
701,"Hey everyone,

I can't talk to anyone about this irl, so I'm posting it here. I got my master's degree in May 2021 and I have been really sad since. Around this time of the year, you see all the people graduating high school and starting college, so it brings all the feelings back up.

2020 and 2021 were my two last years, and C19 basically stole my last 2 years of student life. My college experience just randomly ended on a random Friday in March 2020. After that, I had to move back in with my parents for 21 months, and do the rest of my college life via zoom from my childhood bedroom. I was just ""ripped out"" of my student life with no warning and had no idea I'd never come back. Now, when I see people starting college, I envy them. and I wish I could have another go, or at least have my last 2 years back that covid stole from me. I am angry and sad about this. I did not have a social life at all for 20 months until I moved out of my parents' house again.

Besides the pandemic taking away my last 2 years, post-grad depression is kicking my butt in general. I am so sad about the end of college and I am grieving for my previous life. I am just starting to give up hope that I'll ever actually have fun again. I miss college. I miss my friends (who are now scattered across the world and I have lost touch with most of them). I miss my student association. I miss the parties I attended, and the themed events hosted by my student association. I miss representing my student association during freshers week. I even miss cycling to class at 11am hungover as hell, and stressing over finals in the library all day. I'd kill to sit in the library stressing over finals or in a boring seminar room right now & I would give anything to go back.

I just want my student life back. I want a do-over. Or I want to at least have my last 2 years back that covid stole from me. It actually feels like someone died. It also feels like I died too, and I have been in purgatory since graduation.  I see other students existing and having the life that I am missing (especially since covid) and I have stopped existing. I am not there anymore. Life is continuing, but without me. I am no longer a member of life. I am dead.

Now I'm dealing with unemployment, being broke, and possible homelessness soon. Applying for jobs isn't yielding any success and I feel hopeless. This is shit. I am mourning the loss of my student life as if someone died.  I have lost EVERYTHING thanks to covid and graduation. I don't want this.

&#x200B;

sorry for the long post - I just needed to vent a little. Feel free to share your own experiences or feelings and how you cope. I'd love to hear it."
702,"Hey there -

I'be been in HR for almost 20 years - working with companies like Amex, WebMD, Spotify, etc.

Over the last 3-5 years I've been working with a few other professionals who started to see everything in the college system is a huge friggin lie.

We are told from being kids ""get into a good school, get into a good school"" and the idea is that we pay this HUGE ass amount of money in exchange for skills, information, knowledge and networking to allow us to find jobs. But unless you are in Medical, Legal or Academic there is little to no pipeline between your school and a job and about 38% of students are basically just dropped off with a degree and a ""good luck!' and a bill for $100,000. Colleges are knowingly offering fields of study that have no market value and are not investing shit in career resources. Literally with 3-6 months you could begin learning skills that have real market value but nobody knows about them until you hit ""the real world"" - (Product Marketing? Sales Ops? HR? Business Development? Data Analytics? Branding and Identity? Acquisition? Business Insights?) Yeah all those roles pay super well and companies need people who can do them.

Corporate isn't for everyone of course - but me and a few friends have started a website designed to tell college students and recent graduates ""the truth"" and give a ton of resources on how to do things now and how things work. Some of the stuff is paid but a lot is free - so pls don't think of it as trying to spam. We keep most of the content completely free.

We upload new content, articles, ""how to guides"", explanations, breakdowns, etc once a week or so and we are very eager to post what college students and graduates want to hear, so please feel free to shoot over some emails, etc.

Our sincere hope is that we start to change this, that colleges really start to actively train students for the real world and that students and graduates can be given an active choice in their future and not just fall into something by chance.

704,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm about to graduate with an exercise science degree. When I was younger all I wanted to do was be a physical therapist. But after constantly struggling in (and retaking) prerequisite classes like chemistry, and biology - I don‚Äôt think anything in the science realm is cut out for me.

I nearly failed biology twice because I just can‚Äôt comprehend anything in the class due to lack of interest. Nearly everything in physical therapy school is related to biology.

I don‚Äôt know how I got by all years of college. I feel like I‚Äôve cheated myself and I don‚Äôt deserve to get a degree. I feel like I‚Äôve gotten by only because of nice professors. I feel like I only learned how to take tests but now how to learn. I don‚Äôt remember anything in any of my exercise science related classes nor do I want to work in the field anymore.

I dislike science, political science, history, law, criminal justice, math, and statistics. There goes plenty of jobs out the window.

But I do enjoy art (graphic design, game design, etc), tech, and media (adobe and the like). I feel like the window is very small here. I don‚Äôt feel smart enough to do any of these though. I never felt smart enough for anything. Maybe that‚Äôs my problem.

A lot of pressure is coming from letting my parents down because I won‚Äôt know what to do. They‚Äôre both extremely wealthy successful individuals who have had been working their jobs and had their minds set straight after they graduated college - and expect me to out do them. I can‚Äôt compare. I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôll have a salary of $200k like they do.

I‚Äôm definitely having burnout right now so I don‚Äôt think going to pursue a masters or going back to get another bachelors after this would be smart. Does any one have any advice?

Tldr: does anyone work in a field that was not related to their degree at all?"
705,"I posted here after about a week into this job and I am still not sure if it‚Äôs too early to know if I should quit. If this weren‚Äôt my first job, I would def quit cuz I‚Äôd have something to fall back on resume wise‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt have a lot going for me in that aspect. 

I am still in the training process (I must pass a large exam in anatomy and medical devices in order to move on) this test is in 2 weeks. And then I have 2 more weeks of intensive training in Nov. I was not aware in the interview that it was going to be this intense. Also I am not in the medical field; I was an english major, hoping for something creative. 

Another mistake I made was taking this job because my parents and grandparents told me I had to. (Like actually my grandparents were harassing me). It has been a year since I graduated and everyone in the family knows my business. I was working at a bakery and I agree that I needed to move on but I did not want to take this job solely bc of the medical aspect‚Ä¶I hate it.

I was going to try to put in 6 months to make money but with these trainings scheduled I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd end up screwing them over too if I get trained fully and then leave a month later?

It has been impossible to get in touch with my boss because she‚Äôs the VP of the department and I‚Äôve had little guidance (which is nice sometimes not having anyone breathe down my neck). 

I have been waking up at night thinking my life was just a nightmare but then I realize it‚Äôs actually my life and then I cry lol I have become irritated at little things like loud noises or when my roommate leaves a dish in the sink which I haven‚Äôt done before. I am struggling to eat in general and only lay in bed after work and it seems like every day is meshed into one. 

I‚Äôve had some good days at the office‚Äîfor 3 days, they gave me some things to review and I felt useful. My co workers are nice and my salary is out of this world, which I had never had this kind of financial security before (as an english major everyone always said there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm gonna make a good living). So far everything else has been like pulling teeth all day. 

I‚Äôm worried that if I quit I will: disappointment my family again, be financially unstable, and continue with this resume gap, break the salary foundation I just started

706,"I received a 3.0 GPA every year other than junior year where I entirely tanked every class (COVID, severe depression, horrible mental health state, family issues, etc) due to not submitting enough work to receive a decent grade. I did just enough to pass, but I'm probably around a 65 average (bare minimum). I can confidently get a 4.0 GPA senior year (school has never been hard for me, I just lack the motivation to try in subjects that are entirely irrelevant in the real world), but I heard a lot of colleges won't even look at your senior year performance unless you're being considered as is. I wanna go to a community college in Manhattan. I'm unsure of any academic requirements, but I think most people who get accepted have around a 3.0 GPA & 1200 SAT score. I have no issue putting in the effort to get a 4.0 (or close) senior year / 1200 SAT, just so I can include it in my application to show I'm way more capable than my junior year performance may reflect. Do you think there's a realistic chance of me getting accepted, despite my junior year temporary downfall? I wish I could meet the admission team / write an email / write a good essay or something similar to show I'm actually really smart, and my school grades don't reflect my intelligence in the slightest.

Edit: Maybe going to a community college for a year prior to applying with outstanding grades would help me out? Not sure if that'd get looked at, would assume so though"

 The longer my social life sucks the more increased anger I have wishing I could have it like school again. I'm just pissed off at how hard and little time I have to hang out with people. Like you really have to try hard where in school it just came natural. 

Even if I do meet people it's always on the go and there isn't enough time to get to know them. I just know they'll be gone and I won't ever see them again so whats the point? Having friends shouldn't be this rare thing that only certain people can find."
709,"I graduated in May of 2021 with a B.S and cannot seem to find a job doing anything even with two internships under my belt. This is the longest I've been faced with unemployment and it's completely ironic given that my shortest spells were without my degree. I keep trying to remind myself that we are in a pandemic and I'll find work eventually. But with my recent blow, I just can't seem to find my groove anymore. I am tired of filling out job applications, creating various accounts on sites just to apply. It's gotten to the point I've started getting email subscriptions from things I've never put in for. 

Thus far, I've been:

* Rejected (even with an employee referral)
* ghosted by a  recruiter even after setting up a zoom meeting for the interview (they never showed up to allow me in.)
* received an automation error (told to proceed with scheduling a date for the interview to then being told it was an accident and they will get back to me at a later date, never did).
* Ghosted after submitting applications. 

My most recent interview which I spent days prepping for as I really wanted the position I didn't get because they wanted someone with more 'experience'. While I am not immune to that phrase, I think they could've mentioned it sooner before making me go thru 4 rounds of interviews. I was even told at the end I fit the team's profile (knew not to get my hopes up because they probably said that to another candidate before). 

This whole process is a bit of an oxymoron because you're told from  young ""Go to college and you'll go far in life.""  But it's like no matter the field they want you to have a decade worth of experience just for an entry-level position.  In the meantime, I've been doing projects to help bolster my resume but I fell off severely 2 months ago due to this ongoing mental battlefield. I am willing to relocate for the proper job because there are not many job opportunities where I am from. I even made a plan to go back to the retail environment jobs save and plan to move from there. But I cannot get one of those jobs because of the degree. ATP I defeated, Idk what to do. 

It's gotten to the point of even referrals cannot help me land a position.  I just want a job to help me start building towards the life I want (moving away, having new experiences, making new friends, fostering more hobbies, etc. )"
710,"I'm a final year uni student who's pretty much almost done with university. I only have 2 months left of internship that is part of university requirements and then I'll be graduating. The thing is, I started this internship literally right after finishing my previous semester (AKA right after finals) and I am 6 months in now. I am absolutely absolutely exhausted. I love this company, they let me experience things and all that, I do a lot of important jobs as well so not the typical make coffee print stuff jobs. But again, because I literally have no break right after last semester, I'm starting to feel very very tired. At this point, I hate waking up in the morning and having to work.

My friends are all excited to get a job right after graduating. Everyone that I talked to told me they'll accept any full time jobs right away etc. The thing is for me... I'm already so exhausted and I really want to get a month or two months break before I start looking for my full time job. But everyone seems to think that this is a bad idea because obviously there is such a high amount of competition and everyone is rushing and trying hard to get a job whereas I'm just out there chilling. üò©

712,"SO I was a Jan 2020 grad, initially got a job and then covid came and I got cut before I started. I got extremely comfortable being ‚Äúfree‚Äù but eventually developed anxiety to where I had trouble leaving the house.

I worked a bunch of gigs until a month ago I finally landed a job that was basically handed to me my my grandmas friend. This is a job that I had no interest in, especially because at the time I was finally trying to lose the gap with my long distance boyfriend. But I knew that if I didn‚Äôt take a job my entire family would be disappointed and the gap on my resume would get bigger and bigger. 

I just finished my first week and it was awful. I know this is standard corporate America but I was struggling with sitting at a desk all day (I‚Äôm a super busy body) and the management is so scattered that every time I try to find someone to ask to get work for, I get passed along until I end up not finding anyone to assist me. It involves medical devices so I‚Äôm going to have to go thru 2 intense training courses and exams in a few months. I come from a creative background and it‚Äôs killing me. I worked at a bakery before this and really enjoyed always moving so I‚Äôm just really struggling and starting to feel anxious and depressed again. 

I also just want to finally move to where my long distance boyfriend is. 

However now that I have the job, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm gonna fuck the company who is investing money in me as well as fucking over my resume and my family‚Ä¶and savings‚Ä¶

TL;dr I took a job my family wanted and I hate it but I feel stuck now"

I always dreamed of a life changing miracle but it didn‚Äôt arrive, it won‚Äôt arrive. 
During nights I just cannot sleep and wait for mornings to go to office. Nothing good can come out of this ordinary life. I feel constant fear or anger. I only feel happy when I‚Äôm drunk.

I wear my hair messy and kinda long because it suites my face shape quite well and I like the messy hair look.

I tend to think I dress fairly trendy but I keep things professional in the office and when Im out with coworkers. All this added on to a natural baby face have led to many people assuming Im an intern, or that my id is fake, or that I‚Äôm one of my friends‚Äô younger brother. 

Well, someone in my friend group recently pointed out that I look like a freshman in college on my tinder, implying that I look like I‚Äôm hiding my age to hunt for young guys/girls. Up until now, Ive always just kinda brushed off the ‚Äúlooking young‚Äù comments as a compliment or just an observation, but now I feel like a complete fucking creep. Being in the weird ‚Äúmid twenties transitional period‚Äù of my life, should I make a focused effort to look older so that I don‚Äôt pass off as someone *trying* to look younger than I am (unintentionally)?

I don't if it's because the school is complete crap (Wich it is) but I just can't stand now the thought of doing this as  a job or even having to go into that school again. Going to filmschool took away all my drive and inspiration. I didn't quit before cause covid made it really easy for me to just log into class and not really pay much attention to it. Even tho I can now make a much better movie or short film if I wanted to than before. I would give all of that knowledge away to get that hunger for movies again. I don't even keep track of new movie releases, I even lost my passion as a cinephile.   


I now play the guitar fairly well, and music has become my obsession. I want to quit school so bad and keep working as a freelance editor like I have been doing for the past year (And making good money off of it too)  and keep practicing and maybe get into a more advanced course. But I don't want to find myself in a position where a college degree is required, nor I want to lose this drive I now have for music and the guitar.

I'm  not sure how to describe this, but iv'e been having this feeling, after  graduating college I guess, of ""what now"". Yes, i have goals. Travel.  Job opportunities. Moving (I moved to a huge city 2 ish months ago) and  all that. But it feels like i'm still... Not really internalizing the  freedom I have. I can do, within reason, ""anything"". Travel, moving  places, whatever. Yes those things take time, money, effort, energy, but  I ""can"" do them. It's just, hard to internalize.

Or,  maybe i'm having lofty ideas of going on some grand adventure which  will change me forever, and it's a bit idealistic of me, who knows. That  said, I feel like i'm struggling to break this... Wall in my mind, of  internalizing things. Does anyone else feel the same, or has dealt with  it?"

I really only think it's useful to get you ahead because certain jobs require a degree and it looks good on your resume. Outside of that it doesn't make me smarter or more capable imo.

After serving in the army, I got a decent paying job and finished my bachelors degree which I had started prior to enlisting (about 10 years in the making). I graduated last year and jumped right into a grad program. My life got a little too chaotic with my husband in school and keeping up with our 6 year old so I decided to put the brakes on grad school. Covid has drastically changed our lives, my husband got laid off and we will be moving to another state before the end of the year. My job is toxic, and I‚Äôve mentally checked out... but it pays the bills. I‚Äôm falling into a mild depression and I‚Äôve realized this is the first time in my adult life that I‚Äôm not grinding. My major goals of getting my degree is done. I‚Äôm pretty well stuck in this job for at least another year (they support our move and allow me to WFH) while my husband gets his new career going. I guess what I‚Äôm wondering is what now? I feel so unmotivated to do anything. I can‚Äôt even come up with any goals I‚Äôd like to begin working on.

I‚Äôve only been in this position for 4 months now, as I had a different position for 2 months and got promoted. Now I feel like shit and I want to leave after 6 months of being in government.

Context. I have a bachelors in Journalism. I started studying it cause I like to write fiction but Journalism seemed like the route to go to actually make money in my country. Halfway through my studies I realised this wasn't it for me but I carried on anyway cause I reached so far already.

I got this job through a government placement program and I agreed to it simply because using my degree would make me the most money. It's not front facing and I'm out of the public eye. 

 I'd like to move out one day, live in another country and I feel like the experience would eventually (hopefully) land me somewhere comfortable.

I ended up in a small environmental non profit organisation writing articles and doing social media. I thought I'd just be a robot and do what I was told as with all the other jobs I've had however, I'm expected to think here? During my performance review, my boss pointed out my goal of getting more followers on social media isn't personal enough to me and what do I want to accomplish. He used other coworkers as examples. One of them wants to have more project management opportunities, another wants to lead some biodiversity project and I... do not care. 

I don't want to be in charge of anything. I have no connections or ideas of what to even begin looking into that might be interesting. I'm not even well versed on any environmental anything. All I am is a decent writer, according to them (don't judge this post lol). My only goals are personal ones and I don't believe I can find much fulfillment in my field based on the fact that I don't care for most of it.

He has been instructed to conference text me and our Area Manager as she somewhat oversees our store (as we lack an official manager).

The problem comes when ever he is in the store alone. He goes over my head and texts our AM (Area Manager) all the time and tries to ""fix things"" within the store that I haven't gotten a chance to call or text our AM about yet. He doesn't respect me as acting manager, and constantly complains about how he has more experience and disserves more pay.

Hes a ""my daddy is a lawyer"" type of rich white kid that never grew up and is constantly trying to become manager faster than me. He undermines my opinions, and goes over my head to our AM all the time. I don't think my AM sees it as a bad thing, but instead possibly sees it as my ""competition"" in trying to go forward.

I'm an introvert. I need to charge my social battery and I'm not the type to put myself out there, but regardless I'm very sociable if someone were to initiate first.


People say the best way to make friends after college is either find people with similar interests as you and attend such clubs/events, or go to bars or whatever. The latter I feel wouldn't work due to my introvertedness, and the former wouldn't work because I don't have many hobbies.


Now it's not like I'm a boring person. My hobbies include: digital art, anime, video games, and learning mandarin. And when I'm with friends I like to get food, shop around, karaoke, and pool. But with all my hobbies, I'm not super interested in any to the point of joining clubs. For example, I'm a casual anime watcher and wouldn't buy merch or go to conventions. I'm not a hardcore gamer, nor do I really associate with the art community.


In fact, most of my friends don't have the same hobbies as I do. I befriend people out of vibes and out of compatibility, people I can banter around with. I feel like that works for school because I can just find people to get along with in my classes easily. Or last year for example I met friends just from tipsy people in my dorms looking for people to chat or do shots with. I don't share anything in common with these people but we can have a nice conversation and do stuff together. 


And most people like getting food, shopping, karaoke, and pool (at least in my city). But those are more activities for friends or acquaintances. My issue is first finding people to become acquainted with.


Not quite sure of any ideas besides maybe like BumbleBFF. Wish there were some other low-effort low-stakes environments where people are there to meet other friends. It was easy in college because a lot of people were always down to meet new people. I just really want to join another close, no drama friend group. I'm graduating early so all my friends are still at school or are going to move to another city."

I‚Äôve also offered a ton of times for my friends to come visit me bc I moved to a very popular young person weekend trip destination and my friends expressed interest but nothing has come from it. 

Recently a few of my college friends went on a trip to visit another and I didn‚Äôt even know abt the plans until they posted pictures online. And I commented abt how cute the pictures were. And I know it‚Äôs small, but they never comment on my stuff anymore when they always used to.

742,"I graduate in May and will be living at home post-grad. But with this Omicron variant, I am getting increasingly anxious that things will be moved online and my major issue is that I become very stagnant while living at home and less likely to try new things. When I'm away at college, I feel more inclined to try new things and to challenge myself and I think a lot of this has to do with how walkable my campus is and being in an unfamiliar environment. I feel like one of the major reasons why I'm so stagnant at home is because I'm so deep in my comfort zone at home, whereas being away at college pushes me to leave my comfort zone. I also have a lot of driving anxiety, which makes it more difficult to do what I want to do and I don't want to rely on Uber's because that adds up and as a young woman, at times, I feel uncomfortable getting into one. I think also I feel a lot of judgment from my family members, which leads me to inaction.

&amp;#x200B;

So any tips on not feeling stagnant while still living at home. I want to begin preparing now.

However, I obviously don‚Äôt have a transcript to show for those classes, and I don‚Äôt want that to come back to bite me if they ask for one. 

The reason I want to list these classes at all is that I have a huge gap in my resume and I want to show somehow that I was doing something with my time. I fear the gap could hold me back otherwise."

746,"Hi everyone I'm 22 and majored in business and honestly never had any interest in it. I got a job after graduation and was so miserable I quit in under a year and jumped into a new one. My new job has a lot of the same issues as my last job (lack of work/life balance, manager being unresponsive, no training, etc). I'm thinking of quitting because my mental health is shit but I've only been at this new job for around 5 months. There were a lot of red flags in the interview process for the new job I ignored because I was so desperate to leave. But this environment seems common in my industry.

I have around 40k in savings, live at home, and don't really have much expenses. I just have no idea what to do with my life but my job is causing me to have very dark thoughts. I'm thinking of taking a gap 6 months just to figure myself out and give myself a break (i never had a break after graduating).

I'm just terrified I'll never find a job I can tolerate or stay at long term. I'm in therapy right now and it is helping but honestly it's hard to make improvements in the job I'm in. I go to sleep not wanting to wake up and cry every single day because I feel so confused and lost in this role and in life in general.

I know most people say to find a job before you leave but I don't know what job I would want and I think I need a mental break. I don't have the capacity to start a new role.

Any advice would be appreciated. If anyone has been in a similar situation do you regret leaving without a plan?"
747,"Im graduating college next month, this is my last week of finals left. I want to express my honest emotions, im feeling a bit sad and even anxious. I was working part time to support myself but this time, i would be looking for full time jobs and im a bit nervous and anxious. Im feeling a bit sad even though im already graduating late at26 years old due to personal reasons, i dont know how to explain but college was like a little safe space for me. I feel like im going to be incredibly depressed and lost after graduation, i dont know why. I just needed to vent my sad thoughts out. I still feel like this naive little girl who isnt ready for the real world like i did back in my freshmen year"
748,"Just want some feedback. I feel like I've totally outgrown my hometown and there's nothing left for me to accomplish there. Kind of just the same old stuff.  Not the worst situation but I feel like I need to move to a big city or somewhere that's completely foreign to me. Being in my hometown is keeping me feeling stuck, hopeless, bored, and unenthusiastic about life."
749,"I remember during my kinder or prep graduation, one part of the program was each of us were gonna go up on stage and say ""When I grow up I want to be a -----"" and act out whatever profession we chose. When it was my time my mind went blank and couldn't choose. I was trying to recall what my classmates said so I could just copy them. I really didn't know what I wanted at that time. I ended up saying ""I want to be nice"" (don't know why and what that means). My memory of frantically thinking of what to say was so vivid and clear.

I'm 21 now and a sophomore in college but I'm the exact same kid on that stage. All my life I had this passive belief that I'd somehow die of an accident or illness before college. Or maybe by then I'd have gathered the courage to do it myself. I just couldn't see myself past high school for some reason.

I've been searching but I've found no purpose, passion, drive or talent. I hate my course. I study agriculture which is so stupid and ironic because I'm a city girl and hate gardening. I've contemplated shifting but I don't know where else to go. I don't have a preference I just know I don't want anything.

I'm also kind of scared of disappointing my family. I'm supposed to be the ""smart, woman in STEM"" who was gonna be the first doctor in our extended family. Every one in my nuclear family is a college graduate from the same university I'm attending right now (though it's just me who's pressuring myself to attend and graduate here).

I just wish that I had dreams or something. Something to give me joy and give me reason to do whatever. I've tried just pushing on for the sake of other people but it doesn't work. I thought that maybe eventually I'll learn to love what I'm doing but I just loathe myself and what I'm doing. I have a good family life, I have friends but I don't have my OWN reasons to go on.

Not looking for advice particularly, I'm just posting here because I literally don't know anyone who feels the same way. I'm surrounded by people who are so sure of where they want to be and are so happy to be where they are and good for them you know but sometimes I just want to hear about it anymore."
750,"Hey folks!

**TL;DR:** I have ""COVID-19-Studies"" PTSD and want to ease myself into work life. What skills can I acquire during two gap months? Examples see below.

**Long version:** I wanted to hear about your opinion concerning the question above. I'm kinda technically still studying as I wait for my bachelor thesis to be graded, but regardless I wanted to avoid to let myself ""fall"" into a post college laziness for too long. Keep the ball rolling if you will. My plan is to ease my way back into a normal life and new work life. I've spent half of my study time in a COVID-19 ""environment"" which caused me to detach a little bit from mundane things like ""going to place X to work there"", ""work with a group on a project"", ""go outside and get something done (papers ect.)"". That is the reason why I want to refrain from just yeeting myself at the next best job and instead making baby steps towards a new chapter in my life. That being said: I want to take one month off fully and the second month after that I want to get ball rolling by slowly peeking into job applications and what not.

That being said, so far **I came up with following things** that could help me be better prepared for work life. I want to point out that many things mentioned aren't entirely ""new things"". Just things that I've neglected due to a very uneven and unregular university schedule:

* Setting up a ""home-cook-clean"" routine: Cook every second day. Learn how to cook cheaply
* Learn a new (rare) language (Currently learning Norwegian)
* Participate in an online internship
* Learn hard skills (skillshare, Microsoft Excel/Word/Powerpoint...)

**Edit:**

/u/SwissArmy_Accountant made a good point of me including my ""profession""! I studied Landscape architecture and Landscape Design (The latter includes biological engineering too). I'm not extremly picky when it comes to my (first) job. I do enjoy research a lot and any kind of work that bears ""results"". I thought about reaching out to my university and ask about becoming a research assistant or similar. Besides my interest in research, I always had a soft heart for the problems/struggles of children when it comes to growing up in big cities that don't provide (yet) the same outdoor play quality as the country side."
751,"I just graduated almost two weeks ago, and I am hopeful I'll be able to land a job by the end of May or June. I have second round interviews with a company that really likes me (according to the recruiter), two job applications where I was able to get solid internal employees references for, and just been consistent in applying and following up with recruiters and/or hiring managers. I really made sure while I was in school to complete some internships to get relevant experience. 

At first, I was determined to move out by Fall to prove my independence, but my dad suggested living at home for the first year to save up money. I have about $24k in student loans, haven't bought a car yet (I share with my mom while at home, didn't need one at college), and have about almost $10k in savings. Being given the option to live at home, I know how fortunate I am. 

So, I feel like my dad is right and my parents helped me a lot to pay for college, so I feel like I owe it to them to do the smart thing, and not the exciting thing (living on my own). 

Assuming, I do land a job very soon, what else should I being doing in the next 12 months to get ahead and being a good, responsible daughter. I do already help with chores, assisting with dinner, just helping where I can."
752,"I'm not sure what's going on, whether I have depression or anxiety, or just don't like working. But I graduated a couple years ago and I've never really been able to find solid footing or ground. Everyone I graduated with seems to enjoy their job and are solidified in their careers, as a manager, or above. And here, I'm still trying to fight for entry-level roles and with fresh faces that just graduated from college. Meanwhile, I'm having to go to graduate school to work towards my masters, and I just can't seem to enjoy any job I have. 

Every employer I have worked for, they're great people, they are nice but they also seem to give me tasks I do not enjoy. For clarity, I have a marketing and advertising degree, and will be pursuing a branding and integrated communications degree. And I currently work as a media planner.

I don't like the budgets, the cost-outs, the goals, the reach, the frequency, the time I spend in excel. If I am just stupid and this is what advertising and marketing is, then call me stupid. But I think I may have messed up my life, not just my career, but my life. I am getting close to 30-years old, and haven't made more then $50,000 in my life. The pandemic set me back a lot, and now I'm worried.

What is out there for me? Will anyone hire me? Will I ever find a job I love?"
753,"I graduated high school in 2018, then started at a community college. The plan was do my 2 years and transfer in 2020 to a public university and leave home. 

So then Covid happened, and I ended up doing online school 2020-2021. So my whole junior year was just me doing online school and working. 

I went away this school year, but honestly it feels like a pity year. I made a couple friends but otherwise I really didn‚Äôt do much. Feels like a waste. 

I‚Äôm wondering how my life is gonna look once I get a job. Maybe move out, then what. Sit around my future apartment every night? Like what‚Äôs the goal?

755,"Context:

I have kept my Instagram private through my job search since graduating in May. I have a 2nd round interview coming up soon, and I was wondering if I should open the Instagram to the public as my other socials are mostly dead. 

Most of my Instagram is actually really good, nice content, lots of people engaging so I look like a likeable guy based on my Instagram... but here is the problem, the post of me in my cap and gown is my most recent post, consisting of 2 pictures. The first pic is me looking great, but the second is of me throwing up both middle fingers... and I can‚Äôt remove the second picture without deleting the full post. (Don‚Äôt judge me, I realized what I did about 20 mins after posting and have been kicking myself, but it was fully a byproduct of my attitude toward having my graduation ceremony taken away) I feel like archiving the pic isn‚Äôt the best because a picture in my cap and gown should be exciting for an employer. 

So should I leave it private, archive the photo, or own up and change the caption to gently explain the middle fingers..?"
756,"I (16M) am going to graduate HS in 2 years (10th currently), but I'm not sure what I should do after school. I have a general idea of what I want to do, but I don't know which is better long term. I want my future job to involve computers (more specifically the architecture of hardware) I guess the easiest way to put it: I want to set up the entire network/hardware/software for companies and workplaces with a small team or group, kinda like an IT. I want to also be an asset to fix these as well. I've kinda grown up around technology, and always wanted a job like this.

What I'm really struggling to decide is what I should do after I graduate that is going to get me the easiest transition into a job like this. Obviously I can't predict the future, but I know this is a job I want to do. Should I go to a tech college and get a degree in Computer Science for a safer route, or should I go to a trade school, and get a certificate? So far, these are seeming like my only options, as I don't know of any other way to get into a profession like this. Is there a better alternative way of learning the skills I need, or should I keep myself open to anything?"

I feel like I'm gonna struggle big time this upcoming year."
761,"So I turned 25 a few months ago, and I wasn't wild about being 24 so you as you can imagine I'm dangerously close to breaking my good vibes only rule.

I'm a self employed musician, and have been making a living out of it since I was 17, but oh my how the tables have tabled. When I was 18, my school friends had all just gone off to uni and saddled themselves with all this student loan debt, whilst I was living the dream and being one of the only people I knew with any money, bliss! I went into music because a) I loved music, obviously, and b) as an angsty teenager the thought of the rest of my life bearing any resemblance to school (sit down at this desk and do this task with only abstract relevance to anything and with no clear benefit to yourself or indeed to anyone) made me want to curl up into a ball and stop existing.

Fast forward the better part of a decade and oh shit, surprised pikachu face, I'm not a famous multi-millionaire. I don't think I would mind so much, and would absolutely just keep right on going, if it weren't for the fact that I went and fell in love 5 years ago didn't I, ugh, cringe amirite?

So the conundrum is, I'm moving into a place with my girlfriend, and whilst I have nerves of steel and could totally deal with the whole not-knowing-how-much-money-i'm-getting-this-month self-employed thing in conjunction with having to pay rent, particularly because I've done it before solo, I feel very bad about dragging my girlfriend into that kind of high-stress lifestyle. Obviously she's already very involved with my lifestyle, but we've never had shared financial commitments before and that's veeeery different. Problem is I still think conventional employment sounds like an absolute hellscape in almost every field, and the fields where it doesn't seem so bad tend on the side of being almost as unrealistic as the job I'm already in so haha Realname you lose, guess teenage you wasn't so smart after all, just bought yourself some time didn't you. Time to hop on the heckin' treadmill I suppose.

Gooooood god this is awful."
762,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place for this, but recently I‚Äôve been overwhelmed with anxiety about graduating college next year. I have no idea what I‚Äôm going to do after college, and I have no idea how I am going to start my life. I am studying Marketing with a concentration in Digital Marketing Strategy. Especially with COVID, I feel like I was f*cked out of over a whole year of a real college experience. And now college is almost over and I‚Äôm scared.

I am considering going straight to graduate school for an MBA right out of college, and my parents said they will pay for half of it and I could try to get a assistantship with the school to also save money. While I want to do this and my Parents are really pushing this route, my advisors and a lot go online articles say you shouldn‚Äôt get an MBA right out of college. It looks like many schools recommend, or require?, at least 2-3 years of work experience before you go to graduate school. But I would rather go straight to graduate school and get it over with while I am still in a student mindset and while the economy still recovers form COVID. I could really use some practical advice on what is the best option.

A lot of my future depends on this decision. But I am still not even sure where I want to live after I graduate. I want to move out of my college town, but I won‚Äôt have any idea where that is until I apply and get a job for after graduation somewhere or I go to a Graduate school somewhere. I could move home for a while too, but I would rather not stay too long. And I have a GF who I love more than anything, and I‚Äôm worried about our future. How are we suppose to plan a life together like this? She doesn‚Äôt want to go to graduate school, and I‚Äôm scared that we will not be able to be together after college if we get jobs in different places or if I have to go somewhere for graduate school. 

I‚Äôm sorry I unloaded a lot in my rant. I‚Äôm not looking for answers to all these questions, but I could use any advice on how I can stop being so anxious and sleep at night again."

A good day for me is one where I can chill at the house & watch brainless TV, surf the web, & sleep. Having to get dressed & leave the house is an EXTREME task that makes my body weak. The only thing I make time for outside of the house is the gym when I can. Im just confused on why I feel this way. I mean, the only thing I can attribute it to is my body recovering after being up irregular hours like 7am-2am, getting 4-5 hours of sleep, & repeat. Has anyone else experienced this?

765,"Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I figured I'd give it a go.

So I'm 25 now and am finally in a place where in a year or two, I'll be able to afford going to school. That means I'll be entering college at 26-27, and, if I finish the double-major that I want and MFA, I'll be done in like 8 years. Which means that I'll be graduating at like... 34/35.

TBH, it's super exciting, and this isn't a deterrent to me going through with it (the field I'm going into is a dream I've been wanting to pursue since I was a child) but it's a little daunting to me, for some reason, going to school with young adults that can't even drink yet. I don't have kids and plan on saving up enough to go without having to work more than some freelance work here and there, and really wanted to get that legit college experience, but I'm a little saddened by the fact that I'm not sure if I could really make a lot of friends that I can relate to when I'll be almost 10 years older than everyone else that's starting. Heck, there's a not-small chance that I end up having my first kid before or during the completion of my MFA, and I'm nervous about being able to handle breastfeeding, waking up at night, etc. with a baby while trying to pursue my education.

Has anyone else experienced this?

**EDIT: Thanks for the kind words and advice so far, friends! I did want to note that I definitely don't feel like I'm even close to old - I still consider 30 and 40-somethings to be ""young"". It's more about the fear of being able to make a lot of friends I can relate with because of the big age gap. I'm also in an ""adult"" career (a senior software engineer) now without having gone to college, so I don't feel ""behind"" or anything like that. Thanks for the concern, though! :)**"

A few years after I graduated I was underemployed for a while living at home. I couldn't find a real job and I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do. I started to feel the symptoms of post college depression. All my friends were gone, there were no more parties, and school was over. I became very depressed, quit my crappy job, sat in my room all day, and didn't do anything. I've been stuck in this sadness for quit a long time now. I honestly don't know what to do or where to go so I just don't do anything. I'm pretty much a 28 year old bum living in my parents house. This is a nightmare, I could have never imagined myself doing nothing with my life especially at this point. I'm just wondering if there are others out there going through something similar?"
774,"Hi all,

I am a class of 2021 graduate who has been in the workforce for over a year now. I graduated in 2021 with a good degree, have a job that I mostly enjoy, and make a stable enough income to support myself. While I have had a decent time in the ""real world"", I have suffered from extreme depression linked to missing my college years.

For some background, high school was miserable for me. I was all but forced into an ""early college"" program by my parents that had me taking college courses in high school. While it saved me a ton of money when I got to school, socially the four years were torture. I was surrounded by a mixture of  ""high achiever"" type kids who thought they were on their way to Harvard to become doctors, and ""last chance"" kids who were at the early college because they didn't have any other option. I also missed out on the ""normal"" high school  experience no homecoming, no prom, no senior skip day, none of that, all in the name of ""getting ahead in school"". Because of this, I didn't have many friends in high school and spent most of my time alone, away from people not socializing.  I counted down the days to move to college, clean the slate, and meet new people, readily awaiting the days to escape my hometown.

I began college in the Fall of 2018. Once I got to school, it lived up to the hype. I made the best friends of my entire life, finding people with common interests and building life-long friendships. I was involved on campus, it felt like every day I was doing something, chasing down interests, and meeting new people. As a kid who had struggled with depression and anxiety heavily in high school, I found legitimate joy in my college years, knowing in the moment that I was truly happy for the first time in my entire life.

I had even changed my major to something that I was passionate about and truly enjoyed going to class. It felt like after years of looking to find my place in life and feeling like I didn't fit in, I'd hit my stride. Then...well...2020 happened. On a random March day, it all came crashing to a halt, the entire world changed in an instant. No more basketball games, no social events, no more in-person class, the things that my world revolved around suddenly came to an end.

Due to having transfer credits, I was due to graduate in the spring of 2021. So my college experience was truly 3.5 semesters ending on a random weekday in March. My final year was tough. Online  classes social isolation, and boredom took over my life. I became incredibly depressed, longing for parties, sporting events, and other things that defined my college experience. I was locked in my room for hours doing classwork, feeling as if I was dealing with all the miserable parts of college while missing all of the fun. For me, school didn't feel like it had a true ending. My last class was an exam taken in my room, my graduation was limited capacity with few friends and family, and it truly felt like it just randomly ended one day. A lot of my friends graduated in 2022, meaning they had a mostly normal senior year, but since my experience was so short I didn't feel like I had ample time either way.

I have been fortunate to have a fulfilling and successful career post-school, but the thoughts of college depress me. The nostalgia and happy memories have unfortunately filled  me with wondering about ""what could've been"" and feeling as if I was one of the unlucky ones who missed the ""normal"" experience. and had my time cut short. When I was in school, I loved where I went and wanted to be active alumni, but honestly, I have no desire to even go back to the campus for homecoming because it fills me with depression and longing to have the time back. Just walking around the buildings, the dorms, the student center, all of it just reminds me of what I lost and that I will never be able to go back.

I acknowledge that everyone has to move on from college and that these feelings might have been present if I had the full experience, but, I also feel like I would be fine I had some closure to that time period in my life.

So if you graduated ""during COVID"" how have you dealt with this? What are some strategies to get past the post-grad depression?  Has anyone else struggled for the same issues?"
775,"I just graduated not even 2 weeks ago so I‚Äôm relatively joking, but things are starting to pile on in terms of payments and trying to figure all this out after making somewhat over minimum wage for the past four and a half years is getting draining. I have a job I‚Äôm currently interviewing for but probably wouldn‚Äôt start til early next year. I‚Äôm trying to find other things on the side but that‚Äôs also coming up empty. I hate owing money to people (I say after ignoring the 20k over my head) but at this point I might have to start."
776,"I'm not a parent, don't have a partner, no kids, one of the more younger people at work, my friends have all gone their own way, and the list goes on. I feel so out of place right now in so many ways. 

Not that I need a family right now but  I don't connect with those who already do. A lot of people at work are older than me and I can see the difference in generations.

I feel so stuck right now in this very weird in between phase. Like I'm old enough to be more mature than an 18 year old but I'm still very young in the adult world. I feel like a freshmen again.  I'm very disconnected from myself and don't know myself anymore. 

I think school there was a sense that we were all one in a community. It was easy to bound through clubs, sports, and all the activities. Now I can't find a place to feel like I belong to save my life."
777,"This might be a bit late, but I wanna take the time to share this with you all. I graduated college last spring semester with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in engineering, and tbh I was not happy about it. My parents‚Äô one wish was for their kid to go to college and get a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher. I went to community college and got my associate‚Äôs, but I wished I stopped there because I recognized how much I hated school (especially when coronavirus hit). 

As a result, I had no motivation in university. It was worse because I wanted to pursue a career in the arts such as video game design, but my parents wanted me to pursue something more financially stable. So, I went with engineering as an alternative, and I hated it. 

Once I graduated, my family happy and I *smiled* to take photos. But once I got into bed, I cried that night not out of happiness, but out of anger and frustration. I was angry at myself and everyone else for putting me in a situation where these 4 years were 4 years of stress, anxiety, and depression because I was trying to make people happy. 

This feeling also happened when I got my driver‚Äôs license. It wasn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt wanna get my license, but I wish I was taught with more rationality and easier. As a result, I still to this day get anxious when I have to drive other people, especially older people, due to the fear that they would nag at my driving.

Now, idk what to do in life and I am left knowing that I got debt to pay. I know I sound ridiculous and ungrateful, and I might be the only one feeling this way. However, I just wanna get this out of the way, and I hope to hear some advice."
778,"Hi, been filing for Data Entry positions because their hasn't been much else for me, but so far I've gotten 2 positions with Life Insurance companies. 

I've worked in social sectors like Teaching and Community Management, so they see me as a decent fit. They are commission based, with avenues for growth, but I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience in these types of jobs. Both of them offer compensated training (which I was shocked to see), are remote, and flexible hours. Pay details has not been mentioned, but handling calls and filing for data seems ok.

What are other people's experience with this line of work. I'm asking because of how similar both of these jobs feel."

780,"I know a lot of people browse this sub like it‚Äôs r/2meirl4meirl but this isn‚Äôt one of those posts. For context, I‚Äôm a senior in college with one semester left before I get my bachelors in computer science. After three years in community college I finally found out that I really enjoyed programming and switched my major immediately. Due to my own shortcomings however I was only accepted into one of the universities I applied to and it‚Äôs expensive as shit, usually coming to over $20k per semester. While not ideal I didn‚Äôt really have a choice so I kept going and at the new university my GPA was effectively reset and I was able to keep it high enough to be worth mentioning on a resume.

When it came time to apply to internships, my high grades and side projects weren‚Äôt enough to land me a job. Most of the time I wasn‚Äôt even getting interviews, and life was super frustrating. It didn‚Äôt help that all my friends were getting offers left and right. However, my mom knew someone and asked them to take a look at my resume and it happened that I had a skill set they were looking for. 7 months of interning later (co-op program) and I just got an offer to work full time after I finish this last semester and the pay is insane for a fresh graduate. This whole time I‚Äôve been stuck with anxiety and imposter syndrome and felt like I must really suck some ass if people can‚Äôt even bother giving me an interview, but the first job I did land wants to keep me.

Not sure what else to say, it‚Äôs just still not entirely real yet to me. I feel like I blew all my luck on getting the internship and job that I‚Äôll slip and die in the shower tonight.

tldr; shit was hard and anxiety was painful but somehow I ended up in the best timeline"

And would like to get some advice on a couple things. Any advice would be helpful and sorry for the long read that I am about to throw in everyone's faces.

I just recently moved, out of a state I thought I was going to be in for a while longer. So I have to get used to a new area, but with a fractured foot right now, it seems impossible to be the ""New kid on the block"" already. That's why I am looking into ways to move back to the state when I graduate. I don't know if there are any ways for a teen to start buying a house though? Rent seems even more improbable to move back to, unless I get a job and put every bit of money I have into savings. I would like a house in a specific area but am I just shooting too big at a young age?

I also want to be a published novelist after graduating, but I know I need to be in a comfortable living position, could I be writing now to get a head start on writing my novel, so there would be less work in the future? Or should I right now focus more on a part-time job to save up for a living space?

I have no big plans for college since my goal does not require a PHD in writing. So should I look into 2-year programs- or- community colleges? I get constant emails about college due to some college bound program (I think) would responding to emails be beneficial in the long run? Or should I just leave them to consideration later.

I have just been thinking a lot. And I figured I would take these thoughts to reddit because night owls love reddit. Any after-school advice would be appreciated, so thank you for taking the time to read my post."
786,"I'm 22 years old and a sophomore in college. Too many things have been happening at once in my life.

I just came back from a torturous semester on campus. My roommate left, all my classes moved to online and campus completely shut down so I was left almost completely isolated for months. Not to mention, dealing with social security stuff, having my bank account hacked into, and just in general, losing confidence in my ability to absorb information in class and be a competent adult.

I decided to come back home for this semester and take a break from school for mental health. But the lack of structure just made it worse so I decided to take one late class to keep me sane. But people are doing construction on our bathroom so the noise makes it hard to study. Also, my uncle just died of pancreatic cancer, and all the stress has made it a struggle to get a handle on the class's system, so that's another load of stress on me.

So yeah, so much for mental health. I don't even have any motivation to pursue my original goal of developing a social life and making drawings and animation. Because I'm just so damn tired all the time. Everything feels pointless, and the pandemic isn't helping

I constantly feel like I'm losing my mind, my memory and my cognitive functioning are severely impaired and I don't know how to fix it"
787,"This is a continued from my previous post [Factory Girl 1](https://www.wild-child.com.cn/blog/factory-girl)

No one mentioned the idea of me going back to school since that visit. So I continued working at the biscuit factory.

Two styles of parenting were mentioned in the book Outliers. The middle class‚Äôs style, ‚Äúconcerted cultivation‚Äù, is an attempt to actively ‚Äúfoster and access a child‚Äôs talents, opinions and skills.‚Äù Poor parents tend to follow by contrast, a strategy of ‚Äúaccomplishment of natural growth.‚Äù They see as their responsibility to care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own.

My parents seemed to be a typical example of the later. They were busy with earning a living most of the time. I was expected to manage my schooling. Occasionally they asked me how I was doing at school, but the conversation usually were words of encouragement and pointing out tending the fields were hard labor and they don‚Äôt wish me to repeat their path. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on your own to build whatever life you wish to be‚Äù was the thing they constantly told me while growing up. But how to have a better life than theirs was something we never got to discuss. Looking back, I could see they wanted to help but was constrained by time, energy and their own intellectual capabilities.

Working at the biscuit factory was physical demanding but provided very little stimulation for my mind. I started to visit the local book store between my shifts at work and biking home. Reading was the thing I enjoyed doing at school. Books have the magic power of making me forget whatever I was experiencing and take me to places described in the book.

*How The Steel Was Tempered* by¬†Nikolai Ostrovsky was the first book I bought. Bits and pieces of it were mentioned in the class, but I never got to read the book at the time. Not attending school gave me the freedom of directing my mind to whatever interested me. So I devoured it over a few days. One part of the book stuck with me. ‚ÄúMan's dearest possession is life. It is given to him but once, and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years, never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past‚Äù.

How should I live my life in a way that I would not regret by the end of it? The only thing I wanted to do was to go back to school and that was out of the question. Fortunately, books were still available to me even though school was not. So I worked and read in my spare time. People I worked with at the factory were not interested in books and I had no one to discuss whatever I was reading. But I was happy and hoping these books would give me the wisdom and somehow lead me to a better path.

Opportunity struck when my parents agreed to send me to a vocational school a year and half later. It‚Äôs a 12-months program teaching students how to use Microsoft office software, basic knowledge of mechanical and graphic design. We paid the tuition with the wages I earned. The skills I learned from the program prepared me for a better job.

I moved to Dongguan in Guangdong province, the manufacturing hub in China and started working as an office assistant at a Taiwanese ran factory. Working as an office assistant afforded me with more time to do what interested my mind. After the initial excitement of moving into a new city and starting a new job, I enrolled myself in a weekend program to earn an associate degree in Administrative Management. Learning was fun and a better education was the thing I missed and wanted.

It was 2006 and I was 17, working and living far away from home. Friends I went to school with were graduating from high school and some were starting college. The weekend program made me felt like I was returning to the classroom like kids my age, but without depending on my parent‚Äôs financial support. As long as I keep working, I would be able to pay my way through. It was a liberating feeling.

I started to focus on improving my English after I earned the associate degree. With the discipline and confidence I developed while working and study, I was confident I would be able to teach myself the language. I bought the textbooks and turned to various online resources when I needed help. Believing that I am able to pick up whatever knowledge or skill I would like to get is a gift in disguise from that self-learning experience. It was also a financially smart decision at the time. It allowed me to save up most of my wages and send it home to support my parents.

The study plan I developed for learning English consisted of reading exercise on the roof of my factory dorm in the morning and going through the textbooks in the evenings. Reading, writing and listening were not hard to pick up, but I was struggling with speaking. An English training center at the city library happened to host an open English speaking class to the public on every Saturday evening and it was just what I needed.

How I made my way to the English class on Saturdays was an amusing experience. My job at the time required me to work on Saturdays until 6pm. Class started at 7pm. The distance in between took more than an hour by bus. I literally had to run to the class. To reduce the amount of time on the road, I had what I needed for the evening packed over lunch break. Once I finished working at 6pm, I ran towards the dorm to pick up the bag before heading to the nearest bus stop.

Buses on Saturday afternoons were always jammed with people. Standing on the crowded bus among people in summer was bearable. But the amount of time the bus spent on loading and unloading people worried me. The more time we spent on each stop, the less likely I was going to make to the class on time. By the time the bus got to the stop I meant to get off, it would be 10 or 15 minutes before 7pm. I still had 20 minutes of walking distance to cover.

I did not want to waste more time on walking so I would run the whole way from bus stop to the library. When I got there, I was panting and sweating. To cool myself down, I would get my face washed at the ground floor before catching an elevator to the classroom at level 3. Class had already started and I quietly slip in from the back.

Last bus back to the dorm was 9pm and the class ended at 9pm as well. So again I would quietly slip out of the classroom 10 or 15 minutes before it ended and ran to the bus stop. It was a more joyful ran. I would go through what was taught in the class while running through the street lights, sometimes moonlight above me. Looking back now, running under the moonlight sounds kind of romantic, only I was trying to catch a bus and there was no boy with me. If I knew how useful speaking English would be later in life on tinder dates, maybe I would have run twice as hard.

With the associate degree and improved English, another job opportunity opened door to me. It was a Japanese run factory making sunglass and prescription glasses frame. I went on to earn an undergraduate in Business English while working there. The job I was doing allowed me to interact with people from outside of China. My curiosity about life in other countries, especially US, grew stronger. I decided to take a year off from work and moved myself to US through a cultural exchange program by end of 2012.

Experiences in the US helped me to see a bigger world and working with people from different background. It also helped me become more valuable in the job market. I moved back to Shenzhen in early 2014 and started working as a project manager at my current company.

I applied the same goal-setting and discipline to other areas of life as well. My dedication to work was noticed by the factory owner and I was rewarded with loan to help me secure the down payment for an apartment in early 2015. I am happy to share I paid it off earlier this year and became debt free through following Dave Ramey‚Äôs baby steps.

I started out as a production worker for the biscuit factory in rural China at 14 and was crying myself to sleep because I had very little power in deciding what I wanted to do with my life. Like the economy of my country, I have grown a lot over the last 17 years. At 31, I am still a factory girl, but the 14 year old year would never have imagined I would be in the professional staff and organizing (bossing around) engineers and clients from all over the world. I have more control over what directions I would like to take with my life and I dare to dream bigger.

788,"So I'm (23m) currently working for the USAF, through BMT(basic training) and tech school I made lots of friends and acquaintances. I'm not weird or socially awkward and im actually a pretty sociable guy when I'm around people. I dont have many hobbies or interests although I do like being outdoors, staying active and going out. But I dont seem to fire in with my current shop environment. My fear is that I made a bad impression when I first got here (trying to fit in to quickly, getting to drunk, and even a DUI). There are a few guys in my shop who i hang out with and get along with really well as well as my girlfriend who has a different job. But I just love having large groups of friends. And even if the people I work with I dont hangout with outside of work I'd still like to have a positive work relationship.

789,"I‚Äôm graduating from college tomorrow with my commencement, yet I just feel so hopeless about life

I‚Äôm done with my undergraduate college career tomorrow and I just feel so hopeless and unhappy and suicidal. I‚Äôve lost faith in myself and in humanity. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll become. I‚Äôm afraid. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm anxious and I‚Äôm expected to parade myself to my family who I don‚Äôt know anymore because we‚Äôve become distant. 

I hate commencement. I‚Äôm absolutely dreading it yet I have to go to make my mom happy because it‚Äôs what she wants. I just want to forget everything, to throw it all away and just give up. Should I? I feel like it‚Äôs been all a waste. Useless English degree and student loans.

I love meeting  new people my age  and making friends.   I don't see how life gets better then that :L.

I feel so lost and hopeless"
792,"I spent the first three years of college trying biology, chemistry, and bioinformatics since I was so worried about getting a job or having the opportunity to be a doctor. I didn't actually really care much about biology or medicine, it just seemed like the surest option. Unsurprisingly, I burned out and crashed. 

I ended up studying psychology, which was okay, but then I decided it wouldn't be so bad if I added a philosophy major too, because I'm interested in it.

**Holy crap!!** I only got to spend three semesters as a philosophy major, but I'm in love with it. Before philosophy, I intentionally spent as little time on my studies as possible. Now I study philosophy in my spare time; I live it and I breathe it. Sadly, philosophy is extremely competitive as a graduate degree, and now that I'm in my last semester, my GPA will probably hold me back since I lost control of it during my burnout session. 

I don't know, I kind of feel like I ruined my scholarly potential by studying what felt safe instead of what I was interested in. I had extrinsic motivation to study bio, but it ran out. Caring about what you study gives you intrinsic motivation, and after studying philosophy I learned just how much more powerful intrinsic motivation is than extrinsic motivation. 

Right now I'm researching ways to clean up my record a bit and maybe make a shot for grad school in the future. In the meantime, I get to put my philosophy skills to the test in my internship, and reading the philosophers helps me feel connected to the intellectual tradition in our culture, which is valuable in itself. 

The kicker is that if I had just started with philosophy, I could have adapted my education to any path. By tacking on a few pre-med classes, I would have been just fine to go to med school. By tacking on a few CS classes, I would have been just fine in the workplace or to continue a CS education, etc. 

Don't assume that college is a one-track path to getting a certain outcome, especially if you're a young student. You will probably encounter things you've never experienced, which makes the future extremely difficult to predict. Study what you *care about*, and if you care about none of it, then that's your first problem to deal with."
793,"I have been an overachiever throughout my life, and I feel that this has resulted in my extreme post graduate depression that I am feeling now.

I graduated this summer of 2021 from a great university in the UK with top class grades and I have struggled to secure a graduate job within the country that I had to leave to my home country.

Although I am happy to spend time with my family etc, I hate it here, and I have always planned to stay in the UK after grad and potentially living there in the future for the long term. 

I have done countless final interviews for large and boutique companies to only be rejected either by my own fault (stuttering or underperforming in a case study lol) or of the current market conditions (there was nothing wrong with me they just liked someone else better), and it has taken a toll on me in combination with the problems I am currently having in my finances and personal relationship.

I have always been independent in the sense that my parents never budged me about school from primary to uni but I have always did my best and got great results because I like working hard. I almost did not get a chance to study in the UK due to the fact that my last high school did not provide qualifications accepted by most good unis overseas (ie IB or Alevel), worked hard researching each unis specific qualifications to find a way for me to apply-and I did and got in.

I have never been someone who was unconfident with themselves, in the sense that I used to truly believe I had the skills comprehension etc needed to make me succeed in the real world. I lead multiple organizations from highschool to uni, starting my own business last year as a project (which yielded successful returns, but now I truly believe that I no longer have what it takes to cut it anymore.

All my friends either have their life for the next year planned out with a job or Masters, and it is so hard for me to even be happy for them and it makes me feel like such a shit person for even being like this. I haven‚Äôt been applying to jobs again cause I am so tired and burnt out.

794,"Hey, so I didnt really know where to go to ask for specific information like this, so I just wound up here on reddit. So soon, mid january to early february, Im wanting to move to Lake Charles, Louisiana. I currently live in Oxford, Mississippi.  Which if im not mistaken is like 8 hours away. Reason being i want to go work for an industrial company called ISC. it would allow me to be a top helper for an industrial electrician inside an oil refinery that they are trying to build. On top of an hourly salary, they are looking to pay me 85-100$ a day per Diem. also ive already got a bit of money saved up in the bank, so i dont think thats an issue. The main problem i need help with is that im living in one bedroom in my parents house. I drive a little put put kia optima, and im wanting to make this move my first step of independence, so i want to completely move out of my parents house. like i was saying i only drive a small car and i have a pretty good bit of stuff. (clothes, tv and ps4, knickknacks, books, and some other stuff.) which im not sure i could fit all of it in there. In the case i cant, i was wondering what the best course of action is? should i just make two trips? or should i hire like a u-haul or something? btw i still havent found housing in lake charles, since i have never been down there to look around. :( if theres someone i could talk to with experience on moving out id really appreciate it.

796,"For the past few years, since I graduated high school, I‚Äôve been frantically trying to find a path that aligns with my interests so I can make a living while doing something I love. I started off in college for psychology but soon realized I didn‚Äôt want to go to school for 7 years (plus I felt like the courses I took were bullshit that taught me absolutely nothing). 

I‚Äôve been holding on to this idea that maybe I could become a successful fiction writer, but let‚Äôs be real, the chances of that are very slim. I love to write but I don‚Äôt think I should keep my hopes up of making it into a career. So I quit school and got a job at a lawn care company where I was miserable. It payed well for entry level and I planned on staying with it for a while, but I saw no end in sight and just couldn‚Äôt see myself working 40+ hours a week doing something so boring and useless. I kinda just wanted to kill myself. I decided to quit and then got a job delivering for doordash. Although this feels somewhat monotonous and meaningless as well, it‚Äôs much more bearable. I get to listen to music and podcasts while I work and it surprisingly pays fairly well for such an easy job to get. I don‚Äôt think it could support me in the long term but it‚Äôll do for now since I‚Äôm still living with my parents. 

I‚Äôm learning to not fight the fact that I can‚Äôt have my life line up exactly how I want it, no matter how much effort I put in. Instead of thinking about how shitty it is that I‚Äôm stuck in this rut, I try to appreciate the fact that it could be much worse. Before I would allow my free time to be ruined by the fact that I‚Äôd have to go back to a job that I detest and the fact that my life feels like it‚Äôs moving towards nothing. I‚Äôd come home in a sour mood after a long day and all I could think about was the 40+ years I‚Äôd have to spend doing 40+ hours of passionless work every week. Now I embrace my free time and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that this is just how life is, sometimes we have to do things that we don‚Äôt want to do in order to get by, and we don‚Äôt have to have our entire lives be ruined because of this. It could always be much worse (think of the struggles of our ancestors) and there‚Äôs always blessings to appreciate and beauty to be found. This change in perspective has made my days much more enjoyable. Im no longer thinking ‚Äúfuck, how am I gonna do this for the rest of my life?‚Äù I just get done what I gotta do to support myself and then move on to the things that enrich my life that I actually want to do. There‚Äôs no point in dwelling on things you can‚Äôt change but your perspective can always change."
797,"I‚Äôm 26F. I graduated last year. Since then, post-grad depression has been kicking my butt. What makes this worse is that covid ‚Äústole‚Äù my last 2 years of college. I simply can‚Äôt get over that. It‚Äôs not ok. In early 2020, I was the closest I had ever been to having my life together. In college, I had everything I wanted. I had a thriving social life, lots of friends, a fun & active party life, and I regularly attended fun theater events with my student acting group. But all of that was suddenly   stripped from me and everything has been going downhill since. And I‚Äôm supposed to just move on and act like nothing happened.

I feel like everything is over for me. College were my best years, now everything is only getting worse & I'll never have fun again. My degree is in Public Health ‚Äì I graduated during a freaking pandemic. And I still can‚Äôt get hired anywhere due to a lack of experience. It makes me question why I got this degree, and if busting my ass for 7 years was worth it if it wasn't going to help me at all.

Plus, in general, I am failing at everything. I can‚Äôt get a job, I am skint, and I‚Äôm about to lose my apartment in 2 weeks. And I see everyone else thriving and living their best life and I know that‚Äôs never going to be me.

Now, when I see all those news & social media posts of people posting their kids graduating high school, or people starting college, I really envy them. I want a redo with my current knowledge ‚Äì or at least I want to have the last 2 years back that were stolen from me.

Last week, I visited my college town to attend an event, and I walked past my old uni library. I almost started crying because I remembered 03/13/2020 as the last time I was there. I rushed home from that library that day, thinking I‚Äôd go home for the weekend, and had no idea I would never be back. I feel like I have lost everything. I am grieving for my old life and I just want my student life back & nothing else.

I can‚Äôt handle this. Any kind words or experiences with post-grad life are welcome."
798,"I've been accepted to Class of 2024, on a full-ride scholarship for graduate school! 

I cannot believe it. This is still sinking in, but I wanted to just share. I graduated from my alma matter almost close to 6-years ago. I didn't get a job offer right out of college and I was unemployed. Worked various jobs to get by and didn't really think much of the whole thing. I thought life would be handed to you on a silver platter.

Today, I just received notice that not only have I been enrolled back at my alma matter, but this time as a graduate student, but I'm going on a full-ride, tuition-free scholarship that would cover all my expenses.

The years after graduating from 2016 to now are a bit depressing, but I am coming back and I can't wait. 

&#x200B;

Who else has gone back later in life? I'm currently 28 years of age, making me 30 when I graduate, but I was going to be 30 either way, so why not 30, with a degree?"
799,"Saw this on another thread and subreddit, but thought this community might want to chime in. 

What was your first job title after you graduated college/university and what was your salary?"
800,"I feel like this is such a strange post but hopefully someone else relates or can possibly offer insight. 

I don't spend a lot of time socializing. I spend time with my girlfriend, roommates, some family and my co-workers occasionally, but that's pretty much it. 
I also have 1 really close friend and a handful of old friends I keep relative contact with, but we don't hang out very often because of distance. Also important to mention that I left my old friends groups after graduating due to drama/ people revealing their true colors. 

I graduated 7 months ago. In my senior year I was a very social person. For a while after graduating, I missed my college social life, but not as much anymore?
I don't miss the feeling of neglecting my responsibilities to do something I'm not super into, constantly feeling ""booked"", or crossing my own boundaries due to feelings of social obligation.

I find that now I spend a lot of time ""soul- searching"". I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have been trying to understand my experiences internally. I spend a lot of time thinking about my career goals, and fleshing out possible alternative trajectories that I could take in the future. 
If I'm not planning for the future or thinking about work, then I'm knee-deep in my hobbies. I spend a lot of time alone. It's been really hard for me to prioritize much else than nurturing my current relationships and goals. 

 I also find myself being very picky about who I want to hang out with these days. My coworkers are cool people, but I feel like I can't completely be myself around them. I hang out with them occasionally but feels more out of obligation than genuine compatibility. I only really relax around them when we're drinking. 
I tried to join this political group, they're all great people but I don't feel like we are entirely on the same page and I've felt reluctant to engage with them any further. It's also mostly full of university freshman and it feels hard to relate to them. I'm 23 but I feel 43, lol.

I'm really not accustomed to feeling picky about my social life. I'm very used to taking whatever I can get and getting along with whoever. But right now it feels right to be picky? Like my standards for friendship are higher? I feel like in college I was just happy with whoever was willing to be friends with me. But now I dont want whoever as friends. I want friends with similar values. I want friends that understand that you're not always able to hang out or text. I want friends that are as respectful to me as I try to be to them. I want independent friends that have their own goals and motivations.
If I have a community then I want a community of people I can be myself with. Otherwise I prefer to just be myself,  by myself. 

I've had multiple falling outs with people due to incompatibilities with the reasons listed above and maybe I'm just partially tired of that. 

I do feel the desire to be social but it's hard to prioritize that feeling. 
It feels weird that I'm home a lot- like I'm some strange hermit. My roommates leave and come back and I'm always still just here at home. It's easier to do my work and hobbies here. I feel somewhat embarrassed about that from an outside perspective even though it's typically my choice to remain at home. 
When some of my friends reach out to me to discuss hobbies we have in common, I feel a sense of longing to connect and spend time with them and a sort of loneliness. That gets me feeling social again, as well thinking about meeting more people as passionate about my hobbies as I am. I get really excited at that idea. When I think of something cool in the city I'd want to do that my girlfriend or close friend aren't available for, I feel kind of sad because I don't have friends to call up and ask to come along. But again, when the weekend comes and I have free time, I find myself wanting to engage with my hobbies or brainstorm career ideas. Going out and meeting new people isn't at all on the agenda.


I'm just venting at this point I guess,  idk. When I first graduated I was searching a lot for local communities to join but didn't find any I resonated with or with people my age. It was at the point I thought about creating my own group. I recently decided not to go through with it because I realized I didn't want my social life to be another ""project"". I realize now my best bet would probably be to find stuff to do in the city about my hobby for the sole purpose of entertaining myself, and if I meet other people, that's super awesome. If not,  that's alright. 

**TL:DR**
I don't have much of an urge to be social, I just know that it would be good for me and enjoyable. I also feel like my standards for socializing are high. Does anyone else have this experience?? Is this a normal post-grad thing? Where it feels like you're figuring yourself out and your social needs take backseat?
I feel secure in myself, but also like a weirdo, but also not..? I don't even know."
801,"Hello all :)

My partner and I are seeking advice as to where to live. We are currently in Western Massachusetts, and while there are many wonderful things about it, it doesn't necessarily have everything, especially with COVID affecting favorite (and rare) businesses.

For context about us:
I (22F) am currently renting a room in a 2-bedroom apartment. I have a Bachelor's degree in Natural Resources Conservation which I received in December 2019. My partner (22M) is living at home after graduating in December 2020 with a Master's Degree in Civil/Structural Engineering. Both of us are still looking for work, and aren't committed to any job title in particular. Financially speaking, we both have over 10K in the bank.

Even though it would be more affordable to get a place together, we are looking for individual apartments. We have never had the opportunity to live alone and feel it important to indulge ourselves with independence and freedom. We're also just about 1 year into being together and plan on moving before we'd likely feel ready anyway.

We both want to take a job that resonates with us, rather than biding our time and getting trapped. However, we do not want to let employment control us and be the primary driving factor as we determine where to live.

Additionally, we don't have strong family/social ties to the area, so the largest factors that drive most people's decisions do not apply to us. This allows us the blessing and curse of ample opportunity.

Over the last few months, we have been evaluating the U.S. through a lens of deep research. However, we've not been able to find anything that strongly pulls us, especially with our on-paper approach (traveling not encouraged in the pandemic or our financial situations.)

It is okay if we do end up staying in this area, but the point is to empower ourselves with knowledge and choice.

We think it would be most practical to stay in the U.S. (but welcome counter-points) primarily from an ease-of-move perspective. It would likely be easiest to stay in Massachusetts, or at the very least New England, but we keep finding faults/limitations (cost of living/housing availability especially). That being said, we aren't looking for the easy way out if something is really worth the effort.

Some factors that we are prioritizing:
Walk-ability/bike-ability/public transit
Access to nature/green space/variety of recreation opportunities
Good healthcare/safety
Community we'd fit into (not overly religious, relatively young and educated, sustainability mindset, and inclusive/liberal-leaning)

So, we're hoping to get suggestions as to where to live (and/or how to approach the decision-making process) and solid justifications.

TL;DR
Young couple seeking advice on where to move post-graduation, jobless and don't have family tying us down. Want to stay within the United States.

UPDATE:
Thank you to everyone who commented and conversed with us here! We really appreciate having the opportunity to get some 3rd party feedback. After some thought and consideration, and some more research based on your suggestions, we have narrowed our focus down to staying in the Northeast. We have to decide now between the urban areas such as Boston and Springfield in MA, Hartford in CT, NYC and Albany in NY, Providence in RI, and Portland in ME. We do not need to stay in the very core of these cities, but being commutable to them is likely going to be advantageous for work (we were both trained in our fields here so we have more of a competitive edge, especially with networking). We do have a few friends we would like to stick close-ish to, and my partner's mother does live in the Northeast and it might be nice for him to be within a day's drive to help out once in a while.

If you have any arguments within our new constraints, we'd be happy to hear them. This process is definitely stressful, but we're narrowing things down a bit. We're hoping to make a decision this month.

Thank you again for taking the time to chime in, we really appreciate you!!

Stay safe and be well :)"
802,"So I‚Äôm 19 and to start I still don‚Äôt have my full license and I‚Äôve never had a job. Every time I think of getting a job I get really bad anxiety and don‚Äôt follow through at all. I feel like I‚Äôm just wasting so much time having a job and I‚Äôm so picky with choosing one. Also, I get really bad driving anxiety even though I‚Äôm a pretty decent driver so I never really do it. I am going to a university so I can‚Äôt be doing that bad right? If anyone has any advice with getting over these types of anxiety‚Äôs that would be really helpful and I would appreciate it so much!"
803,"Like I'm still a boy. My peers already have families. They have a wife or child ir children . When I meet classmates from high school, 60% of them already have children or are already married. I feel like a boy. Like forever teenager. I don't even want or feel like a relationship or family right now, and I don't mind it at all. I just find it strange that most people follow this established cycle and way of life. I feel like I have Peter Pan syndrome and haven't grown up. But I'm happy that I'm single and I don't want to imagine that I would have the same situation and now have a family or a wife ir kids. Freedom is a gift. Moreover, when I see my friends and classmates from high school or childhood who already have families and these family ""obligations"", it seems to me and they behave as if they have lost their energy and the desire to fool around and enjoy life lije they enjoyed before. I was and I am still looner all my life. I feel like I am from a different type of cloud than anyone else. I really can't understand those normal traditional ways of living a life in this society. When will I meet with my childhood friends or classmates or someone from my family. When someone at my age already has children, they looking at me strangely that I don't have a child or a family yet. What is going on with everyone? Does everyone really have to live according to the trend of civilized society?"
804,"I‚Äôve been through quite a few final rounds for different companies, more first round interviews, and so many more recruiter calls for jobs that lead no where. I‚Äôm a good candidate. I have experience for a Fortune 500 developing projects through an internship and a Bachelors in tech. I just graduated though, and a lot of companies say I don‚Äôt have enough experience. 

I really hope this one company comes through. I studied so much, I love the company, I love the team, and this was my best interview ever.

806,"I have worked for all my life, starting when I was 15. However, only once have I worked a full 40 hour work week over the course of a summer. It was 9-5 at a summer camp in North Carolina. My days were horrendous, incredibly hot, so tiring due to the kids and terrible bosses that hated my guts, etc.   

Well I will go back to full-time work for a year before starting my Master's program and I am quite worried. I was so tired every day and could do absolutely nothing else with my time - I was too tired. I don't know if this was because of the job (heat, working with kids, etc.) or what, but I'm really worried because I value my free time and don't want to have absolutely none due to fatigue. 

Ironically, when I think back to my time in college I had way less time and was doing school work/actual work/volunteering for much longer than 40 hours a week. Despite this I was much happier, I don't know if it was because of the variation in duties and tasks, flexibility, the fact it wasn't 100¬∞ outside all day, or what, but I much preferred that life. 

I'd like to hear your experiences, personal advice, etc. maybe just to get some peace of mind. If anyone has job/career suggestions that feature a lot of flexibility as well maybe that would be advantageous. Thank you."
807,"I'm 27, about to turn 28. A former coworker of mine just spent the long 3-day weekend in London. While that's not uncommon for her personality, never have I ever even thought about going to another place, especially not in an another country for my birthday. But that's just the type of person she is.

While I do experience some fear-of-missing-out, part of me also wonders how does she not worry about money? I have a bit saved up, so it's not like I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck, but I know if I took a vacation, I'd worry about the money I'd spend on flights, hotels, vacationing, etc. It's not life-altering, but I can never truly take my mind off work.

How does one live their life, irrespective to the money they make?"
808,"hey everyone. hope this is the right place for this, as it really is a post grad problem that I'm facing but idk if it's normal or weird or what.

i graduated back in may 2021, had a paid summer fellowship, and now I'm beyond anxious to apply to jobs or work. i feel like I'm not qualified for anything, that my resume is trash, and that there's plenty of other folks way more accomplished than I and they deserve the spots over me. i worked my ass off in undergrad to not feel this imposter-y after graduating, yet here I am. i feel like I also sabotage myself, I don't follow up after interview requests in fear of not being good enough. i apply sometimes to jobs but just to make myself feel better in that moment.

the family pressure to get a job is also overwhelming, and I feel like I can't even enjoy a slither of vacation with my friends or anything without the guilt that I don't currently have a steady income. I've worked since I've been able to at the age of 16 and have never been one to be as ""lazy"" as I'm being made to feel now. 

half of me doesn't think im qualified enough to work, the other half of me is trying to defy the capitalistic ideals of productivity and avoiding rest (but then i just end up hating myself for it).

anyone ever felt the same? or resonate at least a lil? or have any kind words? i just needed to ramble to a community that doesn't know me personally lol im tired of the people in my life bombarding me with questions."
809,"All throughout college I really toyed with the idea of being an engineer, something along the lines of mechanical engineering. I really like math and I always liked the idea of being an engineer. However due to being poor I could not attend an engineering school near me. The college that I attended had no engineering programs or even physics programs. I started with biology and stuck through it because there were no other programs that I could take. The closest engineering program near me was at a private college and was too expensive. And the closest public college was about an hour away and I would have to live there which I couldn‚Äôt afford. Now I have graduated with a degree in environmental biology and minor in psychology and I really wanted to be an engineer. It‚Äôs not like I can get a masters degree in engineering because I don‚Äôt have a bachelors degree in engineering. Also those schools are still way expensive and out-of-the-way so what would you recommend I do because I don‚Äôt want to go for my bachelors again and another subject but I also feel like the subject that I have pursued and finished with is not lucrative and doesn‚Äôt have many job opportunities."
810,"I went back to my university to visit friends a couple of weeks ago. I graduated this May but I already felt so out of place, like the entire campus had changed. I went back to where my best friend and I would hang out to work together on homework. I went to where I used to take walks with my ex. I went to the dining hall and had one of my favorite meals that they prepared there. But it just felt so fucking soulless, like I had only ever dreamed that I had once been a student there. 

It was a gorgeous day out, one that I would have cherished if I had still gone to the school. I would have done my work in the morning, chilled with friends in the afternoon, and gone to the gym in the evening. But that simple, beautiful life that I once had is a million miles away from me now. My best friend is on the other side of the planet now, not at his dorm, watching a crazy movie from his country. I miss him dearly. We used to eat lunch every day together and talk for hours about all sorts of things.

It just sucks. I went to such a great school, with such a pretty campus and I had so many great experiences. In a way, I'm also mourning the experiences I never had due to COVID. Essentially three semesters of my college life were really bad because I was depressed, alone, and socially distanced.  I'm trying to live by the ""don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"" thing, but I'm not succeeding. College is such an amazing experience, perhaps the freest one will ever be in their life, and now I'm done with it. I'm going to grad school next semester (hopefully) and I want to not throw away the time again. But no matter how much I savor the experience, it's only sand flowing down a timer."

813,"I'm lost as fuck. Obviously, it's why I'm posting here. I'm in my early twenties, I graduated with a stupid degree, did no internships, just did it because my parents said I had to to get a good career and now here we are. I don't know what I want to do in life. I get that feeling is normal. But it doesn't mean I like it.

I thought about going back to college to pursue a new career path. I just set up my life to revolve around that. And now after doing some late night research, I've realized that my ideas are stupid. I don't know what I'm doing. This was all dumb. And now I'm back to square one. I hate my existence.

I hate the fact that I'm supposed to know what I want outta life from square one. I hate that I set my parents up to this expectation of going back to college even though I just found out I didn't do enough research and all my plans are dumb. I know they're gonna be disappointed. But the expectations are too high! I'm only fucking twenty three! I dunno jack shit!"
814,"As title states, I‚Äôm dreading the lonely phase of my life when the job search, stuck at home, is ahead, after graduating from college. 

I‚Äôm already dealing with a fair amount of loneliness stuck at home with a majority of my interactions (both students and faculty) having ended without closure, thanks both to this pandemic and them advancing with their lives, which has brought about a lot of grief on my end. I‚Äôll be graduating from college at the end of this week, yet a part of me still feels hungover on these expired relationships I made in college, in part due to how I won‚Äôt have an instant stream of new people to talk to with how I‚Äôm going to go through an arduous job search, which looks to be indefinite in terms of time frame. 

Was wondering if anybody had advice with dealing with a situation I‚Äôm in?"
815,"I‚Äôm currently in Quality Assurance in manufacturing, and occasionally I ‚Äústudy‚Äù to get my CompTIA certifications because I‚Äôm not happy in my current position. I‚Äôve also thought about and looked up the info for a Technical Writer certification, and dreamt about being a writer. 

However, I have major confidence and imposter syndrome issues. I study for the CompTIA but give up after a few days because I feel like I never could switch. I can‚Äôt force myself to commit to the Tech Writer course because I‚Äôm worried about wasting the time and money. I dabble in writing about once a month, but can‚Äôt commit to following through because I don‚Äôt want to waste my time on something that will flop. 

Logically I know I could succeed in any of these things, but I feel so defeated every day because I make good money with benefits but hate coming into work each day. I got my degree in hospitality management but I don‚Äôt want to go back to that either. 

I feel like maybe I‚Äôm just meant to hate my job no matter what it is, and that just sends me spiraling more. 

How do I force myself to follow through on any plan to commit to a new field?"

817,"So growing up I did everything by the book. I went to school, college, I have an amazing job that I can retire from. The pay is great & im not complaining about that..but I thought if I did everything right I‚Äôd be happy. Because you see everyone with the nice house, car family‚Ä¶and It‚Äôs not true. I feel like my hobby that I have and selling my small products I make‚Ä¶makes me so much happier. & it doesn‚Äôt even make me a lot of money. The only reason I continue to work my job is to make money so I can buy materials. I wish I had the guts to quit my job & risk everything just to stick with my hobby.

I‚Äôm lucky to where I played hockey growing up and it‚Äôs popular to keep playing recreationally as an adult, but I know plenty of people who play in leagues that do kickball, dodgeball, etc., and those people never complain about making friends. People usually go drink after too so it‚Äôs more than just playing sports. If that‚Äôs not you‚Äôre thing, join a book club, volunteer club, political organization, whatever makes you happy. Make your life about more than just work."
819,"So, for background, I grew up in a college town (let's call it Town A). I lived there until university, enrolled in and graduated from that town's university, and worked there for a while. During my time in Town A, I rarely thought about competition. Granted, the town itself has a culture where open competition is frowned upon, but at that time I never actually realized it.

As I wanted to try to shoot for a bigger pond, I then applied for various other companies, and eventually landed a job in a company located in a big city, let's call it City B. I'd visited City B numerous times to meet my relatives, but I've never actually lived there. 

Long short story, after moving out and working in a corporate world in a big city, I noticed that  I am becoming more competitive. Before, the concept of ""rival companies"" never appeared in my mind, but now it's like something that I face on daily basis. I am starting to compare my workplace's performance and activities with ""competitors"". Sometimes, I compare *my* performance with my colleagues'. I cannot decide whether it is good or bad, but one certain thing is I recently become conscious of this practice. 

Of course, if we refer to my hometown (Town A), showing too much competition is inappropriate. However, in where I am now (City B), showing too much competition might become a necessity to survive.

So, is there anyone with similar experience? Or what is your opinion about this matter?"
820,"Hey friends,

My old job offered great opportunities in some ways, but was a nightmare in many other ways. Everyone was great, except I was bullied and shamed by this one coworker for a physical disability. My boss took the coworker's side, because my coworker constantly complained about me to the boss and there's a lot of favoritism, and very soon I'm getting fired. My coworker lied to the boss about everything he did, and the boss believed him. I didn't stand up for myself and tried to let it go because I hate conflict, and as a result the boss still hasn't heard my side of the story, but now I stay up late and cry everyday because of the horrible things he said to me. I've never really been an emotional person, to the point I can count on one hand how many times I cried in high school and college, but this person has gotten to me. Looking for a job is not going to go well and I remember how much of a struggle it was when I graduated. My life is going downhill fast and I just can't take it anymore."
821,I know I don't need any of those things but I can't help but worry about it especially because I'm 34. I just remember when I was 20 I was like oh ya I'll have all those things by my 30's no big deal. Now that none of those things have happened I'm a complete emotional wreck. I just wish I could stop giving a fuck about it but it eats me inside all the time. Can't help but wonder if I'm screwing up my future and time is slipping away.
822,"It's been about 2 years almost since I graduated college and while I could attend college events and make new friends so easily, now I don't really meet many new people. I still have a few nice friends but they are like the chill, homebodies, play board games type of friends. There's nothing wrong with that I enjoy all the time I spend with them but I wanted other new friends who were more down with going out and being spontaneous.

 I'm feeling a little lonely lately and I've been trying to push myself to go to local events but I'm kind of shy. Any advice to what you guys do to create new friendships?"
823,"Do you ever regret not taking that other offer you were given?

I'm currently in non-profit, and while the work is okay and provides a paycheck, that's about all it ever does. It doesn't tug at the heartstrings, and doesn't even pay well. I thought by taking this job and offer, I'd be doing more work that was fulfilling, but these days, I find myself questioning my career and the choices I've made. 

A few months ago, I was given the offer to work with the city. It was a temporary role however for 1-year, and pays a lot more, but wasn't guaranteed past the 1-year mark. At the time, the pandemic was still in full-swing, so while we've made progress, it was hard to envision life the way it is now, what with new variants, and funding was an issue. 

At the time, I justified that what my current now job offer was better. It didn't pay more, but it was stable. I don't want to continue to job search and look like a hopper. Also, I'm coming up on my now one year, and grateful to have a job. Being unemployed will have you choosing stability, over pay anytime. But now, I find myself at an impasse, finding it difficult to even continue in this role. 

I keep going back and thinking what if I chose to work for my city? What an opportunity of a lifetime. 

Anyone ever regret not taking previous offers in their life? Or staying put at their job, because of stability? How do we eat these feelings? Or progress forward?"

Hi! I‚Äôm a junior at a random state school not known for its polisci program majoring in political science and public policy (these are two separate majors) with minors in public health and ethnic studies. As my junior year comes to a close I‚Äôve been thinking more and more about things that I can do right now to help me with boosting my resume + other parts of the job hunting process I‚Äôll undertake my senior year.

I‚Äôve done quite a few internships (will be graduating with at least 10 under my belt - thanks to the quarter system) related to working with communities of color/climate change and held various leadership positions. This summer I‚Äôll be interning at the Smithsonian but based on what I‚Äôve found so far, their internships don‚Äôt necessarily function as a stepping stone to a full time job after (which doesn‚Äôt bother me too much since I never even thought interning at the Smithsonian would ever be a possibility, so just being there for a summer is a pleasant surprise).

All of my experiences have been with non-profit and government agencies so as one can guess, the pay hasn‚Äôt been great and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve pigeonholed myself. My resume would make a pretty strong narrative for law school (an option I‚Äôve been contemplating since I was 16 so that‚Äôs partially why I zeroed in on a specific interest) but in the real world when hunting for a job I‚Äôm worried I didn‚Äôt try enough different things. 

I‚Äôm contemplating pivoting into the private sector - maybe consulting, corporate sustainability, government relations department at a company - or just something that‚Äôll give me a decent living wage for a couple years before I pursue a masters or JD. I think I have a transferable skill set that would transition well into private companies - I‚Äôve done a lot of writing, research (currently working on quantitative and qualitative projects), learning R atm, worked under tight deadlines, and have interned at organizations scattered across the US and I‚Äôm hoping this geographic diversity on my resume will help it stand out. 

The issue is I‚Äôm not sure how to get there. However, I‚Äôm really just focused on getting a job and would like to know how I can improve of my chances of getting one, particularly in places like the West Coast (CA or WA), DC, or any large major city in America. 

I‚Äôm aware of the realities of being a political science major (definitely have gotten a lot of underwater basket weaving comments) and I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm probably going to graduate in a recession (and maybe another pandemic, who knows) so I‚Äôm trying my best to make sure I‚Äôm actually employable.

I‚Äôm a) interested in hearing what internships, practical experiences, extracurriculars, etc people did during their undergrad, b) if you believe they positively or negatively impacted your career prospects after  graduation, and c) if you ended up working at non-profits, government, private companies, etc. 

If anyone has any additional advice (especially if it‚Äôs related to job hunting) for the final year of undergrad that would be great!"
827,"because i choose professors i connected with and actually went to their office hours despite doing well in their classes, but how do i personally know how strong it is going to be?"
828,"Graduated from a well-known US university in 2019. Majored in Economics and minored in Media. 2 months after grad I got a government position in the Middle East as ICT Analyst. After 8 months, I got 2x of my salary as an offer for a communications role in a financial institution, also in the Middle East. I know I want to pursue a master‚Äôs degree, but how do I figure out which one? 

When it comes to passion, I‚Äôm equally passionate for anything in the realm of my major and minor. I want to have a gameplan because I don‚Äôt plan to stay in the Middle East for long."
829,"Not sure if this is the place to post, but I am in my third year of my accounting program. I hated my program ever since first year but stuck with it because of my parents (job stability and whatnot). But studying for these courses makes me want to claw my eyes out and working in accounting has been a rough experience. My mental health has been awful during my years in university and each term it gets worse because I'm just trying to hang on and finish this degree. Problem is, I'm not sure what I want to do or what my interests are anymore. People say to explore my options, but how do you go about doing it? How did you guys decide what you wanted to do? I think I at least want to pursue a career that is bearable.

Edit: Thank you for the advice! I'm starting to feel a bit better"
830,"I graduated university with a degree in engineering 4 months ago. Since then, I've spent my time idling. I wake up in the morning and exercise. Then, I come home, take a shower, and sit in front of my computer for the rest of the day. I browse reddit, youtube, and porn. The day ends before I know it.

I've struggled throughout my life with loneliness. My parents were strict and I had no friends for most of my life. Rather than getting a girlfriend, I just jacked off. Rather than going to the club, I just listened to music in my room alone. I was lonely for my entire life. Instead of fixing my loneliness, I just ignored it. I feel overwhelmed by having lived a life devoid of love and friendship.

I could ""just get over it,"" but I feel that my isolated upbringing and the lifelong sadness that I had to simply accept is suffocating me like a heavy blanket. I feel too paralyzed to act because of the sadness that has defined my entire life.

My loneliness stunted my social skills and made me very socially anxious. I should just get out there and learn social skills. I wish it worked that way. I just feel so doomed. I feel like I'm going to have a mediocre career limited by my social skills. I will never be able to get a girlfriend, and, if I do somehow manage to get a girlfriend, the relationship will be tarnished by my lack of previous dating experience. I will be too awkward to find an actual connection. I will just accept whichever woman I am mildly attracted to and become her slave while I look at other women out of the corner of my eye and shed silent tears.

I feel anxious about starting the next chapter in my life but I know that I have to move on. My parents will eventually die and I am wasting my time doing nothing.

I feel powerless to change my life. I feel hopeless. I feel that, because I was isolated from others growing up, I have been stunted. I feel that I will never be able to catch up. I will never become ""normal."" Because I failed at getting a girlfriend when I was young, it seems unlikely that I will be able to get one in the future. Most people spent their time living in the world and learning from it, developing themselves as people. I spent my time in front of my screen."
831,"23F, recent graduate. I thirst for knowledge and to keep learning after university. Thankfully my university has a great alumni program where they give us a Microsoft account and we can access jobs and other resources however I have trouble learning because I didn‚Äôt really make friends at uni. Friends and classmates are really important for knowing what‚Äôs up to date in the industry and I don‚Äôt know who to speak to keep me on the right track.

I‚Äôm the type of student that, in their spare time, joined project teams, competitions, went on exchange had friends for class and that‚Äôs about it.  I took every opportunity uni gave me. My logic is that since I‚Äôm paying a lot for my degree, I‚Äôm going to take advantage of every opportunity I get. I grow based on practical experience and thrive in competitions but now I don‚Äôt have that.

Due to this, I focused more on my career than friends to the point that I never focused on having friends. I lived too far away and was introverted and exhausted and insecure about my strengths. 

What I miss a lot about uni is joining the societies and competitions, as a way to socialise and grow and learn. I regret not joining a sport. What can I do now to push myself at the speed of the industry?

I know there‚Äôs some industry competitions and associations where you can continually learn. I‚Äôm so used to throwing myself outside of my comfort zone and being given projects to challenge myself. I would like to enter industry competitions but I‚Äôm really scared for some reason.... I think it‚Äôs because no one knows what I‚Äôm doing whereas I know what they do. My peers are clueless about what I do but perhaps that is the perfect time to make a statement and be confident.

I work in a small family business. They‚Äôre all experienced in big companies but they‚Äôre in their mid 30‚Äôs and I‚Äôm trying to get into a company that allows me to network with younger people my age.

I‚Äôm a graphic designer and creative strategist in advertising. I plan to go into UI/UX Design, being a strategist and Creative Direction. If I did a masters, I would absolutely socialise more, hang out with people more, join a sport, invest in my friends, dress better etc. Because when you‚Äôre young, that is the best time to grow and move forward."
832,"I feel like this is normal, but since I graduated from undergrad Saturday I've been really down about life. 

I think one contributing factor is that I have a job in an unrelated field and I know this isn't out of the ordinary and finding one in my field will take some time, but it still sucks especially when I see friends and my sorority sisters go straight into their field.  

Another is that I've literally been in school since I was 3 (I'm 23 now) and all I've ever known is school, so this is a huge adjustment for me. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to get over this and to start feeling like yourself again?"
833,"I just had my college commencement ceremony a week ago, and i‚Äôm still burnt out. On top of that now there‚Äôs the added job search stress during a ridiculous inflation. So many choices so little time as employment is vital. Wish i could afford to take a year long break. Anyone experiece burnout even after graduation?"
834,"Hey, I don‚Äôt know how to get going and stop being stuck so I‚Äôm asking for help..
Since graduating college in 2021, I started a job at the company I got an offer at the following August. 
When I started, there was a condition in my offer that I will start working remotely due to the pandemic but I must move to the city my job is in (Colorado Springs, CO) within a year. I have kept putting off this move, because fundamentally I‚Äôve only grown more insecure about my job and I continue to find it unfulfilling. More on that soon..
So since then, I‚Äôve been renting my family friend‚Äôs basement in another state, working remote (living at my family home isn‚Äôt an option). My coworkers and manager momentarily will ask me when I‚Äôm moving to the area -  at first I said in November 2021, then moved it to March/April. Well, it‚Äôs now that time and I‚Äôm still believed to be moving like this weekend - I‚Äôve made no concrete plans to do so. 

Main reasons I have not moved:
- I suck at my job. I was hired as a software developer, and I dont have a computer science degree, so I learned most of what I know on the job and still barely know anything. I‚Äôve been moved around different teams on my project a lot. Earlier this year I asked to do UI development work, then got kicked off onto another team because I wasn‚Äôt delivering fast enough. So every time it‚Äôs been me adjusting to a new team, struggling and being slower/ less competent than everyone else due to lack of the degree everyone else has + lack of experience. For these reasons, I‚Äôm extremely nervous about going in person because it would be even more obvious how bad I am at my job.
- I‚Äôm looking for another job, which isn‚Äôt going great. I‚Äôve been trying to go into UI/UX design (my original plan after college) but that requires a portfolio and I have leaps to make on putting a decent one together. I spend my free time learning what I need to for my job which makes it harder to build my portfolio on the side.
- I don‚Äôt know anyone in the city I should be moving to, and don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll like it. Getting a 1 year lease for somewhere I know nothing about is causing much anxiety.
- The only thing I genuinely want to do at this time is travel. I am tired of worrying about my career stuff and I keep thinking I would benefit from meeting new people, being exposed to other perspectives and understanding other cultures better (as cheesy as that may sound). The state of exhaustion I‚Äôve been in has slowly chipped away at my motivation to do the things I was passionate about like drawing, and travel is the main thing that‚Äôs left that I actually have drive to do. I keep fantasizing about quitting and backpacking around the places on my list in Asia but that‚Äôs extreme. Realistically I want to take a small trip first. 

My plan was to find another job I like/ can actually do, then just move wherever that is. But at this point I‚Äôm going to have to either tell my current company I‚Äôm not moving, just move there, or quit. Friends and family think I‚Äôd be happier if I quit but I‚Äôm trying to stick it out for a year and learn what I can. It‚Äôs killing me though.

I want to know if there are any frameworks/ tools I can use for evaluating complicated options to make a decision, that anyone else uses? Im very confused and tired of being stuck, don‚Äôt want to be stuck any longer. Any advice for how to make a decision? It would help me a lot."
835,"I was thinking about this idea all day at my job. I'm at an impasse with my career, and as a first-generation American, I have the luxury of choosing what career path I'd like to chase. The generation before me, had it written in stone, so there wasn't as much freedom or opportunities. What I've been discovering and noticing however, is that given all of these options, I fall into hibernation, and rather then make the best choice for me, I recluse to analysis paralysis. Given an option between two choices, because I can't decide which is better for my career, I choose the idiotic option, which is to stall and day-dream, thinking about my life in either path, rather then choosing a single path. I do it all the time. Simple choices like what to eat, or what to drink, never bother me. But career options and choices, really stall me in my tracks. I stop, almost as if frozen, and rather then choosing a door, I chose the door from whence I came, as opposed to the door in front of me.   


I guess I have a couple of questions.   


How do I feel more confident about my choices?  
How do I actually select an option, given the multiple in front of me?

What do I do when I'm faced with a fork in the road? 

How do I live a life worth living?   
How do I ignore the feelings of regret, self-doubt, and inner turmoil?

Probably more questions, but I suppose these are a great start.   


How do I start living the way I want to live, as opposed to dreaming about the life I want to live?"
836,"I struggle to make my own decisions as a 22 year old female because I‚Äôve been told my whole life what to do by my Asian parents and people around me. Even now, I ask my parents and friends for advice as I‚Äôm scared to make the wrong decision. How do you go about learning to make your decision and trusting your gut?"
837,"I graduated in 2016, and stupidly worked for a cafe for two additional years upon that, when I should have been looking for entry-level jobs. I wasn't ready.

In 2018, I got laid off from my cafe job, and then found another one, before landing a role in an office, doing glorified customer service. Got fired from that job, due to no growth.

I joined a start-up in 2019, thinking that was my big break, but it was a toxic work environment, and due to the pandemic, my role was eliminated by October of 2020. 

I was unemployed for 10-month during the pandemic, where I got a social worker job, supporting my company, but that was a contract opportunity. 

I then left that job, to go to a full-time non-profit role. At the time, it made sense, just due to length of time. 

I then pivoted back to my industry, hoping to give it one more shot. I was working with college students fresh out of school.

Now, I'm in a role I dislike, because I jumped ship too quickly and didn't obtain the fundamentals of my prior role. 

&#x200B;

I think I messed up my life. I don't know how to fix it. I'm 28-years old and can't determine what is going on with me. I keep jumping because I wanted to settle for the right opportunity, since if I were to just continue to work in any ole' job, I didn't want to be silo'ed to that career field. 

What do I do? I haven't been feeling very confident about my choices and decisions I've made thus far."
838," 

How do I decide on a career path when I have so many interests?

I have a lot of interests in the world. As someone who is still very much entry-level despite graduating college a couple of years ago, I've taken any job that would have accepted me in the past few years. This has caused my resume to be a bit sporadic, but ultimately, given me a well-rounded balance of experience in non-profits, start-ups, tech, advertising, marketing and communications. I have interests in all industries, and tend to be someone who keeps my options open. Whereas another person could say they would never imagine themselves working as a teacher or social worker, I go, that's a cool path, I would love to try it out.

Every time I find myself investing too deep into one silo or industry, I start to get worried that this is all I'll ever get known for, and it would be hard to transition, so I back-out. My whole life, I've always lived cautiously, with great risk management. I never took a job if I didn't think it would be beneficial for the moment or for my career, and I always try to say yes to every opportunity. I never had that mentality that I would go forth and say, I only want to be an actor, or lawyer, or doctor and that's it.

I tend to be a jack of all trades, and master of none. So given that I have so many interests, how I navigate the career path ahead of me. I should be currently happy with where I am, but I find myself thinking there's more to life then the current job I am part of, and get scared. I wouldn't call it commitment issues, but I suppose that's the best way to describe the current situation I am facing.

Social worker. Teacher. Advertising, media specifically. Non-profits/Community-based-organizations. Communications/Marketing.

\^ All roles I've had in the past. So, how do I choose one?"
839,I don't think anything is terribly wrong but it's not what I pictured when I was younger. I looked up quarter-life crisis and what do you know this is part of it.  I just don't live happy and wake up everyday knowing I'm not living the dream and it's somewhat out of my control. I don't know how to shake this off mentally. It eats away at my soul.
840,"Anyone else just look at former coworker's or people's LinkedIn profiles to see where they've gone?

I'm generally happy with my life and the choices with which I've made thus far. However, there are some days where I just go on a binge and reminisce about the previous jobs I've had, and more importantly, the people I used to work with. Although we never were close, we weren't complete strangers as well. They were people I've worked with, gosh darn it. They were people I had to learn how to communicate with, tackled projects together, and spent time with. They have made me the person I am today, so in some sense, I am thankful for them.

&#x200B;

Today, I spent close to about 15 minutes just looking at people's LinkedIn pages, to see the jobs they've held prior to us working together, and where they have gone since post. While I'm set in my career and starting something fresh and anew in the summer of this month, I still can't help but shake and compare.   


I'm wondering if this is a solo-act, or commonality. Thanks!"
841,"Hi all! 

I recently accepted a job offer from a start up, and they very kindly invited me to their Christmas party, which is wonderful of them! However, I have zero experience with these things, and this will be my first time meeting the team. I'm very nervous, so would love some advice (beyond ""just relax and be yourself"" haha).

As a stereotypical tech person, I'm not the best at small talk. What are some easy questions or conversation starters you would recommend? It's a small team going out to an activity and a film - what's the dress code like for these things (for women)? How do I not get fired?! 

I appreciate any and all advice you could give me! I'd also love to hear your experiences with office parties - good or bad. Thanks!"
842,"i have graduated in computer engineering in 2017, i have been working as contractor for many auto motive and tech firms. it is so hard to fit in, so hard to keep people happy. biggest problem i find is nobody talks, no one gives advice. no one say what i need to do. just all the things i am doing wrong. right after graduation i was so excited to do hard work and rise up the rank but i quickly find my self doing very little to any productive work. i feel i have stagnated, and not grown in past 5 years. if you are new grad and you want to do well. dont stay in company that does not help you grow. no one care about you or your growth. they will only see you as company asset. if you need change you have to make it happen. 
i tell my self this all the time. but it is hard to just quit and look for new job. but i will do it eventually."
843,"I'm about to graduate university and I have no idea what I want in any aspect of life. The big things being that I don't know where I want to live and I don't know what job I want.

I moved from the US to Canada for school so I'm desperately missing my childhood friends and family, but at the same time I don't want to move back to my hometown. I'd love to live in a large city or even a foreign country but my hometown is where all my best friends are, yea I can make friends wherever I go but the connection won't be anything like the ones I have back home, we've been friends since middle school and still talk everyday despite not seeing each other in person since christmas of 2020. My grandma is also getting older and I want to spend more time with her while I can, she is like my mother and I owe everything to her.

On top of that I got diagnosed with a chronic condition while attending school so do I sacrifice Canadian healthcare just to be closer to friends and family? Also, I've accumulated a bunch of stuff over my 4 years attending school and no idea how to move it, I don't want to get rid of it but that seems to be the easiest and most reasonable solution.

And all that isn't even mentioning the job situation, I'm not crazy about any of the jobs I can get with my degree but will I even find a job in the first place? Should I do a Masters even though it will mean a lot of work and little pay? What if I hate the job but can't afford to make a career change?

**Beyond graduation it feels like there's just a big blank page on my life and I have absolutely no idea what to fill it with.**

Sorry if that's too rambly, I just needed to get that off my chest."

845,"Not really sure where to post this rn other than here. I graduated college last year with my bachelors & have been working full time since (currently overqualified & underpaid). I have been thinking of moving out for a while now but wouldn't be able to on my own, currently. 

So I was on craigslist, mainly just for fun, & looking at the listings for roommates. I know it's a thing that people do but how successful is it actually? Is it mainly normal people just looking for someone to split rent with or what? 

I also understand this is probably something I need to just find out on my own, but I figured I would turn here first & see what anyone's experiences have been."
846,"Spent 6 years in college. 4 of them were flopping around in a passionless major, and only the last two really mattered. I don't think I made any real friends, any real connections, and the only thing I can think about is how all of it is wasted time. How less than a third of any of the time I spent meant anything at all.

I have absolutely no good memories of my college years and I legitimately cringe at them and wish I never went any time I think about it. It's gotten to the point where I feel guilty for having fun because people like me who are absolute failures at life just don't deserve to have fun.

The feeling of being behind will never really leave me. About to turn 24 and I'm an old man now.

I know, I know, ""24 isn't old shut the fuck up.""

I'm being interviewed by people younger than me. Almost every single interview I've had in person was conducted by some kid a year younger than me making six figures fresh out of college.

I'm 4 years older than my peers and I'm less experienced and less competitive than all of them. Every single person in my field that I've met that stayed on top of things will surpass me by the time they reach my age.

Probably just gonna kill myself soon honestly."
847,"
Hi everyone I‚Äôve posted here in the past but would like some additional advice. So here is a little back story to me, I have a degree in Business Analytics and I‚Äôm 22 and graduated in January. I never really liked my major or really understood it well. I graduated with a high GPA but I honestly was not interested. I had internships in other fields and did well as I felt like I was provided with good training and got positive feedback but didn‚Äôt except the job offers b/c I was offered a different IT consulting position with higher pay.

In my IT consulting job I quit after 8 months because I just was struggling mentally and had a huge lack of work/life balance (typical consultant issues). Anyways, I quit and accepted an IT position at a Fortune 500 company. During my interview, the hiring manager didn‚Äôt show up and I took that as a red flag but rescheduled + accepted the position because I honestly was just so desperate to leave my current job.

My hiring manager is my current manager and she is so disorganized that she did not even realize I started until 2 weeks in. My first month she wanted me to be the lead on a project (this is a position marketed to entry level new grads). I was so lost but followed her direction however, no one on my team responds to any questions and my manager does not show up to 1:1‚Äôs so I struggled to make much progress.

Recently, she told me she wants me to get everything done and told me I need to be a ‚Äúdriver‚Äù and fit in with the ‚Äúhustle‚Äù culture of the company and said I need to basically get this entire project done by December. During my interview I was told by the recruiter this would be a 40 hour work week with proper training. My manager has told our team to work through the weekends and sends out emails at 4am, 11pm, etc. Everyone on my team is so busy and overworked and it seems similar to my past position. My personality is not very assertive and I honestly need training.

I‚Äôm struggling to see if my field is the issue, me being a bad employee, my personality, or maybe a combination of all. I just feel so lost and confused and anxious. I really am considering leaving this position because it is not at all what I was expecting but I feel like it would look so bad to leave 2 jobs in less than a year. I‚Äôm not sure what I will do after. Financially I will be okay because I live at home but I am still so nervous. I‚Äôm so lost and scared. Any advice would be appreciated"

849,"Is it okay to not love what you do for work?

I'm having a hard time. I'm in a field I do not enjoy, and going to graduate school. I'm in a field dominated by marketing numbers and media math, but I've always been more drawn to a creative field, one which is research and insights driven, not by looking at numbers at a spreadsheet and pulling data from 1st, 2nd, and 3rd party sources. 

While I could learn to do it, I wouldn't necessarily say that I love to do it. 

That being said, are my feelings valid? I'm 28-years old, quite older now, and don't know if I have the will power to keep on looking. But I also want to find out what it is that I truly want to do.

Honestly, I'm not sure what I'm really looking for."
850,"22F. Graduated college this past May.

A few years ago, I was someone who had a lot of friends, especially from high school. I remember the summer after high school I'd hang out with my old friends all day and night and my mom would warn me that these friendships wouldn't last. It was hard for me to believe her at the time as our friendships were stronger than ever a year after graduation, but she was ultimately right.

Most of my friends and I were single in high school, but suddenly (me included), we're almost all in pretty serious relationships. My boyfriend and I have fairly different interests and don't live together yet, so we aren't the type of couple that spends every second together. But the majority of my close friends spend every single day with their SOs and are basically part of each others' families. A lot of them liked to go out and stuff before getting into relationships and now they have virtually no interest. I'm sure at least one of them will have a falling out and break up with their partner, but honestly I can't see that happening for most of them. A lot of them have never been in another serious relationship before. Most of my friends are atheist or agnostic, and I have to wonder if it's somewhat rare among Gen Z nonreligious Americans to find your life partner by the age of 22.

I do have a few friends who are single, but a few of these people have also become distant. Everyone just seems a lot more introverted than they were in high school. A former close friend even admitted to me that he felt the pressure of society to have friends but he honestly was content being alone all the time. A few weeks later he ghosted me.

I feel like this would be expected if I was approaching 30 or something, but 22 seems a bit young to have largely given up on the stage of life where you spend a lot of your time with your friends imo. Maybe we're not 17 anymore and it'd be a little weird to spend all night driving around and blasting music like we used to do, but we're definitely in the perfect stage of life to enjoy nightlife to the fullest. And this post is in no way a complaint on my boyfriend-he's great and I'm lucky to have him (and I don't want to go out to cheat on him; just to get drunk and have fun), but we both don't want to be codependent on each other. This isn't a complaint on the taken lifestyle-only on my friends becoming more distant at such a young age, which can be explained in many cases by the fact that their partners have somewhat replaced most of their friends.

Anyone else in their early 20's experiencing this and feeling like they're a little young to have this problem?"

My work experience is atrocious. I've spent all my years during college working as a barista and in retail, trying to make ends meet. Once I graduated, I got my first big boy job in an office, serving the community for a big tech company. Jumped shift after that to join a start-up, which went afloat and down under every which way during the pandemic.   


I was unemployed for 10-months and just took odd end jobs here and there to make ends meet. I found a temporary full-time gig at a non-profit doing work aligning with social work. I jumped from the non-profit to another non-profit, serving the education and child care industry.   


I am in the middle of my notice, going to work an entry-level role in an advertising agency, doing media. I also have a job offer lined up to be a teacher, via my state's teaching fellow program.

&#x200B;

I tell this story because I'm stuck. I'm truly lost for words. I have no idea what to do with my life, and how to find out. I spend hours upon hours connecting with people on the streets, having conversations, perusing profiles on Linkedin, looking at their trajectories, but nothing seems to stick.

&#x200B;

I thought advertising was a lucrative career, because I thought it would exercise the strategic thinking I love seeing in great campaigns. 

I dislike digital marketing, because it's all about numbers and just making sure I manage someone else's money. 

I thought teaching would be my passion, but as the months draw near, and the program is getting close, I realize I maybe am more shy then I care to imagine, and don't know if I would be a good teacher. Plus I am teaching special education, which isn't really my jam.

I thought I would go back to law school, but can't find a reason to take out or be over six figures in loans.

I tried non-profit, but didn't like the competitive repetition that is admin and full of red tape.

I tried studying software engineering and computer science, and maybe I just didn't give it enough time, that, or, my brain just doesn't work that way and the language makes me wish I didn't even try. 

I wanted to be an actor, thinking I could be famous, but I'm actually quite scared and shy, and not good in front of a camera. 

&#x200B;

What is left for me to try? Today I am feeling like a failure. 

I keep seeing all of these great stories and people going for these paths to their passion and here I am, just floating, unsure what's my story.   


I like to help people, I like to talk to people, I like strategy and I like to think. 

I'm scared. What do I do?"
854,"If you get an email from a recruiter that emphasizes immediate hire, requires that you set up an account with an encrypted messaging service, (Telegram or Wire in my case) and/or gives you a verification/hiring code, do not give them your bank info. This happened to me recently. A few weeks ago I got an email from a company I didn‚Äôt remember applying for, but I‚Äôm a recent grad applying for jobs daily and I figured I must‚Äôve forgot. Everything happened very quick and it was a job right in my field with too-good-to-be-true pay and benefits. I did an ‚Äúinterview‚Äù over Wire with someone who I never saw or even heard their voice. That. Day. I got an email from another person that I‚Äôve been hired and I need to immediately fill out on boarding paperwork (with bank and personal info). I even got a call from someone who wanted me to rate my interview experience (?). I‚Äôm now sure these were all the same person trying to make the job and company seem more legit. It all felt suspicious and way too easy given the pay and benefits they were offering (work from home too!) I copy/pasted some text from their on boarding packet into google and they plagiarized much of it from another company‚Äôs website. But the company had a LinkedIn page and I found the recruiter‚Äôs profile on there too. I now assume this person is cat fishing as different recruiters. I just want to warn other recent graduates and anyone else desperately looking for a job- someone out there is trying to take advantage of that desperation! If it seems too good to be true, it just might be. Throughly research the company before giving any personal or bank information. I‚Äôm lucky I did that google search before I gave up my bank info. I‚Äôve since received other offer letters from random companies I don‚Äôt remember applying for with the exact same email template (which I‚Äôll try to link a screenshot of) Be careful!

855,"Basically as title states. 

Specifically, I‚Äôm a burnt out computer science student about to graduate at the end of this July, whose next stage is the dreadful job search. For me, that job search will involve data analyst/data scientist positions. I‚Äôve also been dealing with grief with multiple relationships I created with people during college being upended without closure due to pandemic. 

Unfortunately, I‚Äôll be stuck in lockdown at my parents house, so any plans of vacationing out of home are out of question. Schoolwork is pretty much all I‚Äôve done ever since I started it, and I‚Äôve felt for quite some time I‚Äôve been fighting for my life. So I‚Äôm really hoping that a break after graduating where I don‚Äôt have to follow a specific structure driven by deadlines like I have been as a student, where I have all the time in the world to do or learn whatever my heart desires, can heal. 

I am welcome to tips on how long of a break I should take after graduating before I resume job search, whether or not you studied/pursued anything similar to me major/job-wise."
856,"I just graduated with my Bachelors a few months ago, and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ready to start working, but my finances are starting to run down and it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôll have to unless I start to feel like struggling even more. I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll have many job options in my state that match my degree and/or career goals, I don‚Äôt have the start-up capital to start freelancing, and my social/family situation is such that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to comfortably transition to another geographic region to accept a position if I found one that worked for me. I‚Äôm feeling like my options are narrowed by my circumstances, and so I‚Äôm wondering if a job placement service wouldn‚Äôt be my best option right now, but I‚Äôve never used one and I‚Äôm not finding much information about the pros and cons of taking that route. 

With that said, has anyone had experience with job placement? What was the process and outcome like? Are there things to watch out for so that I‚Äôm not taken advantage of? Is it worth the while, or not so much?"
857,"I'm currently a first year in university, I'm suppose to be a second year but because of a dislike for my previous major and money being a bit tight, I decided to transfer to a university back home. It's been not even two months in and I'm already having second thoughts. I took some more time to reflect on what I want to do and I honestly have no clue which has caused tremendous amounts of stress. I feel like my major is completely useless compared to what my friends are studying and I dread the thought of studying it for another 3 years. 

The idea of transferring again or getting a degree that I not only don't have a strong interest in, but is also not the most versatile and practical scares me so much. My parents are the ones paying for university and it worries me that I won't amount to anything for them because they mean the world to me, I just want to support them, but right now I feel like I'll end up being useless. 

I've been talking to academic advisors and health counsellors to deal with the stress, but there hasn't been too much progress. If anyone has any thoughts/advice/recommendations on how I should go about my situation that would be amazing!"
858,"I had a terrible couple of months trying to find a job. I graduated in July and I'm back home but I hate it here. My mom is overbearing and strict, my father is retiring by the end of the month and my sister is suicidal because she is unemployed and she hates living at home too. There is constant drama at home. I was not ready for my master's but my mom forced me to take it up and she forced me yet again to take up a job after graduation. I don't have any friends or any clubs to participate in here in my hometown. (I'm from a small town in India)

I finally got a job but it's WFH. It's a great job really with good money and a lot of flexible hours. I was planning to shift to another city in the coming months where my boyfriend lived but we broke up recently. I'm still planning to shift there but I'm so scared. I don't have any real friends there either but I'll at least have my independence. I was thinking to shift with my sister as roommates there but had second thoughts. She doesnt have any close friends there either but she hates living at home because my parents are quite literally mentally torturing her. It might get weird if I bring guys over or if i go to places alone or with some people from college without taking her with me. She doesn't know that I drink, smoke up and party hard and I don't want it to feel like I'm living with a parental figure all over again. (She is 7 years older than me).

This brings me to today. I can't be good friends with work colleagues because well, it's WFH. Idk if I can make new friends in the city. I already such few friends in college, I find it extremely hard to make friends and at the end it was like my bf was my only friend. I'm incredibly lonely and I know it's only going to be harder to make friends from now on. Idk what to do. I'm still yet to find a house and shift. Life after college feels so empty, lifeless, lackluster."
859,"Anyone left their cushy high-paying job for one that is much simpler?

Would love to hear any stories about any individuals who left their high-paying cushy job, maybe six-figures or more, and decided to embrace the simpleliving lifestyle, or cater to something entry-level. 

I just recently took a job that was a promotion from entry-level, but am thinking about going back down to entry-level. Anyone just have no interest in making more money, or being a manager?"
860,"I‚Äôll just tell you a little bit about myself‚Ä¶.
I came to the US when i was 14 yrs old, didn‚Äôt know a word of english back then so it was kinda hard at the beginning but after a few years i learned some as you can see lol. 

2017 was my worst year, WORST because i had to move and live by myself till today, i was still in high school when i had to move and had no support from my parents because one is in my country, can‚Äôt travel to the US(no visa) and the other had a problem with the law in the US so had to move to another state. 

I had family near me but they had to deal with their own problems so i moved to a shared house(room) and kept going to high school living on another city and work. I was always a great student,smart , always did my homework, paid attention in class, was always on top of everybody in all of my classes (higher grades) etc‚Ä¶. 

So I kept doing that till 2018 that‚Äôs when i dropped out of high school like 3-4 months before graduation, i regret doing that but I didn‚Äôt have a choice and I was going through a lot. 

After dropping out of high school i worked for 5 months and saved all the money i could, my routine was just wake up go to work and then go back to sleep to do the same thing all over.

After 5 months i bought my own car and then took the GED exam, didn‚Äôt have to study for it just went to my community college, took it and passed it. 

When i got my GED I didn‚Äôt wanted to waste anytime so i just applied to my community college right away. 

2021 i got my associate degree in CRIMINAL JUSTICE. After that i started looking for a better job so I applied to work at a bank and got the job. 

I‚Äôm still working at that bank‚Ä¶.

I will be applying for the NYPD in the near future. Ohhh and I brought my mom to the US so she lives with me and my 2 little brothers, never been happier. 

By the way‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm 22

Again, I apologize for my messed up english.

Just wanted to share a little bit about me with you guys. üòä"
861,"For me, my birthday is coming up and the thought of celebrating it, has never occurred to me. As I've grown older, the thought is nice when it's done and planned correctly, but I've always equated my birthdays to growing older. In fact, I'd prefer it if people didn't do anything special. I dislike to be the center of attention. Wondering if I'm just in the anomaly here or the majority.

What does your birthday look like?"
862,Hello! So I graduated with a bachelor in anthropology in May 2017. I had a really hard time finding a job in the field. Not one place hired me after rigorously applying. I was working some retail/customer service jobs and I got thrown into a management position at a grocery store I used to work at. Now I‚Äôm a shift lead at a company with multiple chains and my GM already wants me to move up to assistant manager after only being there for a couple weeks. I feel like I found something that I‚Äôm good at and that I like. However I‚Äôm abandoning all my education. But I‚Äôm genuinely happy with where I am now I just feel guilty because my parents really supported me through school.
863,"I did everything ‚Äúright‚Äù in undergrad. I got a STEM degree (Microbiology), I did 2 prestigious biotech internships, then after undergrad got accepted to my dream PhD program, started it, then left it after less than a year because I couldn‚Äôt live in that location any longer (moved from Texas (PhD) to Boulder, CO for access to the outdoors). All I care about is rock climbing, skiing, and mountaineering and spend 100% of my free time and money and social life in those circles. But I feel so trapped in my career. I got a job in a biotech here, which pays my bills but I hate the job, the company, and being a scientist at all. I DON‚ÄôT WANT TO DO ANYTHING IN MY DEGREE FIELD ANYMORE, EVER AGAIN. But I have NO goddamn money to escape. 
The bigger issue I have with talking to people about this is that I truly do not know what I actually want to do for a career. I‚Äôm nearly 24 and have no clue what I want to be when I ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù.  I desire flexibility like 4 day work weeks or different shift hours or something that is NOT a 9-5, I CANNOT do them. I don‚Äôt want to be an entrepreneur. I want to interact with people in some way, and work for a company or institution or something that I think is good for the world. I want to work in the outdoor industry but I don‚Äôt know what. I have financial obligations (like a lease on my apartment etc) that scare me away from being willing to do minimum wage something. I can‚Äôt afford to go back to school either. And I live in a place where it seems everyone has an incredibly privileged background (like family financial help) or is a professional athlete or otherwise lucked out into a really cool and chill and well-paying outdoors job. I feel stupid for working a boring 9-5 in a field that I hate. I don‚Äôt know how to leave or what I even want to leave to. I regret my STEM degree so so so goddamn much."
864,"Anyone else just not pleased with any job they've ever held in their life?

I recently started a new job, after leaving one after having started another one, but for only three-months. Technically, the new job I have now is a promotion and title-bump, so it was a no-brainer to join. But for someone who just started a new senior role after only spent three-months in the prior role is a bit eye-brow raising. I understand.

Prior to that, I was working in a non-profit for seven-months. And spent two-months before that non-profit, at another non-profit, doing social work. I was unemployed for about ten-months during the pandemic, so my trajectory has been nothing but short, little jumps.

Aside from the length of time I've stayed, I find myself getting bored at any job I've held in my life. I've certainly stayed at jobs for over a year, sometimes two, but I find by six-months, I'm starting to feel like suffocated, I can't grow here, and desire to see what else is out there. 

It's like I don't like my job, so the only way I can do it, is by knowing that I have an ""out,"" which is potentially a new job on the horizon. The more I hate my current job, the more I spend time looking for a role, sending out job applications, tailoring cover letters.

Obviously, I don't want to be constantly job-hopping and going around job-to-job, but is there any way to settle-down and just enjoy the job? I start to feel that if the job isn't keeping me busy, my mind wanders, and I start to look at social media, or other roles. 

But because I'm not super high-up in management, I don't typically do work that is always constantly-on. I'm just supporting the team.

What should I do?"
865,"I'm currently in digital marketing and advertising, and find I may not have liked it as much as I thought I did. For clarification, I'm a media planner, so I work in an agency. However, I scroll through Linkedin and I see my colleagues who have taken different directions with their lives and careers. Notably, one who devoted their life to politics, another to computer science/software engineering, and here I am, still traversing in water, entry-level. I try not to compare myself to these people, since I know I'm on my own journey, but I do find it kind of mentally draining and taxing to see them live their best lives and me just trying to make it a couple years out of college. It feels like I should have tried harder and I keep shunning myself for it."
866,"Upon graduation, do you ever call your former educators by their first name?

As an aspiring teacher, it seems odd to be called by my last name. But I know once I'm in the classroom this will be the norm. I'm usually quick to turn wit if I hear my first name. How long was that adjustment to getting used to being called Mr. Last name? Additionally, if you graduated from high school, or university, do you ever find it appropriate to call your former educator, or teacher by their first name?"
867,Your degree isn‚Äôt gonna be a ticket that says ‚Äúredeemable for one job‚Äù on it.  Employers are going to want to see something on your resume besides the fact that you graduated.
868,"Long story short, I graduated university back in 2019, and I haven't done anything productive or useful.  Back then I was way too burnt out to go to grad school directly so I decided to take a break and look for a job instead.  But so far, my career is a dismal failure.  Not exaggerating- I've only worked two jobs- both times I lasted less than a year (seven months for the first job, and about 2 months for the second job) and I got fired both times.

As far as academics is concerned, I didn't do too well either, and the professors who I thought remembered and liked me didn't want to write me a letter of recommendation for grad school.

Not surprisingly, my family noticed that I can't hold down a job for any appreciable length of time, and they basically half advised/half pressured me into going to grad school.  I'd love to go to grad school, but I am also afraid of the mountain of student debt I will have to pay off, on top of the student debt I have already.

My family also had a bunch of personal mental health issues lately, so that hasn't helped with my own well being either.

I'm at a conundrum here- what am I supposed to do if I get rejected from every grad school that I applied to? How do I regain motivation and willpower to get my life back on track?"
869,"First of all, Happy New Year! I hope all of you are well... I am hoping that 2022 will finally work for me because 2021 was quite rough on my side. I got scammed when I was conducting business. I also found out that I didn't like what I had studied for years when I took a job back in 2020. I have a Bsc degree in Mechanical Engineering that I graduated at the end of 2020. However, I finally ended up hating my degree when I tried to apply what I learned during my college years and I just want to throw away anything related to mechanical engineering.   
As of now, I am working as a sales, and sometimes I feel regret on why did I take a degree that I would end up hating it anyway? All of my friends have better salaries and better company than me and deep down I feel angry and jealous. I ended up developing the thoughts that I am probably not smart/ hardworking enough to tackle ""challenges"".  
My future plan would be to build a small restaurant (well only renovating and changing the concept from my parents)& to get an MBA degree, It makes good progress, but I don't understand why am I feeling unsatisfied about everything despite the effort? 

Sorry if this seems like a drunken person/spoiled brat ranting on  Reddit, but does anyone sometimes feel the same? Just unsatisfied with your effort because the results are not as you expected? How do you cope with it and be able to overcome your problem and insecurities?   


P.S Sorry for the bad English, English is neither my native nor second language"
870,"I worked for 2 years post-college near my college (about 10 mins away) and that job was full of people my own age (22-26ish). It was so great. I bought a house 0.9 miles away from work and would have tons of kickbacks pre-covid with my college buddies, coworkers, and some folks from high school that I still liked and kept in touch with.

I got poached for a job that was too good to pass up 7 hours away and have been living in the new place working at the new job for about 9 months now. The money is great, people are nicer, it's a lower cost of living, no traffic, but I miss my old social group terribly.

I know the grass is always greener on the other side because there are so many pluses with this new job and location, but I still haven't found people my own age to mesh with. I joined a gym and have made friends there but they are older with kids like 8 years younger than me. So they're cool but we're not at the same lifestage at all.

Now I feel like I'd rather have stayed at the old job making less money and sitting in traffic just to have friends. Ugh."

i (23f) graduated with a bachelors in biology today. i know, objectively, i should be happy. i am a first gen student and my journey has been filled with roadblocks. a few years ago, i wasn‚Äôt sure if i ever was going to graduate. i genuinely loved my time at school. 

and yet, all i have felt today is anxiety. i have had 2 panic attacks today and i planned last week to celebrate tonight by going out, but i feel too paralyzed to do that.

i think part of it is the fact that i don‚Äôt quite have plans for what to do next. i am currently applying to grad school for the fall, and i won‚Äôt hear back about admissions decisions until late april. even then, i am entering an extremely competitive field, with only about 30% of applicants getting into grad school their first try.

my plan was to move back home until i hear back from my grad schools, but i come from a very rural town and i‚Äôm having trouble finding any jobs related to my degree. i come from a low income family and have to work, so i will likely be fulfilling the stereotype of being a fresh college grad working as a barista. this is especially frustrating as many of my friends who are entering the work force right away are getting $50k+ salary offers.

i am having trouble dealing with everything. months ago, i was excited to finally have all the free time i‚Äôve been dreaming about for years. now, it feels like any time i spend not doing anything is time wasted.

i feel directionless and without a purpose. it‚Äôs a little nauseating. does this feeling ever go away? does anyone have any advice for how to get through it, especially in the short term? i‚Äôm having trouble falling asleep at night.

for reference, i‚Äôve been trying to take care of my mental health. i see a therapist weekly, exercise regularly, have a plan to volunteer in my hometown, have some hobbies that get me out of the house. this is still kicking my ass."

876,"Hi there,

 &nbsp;

I've been enrolled in college for the past 8 years of my life since I graduated high school. I spent 5 years straight at a junior college until I finally transferred to a university. Spent a lot of time messing around with friends, gaming, and just generally didn't take school seriously at all - but stayed the course despite almost dropping out multiple times. Changed my major 3 times and generally just slacked my way through school until a fire lit under my ass and I got it together. I'm graduating with a bachelor's in engineering and the whole experience has just been a mental rollercoaster as I'm nearing the end as an older student. I feel like I'm losing a big part of my identity that has been with me for as long as I could remember. I was pretty much just a kid the first time I stepped foot on my junior college campus, and I'm anxious to see what life is like stepping out into the ""real world"" and working a 9-5.

 &nbsp;

What was your first year like as a college grad in an entry level position? What was adjusting to full time work weeks and having to do adult things after moving out like? Would appreciate some insight/advice, as well as reading your guys' stories about being in a similar situation

 &nbsp;

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses, seriously. Honestly didn't expect this much feedback but seeing everyone's circumstances and advice has helped ease my mind moving forward, and gave me a better idea of how to prepare for this."

The company/managers have been good to me but I'm barely making enough to keep up with my bills, even though I'm pretty much able to do the same work as the guys who've been at this job for years.

878,"
I am a recent college graduate (22F) with a degree in mass communications from a small podunk college.. and I have no direction or idea with what I want to do with my life 

When I had entered college, I originally wanted to be a journalism major, but due to my myriad of mental health problems (autism, anxiety & ocd) and inability/fear to talk to strangers, i switched my concentration to advertising (believing it to be a more lucrative career path, but boy, was I ever wrong)

My dad, however, warned against this, saying that I should major in computer science (since he said that I‚Äôm pretty good with technology) but I stated since I‚Äôm terrible at math, I wouldn‚Äôt do so well. 

I almost had an internship lined up, (before it got canceled due to COVID) in copywriting.

Before graduation, I had made a portfolio website of my project work, and sent out my resume to dozens of companies with only one reply, and I had an interview with them that seemed to go well, but then had ghosted me, and I never heard from them again (I should have read the Glassdoor/indeed reviews, which were mostly negative) I then lost all interest in marketing/advertising (since jobs in these areas want you to have a ton of job experience, even in an entry level position, and involves a lot of client interaction/presentation, which is not one of my biggest strengths).

And fast forward to now.. I am living at home with my parents and working as a part time cashier at  my neighborhood grocery store (which I hate with every fiber of my being, with all the customers buying hundreds of dollars of groceries, me having to stand for hours on end with measly breaks, customers complaining to me about the sale prices, and the constant social interaction-having constantly interact with people is difficult enough with autism) in order to save up for a car so that I may travel around for work. It should be noted that I am quitting this store, and moving to a smaller, quieter retailer.

I overheard my dad lamenting to my mom today about how I have no direction, and student loans kick in in four months and they have to pay 500+ dollars a month and I don‚Äôt have a solid idea on what I am supposed to do as a career for the next few decades. I am interested in pursuing other fields, such as the paralegal/legal field (since it involves writing and research, two things in which I was successful at in school) or even web development/tech (very high in demand, but pretty hard to break into without a comp sci or STEM degree) for which I‚Äôm taking an online UDEMY course right now, which will hopefully help me out in developing some useful skills.

It seems as though I‚Äôm disappointing my parents by getting a useless degree that I can‚Äôt exactly use. Does anyone have any advice (career or otherwise) for a struggling college grad with no direction? Thank you!"
879,"Hi guys I‚Äôm 22 and graduated in January and have realized I don‚Äôt really have any close friends. I‚Äôve always been really shy and spent almost my entire college experience online so the friends I did make kinda drifted apart.

With the few friends I have left I just feel like I‚Äôm closer to them than they are to me? They are all in relationships or have other friends and I just feel so lonely and pathetic bc they‚Äôre all I have but to them I‚Äôm probably just a casual friend. I only see them maybe once a month if that.

I just feel like I have no one and feel like I‚Äôm wasting my 20‚Äôs by not having anyone to do anything with. I don‚Äôt even know how or where to make friends. I live at home in the suburbs so there aren‚Äôt really a lot of people my age or things to do.

Anyone else feel this way?"
880,I've been lying to myself that I don't have this problem but I'm just like everyone else who has the same issue. Just so frustrated and I've kind of given up and just accepted that I won't ever find any close friends.
881,"How do I deal with anxiety towards the future?

Hi, so I'm dealing with lots of anxiety towards the future. Today was the last day at my job, and on Monday, I'll start a new one. By any measure, I should be happy. I'm leaving for more money, a title-bump, and salary-increase, but also, somewhat scared about the future. 

I'm also 28-years old and living with my folks. I suppose I wish I was more towards the end of my life then the beginning. There is so much about my situation that I cannot explain, but I've always been a traditional birds-nest kind-of-guy, so trying to be the first one to ""make-it"" is kind of hard, and not to mention, trying to break away from the family-nest. 

What are some things I can do to cure my anxiety towards the future?"
882,"What did you study in college/university?

Life has no playbook. In college/university, I had a clear game-plan. Graduate. Now that I am no longer in a classroom, what was your major? What did you study? Why? How has it manifested itself into your life? 

Curious to hear what you pursued."
883,"I'll pre-face this by saying I'm 28-years old, and not where I want to be. For all intents and purposes, I should be very happy. I work in my field, albeit being entry-level, still! I graduated with my bachelor's and am going back to school for my master's, on a full-ride and tuition-scholarship. 

But I seem to question my future. Every choice I make. It's almost as if I can't make decisions. If someone new or interesting comes along, I tend to shift gears and wonder why I didn't do that. I was on another subreddit, and heard about some great things that the students were doing, in an unrelated field to mine, and thought, oh wow, why didn't I do that? I wish I did, because I'm unhappy with where I am now.

I graduated with a liberal arts major, studying advertising and public relations, and haven't been able to really effectively utilize my degree. Others have, and while I'm sure I had my own reasons for selecting this major, felt that as my spiraling point. I really feel college was the point at which I made a decision that had changed my career trajectory.

It's hard to build a career and sometimes even though I don't know what the future has in store for me, and there is a path currently, it's like I'm afraid to work towards it, because of the unknown. I'm not afraid to work, I love to, but I guess what I'm asking is how do I know if something is really for me, job-wise? Life-wise? 

I have really bad analysis paralysis."
884,"I graduate in May from college and I‚Äôm already dreading it. I‚Äôm home for thanksgiving and just being home with my parents I feel so stuck. I don‚Äôt have the money to move out and I  hate my small suburban town so much. I feel so confined at home and I feel like I have to act like another person to appease my parents. It sucks because in my town/area you need a car to do anything and I already have so much driving anxiety. At college I feel free to be myself, do what I like and I‚Äôm not around my toxic parents. Idk I don‚Äôt want to graduate one bit"
885,I(21F) graduated in June with my MS degree. I got a really good job with great pay and benefits. I feel like I have accomplished so much in so little time. My whole life was revolved about being excited about the future and planning meticulously for it. I have nothing more to look forward to except a few more milestones but I have to wait until I pay off my student loans for the next couple of months. How do I find a new purpose in my life? Life feels so empty. This adult lifestyle feels so lonely. I miss being in college.
886,"I‚Äôve been out of school for a year almost coming July and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about my future. this has been eating at me for a long time and I can‚Äôt stop feeling like I‚Äôm behind in life, what was everyone‚Äôs way of finding a career that you loved or filling the void"
887,"Hello, I have to decide between going to Rutgers NB (I would love to because I've heard from many that it's such a good university) I'll have to get a job and it'll be a bit hard to afford it,  I'll be also be commuting, it takes around 40 min to get there and pay additional stuff such as food, parking, books, etc... but I've received a full-ride in another university NJCU, therefore, I would not have to pay tuition as long as I maintain my grades up and it's only 15 min away. What would you guys choose? ""Prestige"" or reliability?"
888,"I really had the idea of going after what I  wanted in life  but I just don't think it's realistically achievable to a certain degree. I wanna be great but we all can't work at ESPN otherwise everyone would be doing it. I think I took motivational quotes and advice from highly successful people too seriously. You know the typical ""you only got one life,"" ""you can be whatever you want if you go after it,"" ""anything is possible, "" or ""don't settle for average."" 

I felt like I was failing if I wasn't living up to these quotes or doing something wrong but I realized I was just putting too much pressure on myself to succeed. If I'm just watching tv or doing some mediocre job I don't care for so what? That doesn't mean something is wrong with me. Once I let go of what I thought my life should look like  apart of me was set free."
889,"I am graduating in December with a B.A in computer science with a business minor, and am unsure if it would be worth it to go to grad school. I was thinking about going to grad school for something business related but im not sure if it would be worth it long term.
Honestly one of the reasons why I am considering going to grad school for something business related is beacuse I think it would allow me to apply for a variety of jobs in conjunction with my computer science degree, as to be honest im not really sure what i want to do as a career yet. I'm not sure if thats such a good idea though as I don't want to waste 2 years of my life and have to spend a lot of more money, for something thats not that going to be that useful. I am also at a point where I'd honestly would just like to start my life already and start making a solid income so I could move out. 

I am also worried about gradutating without having had a computer science internship as I was hoping to get one this summer but unfortunately COVID squashed that plan. If i were to attend grad school I was planning on trying get internships during the summer months so I have more experience on my resume. 

Im just looking for advice or guidance, to make sure i dont make any decisions I end up regretting."
890,"Is it possible to love your job but hate working in general?

&#x200B;

I'm not sure how to explain this mentality I have. I'm just starting out my career, so I'm still relatively fresh out of college. But I've been working for close to 10+ years. I love my job now, I work in social media, but I hate working. I hate spending 40+ hours of my work week helping someone. It just feels like I'm a corporate drone. 

Is this even possible, to like your job, but hate the idea of working for someone else?"
891,"Info about me : Graduated 2015 with a Bachelors in Biological Sciences, pursuing Masters

Congratulations on graduating! 

The job hunt is going to be a cycle but understand rejections are not personal! 

When I received rejections I reached out to see what I needed to diversify myself to be a stronger candidate. 

Network Network Network! 

Humble pie is your best friend, jobs are going to start you entry level because you do not have experience. Try negotiating but do understand some employers are inclined to see how you do first then raises will occur.  Look over thing as a whole especially the benefits package. 

Do not come out of school with the mentality of this job is going to pay me 6 figures because I have my degree in (insert your degree major here). 

The job hunt is tedious but you will land one!

Welcome to the land of the graduates!üéìüéì"
892,"Hi I‚Äôm gonna try to keep this short and straightforward, I‚Äôm 17 and my grades are average although I know I can do better (but  I‚Äôm working on it rn). I‚Äôm Asian (filipino), my mom grew up w/o parents (she grew up w her grandma) and had to work to go school. Now she‚Äôs working as a nurse, something she never thought she could become because of not having that opportunity of a good childhood, money, parents,etc,.. that‚Äôs why having a successful career is important for her and I 100% get her. Yesterday she asked me in a tone of disappointment what i wanted to do w my life because she has done everything for me (like provided for me and make me go to school without having to worry about financial problems,.. everything she never had) and I honestly felt so guilty, I felt like I was a ‚Äúbad child‚Äù for not taking my studies so seriously. My grades have always been average because I don‚Äôt spend my days studying although I want to but I guess it‚Äôs just lack of motivation. Anyways my question is that is it okay if i don‚Äôt know what I want to do later? Im 17 and I feel like I should know by now and that‚Äôs the problem.. Honestly I‚Äôm interested in a lot of stuff but there‚Äôs nothing im passionate about. Any advices for me? Opinions? Feel free to comment, anything would help!"
893,"Ever since high school ended(3 yrs ago), I haven‚Äôt been the same. I‚Äôve been anxious, overwhelmed easily, and a little depressed. My family understands this and I‚Äôve had therapy, but I always find myself not spending time with them, always in my room, and when I do go out my room and have conversation with them, I always feel uncomfortable/overwhelmed and long to go back to my room. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm mean, I just feel overwhelmed when I‚Äôm out my room or talking to anyone beside my bf. Also, I don‚Äôt have any friends, I‚Äôm autistic, and almost 21. Please help I fell so guilty about this but I can‚Äôt seem to fix it."
894,"Can we get insight and transparency into your job title + salary + location?

&#x200B;

I am a diversity, equity, and inclusion champion. I try to live it every day. I'm not in the advertising industry (yet), but have graduated with a degree in Communications, specializing in advertising and public relations. My guest and commence speaker was then-First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. Super exciting.

I've always been curious to hear the insights and salaries of those currently working in different industries. I know websites like Glassdoor and Linkedin only provide a small sample size, if that, but don't truly paint a picture of the salary. I'm hoping this network, with its authenticity, can chime in.

&#x200B;

I also believe in financial freedom and salary transparency. it serves no one to actually keep individual's salaries behind closed doors. In order to be more equitable as a company, as an industry, it requires the effort and participation of many people in the industry. I believe workers and employees should demand as much salary as they can. It's true what they say, you are what you negotiate and/or are worth. 

You don't have to mention what job company you work for, but please do mention the location. Perhaps your city or state, because as we all know, $80,000 goes a long way in a small-market city, like Oklahoma, but doesn't in a very high cost of living city, like Los Angeles and New York City. So therefore, I'd love to hear the salaries of those of you in the sub-reddit.

Maybe to even break it down even further, your years of experience.

I'll start, even though I'm not in the industry.

non-profit, entry-level, NYC, $48,000."
895,"I honestly hate wearing business clothes or a uniform. Not because I hate the look but that I'm limited in options. When I was in school I felt like I had freedom to express and wear what I want. Now I can't wear a t-shirt or shorts until after work or on the weekends and that doesn't sit well with me. 

Obviously you don't want to wear pajamas to work but I don't get this need to be professional and dress to impress. I just go to work and do what I do. My clothes have no impact on my work. I just feel like a prisoner in my business attire. I hate that this is who I am now. Anytime I see kids in school I'm so jealous like why can't I look like that anymore?"
896,
897,"There was a previous post that said college was a distraction from reality. Read that and thought that was the smartest thing I‚Äôve read. No wonder I‚Äôm still struggling.

I feel like the post-uni life blues are kicking in. Additionally, I‚Äôm poor, in a pandemic, not doing graduation travelling or gifting myself anything. Very lucky to find work somewhere, that‚Äôs at least 10hours a week, and at work and busying myself with non profit purposeful projects I can find.

Two things that I‚Äôve learned 6 months after my last semester.

1. Establish a routine and discipline yourself for it. God fuck I love being lazy but I never realised how reliable my life was around my timetable until I left. I‚Äôm definitely in a ‚Äúoverworked underpaid‚Äù situation. You don‚Äôt realise how well/bad you‚Äôve been doing until you don‚Äôt have peers around.

2. Turn your complaints into productivity. I‚Äôm grumpy like all the time and I feel being an adult is just being productive with your issues. Learn to say no, cleaning is therapeutic, limit social media use. Provide value to others. If you don‚Äôt have friends like me, mentally work on yourself and be self sufficient. Be grateful but don‚Äôt beg for people to be around you."
898,"Let‚Äôs share some positivity and start the week off in a great way. Here, you can tell us what‚Äôs been positive in your life recently.

No matter if it‚Äôs big or small, share your positivity and your successes here!"
899,"I know it's cliche, but most people quickly get into the habit of going to work, then heading home.

I wonder if anyone has advice on meeting girls.

Trouble for me is most of my hobbies are male dominate so the prospects of meeting some is low. I've tried dating apps to little to no success.

Again, I know it may some cliche, but anyone have advice? I am only 3 months out of college."
900,"Hello! I went to some universities ranked in the top ten for my undergrad and master's degrees, which were very expensive and in relatively useless fields. 

However, I regret a lot of my choices and each month when I pay student loans, it actually kind of stings.

I moved out of the United States to a country that really cares about prestige but has a generally lower salary than US companies.

Is there any way I can take advantage of the prestige of my alma mater and make a higher salary? Thank you"
