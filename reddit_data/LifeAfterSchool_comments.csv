0,the agricultural revolution was a mistake
1,Why do people get degrees like engineering and then complain about sitting at a desk for their job? It was never a secret that is what the career path entails.
2,"Instead of staring at the one 5 steps from my bed... because, you know, i should drive across town to use your internet connection instead of mine..."
3,I came to this subreddit for advice and direction after undergrad but all I get are a bunch of sad mops who don't like the grind of a bottom tier corporate job.
4,"Exactly, sitting 8 hours behind a desk 5 days week while making 60,000$ is a pretty good gig"
5,"If you’re lucky, you can go home early and stare at another screen till bedtime."
6,"Watch yourself man, I got destroyed once for suggesting that 50k was good money."
7,The Big Bang was a mistake.
8,I feel the same. If your job is making you miserable by all means complain and look elsewhere but if you get to know your coworkers and the work isn’t draining it’s really not bad. Barring some of the really shit jobs out there making pretty good money for my time is fair to me.
9,a job gives you the means to live your life as you want to in your free time
10,"Depends on your location. In the bay area, where I'm at, it's chump change. Back home in Detroit? You're doing alright."
11,At more senior level positions you’re most likely to spend half or more of your working hours from home. Well at least in digital marketing thats how it is
12,"> Depends on your location.

Literally everywhere except the bay area, LA, and NYC"
13,"Society: Hey, you’re going to need to work in order to enjoy the goods and services produced by other people. The good news is you can do this with fewer hours and lighter work than any other time in human history. 

Reddit: wtf is this bullshit I was promised NEETbux"
14,"Exactly. People say that sitting in a desk all day is ""bad for your health""

Like bitch, it's your choice to not stretch/exercise at all during the work day/after work. Why dont you visit a construction site or a hot ass factory and tell the people working there that they're better off. My ass."
15,"“Society expects me to do work in order to enjoy the goods and services produced by other people, and that is a bad and evil thing.” - Reddit, 2019"
16,"Yep, so for the other 80% of the American population, it's good money."
17,"Yep replace car with feet, wake up at sunrise and literally smack the ground with a stick to try and get it to feed you. Work all day and do it well and still some birds, locusts, random nomads can just come by and take it all away in a pinch. Also so dude on a horse keeps on coming by and saying that he’s the one who really owns everything and you and you gotta give him stuff or else he’ll kill you. 

Sure parts of adult life are dull and tough but prior to all of this it was much much worse."
18,And probably Boston and DC too.
19,Why would you rather wake up before sunrise to work the farm only to be sacked by bandits after the harvest?
20,I think a part of if (myself included) is a slight bit of burnout after college. I think motivation will return!
21,That’s called retirement.
22,Or you can go and work in a field in Kansas half of the year. You’ll be working outside and have the other half of the year for yourself. Obviously the opportunity cost is greater but you do have a choice
23,Because they were never actually interested in it and didn't look past the surface level benefits like job security and high pay. Their parents probably pressured them into it.
24,The most underrated comment on Reddit
25,We all just want to be executives
26,Were doin the cockroach yeah
27,Why was I not made owner upon arrival?
28,You forgot the part where the boss gets rich in Cancun while you try to make ends meet
29,"Why?! My coworker puts his phone in the kitchen and won’t touch it until morning, maybe that’s my next move."
30,that awkward moment when you have to choose between 'working for a mafia front busines' and 'not starving'
31,Beat me to it lol
32," The truth! I went for forestry and I keep getting offers to be a masseuse.

Edit: I would also like to elaborate that my field contains some aspect of sustainability. So when I go to indeed and type in “Sustainability” I get
Offers to work in Red Lobster because of their sustainable fishing I assume."
33,I’ve been rejected from Target and Wegmans since I graduated last month.
34,It be like that sometimes
35,i wish they would say anything in addition to ‘your application hasn’t been chosen for further review at this time’ or something similar. I applied as a cashier and a coffee customer service position but nope!
36,Getting jobs in 2019 in a nutshell
37,"You were rejected because you're overqualified for the position, and both you and they know it. With this knowledge they expect you will jump ship as soon as you find something better, which would be either something in the field you went to school for, or something with better pay/compensation, or both. And when you get that better job is highly unpredictable - you could get that call six months later, or you could get it two weeks into your new job. 

If a store is looking for someone long term, they're not going to spend the time, money, and effort on hiring and training someone who they're sure will always be looking for something better while they're there. 

If you're looking for a retail job as a college graduate, leave your degree off your resume."
38,"Implying that Moe's would be hiring them for their forensics degree to aid with illegal activities, body disposal, etc."
39,"Fuck these entitled pricks. The goddamn nerve you must have to see someone with an education and a high level of job training looking for a job in their field, and then you send them this fucking shit?

I hope whoever this hiring manager manager is, and all the ones like them, eternally step on legos."
40,On what grounds?
41,Does Moe’s Southwest Grill keep hungry pigs out back?
42,"I’m so extremely grateful I got a job in my field straight out of college. I had to move all the way across the country for it but that’s fine, I’m getting experience and I’ll be working on exciting projects! Then hopefully after a year or so I’ll be back home with my friends/family."
43,"If you need the money now, leave your degree off your resume and see if that makes a difference."
44,"My Uni has a job search app for students and graduates - never really helped me because out of my searches for “media” jobs, 2 would be actual jobs I might want and the rest were like, sales and accounting for a media/broadcast company."
45,God this is insulting >:/
46,"Just lie.  Say you spent the last four years working at a starbucks or something.  It's a fucking Target, they're not calling your references."
47,“Welcome to Mooooooe’s!”
48,"Something similar happened to me, I was contacted about an industrial sewing position in a warehouse after I applied for a job in my field through a website that is supposed to match your resume to jobs."
49,It’s a bot
50,HECK
51,[deleted]
52,Im pretty sure you dont need a coma before this use of “when”
53,Legit.
54,The truth hurts.
55,Well that sucks and I wish you best of luck in your employment search.

57,thanks!
58,"The time between graduating college and getting a job? 

I've never admittedly been in that position, but based on everything I've heard and read online, if it were me I would probably spend the first few months aggressively applying for jobs, multiple a day, while crafting custom resumes and possibly cover letters for positions I was really interested in. 

I would also be trying to keep busy and maintain or build my skills through something like volunteering, completing online courses, working on a personal project, obtaining certifications, or seeing if I could get an internship as a new grad. 

I'd try to get in contact with my school's career or alumni center and see if I can get any additional help or direction from them, regarding how I could rework my resume or someone I could speak to in order to help get me a job. I'd see if there were any upcoming career fairs or networking events I could go to, or maybe a temp agency in the local area that might be able to give me something. I'd reach out to my past internship supervisors and inquire about any open full-time positions. I'd also see if family might know anyone. 

If I couldn't find anything and really had to get any job ASAP, I would leave my degree off my resume, and have at least two separate resumes (one with my degree listed and one without) depending on the position, and keep looking for something in my field."
59,That’s about right 🙄
60,Lol. Should I tell this guy?
61,"No ones disputing that you’ll have the dream job you always wanted. It’s the fact that you haven’t started it yet, so you still think it’s a dream job.  Most people’s dream jobs are just as awful as all the rest once they get into it far enough. Just wait until you get burnt out, run down, crushed by corporate, and experience bad managers, bad employees, and bad wages."
62,it’s a better mindset than being pessimistic about things
63,[deleted]
64,"Yes, it’s ditch digger"
65,It is sad that a lot of people have that mentality starting out. Very optimistic about things only to find out that it is rough out here.
66,"Hey, maybe her dream job is at Starbucks making 10 bucks an hour. You don’t know her. You don’t know her life."
67,Sorry requires 2+ years experience
68,"I’ve actually been working there for about a year and have only gotten more excited for going full-time. It’s not the job or the company that makes it a dream job. It’s doing something I really enjoy, using skills I love to work on. 

In my experience and the experiences of others I’ve witnessed, that burnt out feeling is about 70% mentality/balance and 30% luck. I’m not going to wait for those feelings because I’m not going to let them happen.

But my original point was that OP made a bitter remark acting like dream jobs don’t exist and people can’t work and be happy. Which does nothing but discourage people and in my opinion guarantee that it happens."
69,"The important thing is to balance both of them while being realistic at the same time. Do your research. Talk to people. Find something that you think would be your dream job that you can strive towards. At the same time, manage your expectations that there's a 90% chance it will not turn out how you think it will. Hope for the best, but expect the worst."
70,It's entirely possible that she will reach her dream job.
71,Let us know if its a dream job.
72,"My interpretation of OP was not that dream jobs don't exist, but that it's not that easy to get there right out of university and you may be setting yourself up for disappointment if you expect the job hunting process to go as smoothly as it did for you."
73,"Did she know what ""open her own business"" actually mean?"
74,"This is actually a sub dedicated to life after school which includes venting, asking for advice, or even giving advice. 

A lot of people here also are young, weren’t given the same advantages as others, or haven’t had guidance they truly need. 

You seem to project a big ego and imply you have your life together. Maybe instead of passive aggressively degrading other users, you can shine some light on those in the dark.

Hope your day stays well!"
75,Right! Like I’m a nursing student and will be employable in my field immediately after graduating.
76,"Jesus Christ you guys are bitter. College isn’t easy, but you can definitely land your dream job like I did if you work at it hard enough."
77,I'm gonna make the reasonable assumption that it ain't.
78,Nothing in her post implied that she thought she’d be making 6 figs
79,"Yeah, I don’t understand the negativity in this thread. Everyone has different expectations and some people actually find their dream job."
80,"I mean that can be said for a wide variety of jobs,  a lot of which you can get without even a degree"
81,"It’s a joke, if you scroll through the sub, you will see lots of honest posts with people asking for advice. 

I can see how this one might not be to your taste as it implies going to college is a waste, and in your position this is false, but to some it’s a reality. 

—__(*_*)__—"
82,Jamie pull that up
83,"My point wasn’t on the degree but rather the sad, toxic nature of the post. Being spiteful and angry gets you nowhere. I thought this would be a sub with cool tips on how to be an adult not a fucking pity party. It’s just sad is all and reinforces the “reddit” stereotype."
84,"Oh shit, it’s just a matter of working hard enough? I guess I must just be wicked lazy, then. 

It certainly is a lot *easier* to work several low paying jobs with just enough money to scrape by and having to worry about the looming threat of on unexpected bill tossing your whole existence into the void. 

Too bad I don’t work hard enough to deserve the hardships of a 9-5 AND being able to eat."
85,Depends on the person. I always wanted to do something where I helped people so yeah it is a dream job
86,Guess it depends on your definition of dream job
87,Ah gotcha. I can see why you would see the post that way.
88,"I mean, it’s not impossible. I kinda did it. But my dreams are practical and done in a step-wise fashion."
89,what exactly does this misplaced rant have to do with anything though lol
90,Do you know all the details about what loans you’re taking out?
91,"I'm doing this right now, I'm a Junior, and I have zero debt.


I am a Finance major, but I might change it to accounting, I don't know. Anyways, what you said is entirely possible."
92,I’m not taking any loans
93,"idk, i'm paying $10k for a tech degree that will start me with a job that pays $50k starting. i'd say that degree is pretty damn valuable"
94,Are they bombs too. If so I might be interested
95,That’s good.
96,False. Alot of people only start thinking this way when they haven't found a job yet. It gets better just keep applying and keep your mental health up it's going to be okay.
97,"Only specific STEM degrees tho 

Don't major in chem, physics or biology, unless you wanna be a glorified lab tech."
98,This fuckn hurts.
99,I have a friend with a finance degree who says his biggest regret is getting that instead of an accounting degree.
100,"Shit, I believe you, man. I'll talk to my advisor ASAP. 

Thanks for the input, dude. Also nice username lol"
101,"College degrees are still the biggest factor in determining salary and job security for most people. There are outliers, and the student loans really suck, but a degree is still useful if leveraged correctly."
102,"Contrary to the other comment your received, majority of my Accountant friends regret choosing that major because not only is it competitive, but very boring.

What’s wrong with Finance? I actually heard that there are way more career opportunities as a financial major."
103,It’s a worthwhile investment if you go in a STEM field degree. Most if not all of those jobs have a good job market
104,"Best of luck to you friend. It’s definitely possible to get a decent job in that time. If not, it doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong with you! Sometimes positions get filled by more experienced individuals in spite of you being perfectly qualified. 

Just be persistent and you’ve got this!"
105,"Stick with finance, a finance degree can get your foot in the door in both industries. You can gain experience and pivot to the next one if you lose interest. Maybe minor in accounting. 

Source: graduated with a finance degree, am accountant."
106,"Sounds great, and I don’t know about your particular circumstances but... Just be sure you have a job offer before banking on the 50k."
107,Depending on what you wanna get into
108,well i have six months after i graduate to start paying off my loan lmao. if i can't find a job within that time something's wrong with me
109,"yeeeep! Or maybe get super lucky and get a PHD to maybe become a well paid PI, prof, or Researcher for some large company (maybe)"
110,i appreciate you
111,Nowadays it’s more like TE
112,"Yep, I speak from experience lol. Not on the PHD route lol."
113,"Those aren’t pies, they’re bombs, from a bomb factory"
114,My brother took a similar rout. Accounting major to finance major in the end. He’s doing pretty well right now so it looks like a good bet.
115,My life😢
116,While simultaneously becoming more important to employers.
117,You just hurt my pride lol. Though I agree.
118,Did you get out in time? Or still stuck in tech hell?
119,I'm a clinical research coordinator. Its not all bad currently. But I applied to many tech jobs for sure as that is what was available.
120,I once saw a dishwashing position that required 10 years of experience in a fast-paced restaurant.
121,"Since my second semester of university I was editing video, shooting on-site, and working in the TV studio, almost exactly how it's done in the ""real world"".

""Yeah, but uni experience isn't PROFESSIONAL experience!"" Okay, then don't call it an entry-level job and don't bitch to me when you're re-posting the job listing over and over since January. I can almost guarantee that it was: 

""So this entry level job requires pretty minimal tech skills. What should we say? A year or equivalent education would be preferred?""

""I don't know, 5 seems a lot more 'whole', knowhatimean? Let's just say 5 years, fuck it."""
122,This hurts soooooo much lmao
123,"Yeah no I hear this a lot but when I've straight up been told before how my resume isn't good enough for shit entry-level positions despite my degree, multiple prestigious internships, and relevant work experience."
124,fuck that shit  [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)
125,My internships weren't in the same area I'm living in now. It's just that companies don't understand when they can't be picky. Lawyers and politicians particularly. My local job agencies have parroted this sentiment; employers beg for workers but won't give up on impossible requirements.
126,"This is too true for my field.. LinkedIn is full of ‘Entry level positions’ that need 3-5 years experience and 2 or more certifications. So many of the listings have been up for MONTHS and I’m just thinking how they could’ve trained someone to do the job and do it well in that time span. 

You’d think people would want to hire people in college or fresh out so they can mold them into exactly what they want from an employee... but nah fuck that shit give me someone set in their ways that will inevitably leave for another entry level position that pays more!"
127,You know what happens if everyone turns to STEM? Same treatment.
128,"That’s why I only look into government positions, you just need half brain working to work for them"
129,Sounds like you industry / local market is at a point where companies can be that picky. Sucks for you. Try branching out. Why didn’t your prestigious internships translate into job offers?
130,"Not under. They just put too much work on the employees they do have, know they need more people, and infinitely bitch to employment agencies that they can't find that magic employee with 5 years experience with 1 employer who's willing to work for 32k."
131,"I’m a recent grad as of a month ago with my Bachelor’s in HR and I fortunately got hired on where I completed my internship. 

However, everything everyone is saying above is 100% true. Job descriptions aren’t typically accurate, it’s a laundry list of potential things. Our job descriptions have a ton of requirements listed, but I typically look for 3 things out of that list. If they have 3 things, I call them for an interview. 

Don’t let the job posting scare you away from applying. You may be surprised at all of the opportunities you’re missing."
132,Are you kidding me getting a dog requires more experience and reviewing then having a child. When you have a child the hospital doesn’t even ask if you have the ability to care for the child or check with your land lord just hands over the child.
133,The only place I could understand that would be the Jiro Ono's restaurant
134,Seriously; Junior JavaScript Developer: minimum 2 years experience with 6 different technologies.
135,Same though.
136,100% why I leave them
137,Forgot the 5 years previous experience in a technology that’s 3 years old 😂
138,Join a new interesting subreddit: r/college_buzz/
139,Sounds like you should switch to STEM
140,The bar on owning a gun is far too generous. Lol.
141,Yeah I'm sure all the companies that arent hiring you are all going under lol
142,[deleted]
143,Those who went to private “elite” liberal arts colleges have over $150k in debt
144,"Studio apartment?  You rich? Shit son, thats goals.  I’m living in my brother’s house.  Rent is crazy high."
145,"I’m in STEM and I hate the fucking circlejerk here. This is a straw man and does not cover the majority of the issue. Also, a world of entirely engineers would be a weird place."
146,"As a recent engineering grad, the world doesn't need more people who traded social skills for math. We're weird."
147,[deleted]
148,Wtf are people doing. How are they selling this?
149,"If you live in America or are familiar with their culture you’d know. 
They tell kids to “follow their passion”, promote ridiculous SJW ideas in the name of “diversity”, “equity” and “education”. 
Liberal arts colleges in USA also have stupid and useless majors like basket weaving, traditional african studies, women’s studies, art history, etc which will won’t land you a job anywhere except McDonalds or Starbucks. (And the students take them because “its mah passion! Follow mah passion it will make me successful!”) /s 


Its all clever marketing done to schoolchildren who have no idea what they’re signing up for.
Private universities already cost about US$60,000 a year and the prices are constantly rising. 
If you’re a European, considering yourself really lucky."
150,">I have no clue why you got downvoted for that

Because he used the term ""SJW"" as a pejorative, and comes off as gruff and insensitive."
151,"Went for a year, dropped out from networking. Was a rushed associates program. Now with girlfriend making right around 3k. Been making right around 3 for the last 8 years together. Kinda sucks, wish I would have had a support group but going at it alone and in the same year my dad had a heart attack, wasn't all there. Idk why I'm sharing."
152,26 years old here. Still living at home. Unemployed for almost two months because no one will hire me.
153,[deleted]
154,"I sleep under my desk at work, still can't afford rent :/"
155,"Holy fuck bro, I’m sorry you have to do that."
156,"have you checked your sources, are you sure  basket weaving is really a major or just a class...?🤷🏻‍♂️"
157,/r/lostgeneration
158,Computer Science isn't liberal arts.
159,"No, per month."
160,"$3,000 annually? Between two people?"
161,That’s how much I make....with a bio degree
162,Econ degree from a good school goes further than you think
163,"Right I was about to say ""30k.... how about 120"""
164,"As someone who actually went to a private elite liberal arts college, most people I know received significant financial aid and paid nowhere near that amount for tuition."
165,It took me 4 months of searching until I had a job after I was laid off last year. Hang in there!
166,Holy shit. My grandfather created a Reddit account. An original opinion and argument would be nice for a change.
167,"my old friend went to a super prestigious school on her trust fund wallet and got two degrees

*creative writing and women's studies*

she is going back a couple years later since she couldn't find a job in those fields"
168,"No, you're absolutely right. We were conditioned as young children to choose which university we should attend when half of us have no clue what to study, so we choose our ""passion."" It's really sad..."
169,Studios are 500+ around these parts and I think it's the cheaper end of the country. Idk how people are supposed to live out here.
170,I have no clue why you got downvoted for that... It's basically true. Those degrees will get you no where...
171,Yikes😅
172,Thank you for this. I start in September and it seems like everybody wants to tell you about the bad parts and none of the good ones.
173,Reddit is a depression circlejerk so I get that lol
174,"A lot of people don't have a corporate job lined up after college, but if you do, you can pretty much live this lifestyle. Just don't live at home if you can afford it. The extra money isn't worth it (to me). Oh and keep your commute to 20 minutes if you can. It will drastically improve your quality of life."
175,"Seeing how most of the post on this sub is kinda depressing, thanks for posting this.

Life after school is not all that bad"
176,"Thank God for some positivity. I joined this sub out of a desire for some answers to the question of ""now what"" but instead all I see is depression and self-pity."
177,This is good advice. But I'm currently living at home - saving up 20k for a down payment on a condo. I recommend that others do the same because a mortgage is an investment. Rent just goes to the landlord.
178,right? of course life after college sucks if you go straight home and sit on reddit for 4 hours each day. people need to take control of their lives.
179,"Yeah, I don't have depression, anxiety, am not socially awkward, just got a dope ass job after graduating that I start in a month in the city that I've dreamed of living in since I was 16 (am 27 now), got a fiancee that loves and supports me, getting married in a few months, and overall almost always happy. I feel like if I posted any of that anywhere, I'd get downvoted for not being depressed or anxious and it sucks."
180,It'S aLl AbOuT nEtWoRkInG!
181,[deleted]
182,"I mean the issue is getting the job in the first place. I was unemployed for a year after graduation, and definitely wasn’t just sitting on reddit. Would’ve killed for a corporate job 1 month after graduation."
183,"Not a bad plan! General advice I heard is you need to own a place for at least 5 years before it nets positive and I don’t think I’m there yet.

Renting isn’t bad though. You’re basically paying for the convenience of never having to fix anything. Plus with how high property taxes are in my city + interest + maintenance, you’re not really losing much to renting if you’re investing your principle into the stock market instead."
184,No sadness on my Christian thread lol. It was my job in college to revise papers and fix resumes/cover letters. Drafted plenty from scratch. Let me know if you need any help.
185,God forbid we get a little positivity here. This sub is depressing as shit most of the time. Can’t wait to not be broke and to be doing what I’m interested in.
186,"Thank you for this, I went this path and genuinely enjoy my 9-5. I’m happiest when I have a routine, and my job helps structure my life."
187,I'm hoping to bring some positivity to this sub because I love life a lot
188,"haha. this was just a response post to the sadboy one. can't see ""feeling distant from your college friends"" in only a month either.

edit: this is my moment to soapbox about wilderness backpacking. amazing hobby - so many stars you won't believe your eyes. cheap to start. and can be done in a weekend."
189,"1) Start applying well before graduation. A few months at minimum 

2) Have an idea of who you'll be using as your references

3) Create your resume or cover letter. Have someone look over it for glaring errors. Make sure your resume bullet points focus on skills like teamwork, leadership and not just ""I worked the register"" 

4) If your school has a partnership with Handshake, apply to jobs there first. Employers there recognize that you probably lack a ton of experience and are looking for new graduates.

5) Indeed. If you get a voicemail or email apply promptly. Companies are really fast to hire.

6) Know that you may not be making bank in your first job. But you can still do everything in this starter pack and you will be happy (:"
190,Fuck yeah
191,I feel attacked.
192,"I'm 29, and I look back on the 1-2 year post-college period very fondly. Living in a shitty studio apartment, not making good money but it was all my own for the first time -- the amount doesn't matter as much when you have very few expenses. Making a few new friends and living completely on my own for the first time. Even if you're not rolling in dough it can be a great time."
193,"Lmao you’re like the poster boy for lifestyle expansion. 

One paycheck and you’re lounging in resorts in foreign countries getting drinks brought to you?"
194,What major? I just graduated as a CS major and it was hard too. Landed a job at one of the big 4 and I'm starting at six figures. I shit myself when I got the offer tbh. Never expected this after school.
195,"$1.5k credit card from being foolish. Other than that, none"
196,"To offer another perspective, I think living at home can be very worth it. 

If you don't get charged rent (or don't get charged a lot), you can aggressively put money towards paying off student loans or other debt, building up general savings, or starting or continuing a retirement fund, as a few examples. 

I'm fortunate that my family has also been pretty easy to live with and I usually genuinely enjoy being around them, so every family and situation can be different."
197,"Firstly, congrats! Secondly, how’d you land the job after school? I’m finishing uni in about 2 years but want to be prepared and walking out knowing I’m walking straight on the path to a nice life"
198,A month after graduation? Seems like either an anomaly or reckless spending tbh

203,I second this entirely. Started picking up Japanese just to study something. It has been the best hobby I've ever had. Learning something new every day really helps curve that right-out-of-college feeling. Plus I've met a number of Skype pen pals which has been fun too.

224,"The surge of anger that goes through me every time I upload my resume only to scroll down and see four or five 'Employment History' sections is truly unmatched.

230,"This actually happened at my job.  Saw an ad for "" production manager"" at the shop I work at, except we don't have one, and my boss and I specifically talked about why we don't have one and how everyone manages their own production and just steps all over everyone.  He said there was no way he was hiring a ""production manager"" to make sure the three sales people arent running roughshod over the shop personell and stopping work on other jobs, so theirs can go out.

I got fired 3 days later after seeing a guy come in and interview for the nonexistent job....he was sitting in my chair, and running my jobs when I came to pick up my last check the next week.....he was not a "" production manager"" according to anyone I spoke to in the shop after I left.  He simply sat in my chair, and changed the name on the profile in the computer from mine to his on the job tracker."
231,"Just out of curiosity, wtf do the people ask at a 4 panel interview?"

As in, how do you go all the way towards a goal while also avoiding the pitfalls that come with going all the way in one direction. I think 90% of the questions were in this format. The list of questions gave each member of the panel something to do."

243,"I once applied for a job that was for Administrative Assistant for a mall. More specifically, it would have been for their security office.

I go in to the interview only to be told the job was already taken, but that he wanted to hire me as a guard/supervisor for less pay. In addition, I'd have to go take a two day class uncompensated. I just walked away.

Fuck employers who do that. Things like that is why I just do the bare minimum everywhere I go. (Funny enough, I actually did go into security and now spend my nights fucking around on my Switch and on here.)"

Let’s say you were applying for a position where you have to work with different departments. They may have the person you will report to, two people from other departments you will work with, and then one person with no connection to your job. Your potential supervisor has the greatest say, but they may want the input of your coworkers to see if they think you can work together.

251,"**[360-degree feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree feedback)**

A 360-degree feedback (also known as multi-rater feedback, multi source feedback, or multi source assessment) is a process through which feedback from an employee's subordinates, colleagues, and supervisor(s), as well as a self-evaluation by the employee themselves is gathered. Such feedback can also include, when relevant, feedback from external sources who interact with the employee, such as customers and suppliers or other interested stakeholders. 360-degree feedback is so named because it solicits feedback regarding an employee's behavior from a variety of points of view (subordinate, lateral, and supervisory). It therefore may be contrasted with ""downward feedback"" (traditional feedback on work behavior and performance delivered to subordinates by supervisory or management employees only; see traditional performance appraisal), or ""upward feedback"" delivered to supervisory or management employees by subordinates only.

264,"“Hey, person I haven’t spoken to in over a year! I know we’re currently in the midst of a worldwide pandemic and dealing with the aftermath of an attempted coup, but I was wondering if I could connect with you on LinkedIn so you can help me find a job?????????”"
265,"I get a message like this once in a while and I have to explain quite a bit. But let me try to do it in as short a manner as I can
I hold 3 degrees, Math, Computer Science, MBA. I’ve worked in IT for 13 years. In my 20s, I held two jobs at a time. Sometimes 3. I’ve always had side gigs. I’m always doing multiple things to generate income. I make good money in my job, I’ve earned it. I keep my spending low very low for what I make.

I take time that I have free (which isn’t much but I try) to create content for people so that they can have something I didn’t - an honest teacher/mentor. I fumbled my way through life because no one would teach me. I worked very hard for where I’ve gotten. And I see nothing but “get rich quick!” Or guys like you who are really disrespectful without a reason because of their own biases in life. So, I deal with it and keep in mind that even though what I’m teaching is not for u, messages and encouragement from others say that others appreciate it. Especially because I don’t sell anything and what I’m saying isn’t gambling such as stock picking or options trading or margin trading. 

So, now let me explain what I do: I am what’s called “an INDEX INVESTOR”. My portfolio is 90% indexed and 10 whatever I want to do. A market index means I “buy almost all stocks in America and the world” to avoid picking and choosing stocks. This allows me to claim a portion of the American GDP without gambling. 

Ok lastly, if you don’t like or truly understand investing - I understand. There are many like you, which is why I teach. Your bias is the reason the American wealth gap is so large and if I, an immigrant who started with less than 0 (ie debt), can do it - I thought I could certain teach something to someone to try to get their situation up and hence help close the wealth gap. And while I’m at it, maybe I can eventually create a side business out of my YouTube channel where ads or sponsorship can generate some income. Who knows if this will be worth it. I’ve been at it for a long time and YouTube hasn’t still monetized. But hopefully soon. I work hard on these videos.I’ve done it for years. 2020 I worked super hard. Each video takes me 5-8 hours. Multiple days to edit. But I don’t get paid yet for them. But I’m patient and that’s a quality that I have which is how I’ve gotten to where I am. 

In closing - I understand you don’t get what I do and you are jaded. But, even now that you have been completely nasty for no provocation at all, if you ever need to understand HOW to actually build wealth and do it safely, I’m here to teach through my various social media. And just like for everyone else, it’ll be free for you too."
266,"Ok ok guys listen and listen closely. Lol this was a funny meme. Ok ok. 

I got into the job market when the economy was crashing last decade.
I sat on my ass for six months. Then, I realized that no one was going to come and save me. I had to get very uncomfortable and jump into things which I had no idea how to do. I was fucking terrified. It was so bad that I couldn’t even understand what the hell my coworkers were talking about. I used to record them on recorders and listen to those recordings while I was going home. I would listen to the recordings like two or three times to understand what the hell they were saying. 

Some of you will have this epiphany that you are The only one who can help yourself. And a certain portion of that group will actually get fed up enough to actually go out there and hustle. And then, a certain portion of that group will actually become successful.

And, while all this is happening, don’t think that you are going to be very confident and that you’ll know what to do at every single point. It’s always going to be an unknown and it’s always going to be scary. Sometimes it might even be terrifying. But, those of you who overcome this will actually make it. And those of you who don’t, will go into old age hating money, hating rich people, perhaps even hating society. And a few unlucky one of you will actually “hate the opposite sex“ - a terrible place to be in. 

If you want to make a difference, if you don’t want to be living your life that is led by the economy rather than you taking a hold of it; then, you really have to get into gear. You have to do stuff that you have not done before. 

You need to learn to negotiate with people. You need to find jobs that pay a lot. You need to start side gigs. You need to invest your money. You need to work two jobs or three jobs if you have a low paying job. You got to do what you need to do to get ahead. 

Now, I understand if this is not for you. And that is perfectly valid and OK. You will live a fine life if you don’t do all this stuff. But, just remember that decision so that later on in life you don’t look back or look at other people and complain about your own life. If you’re happy with your life as is that is 1000% OK. 


Anyhow, if you want to ask questions, I already have tons of content on tiktok/YouTube about how to land a job how to negotiate but I’m doing more every day. Good luck

268,"But then when they don't have school, you're at your job. I remember getting my first job after graduation, and so many times I called someone and instantly dropped the call because they're at school, and so many more times they called me while I'm at my job"

I say cactus making, because that’s what I walked in on the other day! It’s precious how happy these old ladies all are about their little artistic creations. 

Meanwhile, modern society is being taught “there’s no money in artistic expression” 

That my friends, is how art dies. That is how our creative genes get destroyed. Someday, there will be no true artists left because we’ll stop appreciating artists for who they are. True creators. 

You know what an amazing expression of art is in these modern days that I think doesn’t get enough attention? Folks doing stuff like [Johnathan Symmonds ](https://jonathansymmonds.com/about/). If you have to stop and think “Who the hell is this dude?!” that’s the problem right there..."

349,"If the Dems win the White House and the Senate, I would put it at least 50/50 no matter who which democrat wins the presidency, higher if Warren is pres or VP. But I would also say that —if they don’t do something like Elizabeth Warren’s plan—within the next 10 years, the government is going to have to take drastic action on student loans because the bubble is going to burst soon and they’ll have to bail us out. But I think the Democrats are going to go ahead and address it as a progressive move to redistribute wealth and boost the economy.

And if $50,000 wouldn’t do it for you, that puts you in that 5% that wouldn’t have their debt immediately erased. Which sucks, and I hate it for you. But still: having $50k forgiven is no small thing (assuming you will be making less than $250k per year if the plan goes into effect, which...I hope you are if you’re taking that much debt for college). That would take years off your repayment."

357,Do you have a response to my argument?
358,I smell an agenda
359,That going back to college in your 70's is a bad idea?
360,[deleted]
361,"I totally agree with that. I just don’t agree in the way many people are using the word “forced”. That makes it seems that people are being physically forced or forced in some other way against their will. They are being incentivized, but they certainly are not being forced to do so against their will since they decide of their own accord to do so. In the end, it is entirely their decision."
362,"That is one of the problems, the government caused the student loan crisis. The government chose to back any and all privately issued student loans causing private lenders to lend to anyone, causing colleges to accept more and more people. Since more and more people earned degrees companies raised the entry required higher to account for the new normal causing more and more people to feel “forced” to get a college degree. Yet again, the government is the problem, but it takes two parties to tango.

If you think the government can fix a problem they have caused you are in for a surprise.

Plus, if you are thick enough to go to school for a gender study’s degree, you probably deserve to be in debt and in economical bondage for the rest of your life."
363,"What can I say, I got the reaction I was looking for."
364,Sucks to suck I guess. But it’s not my problem.
365,How is that forcing them? You should never complain about something that was your decision. Shifting the blame on others won’t help anyone. No one was forced to go to college.
366,Yeah no doubt. I would have never if there was a way around it for my career.
367,Man at some point we're gonna need PHD's to get an entry level position. At some point everyone is going to be too educated with more than 100k in debt trying to fight for a 60k salary. I see this happening with psychology but fuckkk this shit is gonna get saturated and ugly.
368,Yeah Education Administration is not an undergrad major. I’m in a masters program.
369,"Same! I got to my last semester and since I’m in a non-thesis program, I was readying myself for the comprehensive exam. But then I found out I can’t take it this semester because I failed to fill out and turn in a form in *September of last year,* a full six months ahead of the exam in March. 

So now I have to wait for the next one in October, and I barely got that form in on time because it was due 7 months in advance. Pure asshattery, because all the info they needed I got from looking at my transcript that they also have."
370,"It's definitely not something I'd shun. I want to try my hand at sales first, concurrently I really want to dabble in net sec.

 Mind you, I absolutely love learning. I just hate school."
371,What is your field of study/career if you don't mind me asking?
372,It will and then trades will become more popular. As a high school teacher I see a much larger portion of the graduating population seeking alternatives to college. You’d be shocked how much high school kids learn from our college debt memes.
373,"Valid, I am the same way and I think it is due to the stress of school and the stress I put on myself. I perform very well but at a cost."
374,"I don’t think you’ll get to principle or superintendent without at least a masters, usually a PhD."
375,Ever tried a trade?
376,"I don’t know who I was talking to about this, but we jokingly said the bachelor degree is the new associate degree.  

In many, if not most fields, this speaks a lot of truth. 😞"
377,It’s ridiculous how fast and easy the process is if you “know a guy”. Like half of the postings companies put out are filled before they even begin interviewing so they know you’re wasting your time before you even show up.
378,"Or, better yet, step 1 create account, step 2 fill out a long series of questions about your qualifications, step 3 upload resume and transcript, and step 4 explain your relevant experience after being explicitly told not to reference your resume."
379,They want to see if you keep your story straight.
380,"One is for the employer to read (step 1)

The other is for their searching program to find keywords, phrases, etc. to get you to the point where the employer reads it. Instead of someone reading them all.

Not justifying it, just saying why it happens"
381,"**HOW** has the HR industry let this become a thing?? Are they so incompetent? Imagine if this happened in other fields. Like you go to the doctor and explain your symptoms fully. Then the person you were talking to leaves and the “real doctor” comes in. 

“Ok, I need you to re explain your symptoms to me.” 

-“Why? Didn’t I just say it to that guy?” 

“Oh yeah you did, but he’s not a doctor, he’s just here to hear your symptoms first.”

-“Oh... so can he give you the information then?”

“No, you have to explain all over again.”

-“Then what was the point of that guy?”

“That’s just how we do things. Do you want medical help or not?”"
382,"It's not even the HR, the people above are looking for the cheapest way of doing things, and then they're sociopathic enough to diminish months/years of unemployment and the impact it has on people's lives to a mild discomfort. ""We're not going to spend more money for a humane recruiting process just because this one makes people sad, go to any business meeting saying that and they'll just laugh their asses off""."
383,3 more months to go
384,I know. Hang in there. When are you finished school?
385,"as a CS grad, I was applying to a ton of tech-focused companies and all their resume things parsed it and filled the info in for me. I feel like the more tech savvy a company is, the more likely they are to have something that will take all the data from a resume to make their jobs easier."
386,I literally just finished one of these
387,I hate the application process.
388,"don't even bother with companies that do this shit, honestly"
389,Have a life outside of work?
390,">How you see your coworkers

I’m 29 and this hits hard. I just started working in a job where a bunch of my coworkers are 23-25. Hearing about younger twentysomething shenanigans makes me feel like those old folks."
391,Sounds nice if you have the energy for it
392,"Force yourself to eat well and exercise, it works wonders"
393,You’ll be eating those words before you know it.
394,"I’m nearly 30, and I subbed because I thought I could relate a bit with what people are posting and thought that I might be able to give a little advice.

This comment section though. Holy shit. It’s surprising that most people here are 20+ when the maturity level and thought process of the average poster seems to be a decade earlier than that."
395,"I hate to admit it but I see 29-year-olds as ancient. I imagine the age gap (7 years) applied the opposite direction. I have virtually nothing in common with a 15-year-old.

You guys have wives and children and mortgages. You’re halfway to redeeming your Roth IRA. You’ve been divorced from college for seven years so you’re used to it. I’m just getting started."
396,"In my experience, this isn’t accurate at all. This seems like what people who have seen “corporate America” on tv THINK it is like. 

Cubicle jobs aren’t physically demanding. So when you get off work, you have energy to do stuff after. You still have a life. I promise. 

Also you get vacation time. And a decent amount. You won’t miss out on vacations. 

Personally I can flex my time, meaning if I wanted to take a Friday and following Monday off for a three night getaway, I can work 10 hours mon-thurs and the following tues-fri. 

All your friends are partying now but you’ll be saving a shit ton of money in retirement, savings, health insurance, etc. You are set in the long run and are insured in the short run. 

You have $$$ (as long as you live below your means). Your friends are constantly checking their bank account to hope their night out didn’t over draft their checking account while you can do whatever you want (modestly) and not worry about it. 

You don’t have to be in the 9-5 world your whole life. Every year that goes by gets you more connections, experience, and life lessons. And you can explore other paths USING those instead or alongside your cube life. 

One of my co-workers is also a professional trumpet player. Another owns and manages her own salon. Another owns a bike shop. 

I enjoy cooking, playing board games, and traveling. I can do all three whenever I want and I can do it stress free. 

Life is what you make it, same with your job. But having a stable income with long term plans and goals isn’t a life sentence... it’s an opportunity."
397,"I know. I fear time. It comes too fast. I recall 17 like it was yesterday. Regrets and opportunities haunt me all day and night. It brings me shame to see people that age wasting their youth.

Stuck in the middle, I lack recourse. I’m telling people much younger than me to stop and enjoy it and I’m being told the same from people older than me. Countless 30-year-old coworkers have looked at me, bewildered, and said “why are you here?” not because I’m underqualified or incompetent, but because they see their own regrets about not enjoying youth in my present mistakes."
398,"Being 29 isn’t halfway to “redeeming your Roth IRA” lmao. 

7 years isn’t shit. You’ll be there in the blink of an eye. Good luck."
399,Honestly its cliche but your life is what you make it. Do shit after work. I moved to a city where I knew noone but I made friends and do stuff outside of work. If you dont want your life to be like this it really isnt that hard to change it
400,Do yall not have lives outside of work/on the weekends?
401,"“You guys have wives and children and mortgages. You’re halfway to redeeming your Roth IRA.”

Oh, honey."
402,How do you avoid the rising sun? It is an inevitability.
403,"It’s honestly sad, I would kill for a 9-5 setup."
404,"You describing 29-30 year olds as if they’re ancient, lost souls who spend every spare moment of their miserable lives lamenting their ‘lost youth’ kind of does the trick.

I’m embellishing your words, yes, but that’s honestly the mental picture I had after reading your comments in this thread. You just seem a bit out of touch."
405,"Its possible, but you need to try hard to do it"
406,I wish I could hating my life from home at 6 PM instead of hating my life in the office for another hour :(
407,Seriously. I do 8-7 now. It's so much worse
408,"If you start it at birth, which isn’t a thing. If you’re entering the workforce at 22.5, 29 is under 20% of the way there.

Might wanna work on those mathematics reasoning skills in between online pontification sessions my dude."
409,Did you start your Roth as a newborn? Lmao
410,"Same, this is not what I wanted to see rn"
411,I’m 22 and just survived my first week of work and this is sad and accurate. How do I keep from wanting to die? :)
412,"Meh. Im almost 34, been at a huge corporation for past 6 months. Up until 30 i was all-in on rock bands, tinder, and partying. Im married and my lifestyle has changed a lot, but my coworkers are young (either in actual age or at heart), smart and hardworking. Work hard and play hard (or go chill w my wife and cats and watch tv). Now im on week 2/2 chillin in Brazil. 

I stay sane by working hard, exercising hard, keeping time for my friends and playing in a band. Life was hard in 20s now its just different. 

Keep a good attitude, work hard and smart, take care of and keep time for yourself (and loved ones/hobbies). Make sure you have goals, not just pipedreams. 

Yall will be fine."
413,"But 22 isn’t really that different from 29. People aren’t physically developed at 15; they are much more developed at 22. There may be maturity differences across the spectrum from 22-29 but those come from life experience, it’s not inherent. You can find plenty of 22 year olds that are more mentally mature than 29 year olds."
414,[deleted]
415,"Depending on the city, a huge impact on the misery is commute. It has a surprisingly big effect on your mental state. Even a short commute is terrible during traffic time. And housing right in the city can be pricey."
416,"Meh I think OP was just over-exaggerating but I don't take it as ignorance. I'm 29, married with a kid and 401k. He kinda hit it on the head. I have a completely different mindset than some of the younger folks I work with. Not better or worse, just different. Conversely on the other end, I get along well with the baby boomers I work with but find it hard to relate at times and probably wouldn't hang out outside of work."
417,15 - 22 is not remotely similar to 22 - 29.
418,Bless his heart
419,Hey. You ok man?
420,Too real
421,Make yourself do a hard exhausting job and when you either get used to it or get so fed up you quit you will find that any other work is much easier ‘cause it ain’t “That awful shit”
422,Too real
423,"I mean, you could become a whisky taster or smth"
424,You do Charlie Work for the rest of your life
425,Keep coming back!
426,Too real
427,And what would that be?
428,"Sign me up for r/gatekeeping because I literally got sober right after graduation at 23. ""Too real"" frat bros don't even know."
429,"Grew up gifted too. I still have bad habits from thinking I can coast my way through everything but comparing myself to my elementary/middle/high school classmates who were also gifted gave me the extra push, despite the crippling pressure."
430,"I double-majored and went for my PhD. Turns out that luck is there major factor there. Quit with a Master's after 3 years of abuse. I have a job, so on the surface it looks like I'm doing well, but I feel pretty stagnant in life..."
431,"I was always in the gifted program at school. Graduated top of my class. Excelled in college, got a scholarship. Graduated summa cum laude while working full time in an extremely competitive field..... and I crashed. And realized that the only thing I’m good at is school. I don’t know if it’s because I’m actually smart or I just know how to play the game better than others. I don’t know if I can handle real life.  I’m not doing so great at it right now."
432,"Double major almost always looks silly to me rather than impressive. You find a lot them don't really compliment each other and one is pretty obviously just chosen because it interests the person. For instance an accounting professor of mine double majored in Accounting and Art History. Surprise surprise he never even tried to use the Art History degree. That's cool and all but with today's tuition, it's pretty stupid to do that instead of just majoring in Accounting and reading Art History in your free time.

I think Aziz says it best:

>You know what my big plan was? I was gonna go to college and major in Business and Biology. That was the plan. First I hit you with the business and you think it’s all done. And then I come back– Boosh!– Hit you with the Biology. What was I gonna do with this stupid double major?! Sell organs on the black market very efficiently?"
433,[deleted]
434,"I think my biggest problem was that in elementary/ middle/ high school I could do the absolute bare minimum and I was considered to be going “above and beyond” so any sort of struggle after that, it’s like I didn’t know how to cope. One mistake made me feel like an idiot. Here I am about to graduate undergrad, and while I did decent, I have such a bad understanding of what the right amount of hard work is, while not mentally burning myself out for wanting to keep up with this idea of my “potential”. It’s why I’m not going to grad school straight away, and my family’s a little mad about it. 

But yeah, it’s normal to grow up and be like “oh shit I’m not that special”. And honestly? For me that’s a good thing. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses so at this point I’m just trying to find my little niche in the world that maybe I’m decent at, but more importantly I don’t hate life. Don’t beat yourself up about it, I know I’m still learning to be a little nicer to myself now and then."
435,We’re in the Endgame now.
436,Like 90% of people in gifted classes with me now have shit jobs or sells drugs. Im pretty sure we are all just autistic af bro.
437,"I think thats how everyone feels man. Just go with the flow, don't worry."
438,"You have a point, but sometimes (I think often) it doesn’t cost any more to get a second major. By their senior year of college some people, especially those “overacheivers” who got dual credit from high school, have extra room in their schedule and it’s between taking fun classes just for fun or taking fun classes and getting another major while they’re at it."
439,"It's a learning curve and too many years in school and not the real world can warp what we believe the workforce will be. The sudden lack of structure can be jarring, especially when the environment shifts to a focus on results instead of classes and testing. Keep pushing and you will adapt, it's all about having the drive to learn what is  expected of you and to perfect your task to a T."
440,r/aftergifted
441,Yeah I think a lot of high schools (unintentionally) blow smoke up your ass by making you think you're hot shit but in reality they just have to dumb everything down due to lack of budget and pushing kids across the stage.
442,"Yes, definitely. I was an overachiever elementary-high school, then barely scraped by in college"
443,I’m extremely lazy but I have always been “gifted”. I’m close to graduating summa cum laude right now. I wish I knew how I did it.
444,"That doesn’t necessarily carry over to the professional world, which is the entire point of this post.

School is designed to push you upwards. All you have to do is float - and if you float well, you’re at the top of the pack!

If you float in a professional setting, you’ll just sit there. No one cares if you move up or not."
445,Yup. You are not alone.
446,"I always did well till sophomore year of high school, and after that it all just went downhill. I graduated med school in last September and I don’t know anything about medicine. Went through all my clinical rotations without having a clue of what was going on. I don’t even know if I chose the right field anymore."
447,"Unfortunately I’m a useless human being and I can’t offer any solid advice, but I just wanted to let you know that this is exactly to a capital T how I feel right now, so please don’t feel like you are alone. I’ve always felt like I really wasn’t as capable as people thought I was (Impostorism sucks..) so I stick to the one game I can actually play which is school. People think I’m amazing for going for my doctorate when really I’m just too afraid to be out in the real world.  Mental hugs 🤗"
448,"It can be a curse. A whole family that praises you for having so much 'potential', and being 'so intelligent' that they all assume you can take care of yourself and do not require any attention from any adult. By the time I realized that being clever and having a good memory for facts is not intelligence, I'd already basically screwed my own life up by simply assuming I was the smartest person in the room any where I went."
449,"Yep, me in a nutshell. All A’s through elementary & mid school, Top 5% in high school, barely holding onto a 2.8 in college for a fuckin sociology & psych degree (the easiest paths my university offers)."
450,Omg yes
451,I never was in gifted and always felt extremely left out.  Now I am mature enough to know that it didn’t really mean a single fucking thing and I feel great
452,Story of my life
453,"yup, you find out that you’re super average when you get to college. College slaps you hard."
454,"I’m the opposite sort of. Started out gifted, midway through middle school I started failing my classes because I was incredibly depressed and anxious, started my sophomore year of high school with a 1.9, but managed to finish my junior year with a 3.1 after taking all APs and graduated early. Went to a community college, and decided I wanted to be a doctor. Transferred to my large state school, failed out because my mental health issues peaked again, got medicated, settled on nursing school as an obtainable goal and now I’m finishing my BSN :) the path is never linear"
455,"Oh what could have been. I was a ""gifted"" child from elementary to early middle school. I was always a few steps ahead of other students, like I just soaked up every scrap of information teachers and books could give me. 

In middle school, my parents told me that Dad has ADHD and since it is hereditary, I probably have it too. So they started buying books and giving me ""natural remedies"".

My mother never once applied anything from those books. I know, because I actually did read them. Most of what she did with me was the opposite of what the books all advised. Then she spent over $100 on some natural bull crap and of course it did absolutely nothing. 

I spent all of high school knowing I was pretty dang smart, but feeling like a loser because I couldn't quite keep up with my smart friends.

It wasn't until just a while ago, in my late 20's I finally sought out a formal diagnosis of ADD and medication. I'm like a new person entirely. I can focus, I get shit done, I remember important things. To top it off, an IQ test is part of diagnosis, so now I have proof I'm pretty dang smart. It's incredible and I do resent my parents more than I would ever admit to them for not taking my ADD seriously."
456,r/beatmetoit
457,"Yeah! Mine was less through school, though. I was a shit student all the way through my master’s but was always good at hands-on learning so I excelled out of school. I tried starting companies that never took off but got better at marketing. With each job, I got a few more tools in my kit and just landed a dream job from In California (moved here two days ago from Florida).

I still feel like I have no idea what I’m doing but putting forth 100000%. Somehow, that seems to  be working for me.

Bro/sis, keep giving whatever you do all you’ve got. You’ll feel like you’re stumbling but nah be moving forward. My life has basically been a game of bowling with the bumpers on it. I’m a shit bowler but somehow still knocking pins. 

You got  this!"
458,I don’t want to be a doctor that kills patients but I’ve also invested too much money and time on this to do anything else.

466,Sounds like he needs to move.
467,"I remember those days. My work start time has been getting progressively later and later as my career has gone on; I used to have to be at work by 6, now I don’t have to be at work until 9:30. I still wake up at 6 though, but now it’s more getting myself into a good frame of mind before I’m out the door than a mad rush to leave for work by 530. Fingers crossed it gets better as it goes along!"
468,At least it’s Friday 😁
469,"I start work at 5 am lol... I get up at 3:45 am and curse my life. Oh my god.

474,I’m a supervisor at Starbucks. I always say that I wake the world up on time. So I’m up early so they can be on time hahaha

487,We're really looking for someone with more retail experience
488,"I have a bachelors degree, getting my masters and have food and bev experience and didn’t get a job at a local coffee shop..... it really do be like that"
489,And they’ll say “you’re overqualified” or “we’re looking for someone with more retail experience”
490,I love that advice. Eye opening for me
491,"By college do you mean ""college college"" or university?

Because university pretty much only teaches you about theory. Very little about practice (unless you do some labs, of course)."
492,4 year university w/ a lot of labs
493,"I have a professor who is realistic and always tells us if we don’t know something on the job, you’ll just google it lol"
494,"As another poster said, college is not a job training program. College is where you begin to specialize your knowledge and learn how to learn in a field. The way a computer scientist learns and the way a biologist learns are different. In college you don’t learn how to be a C developer or car designer, you learn how to be a software developer or an engineer. The difference is that the latter are individuals who, although they may lack knowledge about a specific task, are a part of the discourse and therefore can learn quickly how to perform a task. 

For example, if you get a finance degree, you learn all about the terminology, common practices, and general ins and outs of finance, but you are not trained to consult General Motors in their supply chain management finances. With your knowledge of finance basics and jargon, you can learn about supply chain management of automotive manufacturers much faster than someone without an education in finance."
495,"I’m only a high school intern so take this with a grain of salt, but the engineers I work with told us on the first day that google will be our greatest tool throughout our careers, and that time spent on google learning is not time wasted."
496,"Really nice advice, thank you. Been looking in that way always as well, well said by your dad."
497,"College is not where you learn information, it's where you learn how to source information effectively."
498,Plot twist: the engineer you work for is OP
499,"Ah, so trade schools in the U.S."
500,Coding 101: How to use google effectively
501,"Here in Canada, at least where I am from, terminology is different. 

College here refers to a college where one learns manual, practical work related to trades for example, whereas university strictly refers to the theoretical aspects of a field of study."
502,"Thats actually a really good skill.

&#x200B;

When I started my career 4 years ago a lot of people were amazed on how quickly I was able to do something or answer dumb questions.  The ""how to"" google search is a skill that older generations lack."
503,Best advice I’ve ever hear!  Your father is brilliant.
504,What do you mean by college college? Like a liberal arts college?
505,"In my experience, uni will give you basics in the field, so you can understand anything is based on them and gives you very general sense of what actually working in the field is like. 

Other part of earning a degree is to show off how much can you learn under pressure and how you cope with stress that comes with it.  It's a warrant for the employer that you'll be able to learn things and perform well under stress. Learning is a big part of anyone's job."
506,"This reminds of a story about a new graduate who started working at a company with mostly older people. They gave him some sort of recognition/award for being so proficient at all the tech issues at the company. He confessed to his boss that he just googled everything to find solutions.  The boss told him that THIS is what makes him special. His ability and willingness to go search for the answer and actually find it is what set him apart.  Our generation might google everything, but we forget that this is actually a major skill that can differentiate us from older people in the workforce.  Our ability to use the right phrasing and critical thinking to sort through all the potential results to find the correct answer is incredibly valuable and should not be looked down on!  Keep googling. ."

If you're just going to get a bachelors....I would highly avoid biology and lean towards engineering or computer science. Starting pay for biology grads is garbage and usually entry level lab stuff is the most common thing people go into if they want to work in the same field as their degree. Can find better pay if you decide not to work in bio/science at all and just go find normal office jobs, which kind of defeats the point of having taken so many difficult science courses and learned a lot of things you will never apply."
554,Go to school and study something that is actually useful?
555,As an engineer you have to have great problem solving skills. School is a way for you to learn those skills while learning relevant information to what you want to do. You might even find a more specific area within your major that interests you. When your working as an engineer people generally expect you to be able to solve problems others can’t. A lot of people wouldn’t learn the skills necessary for this without school. Can’t really speak for other majors.

Now I’m just living day to day, miserable at work, with a gun perpetually aimed at my foot (figuratively), waiting to make another poor decision."

631,"I had an occupational therapist come to my work and he described this as part of the “stress funnel.” When you’re in the stress funnel, if you don’t recognize it, you can sink deeper into the funnel and start neglecting more and more things in your life. First it might be hobbies, but then it could become eating regularly or seeing friends, or even just generally taking care of yourself.

He said the best way to get out of the funnel is to recognize it’s a problem and make an effort to pull yourself out. Even if they don’t bring you much joy at the beginning- start making time to take care of yourself and do the things you once loved to do. 

Prioritize self care because ultimately, that will make you happier, which often leads to better performance at work (which is often the goal when you are stuck in the funnel)."

670,"A degree on its own is nothing but a useless piece of paper, it’s all about the person behind the degree. When you decide to go to college, you have to realize your making an investment, all investments are risks there is no guaranteed reward. However, what you can do is stack the odds in your favor by doing your research, seeing how you can get the best payout from this investment. You have to make an effort to build an industry specific resumè and pursue internships and connections while your in school so you can hit the ground running come graduation time. You can’t just expect company’s to want you because you graduated from college with a four year degree , almost anyone can do that. You have to put in the extra research and work beyond what it takes to get your diploma if you want that job so bad. It’s honestly depressing seeing all these lost souls not put in a shred of effort and pointing at people with any hint of success and saying they don’t deserve it and making excuses for themselves. Because all you can see is that successful person up there doing better than you. You never got to see all the work they put in to get there you only notice them when they have more than you and it makes you feel inadequate about yourself but rather than changing and putting in the shit load of work it takes to get there people will in the end just decide to complain because it’s far easier than trying to make it themselves, it gives them an easy out."

Why are you okay with high school being free then?  Shouldn’t we charge teens?

But there’s a difference between being lazy and just focusing on school.  College is hard work even w no job or even a part time job.  

What you did is almost inhumane.  You need more sleep that 6 hours a night. Plus you probably barely had time for fun, socialization, etc.

We aren’t alive to pay bills and die.

I genuinely wish you had a better time in college where you were well-rested and not overworked.  

Where you had fun and thrived.

I wish that for everyone."
713,Good point. I can't think of any way that people with bachelor's degrees have ever improved their own lives or their communities.
714,That looks comforting and terrifying at the same time
715,"Okay well if you fall and get hurt, make sure you're insured bud."
716,"Safeguard your integrity, be responsible and accountable. After so many fuckups people stop giving you shots so take your time and pay attention at each job. Everything you learn write it down, eventually that list will come in handy. I’m 34 that’s what I’ve learned. Now I’m actually using it."
717,You understand at the end you die right?
718,You have to position YOURSELF for success brother. Others can only help so much.
719,"Reminds me of the last scene of The Truman Show :,)"
720,A lot of hard work for a vastness of monotonous nothing.
721,Such a daunting task to write your own story. I’m trying though.
722,"It was society. If I could live my life freely and not have to worry about money, I would follow art and nature at my own pace for my own satisfaction. Unfortunately it doesn’t pay well to wander around surfing and not filming it or writing about it. And I like a house with a bed and an hvac system. And I don’t like farming. So here we are. Stuck together working to pay those bills until we die with a few intermittent moments of living. Followed by extended periods of existing. It’s not that it’s even that bad. It’s just boring and I definitely don’t feel like I have complete control over my own destiny when I finished school as this picture suggests."
723,Truth
724,I wish this was how it was. This indicates that you have a blank slate of which you can write your own destiny after school. That’s not true at all. A more appropriate picture would be getting to the top after high school and some big asshole is waiting there to push you down another pit on the other side of the top of the wall. And that happens every time you climb out of one. Unless you climb out of one with a ton of money and then you can be the one to push people back down in holes.
725,Yeah that’s why we’re running fast
726,"Jesus, who hurt you? 

You viewed leaving high school from college as someone pushing you down a pit? Was it not your decision to go to college, then your decision to go to a certain college, then your decision to major in a certain major?"
727,Lmao I thought the guy was heading toward the steps from the open area. Like it was all easy growing up but now it's all downhill from here
728,"Well I guess in the sense of wanting to jump around and never work, you don’t have full control.

I viewed this more as a career path destiny, as that’s what most people intend to do after graduating. I’m pretty sure if everyone could live freely and not pay for food, housing, transportation etc, we’d all be doing something different. I wouldn’t exactly group myself into the “stuck” category with you, either. As I don’t share the same mindset."

736,"Was this posted years ago with the title ""Graduation""?"
737,Not in this subreddit

739,ok boomer
740,I did this! Best decision I ever made. You’re gonna kill it.
741,"Aw! You look so happy. Congrats, kiddo! You made it!!!"
742,Thought this was r/roastme and the wholesome comments threw me off guard
743,Congratulations!! What an achievement! I wish you all the best in your future endeavors!!!
744,Congrats! The world really opens up and gets a TON bigger after you graduate! It really will be a whole new chapter :)
745,hahah yes still am. thanks for the kind words. four years of oppression won’t go to waste
746,"Remember this post in a few years in the future just to see how much have you grown over the years. This photo is the start of your own journey, dont be scared, you will be fine"
747,Doing it right! Good luck!

749,Congratulations man! Best of luck to you!
750,Good luck!
751,i’ll prob repost this to r/roastme i’m new to reddit so I started scrolling through it and I thought it was hilarious hahah. Def a different community lol
752,thank you! I had a few downfalls throughout HS but none of them matter anymore. Just looking forward to having a better future
753,High school
754,What must you do to be qualified as an EMT?
755,"Life is full of all of the above. Make the best of it and don’t forget to learn from mistakes.  It’s okay to make mistakes. 

Congrats!"
756,"Mostly physical tests, the basics of first responders, and a couple state tests depending on where you’re from. there’s a couple programs that can make this whole process a lot faster. A quick google search will give you a couple options depending on the state you live at"
757,Mistakes are actually pretty good. You learn reeeally quick from them if you're smart about it!
758,"Congrats man, I don’t know you or what life has to offer you. But I’m sure life will work out just right for you."
759,"hahah that’s what I hope. I’m looking forward to all the new experiences, friendships, relationships, downfalls, and overall just want something new and exciting."
760,Thanks! knowing myself i’m gonna need it hahah
761,"Probably because they know that the students who apply for it are gonna be like 40k in debt once they graduate lol. FAFSA does this awesome thing of helping people through college but sometimes they say people make “too much” to qualify for student aid when really they don’t make enough to even have a decent life paying all their bills, so they get you that way too if that makes sense lol"
762,The federal agency for student aid I believe it stands for. It’s something that students fill out with their tax and income info and then the government decides if they qualify for loans or scholarships/grants. Of course with lots of interest :)
763,Why does it look as shocked 😅
764,Who fafsa
765,"European, can’t relate"
766,Exactly!
767,Damn.
768,Is this Facebook? The reacts are so weird lol
769,Looks like LinkedIn.
770,So true
771,"Well, he also says it's about self awareness. Not everyone has to do the same, if you're happy with where you are in your life, how does it matter?"
772,"So, what to do then? I am fresh out of college, 22, got a really good paying job. What should I risk for if I have a job that will allow me to travel, have what I want and so on?"
773,"While this is a true statement, it still makes me very anxious not to have everything figured out."
774," Thank you, I really needed to hear this today."
775,You got it.
776,Yeah that’s something I always thought growing up and the older I get the more I learn that it’s not true. And finding out that it’s not true actually does help more than I thought it would.
777,Maybe it's all downs.
778,I’m still trying to figure it out.
779,This is what I needed to read.
780,"No worries. We all need a little snap into the true reality of life sometimes. People of this world make it seem like you have to have everything figured out, but we’re all in progress. Just gather as much knowledge as you can from as many people as you can to form your own life, happiness, and world."
781,And all the dumbasses putting this on r/im14andthisisdeep
782,"I always say, times are changing this isn't the 1980s anymore. Its not a sign of failure to not have a mortage, a full-time job, marriage & kids by the time your 25. I hate to be negative, but that married couple you see on facebook, is heading for a divorce in a few years or so, or the guy who got the fancy job, can get laid off or he hates his job. Social media can make one feel like they aren't doing anything. I always thought that at 23, i should have it all but im still learning."
783,Gary Vee literally is my savior right now. Everyone needs to follow him.

____"
785,"This is so true. 😭 I feel like I just wanna go back to school now. The real world is scary, esp if you’re used to being cooped up inside your comfort zone."
786,"Feel you mate, although having spruced up my LinkedIn as well, it’s comical how many “achievements” I have when really it’s just doing the same thing over and over with the same title"
787,The people that post on LinkedIn are wankers don’t mind em
788,I had the same conversation with my friends recently. We agreed that LinkedIn is almost basically a circlejerk of people boasting about their achievements. Which is why I only use it for the job search function.
789,"I am less annoyed by Linkedin brags cause at least the purpose is more understandable there - you make yourself look good to get better jobs / salaries. Instagram feels more evil, trying to make others jealous, or showing off, cringy at best. (I use both btw so I’m guilty too) I do hate how everyone is Senior Executive Manager President of something on Linkedin. Does no one have real job titles anymore? It’s laughable."
790,Bro you got snared in network marketing. You got scammed
791,Now I understand why we read Lord of the flies in ninth grade
792,I used to feel that way. I deleted all of my social media EXCEPT for LinkedIn and reddit last year. I have to use LinkedIn for work research at my current job but other than that I don’t check it. After deleting Facebook and Instagram I realized how weird and sad it is to learn about people from afar without them telling you specifically. Almost like a peeper looking in through a window of their life. My mental health improved a lot when I got rid of stuff. I started caring less specifically. It’s easier heard than realized but you have to understand that no one puts negative things about them online. It’s crafted to look positive and more interesting than it is. How many times have we gotten a job we thought was our perfect dream job only to start the position and find out it’s boring and the workplace is toxic? When you get rid of social media you realize that the only thing you can compare yourself to is... yourself. Is you today doing better than you yesterday was? Then that’s success. Btw I graduated with a low GPA in my major and wasn’t invited into my majors honors society. Professors stopped liking me and thinking I was a successful person in the discipline. But I’m the only one in my major doing work in the Major without a graduate degree. The ones I know with a 4.0 are teaching English abroad or they got a job but it’s unrelated to what we studied.
793,I work in labor market economics and have to research employment and wage data. So I look at employees and employers a lot for work. The latest trend that I’m sick of is entrepreneurship. Being an entrepreneur used to mean that you had a good deal of capital and you started a successful company from the ground up. Now it means you started a craft brewing company and you brew beer out of your closet. Or maybe you wrote an app that no one has heard of and you employ four “developers” but hardly anyone gets paid. I cringe whenever I see it on dating apps now knowing what I know about the labor market. “I’m the CEO/CTO/CFO of Hazazz Inc. here’s some photos of me traveling to distract you from the fact that I’m not doing anything meaningful and I’m trying to sound cool because I can’t figure my life out besides deciding to quit work and start my own business. Just winging it. Wanna talk about Mach Picchu?”
794,This is good but now I hate you
795,Don't listen to the haters! *clap*
796,"I hate sounding like an old grouch, but I miss back when I was in high school and could just go up to where I wanted to work and be like, “are you taking applications?” And be handed one to fill out right there. 

Screw LinkedIn it feels like Tinder for jobs. Like I’ll finally find a job that matches my credentials, I’ll agonize a bit over what to say on all the questions, I’ll turn it in, and never hear a word back. 

I know, I gotta call and check on the application after a week or whatever, but it’s easier to do that if I’ve interacted with like, *any human being* before that point. Sometimes I’ll call to check and I’ll have to talk to yet another robot lol"
797,I work in labor market economics and I get so tired of trying to figure out what people are doing. Had two new occupations at two companies come across my desk the other day “Head Programming Evangelist” (They design software and networks) And “Lead Observation Designer” (They do QA in manufacturing for finished parts. Essentially an engineer)
798,This is so true. I temporarily deleted my Instagram earlier this year thinking it would make me happier but instead not having it made me so miserable because I wasn’t motivated at all to socialize or connect with people. Ever since I got it back things have been much better. Meanwhile seeing anyone’s job on LinkedIn makes me seriously envious and so insecure. Even the jobs that are available just reinforce yet another position that I wouldn’t get if I applied.
799,Why’s that?
800,"LPT - stop comparing yourself to your peers.  Start comparing yourself to last year.  How have you personally improved since last year?  

All good? If not what can you start doing now so you'll be doing better than last year's you?"
801,"That seems like the purpose of LinkedIn, doesn't it?  Keep people hungry? Push the idea that you haven't ""made it"" yet, regardless of your achievements?"
802,So tired of people complaining about social media and then continuing to use social media. You have a choice.
803,I deleted Instagram last July and have been more social and secure. My friends actually reach out to me more now that they don’t see me posting all the time. Everyone is different to things tho. Just do what works for you
804,So weird..
805,[There’s a recent slate article about this exact thing!](https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/linkedin-stalking-self-loathing-social-media-envy.html)
806,My friend is going to school to be a marine life researcher (hands on scuba diving in the ocean) and I’m going to be an elementary teacher and I can’t help but think about how cool her job is going to be with swimming with sharks discovering new things and I’m just going to be an elementary teacher in my hometown. She’ll be like “I discovered a new species today” and I’ll be like “A kid threw up in class today” I don’t know I just feel like my life is going to look so lame next to hers.
807,"Careers are a marathon not a sprint. Cliche but it’s true. I’m at the end of a successful 30-year stint at bulge bracket IBs. Honestly,  the best advice I can give you is don’t compare yourself to others or try to keep up with the Jones’s. Just do the best job you can do and keep focussed on what you want. With hard work, talent and some luck (we always need some luck) the success you want will come. I promise you that."
808,"Ehhh, I wouldn’t necessary say that’s the purpose of LinkedIn. I think LinkedIn is mostly for branding your professional accomplishments/experience to better connect with recruiters, industry colleagues, and potential business partners. But it certainly has that effect of motivating people."
809,"Eh, I think Facebook is Facebook for old people."
810,Hahaha yours is much better and closer to what people write!
811,Everyone on linked in seems to be head of something. It’s all bs.
812, LinkedIn makes me feel the most insecure. It's like I need to get a super career the moment my degree is done or I'm a failure :/
813,I still in college but stalking my friends my LinkedIn makes me so sad and and insecure. Especially the ones who were so average in high school that are doing such impressive things now. I know I shouldn’t compare myself to them but I just can’t help it
814,"Do you have access to any resources from school? Like a career services department, or maybe even seeing if you can use the writing center to critique your resume and cover letters?"
815,"I’m hoping so, feel that I need to be more proactive and confident and take my share."
816,We do. Last time I went they said everything looked great 😕
817,"Job search is a #s game. i am in charge of hiring for my company and sometimes we get so many resumes that i can’t review majority of them. If you can be persistent with job hunting, you will eventually find a better job."
818,"I feel this. Graduated in May with an anthropology degree, still just bartending and living off tips. However, I haven’t been actively searching for jobs so it’s sort of my fault. Idk bartending can be really good money. Last night I basically made $60/hr for 5 hours of easy work. I would like a regular 9-5 job though with consistent pay and benefits. It would be nice to have a weekend off for a change."
819,"When I die you know what’s gonna keep me warm buddy? That’s right, those degrees."

821,Wow an actual helpful comment other than “hang in there dude” or “you will be fine bro”
822,anthropology degree moments
823,Shoot pin it to the inside of my coffin I worked way too hard for that paper
824,Medical assisting is a great career to go for. Are you looking in areas outside where you live? There might not be a need around you but you could probably make a lot of money moving to a more remote area where healthcare workers are in higher demand.
825,"What do you mean by ""it wouldn't be difficult to get a job""? I was under the impression that it was hard to get good jobs with social science degrees. Mine's in linguistics, by the way."
826,That's the weird thing. I thought the same till the people I've interviewed with started saying it's been awhile since I've graduated and that they were concerned I have lost some of my skills.

829,"I'm ready for a FT job I'm tired of this ""casual job"" stuff honestly. Not enough hours or pay to make ends meet. Working anywhere from 7am to 1030pm. I'm 26 I'm too old for this mess and have done it for way too long."
830,"Try to talk with your friends or past professors to see if they know anyone that is hiring, or look online for networking events?"
831,How many jobs have you applied to in total? In some fields it takes hundreds of apps. One of my friends was an engineer and one of the smartest people I knew and she even had to apply to a shitload of places before landing something
832,I have. I'm going around 30mi or so out. There's alot of job openings about 50mi away but the pay isnt good either. So for instance I saw a position 50mi out but the pay was 11.00 an hour. I make 11.25 at my job i could just ask for a couple more hours and make what I would make there without the drive.
833,I'm going to meet some recruiters for the local hospital tomorrow so I'll try that while I'm there.
834,Dude I know what you mean. It’s been 4 years since I’ve graduated art school and I still can’t get a creative job :c. I’m working in IKEA currently in returns and it sucks but hey they’re raising the wage to $15.50 in December so that’s something at least.
835,I mean it’s a social science. It wouldn’t be difficult to get a job I just haven’t been looking
836,Yes that’s a great idea!! Give them a paper copy of your resume too. I’m in a different field (software engineering) but I think that networking is generally the same throughout. I wish you the best of luck!! You got this
837,I’m working but don’t know if it’s permanent and I’m like atleast it’s a break. Our time will come. We will make it work. We must. Hope.
838,Finding contacts/emails for recruiters is key. Once I actually had emails and sent my resume directly instead of thru the online app I had a lot better results
839,Moving for that first job may be a necessity
840,"You might need to move until you gain experience in the field. Either that, or tough out the drive for the first year or so.

You’ll be more competitive for jobs once you have 2 or more years experience under your belt. Then you can get the ones in the location you want"

845,"Yeah, but it was the ""half a bottle of Jim Beam fire alone on Tuesday evening"" type of drinking."

874,Yeah maybe because life after school is tough and this sub provides a resource for people and let’s them know that they’re not alone in navigating this period in life.
875,"There are so many things that through college I fell out of love with. Stuff that if I wasnt doing it each week I would be dying inside.   


But you mature and find new things to do, new hobbies, and sometimes you can walk back through things you loved, not quite doing them to the same intensity or preciseness, but still understanding why they are so foundational to that period of your life."
876,"I think it’s fine to not have direction, but you have to make an effort to find it. Try new things, fail, figure out what your good/bad at, what you like/dislike. You can’t just sit there and wait for opportunities to come to you."
877,"You'll get your love for reading back once you have more headspace and time in your life. The books aren't going anywhere, just dont forget about them"

879,"Am 33, reading becomes fun again.  It took a few years after school, but I enjoy it very much as an alternative to phones and reddit."
880,"I grew up right as computers and smartphones were just getting started.  When I was 8 only a few rich people had computers in their house, the library still used card catalogs and nobody had a cell phone.  At 19 everyone had a cell phone and a computer and everywhere you went had a website and used computers. 

When I was a kid I'd read a book or two a week.  Now not so much.  But I read a dozen articles linked here on reddit a night, and thousands of comments.  Nobody said everything you read had to be some classic or thought provoking piece of literature.  Just learning something new or getting another viewpoint is enough.  And today, we aren't just readers, we Tweet, comment, share, and put our own thoughts out there.  We are a part of the literature of our time.

So yeah, if a book sounds interesting to you then pick it up if you have the time, but don't let anyone make you feel less intelligent just because you haven't read the latest ""best seller""."
881,"Everyone will move away from the things they used to do. Sometimes you dont go back, but sometimes you can come back and remember what excited you about your hobby or interest in the first place.

When I was in high school I was always reading manga or watching anime. I loved doing it and I had time to do it. In the middle of college I got so burnt out on anime, because of work and school that I wasnt able to continue doing that. Now that I'm 2 years out of school and married, my wife and I watch anime all the time and its really enjoyable. I no longer can understand most of the japanese, nor do I put in the effort to do so, but I do enjoy it and with a more mature understanding we watch things that arent just garbage.  


Point is you might actually enjoy the things you enjoy now, but with a different frame of reference."
882,"are you sure bc i feel like starting work would just make me straight up depressed since i havent gained enough skills or a degree that would get me a job i wouldnt hate

i mean maybe youre right but i dont wanna be plunged deeper into feeling like shit"

884,"- haven’t been bent over and forcefully fucked by life yet. Wish it does not happen but you aren’t special, unique, or tougher than anyone."
885,That’s a general statement for all misfortune don’t you think? So you are telling me that you have no breaking point? Life could throw anything at you and your attitude would stay positive and you wouldent adopt any destructive behaviors? What are you hoping to contribute by telling people not to complain on the internet?
886,I hate the ending about the girl. Men who think girls will make them happy are dangerous. My high school bf who I loved killed himself when I left for college.
887,"Well why did you get a degree you hate? If it was an honest mistake then you just gotta start working to fix it. By “work” i mean start the hustle that is life. If that means getting a whatever job for a little bit then sure, but the key is to make a plan then hard charge after it.

I’m obviously not a therapist, but I think letting yourself get stagnant and freeze your personal growth will only hurt more. Just some food for thought"
888,"This is very true. All of high school/college I didn’t really read any books for fun, other than a couple during summers. But now that I’m out of school and just working, books have become a source of enjoyment for me again and I’ve been reading a ton just like I did when I was young. School can sometimes just make you feel burned out and the last thing you want to do is take in more information when that’s what you’re doing all day long. But when you’re done you don’t have that pressure and most learning you’re doing is stuff you want to learn, and on your own time."
889,It feels like there used to be more discussion and support posts. I like seeing people help each other out and make the most out of situations. This post isn’t explicitly bad but I think a lot of the responses in the comments are just wallowing instead of focusing on the positives or how to improve that situation
890,"Are you moving between different roles, networking with people, and trying new things within the industry? If you are, then good on you! Be patient; Contrary to common belief, most people don't just have a passion - they develop interest as they start to get better and better at things. Most people also don't start doing really good work until their 30's, and don't do great work until their 40's. 

If you're not trying new things within your field, then get started! Ask for new projects at work, meet new people in the office for coffee chats, reach out to people on LinkedIn and ask them about their jobs. You can't find your way if you're just sitting still, staring at a map; you have to walk, get lost, and find your way."
891,Does anybody really? Money doesn’t equal happiness. Some of the most miserable people I know are in finance.
892,"I believe the speaker is a woman, and is referring to her past, more driven self."
893,[removed]
894,"We all do that. I read tons in high school, tons when I finished. When I went back to uni for 5 years, I think I read one book the whole time and it was for work.

Forgive yourself. Required reading is bullshit, and who wants to sit down with a novel after that?"
895,What content are you expecting exactly?
896,You are kind of judging everyone else as weak and you superior don’t you think?
897,Damn I needed to see this today! Thanks for posting this OP
898,"yeah who knows maybe youre right, i guess every option is just bad and im not really happy that the least bad is the best possible choice i have"
899,"The laughing part hit me hard. I do that now. I’ve been wondering if this is how I’ve always been, but I don’t know. Maybe because my social anxiety has gotten bad since I graduated over a year ago and now I just go through the motions, playing human interaction safe and keeping my true self bottled in. I feel like everything I do and say is fake and I look at the world and feel like all human interaction is just fake bullshit as well."
900,Also school did just let out two months ago.  These are the toughest times for new grads
901,"thanks. that’s actually really important, and i hadn’t looked at it like that. i actually do really miss reading, but my degree is literally english literature... i should be realistic about how much i can read and how much i’ll be able to enjoy it when i’m also studying it full-time. thank you for the insight!"
902,Well I feel personally attacked
903,What’s so bad about a boring yet stable desk job that gives you time to do things outside of work?
904,"I used to be optimistic until my boss adopted the attitude of, “I can’t retire because everyone who retires dies within 2 years.”

So now I can’t move up, other companies have a comparatively worse culture even if the pay is slightly better, and it’s balls being stymied by the whims of one person in a small business."
905,Nothing at all if you dont mind it and it doesn’t take your soul eventually
906,"Too true. I have zero qualms being a cog in someone else’s business if doing so gives me the time and resources to happily live my life as I please.

I don’t need to be a CEO or startup founded or a billionaire, I just wanna have a nice house and a healthy family and a disturbing amount of D&D miniatures."
907,Too personal maan
908,"That you didn't attempt anything in your career that benefited you directly... you just did it for the ""machine"" or someone else and you spent most of your life that way under the guise of security and stability without testing your confidence in yourself..."
909,"Sometimes I miss the sweaty work and simple life that came with my old job at the factory, but today I’ll take my cubicle."
910,"I guess I can see that, but I think most jobs exist to ultimately benefit the people at the very top ie: even a great lawyer at a top form is just making things easier for a company. Some people have different metrics of success and a job is just a way to support those (hobby, family, etc)"
911,"Lovely username, my friend."
912,big oof
913,"While I agree and I'm in a similar situation, you have to admit we're in the minority. For folks graduating recently and in the near future, things likely won't be as easy for them."
914,"For sure we’re in a minority in a very fortunate position, and I’m incredibly grateful to be in this position.

But I don’t want all of the kids who are killing themselves in college thinking “this is the rest of my life.” It’s definitely not a universal experience like OP was making it sound."
915,"Unless you were shit learning the way they taught in college, and actually enjoy working with a purpose. For money. Stakes are higher for sure though."
916,"I'm pulling 60-80H weeks, have given up my social life, dating, most of my hobbies, and meals that take longer than 10 minutes to put together to get a doctorate so I Fing hope not."
917,[deleted]
918,"Speak for yourself. Engineering school was brutal, but now that I'm out in the real world and working it's not nearly as hard.

If life after school is harder than in college, you either went into an easy program or went into a career that is different from your major"
919,"Eh. My job’s easy as fuck for the most part, aside from the stressful calls that sometimes happen. You call 911, me and my friend show up, treat you and cart you down to the ER, repeat x 12 hours. 

I’d say FINDING a career is the hard part. If I could retire out of EMS, that’d be it. This would be my career, and I’d be loyal to it. I know it isn’t, so I just do my thing, try to be nice to people, and do what I’m told. I won’t go above and beyond, cause even when I did, it got me nowhere, but hey, I’m here. As a matter of fact, I’d argue the worst thing you could do, for your own sanity, is work your ass off for an employer that doesn’t value YOU"
920,"The way I learn was the factor that made things easier. College felt like paying to torture myself. I wasn't a fan of the social aspect, and everyone knows I hated school from Kindergarten to College. I'm just not a fan of writing book reports and recalling what I'd consider useless info for a test that determines your status in class.



Got a job in sales, and didn't know how I'd feel, because I'm a bit introverted, and didn't do too well socially in college. I'm actually excelling, somehow it's just easier than school ever was. Still have to take tests and recall information, but I think the whole getting paid to do it makes it better.



I'd say you do have to work hard, but if you enjoy your work, it doesn't even feel like you're working that hard."
921,[deleted]
922,"I’m having a completely different experience. School was really hard for me, but at work the deadlines are very flexible and teammates are actually helpful and knowledgeable. A lot of things can be looked up on the spot as well (depending on industry I guess)."
923,"You will work hard, but you should have the skills to handle it.

If you're getting your doctorate, I assume you enjoy the field you are pursuing. Keep going, and be confident that you'll be well equipped to handle what life throws your way.

Also congrats on going for your doctorate!"
924,"Fair point. I guess my recommendation would be hope for the best, but plan for the worst."
925,Man I hope not I’m drowning in college rn
926,"I suspect that, in many cases, the harder you work in university, the easier the job after university."
927,"“Laughs in engineering.”

When are people gonna learn. It’s not all about working hard. It’s about timing and positioning."
928,"Its try at different levels. Life after school is more difficult emotionally and more difficult to connect to other people and you have to definitely put in more effort. The stakes are higher and the rewards greater. 

You can skip lecture, you can’t skip work. For some it may be easier, but you will quickly find some level of difficulty much greater."
929,I’m in IT.. how’s this?
930,I am doing an “internship” if you will at a lab and have been here for almost 2 years. I wanted to know if anyone with a similar experience found that after graduation you were able to stay due to the training and experience you underwent during that time. I really want to stay and work here as a career and if possible do my masters but I’m not really sure where to go about this. I’m planning to ask my PI next semester if after I graduate I could work for them in the lab.
931,Oh joy. Luckily I chose to study an add-on program after my bachelor and boy oh boyyy is it harder than my original degree. **ANYTHING** I do from here on out career-wise will be x1000 easier than programming lmao.
932,"I've developed the skills to handle the pure amount of work better and things will be much more complex when I'm dealing with real people but if I don't get my evenings and weekends back no amount of money will be worth it. 

Thanks for the encouragement! You've got a just keep going."
933,That is some solid advice
934,[deleted]
935,"Man, if this is what life is like after college, I’m really just gonna die from stress. Nobody in my classes has any time for themselves anymore, with all the coursework. If this is true, this sounds like hell."
936,"I find work to be easier, less demanding and less stressful than college actually."
937,I actually think my university classes are easier than what I took in high school.
938,[deleted]
939,"I feel you, to some extent. I’m done w/ my degree, but taking more bio and chem courses for PA school. Online chem is cancerous. The math involved is goofy, and the help is few and far between, whereas on campus I could always just go to the supplemental instruction and tutoring centers. It made the days longer, but I got my A. Now I’m barely getting a C and I’m working full time/trying not to forget what the lecture taught me. 

If I could just work, it’d be so much easier. Like the nurses I know, they’re all making solid money. In EMS? Good fuckin luck. I wish it were as simple as just picking up over time, or “just work harder”.

Point being; I feel you on school being torture, my long winded rant aside. It feels like I’m draining myself of blood, little by little"
940,Why was software engineering hard in school for you? What made it hard?

943,That's actually where I'm trying to go haha
944,"Apparently it’s something of a boy’s club and can be hard to get a job because a lot of funeral homes only hire their family. Just what I heard from Ask a Mortician, lol."
945,Yooooo Winnipegger here too!
946,My mechanical engineering degree with honors feels the same. The only places that call me are shitty factory labor or shitty manufacturing engineer roles.
947,I just imagine that Andrew now just says “heeeeellllllooooooooooo” like in that Seinfeld episode and that’s all he learned.
948,Nobody gives a crap about new grads in engineering.
949,What even is Creative Communications?
950,I hate Winnipeg
951,Went to a CC called green river and this hit me lol
952,"always hear best majors were engineering, business, comp sci, nursing, and accounting"
953,Winterpeg!! Woot woot
954,don't get too down...common these days
955,"Design roles. I put myself through school with factory labor jobs. I will never go back to the factories as long as I can help it. They are cesspools of misery, and nothing is ever enough."
956,I’ve looked at some textbooks for mortuary science. Real CSI stuff. Seemed kind of interesting.
957,"Shitty manufacturing engineer jobs? What jobs do you consider ""not shitty"" then?"
958,"I'm a chemical engineer and work in a factory as a process engineer. My job isn't perfect but the environment isn't the problem at all. I love working in that environment. Different strokes for different folks I guess, though I wouldn't characterize all manufacturing as ""shitty"" for everyone though"
959,"Maybe not as much as you think it does. You still probably shouldn't get a PhD in gender studies or whatever, though. That's just asking for disappointment."
960,Right.
961,I thought engineering was a safe bet for jobs?
962,Hopefully this Andrew is actually a female to man (and was an attractive female) transgender who has not done reassignment surgery and can go back and use her feminine charm for some quid quo pro career advancement lol
963,You’ll meet new people every day.
964,You’ll see sides of people you never thought you’d see.
965,"Damn, so I guess my major doesn’t even matter."
966,"It doesn't exactly help that I narrowly avoided getting laid off from my first job with the entire shift by 2 weeks, and they had still been saying something about raises being in the future. And I used to get covered in cocoa all the way down to my underwear.

In any case, I want to stay faaaaaaaaar away from the factories in any role other than occasional visiter."
967,met gary ridgeway?
968,"Honestly, I don't mind *some* dirt. I usually fix my own car and I can get dirt all over me from that. But it's just the entire environment and lack of interest in that field at all. And there's all the noise and stuff too."
969,"Eh, I get extraordinarily dirty and I don't mind at all. Again, different people and different choices. I still wouldn't go as far as to say that all manufacturing jobs are shitty. For instance, I think working as a design engineer would be horrible for me. I need to be able to get out of an office every day, see cool equipment, get dirty sometimes, and have a fast-paced and dynamic work environment. But I wouldn't say all design engineer jobs are shitty"

971,i wanna cry
972,hows going back for computer science working out?
973,^this.  i was in the same position last month and i was able to talk to my manager and become a seasonal employee. My first job is just filled with old people and its completely ruined my social life. I started another job on the lake and i can feel my old self comin back
974,Not paying rent and if you get enough hours and if youre doing a good job (which you will cuz youll enjoy what you do) youll get enough tips thatll make up the 6 buck difference and a boost in attitude will help in the long run so i think its a good idea but maybe still set aside the money you would have used on rent as an emergency fund
975,Sometimes you have to do what makes you happy instead of what makes you more money!
976,Ask ur $17/hr job if you can take the summer off?
977,Make a budget. Can you pay your bills while still saving money to help when the summer is over and you look for a new job? Can you explain to a future employer why you left a new job to spend the summer rafting? I think if it’s reasonable to do so then do it.
978,"11.25 + tips will probably be close to $17. Even if it’s less, if it gives you fulfillment then it’s more than worth it"
979,It’s probably more tasteful to state the reason for quitting and just leave than ask for that much time off after just getting the job.
980,"Lol I make 15 an hour with no debt and no degree. Yet, people try to shame me for no debt inducing degree"
981,r/nobodyasked
982,"Hell yea, wish i knew this sooner. its super hard to just tell oneself “life is short” as a mean for motivation, but i realized how truly little and insignificant an individual is. Its sort of a.. an optimistic nihilism :)"
983,[deleted]
984,May I ask what your job was roughly? The summer job would be fun you just need to consider how it would affect your future employment potential in the industry (if you care).
985,"Do it, life is awful after graduation do whatever makes you happy"
986,Estimator for a construction company
987,Yup getting a degree doesn’t really mean anything today. Save yourself the debt. I’m wishing for some sort of reform someday.
988,"Lol I didn’t downvote but your comment is pretty classless and unhelpful imo, so I can see why."
989,"You are trading in the higher paid permanent job for a lower paid temporary job. Fun though it is, think of the longer term ramifications. When you apply for jobs later, and you put that on your resume, you will have a tough time finding another job. Employers hire people who don’t flake out and want to go back to the easy summer job. You are an adult now. 

If you stay where you are, you can work your way up. If you don’t like it, find a career that you do like. We all want to just spend the summer rafting, but being an adult means there are bills to pay, and you really need to do that. 

If you walk away from a good job, there may not be another one again for a long time."
990,"Ok, well I'm afraid I can't speak on that too much without speaking out of turn but it doesn't sound like the kind of thing you will screw yourself by leaving. Was this supposed to be a position with upward mobility? The concerns are how your bosses will take the news, if they will hire you back, and if you will miss out on any potential recommendations for your resume."
991,Why don't you go into finance? The degree will be worth it if you actually use it.
992,Why are you the way you are
993,Small construction company. I think it might top out around $20/hr.
994,"Do it! It’s your early twenties, live a little!!! A little debt is natural hahaha you have time to cultivate your skills and find ways to make extra money when you need it. You don’t wanna look back years later thinking “all I did was work all my life and I didn’t even like it”"
995,"Do it. If you're worried about your debt, know that you won't be paying it off anytime soon. Even worse, not anytime soon working your office job, so why waste your youth to have your loans paid off in your early 40's when you can experience it and pay it off in your 50's? Obviously, I don't know when you'll be able to finish paying it off, but my point is you'll regret not spending your 20's experiencing and loving life. Also, while you're working as a raft guide, think of ways your experiences can be used in a future position."
996,"I didn’t go to college, but I stayed at a job for two years and now make $18 an hour

Edit: debt free, saving for a house now"
997,"Have you considered new hobbies, i heard from people that joining a book club is very fulfilling. If the money is good from your work and you like it, maybe you should find fulfillment somewhere else."
998,"I don’t think you’re crazy

999,Go for it man
1000,I wish i am crazy enough to do it!!!
1001,"I’d say that you should stay at your $17  per hour job. Milk that for a year or so pay down your debt and ask for a raise. If you don’t get the raise, Then look for the rafting job. It’s always going to be there there’s always going to be a rafting. Versus a job that pays over a livable wage.

I was told by professors, my personal senior project advisor who is also the college Dean, and advisors to start looking at the beginning of senior year and ***at the latest***, the beginning of spring semester. Took me searching from January to April to land my job. And that's because a lot of big companies have larger amounts of open slots for the wave of graduates and want to start them after school.

1064,"Not OP but...

The EA knows everything about the boss’s schedule, plans, often overheard important conversations etc. and is often the person the CEO trusts the most. 

If you’re in with them then you can get that 5 minutes you need with the boss. You can get the “oh I heard a conversation about X opportunity” info, without having to bug the CEO about things."

1066,"Idk about the arriving early and leaving late part as applicable for everyone. If you're content with your job and no one gives a fuck, it isn't as important as you say it is with sales.  I worked in finance and no one cared as much. Even less so with accounting

Also worth mentioning, for those content with your position or are just so damn charismatic that it doesn't matter what you do that everyone still loves you, don't ask for extra work.

When getting a raise, make sure your raise percentage is larger than the rate of inflation. You might get screwed out if inflation is bigger than your raise."
1067,"Even if that wasn't the case, suggesting that people work 2 weeks worth of unpaid overtime (20min x 5 says a week x 50 weeks) annually is pretty damn bold."
1068,"I’m in IT as well and this advice was obviously meant for the business majors. 

But you can find your own ways to appear reliable. For instance, on our IM app, I change the status to “green” at 8:50a, I will walk around the office at line 5:05 to grab a water before I leave, etc. 

And yes you don’t really “””have””” to interact with everyone, but you really should. You don’t need to be forgettable."

First thing first, never let anyone tell you need an office/traditional job to be successful.  If you can support a happy and fulfilling life-style being a professional mushroom hunter in the Sierra Nevada woods then go be the best damn professional mushroom hunter you can be. 


Secondly, if you are going to be self-employed or a independent contractor, managing you personal finances becomes way more important. You don't know when that next paycheck is coming in so be sure to SAVE for the lean times. The recent government shutdown exposed how many people are living paycheck to paycheck. If you want a real shock, look up how much the average American has in savings. It doesn't have to be like that.

Last thing, never stop learning! Dive into whatever specialized communities you can and learn from those who have been there, done that. Sub-reddits, Blogs, YouTube, Conferences, books... anything you can get your hands on. Knowledge is a competitive advantage in anything you do!  

If you have any more specific questions, I'll answer them to the best of my ability but, again, I only have my limited experience. Try to find someone with a career you'd like to emulate and reach out to them for advice, worst thing they can say is ""no""."
1079,"Great list!

Can you expand on why you should suck up to the boss's executive assistant?"
1080,"Is the 20% rule including 401k? Honestly would find it pretty difficult to pay off student loans aggressively, my cc every month, withhold 10% for 401k, rent, and then on top of taxes taken out, withhold another 20% on my own...."
1081,"Totally, they’re great people to know for a heist"
1082,Same with receptionists!
1083,"I would include your 401(k) contribution as part of that 20% savings rule and make sure your contributiing as much as the company will match (Again, free money). That being said, 20% just a guide,its not a reasonable target for everyone, especially with student loans & credit card debt.

&#x200B;

The reason why I stress personal finance so much is because I started collecting paychecks before I knew how to handle money and made some stupid decisions. I was making money but not acumulating wealth. I want other people to avoid the mistakes I did.  /r/personalfinance/ is a great place to start and check out their recommended reading list (espicially ""The Millionaire Next Door"")"
1084,"> If you can’t make something work around your career, you can’t make it work inside your career either.

I don’t think this is true. 

Imo your 20s and early 30s should be about maximising your career progress (also travelling and lots of other cool shit, but when it comes to work..). There’s plenty of careers where that is simply doing your 9-5 and not fucking up. So in those careers it’s easy enough to look externally for dating. 

But the careers like finance, Consulting, law etc. where it’s 12+ hour days and (in Consulting at least) Cross-country/international travel the majority of the time. It makes total sense to date someone who understands the lifestyle. If you haven’t worked in that environment it’s hard to explain and from experience it makes it very difficult to maintain a dating relationship simply due to the demands placed on you from your career. You have very limited personal time and you need someone who understands that. 

That doesn’t mean to say you should actively seek out dating with colleagues. But at the same time I don’t see anything wrong with it personally. If it happens it happens. Stressful situations often bring people closer together; the careers I mentioned are obviously high stress.

If you’re both adults about things and you’re not an asshole who cheats then there’s not much to lose. 

It’s more about being able to mentally separate professional relationships & romantic/platonic relationships."
1085,"This is great, thank you! I appreciate the time you took to write this up."
1086,brown-nose??
1087,Did you take a picture of a wall of text and post it in a place you could of just put text? haha you're silly
1088,"It’s usually always great to show up early, for almost any job type. At the very least it can get you a good reference, as your boss/supervisor will tell future employers that you are always early.





Some places won’t let you leave late (whether for lockup reasons or other), or sometimes there’s literally no more work for you to do when the day is out.




Personally my job site has one or two people who stay a little later to make sure no one else is in the building. So they can lock up and close the gates. We’ve had people sneak into the parking lot and steal orders in the past."
1089,"Not a problem, I'm just glad I stumbled upon a good place to share it."
1090,What kind of company do you work for?
1091,"I’d say it really depends on the attitude. Don’t date at work just because she’s kinda hot and you’ve been single for a few months. But if you meet the kindest and prettiest girl there and she’s into you and you have all these shared interests... then you’re probably okay giving it a go, even if you work together."
1092,"Well thanks for the info. I don't carry CC debt, I pay it off in full. I was just saying if the 401k wasn't included that would be a pretty unattainable goal for a lot of younger folk unless they started after college with zero debt, good paying job, and cheap rent."
1093,"Lol, I was just searching today about living with your parents at 24. Honestly, I don't even know how I'm going to be able to move out anytime soon. Finding a job that pays a livable wage has been absolutely impossible."
1094,"I have no expectations in life besides being paid starvation wages in a shitty apartment for the rest of my life. Can't wait to be choosing between food, rent, or car each month for the rest of my short life! The sky is black."
1095,"Yep, same (except mine was in May)."
1096,"*Envy, not jealousy"
1097,"Fuckin right? I’m moving in with my gf, but rent’s gonna fuck me. It’s not like I can’t afford it, but also I wont get to save money any more. I’ll miss buying things for sure, but hey, it’s only 9 months"
1098,I’ve noticed many of my co workers who attended a 2 year technical school had job offers before they even graduated.
1099,Just graduated with a degree in CS. Sent out about 175 applications before I graduated and didn’t get any offers. I’ve sent out about 110ish since then and am still looking for work. I’m in a pretty competitive area though and COVID’s certainly not helping.
1100,Truth.  Just got my M.S. in an engineering field and this is my life.  <100 applications and 1 callback which ended in rejection after 2 interviews.
1101,[removed]
1102,Painful
1103,"That bottom phrase though.

&#x200B;

Just fucking @ me next time, OP."
1104,"Even in high demand jobs, you will still be beaten by someone who has better connections to the company than you do."
1105,"I'm just wondering what kind of education all people who can't get jobs had? If there's no demand then no shit, of course you won't get a job."
1106,Is this the case for any area in the US? Me and my friends who studied computer science all had jobs before graduating.
1107,Ya I make sure I travel. I couldn't  be sane just working.
1108,"There’s nothing to be scared of. Yes, you’ll be working 5 days a week, but in terms of overall effort it most likely won’t be as demanding as school (unless you’re going into a super-charged and competitive field in chase of sky-high paychecks, in which case you already know what you’re signing up for). You’ll be getting paid, and with that money you’ll be able to create the type of life that you want, pursue the hobbies you want, and take on new people professional and personal challenges. Slipping into professional life with a defeatist attitude and doing nothing other than work and watch TV will set you up for a bad, dystopic experience. But it’s not like that attitude is inevitable. Life and growth doesn’t stop after graduation... your life is really just beginning."
1109,"Then break the cycle. Learn new things. Talk to people. Read. Ask questions. Get out more. Don’t just go straight home after work and/or stay home all weekend. There is more but you have to put in the effort and have the drive to make it all happen.

Wait for your life to change and it will never happen. You will always be waiting. Stop waiting and take action, responsibility, and control of your life. Doesn’t matter how small. If you expect more out of yourself and your life than you’re willing to put the effort in, you will always be disappointed."
1110,Same! I am going to be a senior and a 9-5 scares me.
1111,volunteering your time to a cause that means something to you can also be a fulfilling way to break up monotony
1112,"You've basically been doing a ""9-5"" all through school.  You'll be getting paid now."
1113,"There *is* more to life, it’s just not going to be handed to you on a platter like it was when you were a child. If you’re not engaging yourself and pursuing new challenges in both your personal and professional life, that’s no one’s fault but your own."
1114,"JUST GO TRAVEL, TRABEL ALWAYS AEVERYTIME, TRAVEL IS THE ANSWER TO EVERY PROBLEM IN LIFE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

im so tired of this shit, good for you if you can travel and stuff but it aint that easy"
1115,Just the social aspect helps so much.
1116,"I definitely think about this a lot. I'm lucky, because I got the chance to work the 9-5 life while still in school, during summer vacation. I had a middle management job where the bosses tried to make it take over your whole life. I got to learn early on that that wasn't for me. I just graduated and am putting into action a plan to work for myself, having at least 3 sources of income that I can be work or not work at least with some flexibility. It is so far picking up slowly, but working out well. I teach English online with VIPkid, do some photography work, and might get a flexible public service job of 20 hours a week. I'm just setting short term goals, like get these income sources flowing, save some money, and get in shape, then plan to do some long term travels, even work while traveling with no return date. Basically just doing whatever I can to be ready for when opportunity comes up. I really believe life is all about taking the opportunities that come up when they happen, so I am optimistic, and meanwhile, just actively trying to build a life I want to live, rather than follow the 9-5 path. 

&#x200B;

What field do you work in? Think long and hard about what you want your life to look like, and then see how you can fit your work into that, rather than the other way around."
1117,"Yeah this I don't get. Like I only have 14 days of vacation in a year. I mean I could  travel for like a week (and I do every January), but then that week is done and there's still 51 more weeks. 

I want to travel for a month here and a week there but it's impossible to do that. You'd have to be a teacher with the summers off to travel that much, but even then your pay is shit. 

How can anyone just travel and still have a steady source of income?"
1118,I'm definitely stuck in a rut. Gotta change stuff up.
1119,"Word! Try to apply the mentality that each day is new and full of opportunities and long as you look hard enough, and life can bloom where you didn’t know you could find beauty. I just graduated from engineering school and started my first job, it’s strange but just try and make each day your own"
1120,"Figure out what will make you feel unique and not wasting your life away, and do that.

I stumbled into a literal 8-5 desk job where I LOVE what I do, and I feel like I'm doing something that matters. I have no interest in travel, because everywhere I've gone it really is just the same at the end of the day. I'm not chasing money, I'm fulfilling my ego.

I've been where you are and it was fucking awful. But there is more out there. Figure out how you can make your mark with the talents and interests you have."
1121,There is. It’s your human leaking.
1122,"In my experience it really isn't that bad. It takes some time to get used to, but once you get into the routine and figure out what works and doesn't work for you, it's fine. 

I think it helps tremendously if you have a short commute and some workplace flexibility. In my previous job I was able to adjust my hours, so I came in earlier and left earlier than most, and in doing so I was able to beat a lot of traffic and cut down on my commute. You'll have a lot more time to yourself to spend however you want it if you don't have to spend so much time commuting. Having more time to do stuff later in the day (by leaving earlier) was nice.

I found some employees worked from home a couple days a week (or full-time), and others would use their vacation time and take some half days to spend more time with their kids and do stuff while the weather was nice in the summer. Personally I now work remotely full-time, and I feel that alone has improved my quality of life a lot (although it's definitely not for everyone). 

It's the little things in life that I try to recognize and be appreciative of. Little things I look forward to throughout the day. Of course I think it also helps if you enjoy your job and the people you work with. In my current job I also feel like there's much less hard deadlines than I had in school (and looming deadlines stressed me out a lot in college). 

Once you end work for the day and for the week, that time is all yours. Evenings are yours. Weekends are yours. You can do whatever you want. I'm so glad I no longer have to study for exams, do homework late at night, or write papers over the weekends anymore. In my opinion, you gain a lot of free time just thinking about all the hours you have where you no longer have to think about or engage in any school or work related activities at all. 

If you can I would recommend trying to complete at least one internship before graduation. It will give you a good taste of what corporate life is like, and also what your future job may be like as well. I'm so glad I experienced a 9-5 internship before graduating because I already felt like I knew what to expect and was ready for it.

Having a lot more money than I'm used to and actually being able to afford things now is great too."
1123,This was the most powerful thing I have read all day.
1124,"> How can anyone just travel and still have a steady source of income?

People who get a lot of vacation time (I know someone who has enough to take a month off from work - I think they just don't use any vacation time for the rest of the year), people who are able to make enough freelance or as their own boss, people who work remotely (r/digitalnomad), etc. I'm sure a lot of people become flight attendants because they want to travel. As you mentioned, teachers get time off. There are also people who teach English in other countries. Many other positions also involve a lot of travelling for work-related reasons. Additionally, I know people in international companies who have been stationed in other countries."
1125,"That and find things that are tiered as fuck, so you always have goals to be improving so you feel like you’re going somewhere instead of just doing things to entertain yourself"
1126,"Everything is perspective and mindset. A large percentage of the world would shit bricks of pure joy just to be able to complain about the shit some more fortunate people take for granted. 

Also, depression is real as fuck. Go talk to a professional. The lions share of their time is spent helping people put shit into perspective. 

Also also, find shit you enjoy about your day and focus on that. Remember that losses loom larger than gains and you gotta remember to respect that shit."
1127,"Been there. Am there. The thing that bothers me most is the expectation that you have to have a job even if it’s shitty and even if you’re unhappy. You have to suck it up and deal with it and if you can’t do that then tough. You have to bank on the idea that maybe you can find something fulfilling to do after work or on your days off, and hope to God that it’s enough to alleviate the growing unhappiness and discontentment building inside you.

In my experience, that’s all a fantasy. The odds that you’ll find something that you’ll enjoy that much or even find a job that you enjoy that much are so small. Especially so if you go all your life thinking the career you’re working up towards is gonna be the one you want and the one you like and that you’ll definitely love it. Reality has a way of punishing such naïveté.

So, what’s the answer? You’ll notice that there’s no one that can give you the answer. Just people who can give their opinions, like me. 

Unfortunately, the answer is something only you can find. Lots of people think they have it. Lots of people make themselves believe they have it. I’m not convinced, though. If people had the real answer, then do you think they’d still be so trapped in this cycle? Wouldn’t they share the answer to spread such joy? If we were all doing things right, then why would things still be the way they are?"
1128,I feel the same way which is why I'm currently typing this from Singapore right now.
1129,You must be fun at parties
1130,"Sometimes it’s not that easy, unfortunately. Doing so without a means to maintain your lifestyle could result in a total upheaval of your life. 

Typically, people would have a backup plan. The backup plan could very well land you in the very same situation, though. A good backup plan to come up with, then, would be one that will allow you to maintain or increase your income while increasing your happiness and reducing unhappiness.

That is, unfortunately, much easier said than done, and may still result in a total upheaval of your life."
1131,"I think about this a lot, and I really shouldn’t yet because I’m still struggling to even get a job at the moment (just graduated college in May). 

I fear a life full of constant, unfulfilling cycles. But at the same time, I know that there are so many little things to appreciate that happen within those cycles. For instance, you know how there are certain days when you come home and snuggle up and watch a movie with your favorite snack, and all just feels right in the world, even though it’s such a minimal thing? I get the impression that part of the process of maturing is learning to appreciate those little things a bit more. But the thought of those little things being the only sources of pleasure is also scary. 

Throughout my shitty childhood/adolescence, I promised myself that I wouldn’t live an average life. I felt like so many years of my life were already ruined by trauma, depression, etc. That has caused me to become a person with huge, often unrealistic aspirations. I sometimes wonder if my fear of being average is a sense of entitlement in disguise. So I try to push myself to appreciate little things more often, or to at least see that not all good things are extravagant. I’m a sentimental person, and I guess that’s how I keep myself grounded in this way. But I can’t help feeling like I’m meant to do something big."
1132,Some day but having a child just because I'm lonely sounds like the worst reason to have one.  Stuff doesn't fulfill me so I won't get caught up in that materialistic lifestyle
1133,Jesus thank you.
1134,Yeah. I’m working a 9-5 right now 5 days a week (rising college Junior). Although with commute tacked on its more like an 8-7. It’s been difficult finding the energy to do other things that I really care about.
1135,"There is. The “travel” crowd only half get it. Life’s kinda like a video game where the further you go, the more you can customize. Got a hobby? Great do that. Buy a car or house? Cool work on that. Want to travel? Great, now you can. Work sucks. Money’s cool tho"
1136,"You’ve gotta look at a job as a means to go do the fulfilling things you’re made to do. Once I established that mindset everything changed for me. I had been feeling trapped and stuck in my corporate office job, doing the same things all day every day even when got home until I realized I can go do whatever the hell I want to go do! Want to take an overnight trip somewhere? Do it! Want to take the weekend to go hiking and turn off your phone? DO IT!! What’s stopping you? 

I don’t make much money at all but you learn to find ways to make it work -whatever that looks like for you. Find your passion and realize your job is only there to fund that."
1137,"That’s my exact degree and believe me, it’s NOT useless! English/Communications can be incredibly useful for so many different fields. I’m using those to pursue a career in marketing and it’s worked incredibly so far!"
1138,I’m so happy to hear this!!! I hope you’re rocking your career!
1139,"Thank you so much for posting this! I needed to hear this today. I quit my old high paying job in February because it caused me so much anxiety and stress that I would bring home in unhealthy ways. I just had my second interview yesterday and I thought it was going to go great. I put sooooo much energy into worrying about what I was going to say, etc. Halfway through the interview I realized I really wouldn’t like this job, and just like that it didn’t work out. I feel like such a failure because this has only been my second interview and it didn’t work like I wanted it to. My husband laughed at me when I told him that because he said he had to apply to about 100 jobs before he got interviews at all. He keeps telling me it’s only been a couple months and that I should really take the time to focus on what I want. But at this point I feel like an idiot who should just take any job I can get my hands on now. 

I feel like nobody wants me.  But...

Seeing your post gives me hope (: so thanks again!

Also, Congratulations!!!"
1140,"Congrats!!!! It’s always exciting at your first “big boy” job. I’m currently at mine right now but seeking other opportunities more directly related to my field. Best of luck in your future endeavors!

For Those Struggling After Graduation:

The situation is different for everyone but my best friend put it perfectly the other day. We’re both in the creative industry; her film, myself audio, and we were talking to students getting ready to graduate but I feel it applies to anyone graduating.

For the first 1-3 years after graduation you’re going to struggle and STRUGGLE HARD. You’re going to do jobs or tasks you don’t want at jobs that might not be your dream job or related directly to your industry. Don’t give up. Find a good support system (friends, family, internet community, etc.) and hold true to them. It’ll all work out eventually, however, you need someone to kick your ass mentally sometimes."
1141,"Seriously guys before I graduation I started putting out applications and didn’t my “big break” till about 2 months ago. In the roughly 1.5-2 ish years I was trying to start career moves I sent out somewhere between 300-400 resumes which is a rough estimate because of how many different systems I used. Ironically I ended up being found by a head hunter lmfao, which just proves you shouldn’t judge yourself by your applications and interviews, just keep doing your best and working hard!"
1142,"Ok this is great to hear, I’ve been out 3 months, 40 applications submitted, 10 rejections, 30 no replies...this some BS."
1143,"I completely understand. I have been in your position for a legitimate year and it hurt my self esteem and mental health so badly. 

Some work situations just are not good for you mentally and you owe it to yourself to know when it’s time to get out. I’m so sorry to hear that you feel like this but please know that something will come for you and it will work out perfectly. I know it. It might not happen today or tomorrow but it is definitely coming! Keep trucking and take some time for you as well. Continuously searching and searching made me burnt out and I had to take a break for a little bit. It’ll help you clear your head at the very least. 

I wish you all the best and I appreciate your well wishes so much! Hang in there!!"
1144,"Not OP, but I'm studying English and I have 3 marketing related experiences under my belt so far. The first one I got from an ad at my university's careers platform. It was only a month's work and part time, but it gave me something to put under my repetoire. I then looked for a summer internship. I got rejected from an agency that I really wanted to work at, but I saw an old ad from a company that was looking for summer interns. I was like two months late past the deadline, but I basically emailed them anyway because I had nothing to lose. It really helped me get my foot in the door, so never lose hope! Sometimes its a game of luck. 

I'm also considering post grad in marketing, really wish for some guidance on that as well"
1145,Also have the same major/ minor. How did you find your way into marketing? I’m considering a post grad in marketing when I’m done
1146,I appreciate this. Thank you OP
1147,Happy for you! I'm sure you'll do well. Those degrees must have prepared you to write well!
1148,"I think the degrees are what you make of them. The people who know how to use their degree and what they want to do, who pursue opportunities such as internships to gain experience, are probably more likely to make them worthwhile. 

But I've also had friends and heard many stories of former Communication grads who are still waiting tables. Unfortunately, it seems these are also the people who just got a degree because they were told to get a degree, and they may not have done (or been able to do) any long-term planning, interning, or networking while in college (or shortly after). It's unfortunate."
1149,Here’s to hoping so haha! Thanks so much!
1150, I was just answering the question.
1151,"Thank you! I want to run around in circles and yell “I’m a big kid now! I have my first big girl job!!!” In fact, I’ve told just about everyone I know at this point so I guess I basically have done this lol. 

That is seriously some great advice! I definitely needed to hear that now and remember it. 

I hope everything works out for you in your career as you search for something better suited to your field! Good luck!"
1152,Yep. Most of my applications were not replied to and the ones that did get a response were the auto-rejection that people send. The application process just sucks so bad and makes you feel pretty low. Good things are coming your way! Keep pushing on!
1153,"I agree! I'm still studying English, but I've managed to pick up really valuable internships in marketing and I found that a great deal of companies are looking for English students"
1154,"Honestly I was originally working in digital marketing, with the main focus in social media, editing, copywriting, etc. As a communication major you’re able to get a sense of the bigger picture in social media/online strategies and as a English major, you know how to write and edit properly. Once I got that internship under my belt, I was able to work my way into other marketing fields, such as integrated marketing and analytics. The way I look at it, if you can get one good experience under your belt, you can do anything you want."
1155,Fucking awesome man! I’m happy for you!
1156,"Congratulations!! I’m in the same boat- just landed a full time position, and I’m super stoked! Winter was rough (I worked retail again- it sucked), but I interviewed in January on my birthday and landed this job. We made it!"
1157,Congratulations! Enjoy these years! You have your whole life and career ahead of u to enjoy! Great work!
1158,I’m happy for you man. Good luck in the future
1159,"40 applications doesn’t sound like a lot. That’s only about 13 applications a month. 

Some people have to apply well over a hundred times or more until they land something. Keep applying and don’t give up hope."
1160,Thank you so much!!
1161,Congratulations!! I also have been working retail so I know the feeling. I am so so happy for you!!!! We did it finally!!
1162,"Congratulations on graduating soon! Everything will work out for you! It’s definitely scary to not know what’s going to happen next but something good will happen soon for you! 

Thanks so much!"
1163,My pleasure! Have fun out there! Kick butt! They’re gonna love u 💪👋
1164,Communication major that works for a tech company... can concur
1165,"I’m so scared of this, even though I know it’ll all work out eventually. I went straight into a grad program from undergrad and now I’m about to finish this summer, with an idea of what I want to do but no idea what I’m qualified for, and looking for a job in a country where I don’t speak the native language (well not very well yet anyway). I keep trying to prepare myself for looking for months and picking up minimum wage jobs to pay the rent in the meantime but I’m scared of not knowing what lies ahead for me! Glad everything is working out for you :)"
1166,1 Year in...and yep struggling hard right now
1167,When I started for a big tech company I had to buy a week’s worth of sweatpants just to blend in haha
1168,"I agree! I just recently started a job where I have to dress more professionally every day, so I’m still in the process of figuring out what staple pieces I need to buy. It feels restricting when there’s so many guidelines to think about, really kind of just takes the fun out of shopping in my opinion."
1169,Agreed. I would wear a sweet vest and a lanyard of my favorite sports team. Kinda like how Will Smith would wear his coat in Fresh Prince of Bel-air! Follow the rules... in style.
1170,This is why I found an office with a lax dress code. I can wear yoga pants and hoodies/tshirts pretty much year round. We don’t work face to face with clients and if we know someone from corporate is coming then we dress up.
1171,[deleted]
1172,"I wore a shirt and tie in high school...business casual (jeans, dark wash) at a Fortune 50 company, go figure lol. I think the whole idea of “suit and tie in the office, even though you don’t deal with customers face to face and only other suit wearing co workers”, is dying and that’s a good thing."
1173,Yes I miss wearing what I wanted to in college.
1174,"I work in a hospital and just wear scrubs no matter what. 

“Dress up for rounds with this important doctor!” nah 

“Professional dress please on short call days!” Nah 

“No scrubs in clinic please!” Nahhhhhh

If I had to wear a shirt and tie while working 80+ hours a week, I’d go (even more) insane"
1175,Ya   I heard  for tech companies are super laid back.
1176,Aye agree with u
1177,Wow I am feeling the exact opposite. I don’t have fashion sense and I’m ugly so I want to always dress professionally and not whatever I want because at least I’ll look respectable
1178,"We have a uniform too. I’m near the end but I’ve never liked it. It’s fucking horrible. The colour is depressing, all black. The clothes are so uncomfortable. Just looking at the uniform makes me sad and not wanting to go school. I know I sound dramatic and people have it worse but I’m simply describing how I feel about it. 

I’m going to be saying “uncomfortable” a lot. The white polo shirt we have makes my wrists itchy and isn’t tight but it’s really uncomfortable on the wrists. 

The black jumper you’re supposed to wear over it can be itchy and no, isn’t uncomfortable but isn’t the comfiest, I think is the best way to put it. 

The tie is the fucking worst. It’s so uncomfortable around the neck. If you loosen it you look stupid in my opinion. Once you take it off it’s a like a breath of fresh air. 

The black trousers are uncomfortable to sit in and can be really irritating around the waist sometimes. Don’t get the wrong impression, everything fits me and is perfectly fine it’s just...I’m saying it again, really uncomfortable. 

Again, I know I seem dramatic but it’s awful to look at and wear. You have to wear it but the teachers don’t enforce it. I see people wearing trainers, hoodies and black jeans everyday and they get away with it with ease. I don’t see the point in taking the risk of doing the same. I don’t have long left and I can’t wait to leave that shithole.

(Also, I didn’t think I would write this much)"

1182,"Went from Finance to Tech, not being a suit has greatly improved my enjoyment at work (but also I’m autistic and hate not being entirely comfortable)"
1183,"Interesting post, this is actually part of what got me interested in fashion early in college. I never paid attention to clothes before, but I figured this could be my last chance to wear cool stuff if I ever get locked into a restrictive job/lifestyle. Even if my job didn’t require it, it would be very hard to break into expressive clothing when I’m old and streetwear may not suit me"
1184,Ya what's the point of going shopping at Nike if you only can wear it once you're off work?
1185,"My current position has me wearing a full suit & tie. 

I currently work Hotel Audio/Visual setting up lights, speakers, video walls, etc.

The tie is a safety hazard and I sweat through my suit daily. It sucks. I’d much rather go back to casual clothes I had at previous jobs or in school."
1186,When I use to work in the emergency department I did not mind wearing pajamas I mean scrubs at all. It was a treat to be honest.
1187,"I had an internship that required me to dress “business casual”, which just meant I wore the same 3 plain black T-shirts and pants week after week, and that was still kinda annoying albeit not very strict. I have a new internship now where I can wear anything, and I love it."

1190,I don’t have an answer for what you just asked me
1191,I work at uni and i look like a potato everyday. I mean i wonder why we don’t have a strict dress code sometimes but I wouldn’t like it. I choose my potato way.
1192,Hell yeah. I work for a non-profit and the dress code is super relaxed so I get to wear my graphic tees and Birks w/ socks. Cannot imagine myself having to wear a dress/ heels everyday for the rest of my life
1193,Yes!!! I hate it so much
1194,Me not relating to this post because we wear school uniforms in our country
1195,"assuming you’re a guy check out Eddie Bauer. They have lots of business casual options that are still super comfortable. Like I have their synthetic chino pants and quarter zip fleeces in every color and just mix and match every day for most of the year. Once it’s too hot for fleeces I switch to under armor heat gear 1/4 zips, which I have in 5 different colors."
1196,"I wear scrubs all day and I have for years. As a nurse (vs a dental assistant) I have even LESS opportunities to customize myself. I do little things like order fun badge clips, scrub hats and do my nails. I don’t think any of this applies to you, but my suggestion is to find maybe something small! 

Are you a male wearing ties? Can you customize this? Find little things that make you happy. I used to be depressed wearing clothes for my drive to work, changing into scrubs & then returning to those clothes for the drive home and that’s it lol but I’ve just started wearing comfy clothes and then I get to enjoy those other nicer sets later!"

I normally have an hour and half to do whatever I want before I get tired and go to bed. Then do the whole thing over again the next day. Oh I also have to fit laundry, dishes, cat litter box in there somewhere. Also my girlfriend enjoys spending time with me. Let’s just say it’s been a difficult semester but it’s my last one so I’m really exited to be done. 

People constantly tell me that once I graduated I will be working 40 hours a week and it is worse. I highly doubt that because at least I won’t come home from a busy do to 3 homework assignments."
1205,"I had no days off through a lot of my college years because of work and I can honestly say that while working full time now is tiring sometimes, you’re 100% right that at least there’s no assignments when you come home. When work is over, it’s over (for lots of jobs at least) and then your time is your own. Days off are days completely off."
1206,"""__You could travel or do fun stuff you normally wouldnt have time for but I guarantee there will be something still missing in your life__.""

Lol wat? How would you pay for that?

If you are unemployed but still have the option to travel or just not worry about money. Then yes. That is an enviable position.

Now if you said you feel like a financial burden to your family or worry about long term career prospects then yes that does suck and you have my sympathy.

1221,"Similar for me. I must have done 100+ applications throughout my masters. 30+ interviews. Got the highest grade in college my country allows. Came out with nothing but a stack of rejections. 

Got a job in sales, finally, and got fired after 2 months. The three months I spent on welfare after that were the most depressing of my life. Only my gf knew, my friends still don’t know. It’s embarrassing. I honestly don’t know how anyone does it for long stints. Nothing but free time but no money to do anything. We need a reason to get out of bed in the morning, even if that reason isn’t our ideal way to spend a day. I think that even with money, I wouldn’t have lasted much longer."

And I’ve tried to be productive. Practiced musical instruments, read, played video games, watched lectures online, met up with old friends. But it still gets boring after like a week."
1223,"I've been in this situation before and basically some degrees dont translate 100% to a job. Most jobs want people to have some kind of experience even if they have an impressive tech degree or whatever. If you have a bachelors in english or something like that and have never worked during college a lot of places dont want that. Minimum wage places sometimes take a look at someone like this and don't want to hire them because they know this person will leave the second they get a job in their field. Also applying to tons and tons of different places can cause burnout very quickly and eventually you dont put as much effort into each one. After hundreds of applications I found it really taxing to write an enthusiastic and well done cover letter about how excited I was to flip burgers/whatever. And then after a while you have a gap in your employment history which really turns employers off. In terms of rich parents, if they're already on their health insurance and still have their childhood room in their house it's not so expensive. Basically just food and transportation and I'm assuming they dont give them a lot of money for entertainment and non essentials. It's really not a good situation to be in though and very depressing. I feel like a failure of a human being personally although I do have a part time job and just got a new one that has a lot of potential for growth and offers better benefits so I'm a tad more hopeful."

Email your teacher or professor if you are really confused about something (after you check your syllabus), having a good relationship with your teacher and not hiding in the background can go a long way! 

**Really important bit of advice:** Get hyped when you do well and understand what you did wrong when you don’t do well. It’s crucial to link those good emotions to solid work👍"

1266,How’d you do finishing out high school?
1267,"No, by no means does it get worse after college. But it’s a different kind of fun when you start working full time and have bills to pay. 

For example, I can’t spontaneously go out on a weeknight until 5am with friends because a. I have work the next morning and b. My friends have work the next morning. I’m not in close proximity with all my friends like I was in college, and so hangouts are also less frequent and more of an effort is needed to get groups of people together

But that being said, post grad life is pretty great too. I’m not dirt poor anymore since I’m working full time, so I can go out more and travel more. No homework after work so my nights are completely free until bedtime. And the friends I keep in touch with are pretty much going to be my friends for life so the relationship with them becomes much deeper and more sincere"

1277,"Guy graduating with a BS in Biology in two days. Good job! College can be tough, tougher if you have to commute more than a 1/2 hour every day. College can be eye opening (so I’ve heard), but much of it can feel like high school 2.0: 4 years, do your work, work on group projects with friends/people you barely know, and clubs that you can ignore.  There’s Greek Life for the adventurous, and the best part of college IMHO is not having to wake up at 6 am every day for classes (unless a: that’s your thing or b: mandatory 8am classes).

You may hear people doing all all nighters, but never put yourself in that position; budget your time, study responsibly, and get to bed at a decent hour (let’s be honest, by midnight). Procrastination is normal: I’ve spoken to several STEM students that put things off to the last minute. Many people, especially your “classmates”, will be in the same boat as you. Still, if there’s any habit you want to kick in college, it’s procrastination. 

I’ll be honest: now that I (almost) have the degree, I’m not entirely sure what to do with it. I’m staying on an additional year to complete a Masters in Biotechnology, so I’ll figure it out by then. Try to figure out in the next 4 years what you want to do with a BS in Biology; I just choose it as a default."
1278,Of course man! Have a great night(:
1279,:0 I didn’t know that was possible.
1280,Solid plan.
1281,Well put. I’ve noticed the extra needed effort to get my friends together after high school. It would make sense that it gets less and less frequent. I am very much looking forward to focusing on work and not 5 completely different classes.
1282,Definitely! Have at least one person in every class that you can talk to and work with if needed.
1283,"It was initially strange to me when I was calling my boss by their first name during my first internship (and also being introduced to every other employee there by their first name). At 20, I didn't really feel like someone on their level, an adult (and in many ways, still don't). With time, I soon got over it. 

Looking back, it was probably odd that I felt this way to begin with considering I called my first boss at my very first job by her first name as well, and I had the occasional college class with people who were also years older than me (usually established professionals returning to school for a career change or retirees). So in college I wasn't always around people my age, although the majority usually was.

I probably felt so strongly about calling my boss by their first name at my first internship because it was my first real corporate job. They were also more involved with managing me and giving me tasks than my previous employer was. Given that they were in such a position of power over me, coming from a college environment, it probably felt weird to me that I wasn't addressing my boss by some sort of title, and that they were just a regular person."
1284,"Right!? I still feel like a kid and everyone around me is the “grown ups.” My brain doesn’t comprehend that I should be on the same level as them. 

It’s... intimidating. I feel like everyone I meet is automatically a superior and hat makes it weird when I’m trying to make friends and stuff.

I’m constantly referring to everyone else as “adults.”"
1285,"It can seem strange at first, especially for students who went straight to a 4 year and were always more or less grouped by age, but when your whole social world stops being like that you probably will start to realize that people are just people! More than anything keep an open mind and you will be surprised by the relationships you may form. In my 20’s I’ve found myself with genuinely dear friends of many ages, in their 30’s and 40’s, heck I have a close friend I adore who turned *60* last year! Not only do these people have a lot to share, but when you get down to it, they are just another person you enjoy spending time with. Seek community, keep an open mind,  be kind and you never know what kind of people you might meet!"
1286,"lol im really close friends with an ols teacher of mine and aftee i graduated she told me i could call her by her first name, i declined lol"
1287,"You really did a nice job writing your thoughts out, I get what you're saying.  

&#x200B;

I'm 45 and have been a manager.  

&#x200B;

Counterpoint to what you're saying -- No one is your superior except the managers at your work... everyone else is a co-worker just like you.  If you have a really great boss, they're going to treat you like family as well.  A good boss is just like a good coach who supports you and builds you up, helps you get connected to others, and never makes you feel small."
1288,24M. Totally relate to this. It's just a part of being in the real world. The way I look at it is that it's just maturing you more and more. We're all influenced by the people we interact with and if the people you're talking to through work or whatever it is are older people that are wise beyond your years then that's only a good thing.
1289,"Yeah I agree. Once i grew up I realized how weird it is that children are kept so out of adult stuff and have no practice interacting with various ages, often even other kids. I mean, supervision for a childs safety is good, but adults actively trying to keep adult and kids tables, for example, probably isn't the best way to handle things. And you end up not being even familiar with "" adult"" things when you become an adult which can leave people at a distinct disadvantage to those who weren't sequestered like that."
1290,"In the '70s and '80s I knew all our neighbors on our city block.  Everyone was on a first name basis.  There was John the police officer, Hilda the widow, and 10 other families on the block who knew our family and we had conversations with.  

&#x200B;

Then in my first job at a grocery store when I was 16, we had a night stock crew in their 20's, an assistant manager in his 30's, and the store managers in their 40's and 50's.  All ages were there and you worked side-by-side with everyone, so you became friends.  A couple of the managers would go play basketball with us after work.  

&#x200B;

So going into my full-time career after college, it was not new to me to be relating to adults.  

&#x200B;

It also helped -- my mom included me in everything, my whole life.  I went with her when she bought her car, sat with her when she was at the bank, visited her office (a lot -- the people there loved me and made me laugh!), and when she was on a church board, I was usually just hanging out in the back of the room.  So I heard ""adult business"" and was usually right there at the table, my whole life.

&#x200B;

Can I share something else?  It sounds like your workplace has some boring adults.  I'm 45 and those aren't the kind of things that I usually talk about.  My friends aren't that way either.  There's adults out there who are interested in the same things that you are, and that you'd have awesome conversations with.  Maybe you can get involved, volunteer somewhere (in an interest or passion you have) or find a friendly pub where you can get some good conversations going."
1291,"No, because I grew up in a multigenerational house. What's strange is the k-12 age sequestration.

Edit: you're literally asking why it's strange to interact with adults."
1292,"I'm seeing a lot of people calling for increased home ec and finance classes, and I think age sequestration is part of this. All of the schools I've visited already have these life-skills classes, but the students don't value them."
1293,"yes! im only 18 and two of my closest work friends are in their 50's. its a little weird but it's also pretty refreshing! its cool to be able to chat with so many different people from so many different walks of life, even beyond the diversity of people my age."
1294,Recently started uni and when I called my lecturers “sir” or “Mr” they told me I could call them by their first name but it just felt weird so I still say the more official titles
1295,Right on. I stay away from workplaces where the boss thinks he's in control of everyone.
1296,This is one of the coolest things about working in my opinion. You get to befriend/ interact with people of all different backgrounds/ qualities. Age is definitely one of the most interesting
1297,"Haha...feels like just yesterday. everyone I worked with called me “kid”.  30yrs later I am at the same company and I am 53yo...and I truly cherish meeting and working with younger people just like yourself!!
This thread/post is giving me an interesting juxtaposition..."
1298,"I started working part time at 13 (really) because I always wanted to *adult* rather than try to be accepted by my peers. So I got a job helping out the custodial and maintenance crews for my school district after class time/during summer, etc. Actually having money was nice too, for sure. 

But to your point- I was put into a world where the people who were in charge of me for 6-7 hours a day were now my coworkers for the remainder of it. And I got to learn early on that they were real people with personalities and problems and senses of humor. 

I never really had a problem transitioning into working with people of all ages probably largely because of that experience, so I really appreciate your perspective too. It’s nice when you can relate some things with people your age in the workplace, but it’s certainly better to keep an open mind and remember that older/younger people are still people as well. :)"
1299,"I'm  a big supporter of public schools, but I think we need far more than one adult per classroom. Our current structure and culture treats high school like a social event. The pressure is on peer acceptance instead of learning, and it's partially because the impending adult world is invisible."
1300,"You think not interacting with adults is  normal? Before the last 200 years, it would be the norm."
1301,[deleted]
1302,"Yes exactly. I was homeschooled and I have some issues with how my parents did it but one thing that was hugely beneficial was being included in the daily running of the house and being around adults frequently. Like you said, students don't value that type of learning, and also classes like that are not as good at teaching those things as real life experience is. School keeps kids out of life around the house and then has to try to re- corporate that skill set in an inferior way."
1303,"I just started a contract with a startup with a team of 12 or so people, who are in a 10 year range from my parents. My boss talks about his kids who are about my age (early 20's), and everybody has 20+ years of experiences working agencies and huge brands, like kraft. 

So here I am, 23 year old, not relating to whatever they are saying and really just observing their processes and brainstorming ideas. I feel weird just interjecting and putting in my ideas, I'm also talked over sometimes, but they liked some of my ideas and sent it to a client. 

It's very different because I ask them about their experience and what they did before this start-up and then they ask me what I did before and I'm like ""um one contract, two internships and lots of retail."" It was a long time before I got this opportunity and I'm so thankful.

Also, they are all men and I'm the only girl. Very intersting experience and is exposing me to a new environment."
1304,"I totally feel this way! The ‘adults’ in my life, whether it was parents, relatives or teachers, have always subscribed to the idea that ‘children’ should keep them and their opinions to themselves.

I grew up hiding from the rest of the world. Now it STILL feels strange to go to work and talk to people older than me. 

I keep having the impression that these people are too busy and too important to spend their time on me. That I’m insignificant and my opinions don’t carry weight because I’m a ‘child’. 

There’s always the frozen feeling I get when someone asks me a question. I never developed my opinions enough to think for myself."
1305,"Yea over all I prefer public schooling as an option as well, and I see what you mean, altho I think the peer acceptance pressure would still be high. The more adults and the more interactive school could be with learning, the better."
1306,"Not really, but I was homeschooled and surrounded by other older peers and younger kids as well as adult mentors and other parents of my friends. It was more jarring to come across people from other classes. For most part most of the people I knew were lower or middle middle class. And maybe one or two upper middle class. It was definitely a little jarring coming across people just scraping by. I mean my family was never rich by any means but basic food and shelter was something I never had to stress about, same as my friends and most of the people I knew. Definitely has been a little eye opening meeting people from all different straights of life. Puts things in perspective, makes you humble and grateful."
1307,"Welcome to the adult world, that man that is your dad’s age, he is/can be a real friend.  Age means little."
1308,Nope. You interact with older people from the minute you were born.
1309,"> adults actively trying to keep adult and kids tables, for example, probably isn't the best way to handle things.

Adults are doing that for *their* sake, not for the sake of the kids."
1310,"I'm sure that's true in a lot of cases, but if kids are always kept segregated from adults is where the problem comes in. I realize parents need times away from their kids and they should be able to do that without coming across like they would never willingly spend time with their kids at special events."
1311,Gotta be careful with that. Sometimes if they rush into hiring it means it might not be as good as they make it sound
1312,[deleted]
1313,We had an informal chat to assess suitability but not a full panel interview.
1314,Congrats!!!!!!
1315,"Not true at all. Business could be expanding or growing, someone may have retired. There are good reasons for hiring someone."
1316,Congratulations. I’m so happy for you. This post gives me the courage and hope. Thanks mate.
1317,No one ever hires anyone because everything is already working perfectly.
1318,Congratulations! That really is an accomplishment!
1319,"If you know someone, it’s possible. I did not interview for my current position."
1320,"I just did the math, yeah no exaggeration. Each application has 1 page cover letter and 2 pages of selection criteria. 10hours of work per application several a week over many years. In addition to the actual CV"
1321,That is so exciting!
1322,amazing! 💖
1323,Congratulations!! Hope it all works out!!
1324,"It’s a rehab in the home service, so yeah it’s expanding. And they were hiring cos 2 ppl cut their hours down due to age and child stuff. = a job for me."
1325,Holy shit.
1326,Thanks. :)
1327,Thousands of hours filling applications? Holy shit is that an exaggeration or?
1328,"I realized this a few months ago. I have a less than employable degree that I graduated from 3 years ago now. Turned 25 this year and for the last 2 years have had anxiety and panic attacks about my entire future because of the stigma of what ""should"" have been accomplished by my age already (at 25 my parents had 1 source of income--my dad, 1 kid--me, and within 5 years they had another kid and bout a 4 bedroom house). 

Everyone lives life at their own speed, my significant other and my parents and friends helped me realize that. It's nice knowing that I dont have to compare myself to other successful people and what they accomplished at my age; that's their story, not mine. It's also dope to have the support system I've had to get me to see that."
1329,"Mark Mansion also talks about something similar to this in his book, *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck.*

Life isn't a race but a journey, and we all have our own paths. I think the sooner people realize this, the better off they may be."
1330,"I resonate with this. Comparing myself to others made me feel unsuccessful, depressed, anxious, and stressed. It was keeping me from being happy and growing. It’s hard to do things when you haven’t forgiven yourself for not having done things earlier. There’s absolutely no rush. Take a breath, enjoy life. Just like how the fun will always be there, the degree will always be there. Thanks for the post."
1331,"Great post, you’re very right"
1332,"Yeah honestly I really bungled a launch date for my training but have been getting towards the end day by day.

It can be helpful to have deadlines but remember when they're past that it's not the end all be all!"
1333,"Dude I feel you. My dad had his own business, managed his jam band, and bought two whole small town downtown buildings to rent commercial space by the time he was 23 and I’m here like... I take photos and rent?"
1334,"My aunt told me a lovely peace of unsolicited and unwanted advice: ""nobody's going to hire you when you get old"". I'm 18 currently and going to take a gap year, planning to start university in a year. It's really unreasonable to assume that a year or two will have that much of an impact. And hell, even if i don't get a job in my field at 50, if I'm happy and have good people around me, I'll be just fine."
1335,"I did a gap year and my parents said the same thing, were totally dead against it, but now they admit it was the best thing I ever thought of doing because I learned to drive, got work experience and saved money. You’ll be fine. 

And don’t let anyone tell you that ‘you’ll forget how to study’ in a gap year, because that’s bollocks."
1336,I was in a terrible mental state after high school and a gap year before college was what a needed to help myself. No regrets
1337,I’m just doing circles chasing my own tail. While everyone is doing their thing. :/
1338,"Thank you, I needed to be reminded of this."
1339,"A lot of people don’t even know what they want to do in life. Most people just falls into their current jobs. 

I just to be the guy that had that timeline to do things. Apart from career to a certain extent. There is really no deadline.  I see people getting married later and having kids later."
1340,"I mean, it matters. It's just not game over. But it does matter, so now is better than later."
1341,"This way of thinking got me into an acute stress reaction and I had to visit a psychologist for 7 months afterwards, which costed me thousands of dollars, so no, better is when you do stuff according to your life situation and environment instead of burning out."
1342,I mean I haven’t graduate hs yet but worried as fuck about my future. Like yeah some people say do what you want in life or whatever but without money that’s nothing.
1343,"It’s good that you recognised that. Honestly I know for certain that I would have broken down if I’d gone straight to uni from hs, I put myself under so much pressure. Good for you for not going ahead anyway and doing long-term damage because of societal pressure/expectations."
1344,"The veil has lifted, welcome to adulthood. Now go out there and live free, Have fun and be safe."
1345,"Just relax, be chilled and happy, doesn’t matter “what society says”"
1346,"I tell this to all younger people who tell me their plans feel derailed. For example if someone is struggling in school with a course load, or is really bummed about failing a class. They think they need to GET IT DONE FAST or they’re failing. But the system is not meant for *everyone*. We all work at our own pace. Better to become who you want to be successfully at your own pace than become bogged down and lower your expectations of your potential simply because you need to take your time. I like to think it helps them, but at the same time I need people to tell this to me too because I also feel like I’m failing every day that I don’t find a job after school. I think we have to keep reminding ourselves that it’s LIFE and rushing through time trying to meet deadlines we let society make for us is not living. We need to remember to enjoy whatever stage we’re at; keep learning, living, and breathing in every moment. We’ll get there."
1347,"thanks dude! and Yeah. the worst thing here is that even the government is trying to get kids to go to uni/vocational straight after high school. Jokes on them, i'll be studying anyway, just on my own terms and working at the same time."
1348,"It’s the same here (UK). You do you hun, keep on going."
1349,"Thanks! It was also nice because I felt the need to get an education after a year instead of dreading it right after high school. I stayed working but felt I wanted to make more of myself which I didn’t have those feelings leaving high school. It’s never too late to take a mental break, even if it’s just a couple of weeks or a few days. We all need it. Hope things are working out for you"
1350,"But isn't it also true that when you are young you have the energy to work more, so it's easier to become a doctor or an engineer at a young age as opposed at an old age? 

Each part of one's life is suitable for some stuff, like travel while you are young, because it gets harder when you are old. 

I am not trying to argue or prove you wrong, I'm just confused"
1351,"I'm all for positivity and all, but OP's post is just wrong. Age definitely matters for a huge variety of things."
1352,Always have to tell myself this and to not compare.
1353,Like practically everything. And sometimes you can't unfuck things if you wait to long.
1354,"And how statistically probable is that? There are much more people in their 20's and early 30's trying to meet the same milestones people did decades ago, when the economy was completely different, and getting burned out. Edit: grammar"
1355,K. If you hang around working class people you'll see it happens a fucking lot. It is the bread and butter of for profit colleges.
1356,"They are so far, thank you :). Same to you"
1357,"It really sucks, I'm from Europe, education is free here, so it didn't cross my mind. I think the oldest classmate of mine was in his early 30's when I was in college, normally, most of people here are done with education by the time they turn 30."
1358,"> constant opportunity for something interesting around the corner

Yeah, that’s life in general. People just get used to being spoonfed in school, don’t realize that life afterwards is supposed to be driven by them, and then just stagnate for a few decades before (hopefully) snapping out of it and realizing “oh, shit, I’m actually in control here, I should, like, do stuff outside of work, have goals, hobbies, actively make friends. Huh.”"
1359,"Oh i get it, everyone is racing to die quicker"
1360,"That's a pretty solid assessment. I'm still getting used to the shift in mindset. My studies were in both political science and music; I spent more than half my time in the schools's conservatory. The kind of small fam-like environment there I found kind of unique. I also found myself participating in --sometimes running-- a number of ensembles. The availability of people to collaborate, share some pretty niche interests with, and structured performance opportunities are some things that I've been critically missing. 

Nevertheless, your comment is really vital."
1361,"Not true at all, after about 40 you start heading downhill to death faster and faster.  Completely out of control."
1362,"Studies show that life satisfaction tends to climb steadily. You’re talking about personal health, which, yeah, deteriorates with age."
1363,No it’s up hill then down repeated multiples times and then hopefully you die at the top and not the bottom.
1364,"I don’t agree that it should be removed, but yeah this sub has a really bad habit of being a negativity circlejerk."
1365,"I dont even think high school was a good part of my life, Im just regretful bc it was great for others and not for me, plus nothing good seems to be in my future either"
1366,"I agree. I'm glad that ""DAE negative"" posts are part of the reporting process for the sub. I like the fact that this sub at least tries to stay positive and be a resource for advice rather than a bunch if crabs in a bucket"
1367,"i dont think this minicomic is about life after graduation being worse than school as some of the guys say (please , i have nothing against you xD) .
i actually see it as if you life shoulsnt be a straigh hill , i mean yes you will be heading upwards towards death which will tend to be difficult , but at least we have to shape our hill ,we can make new turns and rest places in it (metaphorically speaking) , i mean our life can go upwards but atleast it shouldnt be a monotonous slow death road , you gotta try new things , but *sigh* after all it all depends on the criteria of time and money , which depend in their turn on job (sadly) ."

1372,The fact that it won’t be forever helps me and that I’ll miss them a lot when I move out.
1373,"Thanks, I appreciate your response! I live in middle TN and while rent and general expenses are lower here, so are wages. The minimum wage for TN is $7.25 and so I’m basically making a quarter more. But at 21-23 hours a week, that translates to not even $170 a week. Occasionally my neighbors go on vacation and they have me housesit for them since they have an elderly dog they don’t want to board, and I love it. I like being by myself in a house where I can cook my own meals and set my own schedule. I feel more like an adult."
1374,"Not giving a fuck is truly a gifted talent. I’m trying to learn how to give less fucks here, more fucks there. “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck” is a great book if you’re interested. You can get through it in a week if you have the time"
1375,"23 here. I took a big risk career wise, fell flat on my face, and had to move back to my parents. We were at dinner yesterday and my mom was looking at Facebook ""oh look, you graduated college this time last year!"" 

Feels bad man. I just had an interview for a job that should pay $50kish but no idea if I'll get it or not. It went well but I know better than to get my hopes up :/

EDIT: they called me back. In salary negotiations now. Phewwwww

EDIT2: what the fuck they hired someone else"
1376,This is very true.
1377,"Poorly. Although cooking nice meals together and having my dog and cat around are pretty amazing. It’s striking how many things we have to give up for student life- like animals, spacious rooms, well stocked kitchens etc... but parents are weird. They have no one to call them out on their bullshit so they can  really act however they want and no one will ever say anything."
1378,"Meh don’t give enough fucks to read it 😂 just kidding thanks for the rec. I’ve heard of it before!

I find that “not giving a fuck” stems from having self confidence. The more I built up my self confidence, the less I sought validation from my peers. A huge first step for me was decreasing my time spent on social media. Distancing myself from IG made me realize that all of it is a sham and now it bothers me how vain it all is"
1379,"I (23M) live in the SF bay area  with my parents, graduated with an international business degree in the fall, currently looking for a job but might end up working retail somewhere. I get along with my parents too but i feel behind af considering i might take a retail job right after college and live with my parents. But basically i deal with it by being grateful that my possible 30k a year would not be enough to live on my own, so the silver lining is i guess you don't pay rent (at least not as much if you pay to help your parents), which here averages weeeellllll over 1k a month.  I just feel grateful, in spite of feeling like i wasted 4 years of my life, that my parents still support me. Some others I know aren't so lucky. And since you get along with them, thats a huge plus too. 

Don't be too hard on yourself, everyone shines at different times in their lives. And hey, you're gunna be off to grad school soon! You'll be shining soon!"
1380,"American culture forces you to think you need to be independent and living on your own means being an adult. You save money. Help them pay bills. Function as a family. Unless your family is toxic there isn’t much benefit on living on your own.. you dont have to prove shit to anyone. 

Live on your own. Struggle to pay bills. Buy a bunch of shit to decorate your place. Never progress in life because you make next to no money. With bills every month. Think of other countries and how some families live together for life. Family is all you got in this world dont be in a rush to leave it behind"
1381,"I’m 20 and have a full time job making 11/H and still live with my parents, I could move out and live in an eh apartment and see my bank account go to under $50 each week. Would it make me feel better right now? Hell yeah id love to live in my own apartment, I love being alone when they’re out of town more than anything, but is it a smart move? Hell no. I start classes next week and will move to part time, luckily over the past 2 years I’ve saved enough for 2 years of college. If I moved out I’d have to take loans and id still barely survive. 

Be happy your parents let you live there and provide for you, save like a maniac so when you can get a place it won’t be so dire to your account until you can get a job in your field! 

Just don’t think about the right now but think about the future, that’s how I deal with it"
1382,"Personally I didn’t cope with it. I just worked myself to death working and going to school full time and busted my ass to get out of a job paying minimum wage (also $7.25 here). You could always get your own place, it’s just whether you think it’s worth it for how much of a pain it is to organize your time and how many hours a week you’re willing to give away for it while also going to school"
1383,I’m 21 and live with my boyfriend. We live in central California and pay like $930 for a one bedroom apartment. I do my best to make it look like we have everything together but we are *constantly* struggling. Not a day goes by that I’m not stressed af and wishing I still lived with my mom lol. Lots of the other people that live away from home also feel this way — so don’t feel too behind! We’re all struggling one way or another.
1384,"For me, my problem is that I compare myself to all other people my age who are already married or moving in to their own place etc. While I’m still dating and living with my parents. It sucks, but it helps to know I’m not alone. I hope your interview went well and keep us all updated! :)"
1385,😂 truly the only downside of living at home. Can’t bring anyone back
1386,good luck getting a reasonably priced place in seattle. the economy is fucked.

Like for instance, something as simple as dinner, the expectation is that we don't eat together... We also have separate fridges and we made a room in the house our living room to also provide more independance. It's hard though!"
1391,"Live with your parents for as long as you can and save like crazy, there is *zero* shame in it, especially these days. Just think you will be soooooo much closer to buying your own damn house by the time are fully ready to move out whereas your friends will still have years of saving to go."

1393,"+1


My fiancée was a waitress at a relatively fine dining restaurant that was always busy. She worked 4 days a week and brought home ~$250-$300 on weeknights and ~$600 on weekends. Her calculated hourly rate was something like $73-$78 an hour fairly consistently. Much higher on holidays like Mother's day/Father's day, New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day, etc."
1394,"23 here living in the bay area. It was definitely the hardest thing moving back in with my parents especially after living with my friends and gf for 4 years. I think what helped me out the most was to go out as much as possible and stay busy. But when you are home maintain a healthy relationship with them. i.e. take initiative in doing chores, cooking, buying groceries, cleaning etc..."
1395,"Did I write this? I’m 22 next month, living at home still, working a crappy job, and there’s no way I’d be able to move out of my parents house for another 2 or 3+ years because King County is so expensive!"
1396,"Culture has a huge role. In some, staying with parents for a while/until marriage is normal. In others, much less so. 

I think in the U.S. at least it's becoming more common for adults to live at home, yet there's still a social expectation and pressure (from yourself, from friends, and from family in some cases) to be on your own at a certain point.

It can also be a difficult transition for those of us who have gone away for college. The people we become, the things we do, and how we live our lives while at college may be very different from the people we were and what we did when living with our parents prior, especially if you have traveled far to attend college in a completely new area.

Even if one doesn't change all that much, it can still be hard to go from ""independent individual"" for four+ years living by yourself in your own place or with friends/roommates, to ""adult child"" living under your parents' roof, perhaps in the same place you grew up in. It's a new environment and relationship dynamic that must be navigated."
1397,"I think it's a preference thing. Some want to get away from toxic environments. I personally love living at home. Home cooked meals? Not dealing with obnoxious neighbors in an apartment complex? I took a year to live in a dorm and I'm very glad to live at home. Plus, I'm helping renovate the house for the day it is given to me. It's a pretty good deal, in my opinion."
1398,"I moved back home last year right after college much like yourself (I’m 23M). At first it was kind of annoying because my parents are strict and the last four years I could do whatever I want, when I wanted and now it wasn’t like that. I actually had to answer someone and it was awful, I couldn’t wait to move out. But after realizing how much I’m saving living at home (after expenses, I save around 2,000 a month) I can deal with it. I had a talk with them about how I’m not 14 any more which they appreciated and respected surprisingly. 

No shame in saving some money while getting on your feet. Rent outside of college towns can get pretty pricy."
1399,Yep! I wait tables and its great
1400,"I don’t get why you guys feel ashamed about living with your parents!!, where I’m from, regardless of gender, if you’re not married, you stay with your parents, no big deal!"
1401,"I live at home with my parents (Age 23). I’m currently in grad school getting my masters degree, so it saves me a lot of money living at home. As another poster said, this just comes down to not caring what other people think. You focus on living your life and being the best possible version of yourself. Everything else is just irrelevant."
1402,"Wow, thank you so much for sharing! It means a lot to me. It’s amazing to me that people can be in different situations and live different lives but still have the same underlying feelings. I love being a human. You are also not alone and I wish you luck and contentedness. 😊"
1403,It's human nature to thing the grass is always greener but sometimes you just need to be content and realize what you have and where you're at is actually pretty good !
1404,"“The grass is always greener on the other side. “
“No... the grass is greener where you water it “ - unknown"
1405,"Geography does matter. Different regions have different cultures and there is a massive difference between urban, rural, and suburban lifestyles.

I wouldn’t expect to relive your college days; that kind of carefree fun, easy bonding, and high level of trust is characteristic of a good college experience. Careers and families get in the way of this in the real world.

If you get lucky, you could imitate it. Develop your own little close knit community. Replicating the past is impossible though."
1406,"I think geography totally matters depending on you and your circumstances. I’m 22, still in my hometown and I desperately want out. But it’s all about mindset too I think. I have to set smaller goals for myself so I know I won’t always be here. I know some people love staying/going back to their hometown but I know it isn’t for me. Life can be better where you make it and where you are happy!! Root yourself where you want to be planted, you know? It might take some time and some moving over the years, but I’ve held on to that since I was a kid."
1407,"Wow, that is so amazing!! Congrats to you guys (: the thing that is holding us back is that both of our families live in the same area, which is close to where we live, and we want to eventually have children. Both sides of the family completely guilt trip us when we ever even mention moving now 😂 my mother in law literally tells me we don’t see her enough every single time we are together (which feels like every other weekend 😭) so it makes me feel like the time we are actually with her means nothing to her because all she can focus on is when we don’t see her. Which is similar to me focusing on the negative parts of where I am in life right now instead of the good."
1408,"I understand, and went through similar. Eventually we decided our happiness wasn’t worth their desire to be near us. For the first year or two we got a lot of extra guilt and tears but eventually that slowed down. Now they are just happy to see/hear from us because they know if they try and guilt us or anything we won’t call for a few weeks. It also makes the time we have together much better. Plus if you do have kids they will change their tune and come visit. I have many expat friends who’s parents never had any interest to visit them u TIL they had kids. 

Just ask your family if they want you to be happy. It’s a catch 22 because either they say yes and you leave or then say no and realize how selfish they are and you leave. Remember you can always come home."
1409,"Thank you so much! 
You said it so right: I love being a human."
1410,Thank you so much for sharing this! My husband is constantly trying to help me not live for other people and its really a challenging thing for me because I am a peace-keeping-people-pleaser 😂 I genuinely care more about his own parents/family’s feelings than he does. I think his family knows this about him and me so they constantly call me for everything and don’t even try with him anymore because they know I care 😂 Maybe moving is the actual answer and I’ve just been listening to the wrong peoples advice (my own family and my husbands family) Ive been blocking the drive to move with all the guilt from others and haven’t even thought about what is better for me and my husband.
1411,"I think you need to think about what's best for you, your husband, and your future family. It may include being near family. But it also may not. 

Try to think about yourself and your life years from now. Are you going to regret leaving? Or are you going to regret staying? Are you going to be content with your life, or will you be thinking about the ""what if""?

IMO pleasing others and keeping the peace is important, but not if you can't please yourself as well. In my experience people also only have as much power as you give them."
1412,"Maybe it would be helpful to live in a more urban area where there’s more to do? I don’t know what your hometown is like, but I know for my wife and I, living in a big city near our friends was important to us after college. I think there’s also something about moving back to your hometown that might feel inherently regressive and limiting... Maybe you could compromise by finding someplace close to at least a couple of friends but still close enough to family to visit regularly."
1413,"I am in a similar situation, and for me it's mostly because of cost. I'm living in a smaller city because the major metro areas are so overpriced and I haven't yet found a way to make that work.

Like you, I feel grateful for what I have here, and I know that I should be thankful that I have generally nice neighbors, a sparkling clean and new grocery store, a mall, a place to have a beer, a taco place, and some volunteering opportunities which I really enjoy. And the area is very safe.

But I don't feel alive. I'm not meeting new people, I don't have anything to do on nights and weekends other than go do things on my own or go to the gym. It's very lonely. I am a ""high key"" person, and this area seems to have nothing that's high key or an exciting vibe. 

The area also seems to have attracted people who like it this way. People here are very introverted. 

I agree with the other comment or who said that American culture seems to have changed. I remember living in a town like this years ago, but people were always outside, and would stop by, or would invite you to things. 

There was definitely better nightlife 10 years ago, and that has dried up. The culture seems to have changed so that the only places that you can really be social and have fun, are the big cities, and they're expensive.

There's also a lot of young adults who stay home and smoke weed by themselves for hours every night. That actually seems to have become a thing. The last THREE apartment complexes I lived in, the smell of marijuana was constant. And these were middle class or upper class neighborhoods and tenants. They were quiet and good neighbors except for the smell. I literally never saw them other than coming and going from work, and I never saw them have anyone visit. 

This rattles me, not because of the drug, but because they're so alone. My impression was always that people smoked up because it brought them together, they would laugh with each other and do ridiculous things and get closer and and bond with each other. That's how it was in the 90's. I don't think it's healthy that these young adults are sitting by themselves seven nights a week.

I guess weed, video games, and unlimited movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime have really changed the culture in the U.S. It's unfortunately possible for a person to completely seclude themselves other than the bare minimum of social interaction."
1414,"I would encourage you to move if you have the means. Life is short see the world. 

I joined the service right out of college. I’ve lived all over the country and been all over the world. My challenge now is that our most recent duty station has been amazing. Especially the neighborhood we live in. We party hard on the weekends and during the week the place is pleasantville. My family doesn’t want to leave again. We still got a couple of years left here but I don’t regret the life I’ve led post college."
1415,"I feel the same way, except I did things in a different order. I want to move away, sometimes by myself, and just explore. The only thing I have keeping me here is my fiance and my parents. If I were able to convince my fiance to move away, I would do it."
1416,"Everything your experiencing is completely normal, it’s something that everyone experiences shortly after college. Myself and my wife experienced it when we moved closer to home because of the eventual passing of my ailing father. Through my 20’s and into my early 30’s we lived in a city and constantly had friends around and were going out all the time. Now things have changed a bit, we have a beautiful baby boy and value being social with friends but also have shifted our priorities to our careers and family. All in all, you will have the ability to make new friends and find out what’s best for you and your husband, but just keep in mind that life is short, do what makes you happy but understand the value of having your loved ones around you. If your in a position were you think moving to a bigger city is more important to being closer to your family I would do it. You will learn a lot about yourself and your relationship with your loved one."
1417,"This is a really interesting perspective to think about because when we first moved back here, we lived really really close to the nearest big city.. like literally minutes away from where all these huge concerts are and we had roommates and now that I think of it we actually did things all the time! It was awesome! Then we moved closer to where my husband works and bought a 4 bedroom fixer upper in a suburb and have no roommates and I feel so much more isolated. But we still do things in the city. Just not as often lol this is our first owned house so I feel guilty the second I even think about moving because I feel like we have to live here forever 😂"
1418,Yes! Thank you! That is exactly what my lifestyle was like the whole time I lived in my college town. I have a huge family here and a few friends but even though I live closer to them I feel more isolated than ever. I completely agree on the taboo thing because so far the people we have made friends with here think that is just a bizarre concept and they have their own lives. It’s got me thinking maybe Im subconsciously some sick twisted person who just wants people to be co-dependent on me?!? Lol I’m driving myself nuts when in reality I think I just get my energy from other people’s energy (:
1419,"I am a teacher and my wife is a Personal trainer/physio. 

I have a Masters though as I had trouble adjusting to life after school so I went back. That allowed us to live and work in Canada, the US, England, & Australia. If I hadn’t gotten that Masters I wouldn’t have been qualified to teach in Canada or Australia as their standards are higher than the US/England"
1420,"Don’t feel guilty! My brother in law bought a house and sold it a year later. People do stuff like that, and it’s not the worst. You gotta do what works for you sometimes!"
1421,"So I think it is partly a culture change in how we live life together now. While faith has not been consistent for me, the biggest thing I miss from childhood was my parents being the de facto singles home group. We had twenty early-20s to mid-30s randomly show up at our house throughout the week in addition to every week for church group.

In a non-faith area, there was always someone’s house we could all show up at on a whim to hangout even if the friend wasn’t there. I had that all from elementary school through college. So between that and the singles I grew up in the atmosphere you’re talking about.

Now I’ve struggled to know anyone that quite does that. And I can tell my parents feel the same way as they’re always offering people (not me or my sibling, just friends) to just stop in for dinner or drinks.

I think it is so much easier to keep yourself entertained, find something to do, and culturally taboo to show up without meticulous planning."
1422,"I might be an awful reader, but I didn’t see any mention of a job in your post (though I might’ve missed it!)- so if you don’t have one already, perhaps throw around the idea of taking on part time work, or finding a fresh new hobby? It sounds ridiculous, but working retail part-time and taking up pottery have been game changers for me, and simply getting out of the house to go meet with people at regular intervals has been a big help. I hope you start feeling better in your environment- whether you stay or move- very very soon. 😊"
1423,"List the things that make you happy when you do them. Is there some reason you can’t do those things where you are now?

Remember, “No matter where you go, there you are.”"
1424,Thank you for saying this. As I was writing out my post I had the realization that my contentedness is what the issue is and I think maybe I can start by just writing out things I’m grateful for and reflecting on it or something? Might be small but it’s worth a try. I’m just looking for any practices I can do to stay grounded and be in the moment (:
1425,"Thank you! Haha I love your comment. The friends and family we have here seem to be much more content with what I consider “doing nothing!” Which I know sounds harsh but I’m someone who also loves Netflix, video games, hobbies I do on my own, etc. but even though that is considered doing something I feel like I’m wasting my time and not actually doing anything! I actually wish I was more content doing those things but in the back of my head I’m constantly thinking “wow this is such a waste of time, I should be doing something else or something productive or more meaningful.” My husband is someone who ONLY lives in the now and hates thinking about the future (for his own personal growth). He is always content with what he is doing and I actually envy it so much. I know I might sound like a jerk but I’m completely serious. When he gets off work and can relax and enjoy it and just look at and focus on what’s directly in front of him, I look up to him so much."
1426,"I guess I literally haven’t even considered how normal that actually is. Now that I think back on it my friends parents moved a lot, even just to move right down the street sometimes lol. I did when I was renting but we always told ourselves back then that if/when we buy a house, it’ll be our last stop, forever home lol. I think I’m psyching myself out too much about how it will look to others too. Like our siblings and friends have not been able to afford a house, so I feel like us buying one, only to move on and buy another a couple years later, would be like a huge slap in the face to them... does that make sense? Maybe I’m overthinking it?"
1427,"I’ve always felt like life would be better if I left my city. I’ve lived in NYC all my life and I feel stifled here. I’m interviewing for a job this Wednesday that’s based deep in NJ and even though I wanted to move farther away, maybe this is the start I need."
1428,Whoever said the geography doesn’t matter probably never left their hometown. It matters. Places are worlds apart
1429,"Yeh dude the grind is real and it's not you grinding it out it's work grinding you down.

You need a holiday.

Ultimately what you'll want is comfort and if you've got that now then the next thing you'll want is excitement which seems to be where you're at.

Take a holiday.

Your working every day of the week and living for the weekends. The same things are happening on repeat and it's boring af.

Go on vacation.

You want to see more of the world and I know because everyone gets that travel itch. It's a beautiful world out there for now and you want to enjoy it while you can.

It's time for a break in the routine."
1430,"Unfortunately the only way to adapt is to just do it.  Let it suck when it does, of course look for new friends, but basically, when life changes, it changes and there's nothing you can do about it other than adapt. 

People are highly adaptable though. Remember, there are millions of people who have gotten used to prisons and jails.  They sleep like babies, wake up and eat food they didn't cook and don't like, they wait for the one day a week they get clean clothes, or go outside...and they're fine.  They WANT to be somewhere else, but they make the best of where they are.  It may even be easier for them than you bc the choice was taken from them.

That does t mean that YOU don't deserve to be disappointed about moving on, but it hopefully helps you see how people are very very adaptable.

Good luck!"
1431,Fuck the cold. I’m thinking about moving to California after I save up for a year. What do you do for work?
1432,"I suffer through it. I hate it. Every day I’m thinking, “I need to quit this shithole.” I need the money though, and it’s near impossible for someone like me who has no skills or talents to find a better paying job."
1433,"> I also recognize that I go utterly insane and get depressed after about a week of being home all day, so I'd rather be at work 5 days a week than do that again.

I feel this. I recognize that sometimes I'd probably like to work less, but in an ideal world I would still probably work or volunteer in some capacity just to feel productive and like I'm doing something meaningful with my time. It feels good to know I'm getting stuff done."
1434,"I feel you. I'm the same way, my first job after graduation was ok although super boring (and I had to drive an hour each way). I came up with excuses all the time (food poisoning, migraines, deliveries, dentist appointments ...) whatever I could think of. Going to bed at night and waking up in the mornings my thinking was always 'how do people do this 5x a week' and 'this sucks, I don't want to spend my whole day at work'... I wish I had advice to give you because I could benefit from the same advice. 5 years later and I've had a few different jobs, some are better than others, but I still find it nauseating to have to sacrifice 5/7 of my days so that I can be a 'productive member of society'. I think it comes down to finding a job that aligns with your goals and dreams where the work is worth doing.

Still looking for mine, good luck to you!"
1435,"Can’t help you with talents, but skills are learnable!"
1436,"I think most people suffer and pretend they aren't, and then take their misery out on others.

It sucks. Work sucks. It's sad that we accept this."
1437,Are they fairly compensating you for that labour?
1438,"Chill weekends are key to preparing for the week. I’m 22 yrs old and I try to limit going out with my friends to once a weekend (Fri or Sat) but I make sure Sunday I get the rest I need for my mental and physical. 

You need that time to yourself!"
1439,Yep. No complaints on my end
1440,"I’m quite an idealistic person, so while at school I was happy to work hard and study because my goal seemed so tangible and great, but now at work I feel it will be impossible to end up where I want to, despite being in the right field and position to do so. Work sucks. I agree."
1441,"I enjoy my job. I enjoy what I do and I like the people I work with. I like being productive. Having different projects to work on keeps it interesting and fresh. I think it helps a lot if you like your job. 

I try to find little things I appreciate and can look forward throughout the day too, like my coffee in the morning or my daily walk.

I think it also significantly helps me that I work from home. I can sleep in more because I don't have a commute. I can start work in my pajamas if I want and take my time getting ready. When I take a break I don't feel guilty like I have to be doing work because no one sees me. When I'm done with work for the day I'm already home. 

Can you do less on the weekends? Could you set aside a Saturday or Sunday or a full weekend every once and a while and just rest and recharge? 

Can you look for a better job that you may enjoy more? 

If you are struggling with your mental health, I would also encourage you to please talk to someone. Having better mental health and a better outlook on life may improve your well-being. I've been there and it's so hard to see the light when you're surrounded by darkness."
1442,"I try to have a similar mindset to you, but I am working an 8 to 5 office job for minimum wage. $8.75  as I am technically an intern, yet I am doing a ton of work, filling in for a person on medical leave and sick leave. So its hard for me to feel that motivated when I know I should be getting paid way more."
1443,Welp I need to get out of this kitchen I work in then.
1444,[deleted]
1445,"I’ve hated all the jobs I’ve had, mostly because they weren’t skilled or meaningful jobs as I took a bit longer to get my degree.  But I actually found working life very freeing.


Why?  Because after work, my time was my own.  Set aside one day for chores or whatever.  The rest is for you!  Every day I would meet someone, read, learn a song on piano, volunteer somewhere, go for a walk.  You can’t save those things for the weekends or you’ll be living for the weekends, which sucks.

I liked that, differently than student life, I could go home and not feel guilty that I’m not studying.  It truly is freeing.  

What I suggest is signing up for some weekly things that will bring you community, knowledge, joy, or both.  One of the things I did is start taking weekly Spanish lessons, as I have always dreamt of learning the language and I also didn’t want my life to work and home.  If I had the money, I would take martial arts classes as well.  

Hope this helps!"
1446,It is important to know not everyone loves it. Most of us just push through.
1447,"Kitchens, to my understanding, are largely a nightmare to work in. I hope you can find a more positive environment."
1448,"I take planned mental health days. Things getting too rough? It’s time for me to leave. I have the flexibility at my job just to let my bosses know with a week’s heads up that I’ll be out on X day (I usually take a Friday off). Unless your company is paying you back for your unused PTO or it rolls over, you’re not doing yourself any favors."
1449,"I have chronic illnesses as well and I sympathize. It can make basic things seem insurmountable. But you’re not a bad employee for needing to take care of yourself and everyone has different ways of coping. 

I like to remind myself that people show their best side often and we don’t get to see their daily struggles. While they may not look like they’re having a hard time, someone could be dealing with something just as much as you are. 

What helped me was remembering I’m only human and I need to be kind to myself and do what I can to ensure I can thrive. Work/life balance and a job that I like helps. Additionally, going to a good therapist regularly helped me cut down on my mental health days and gave me the tools to handle when I’m feeling down emotionally. 

Getting a good primary care physician can also be empowering. Mine helped me identify a lot of my health problems and helped me get to the specialists I needed. I definitely feel more control of my life and health now more than ever. 

An 8-5 is possible but if that’s not what you need, also consider a job or ask if you can work remotely. There are things you can do to balance your work, life and health. Remember to be kind to yourself!

ETA: have you been diagnosed with depression? Or have had other things checked (like thyroid or blood sugar) to see what may be causing you to calling in?"
1450,"I do in fact enjoy my job, but I am in a difficult personal situation right now that makes me feel so mentally exhausted. I’m 19 years old and spending a summer in my home town with a relative whom I hate to go to this job and get experience to pad my resume. Since I am so young, I don’t have flexibility at work because I am technically an intern. I have talked to people in the past about my mental health, but right now I am not insured and cannot afford a therapist on an $8.75 wage. Also, my friends currently don’t give a shit, so it’s hard to talk to them as well because they only care about partying atm."
1451,Paid time off.
1452,You mentioned in another comment that you're going back to school in a month. You should have access to free counseling sessions through your school.
1453,"The end-date is unclear. I go back to school in a month (thank god), but when I was hired there was talk about me coming back to intern for them winters and summers if I do well. We haven’t spoke about it since, but I feel like they will keep me as an intern if I can only work seasonally, until I graduate. What do you think? Also I was thinking of lining up other internships so when next summer comes around, I can use the other internship with better pay as leverage if I grow some balls to do that.


It’s very intimidating to talk to my boss because I am the intern at the bottom of the totem pole, and he is the CFO and COO."
1454,"I have the same problem, and my mom has it too. She’s bipolar and wasn’t diagnosed until I was about 20. She self medicates. She’s textbook alcoholic and smokes weed like crazy. I also got close to being just as bad as her.

My dad tolerates it with my mom, but my husband doesn’t tolerate it with me, and that’s really the only reason I’m still somewhat okay.

I just started a new job in April and my husband is working from home now. Him working from home is the only thing that made me start going to work every day, and it’s saved my life. Besides, half the time when I was calling out something crazy would come up at work and then I’d either feel terrible or just get in trouble for not being around to fix it.

Plus when other people are covering for you they might notice that one task you didn’t do you’ve been trying to sweep under the rug. Or those papers you never filed. It’s just less stressful to be at work. Fuck, if there’s nothing to do at work find a way to get some training or personal/leadership/production development done.

And just keep your eye on the ~~prize~~ paycheck/PTO balance.

Edit; whoa, idk how I got downvoted already lmao bots? Or is this really bad advice?"
1455,"I’ll look into that, thank you!"
1456,Mothafucking money baby. In all seriousness experience as well. More experience in my field means I can go from a warehouse job to an office job. Right now working on boats and hoping to get a job for 3d modelling or cost analysis.
1457,"Like some other commentators, I’m having a blast doing my own thing freelancing and working from home. Quite literally no two days are alike. I wake up fairly early and get going on the day with some exercise, which I highly recommend if you’re able to! Just 15 to 30 minutes of brisk waking or jogging in the morning can really brighten your day up.

I then make sure my wife has everything ready and she goes off to work as a nurse at a clinic, and I stay home working as a translator. I come across a lot of different kinds of translation material, and I’m learning new things constantly to be able to translate. 

Apart from work I really get out of the house often. I live in Japan and try to go to Japanese language classes around twice a week taught by older volunteers, I volunteer teach English to a group of Japanese seniors once a month, and meet up with other various English-speaking friends maybe once or twice a week. My wife and I also plan out things to do together whenever we can, and make sure to go on vacation and take time off often.

It may not seem all worth it at the moment, but if you widen up your headspace a little bit and treat every day as an adventure, it becomes worth it. If your current intern position doesn’t challenge you or put you in the right state of mind, it’s within your very right to pursue bigger and better things for yourself. 

Good luck out there!"
1458,"Got fired from my job for this reason. Sell drugs, steal shit, and landscape. My life is 100 times better. Never define your self worth by what capitalism tells you is your value."
1459,"> I don’t know, for the life of me, how everyone gets up to go to work every day. 

First of all, I'm somewhat extroverted, so I *need* to get out of my apartment and talk to people. Work is one of the ways I do this during the week; I have a job where I'm constantly talking to coworkers, users, and other people, so work is one of the ways I satisfy that emotional need. Some times I'll work from home, but if I do it for more than a day at a time, I start going stir-crazy.

Is work my favorite way to spend my time? No. I'd much rather wake up, go to the gym in the mornings, then just meet my friends out for lunch, and then spend all afternoon on a beach with them, but that's not realistic.

While I don't always enjoy my work, I typically feel some sense of accomplishment when I hit a goal or complete a task. You don't have to love going into the office every day (this is unrealistic, and anyone who claims they love everything about their job is full of shit), but you should find something(s) about that you enjoy, or at least find intellectually stimulating.

> I find myself needing a mental health day pretty much monthly 

I think this is pretty normal, I take at least one day off each month. It doesn't matter how many hours you work, it matters how much you accomplish and what results you achieve. Try reframing your metric for success in terms of tasks and goals, not hours worked."
1460,"Honestly the only thing that helped me get up to work was fluoxetine. Your reaction to SSRIs may vary, but it can be life changing for some."
1461,That sounds really rewarding. What do you freelance?
1462,[deleted]
1463,"That once you become an adult your only purpose is to work and die?

That it's ironic how much (fake) care is given to kids and yanked away as soon as you come of age?

I mean, it's really remarkable when you hear all the shit talk about ""the children"" and ""the future,"" because none of that exists when you can no longer be used as that sort of talking point. The opposite sort of talking point, sure.

When people want to moan about how bad the current generation is or how the world is going to shit, they ought to think about how unrealistic these expectations are."
1464,"This is how I operate as well. It’s very comforting realizing no one gives a fuck about you, so all that anxiety/fear you have is wasted energy, let it go and do what you want to do."
1465,"I consider myself lucky to live in a country that offers social support if things go really bad. Like if you’re sick you’ll be taken care of, etc... but we cant rely on that, what we really need is people we know who can support us. No longer live near your parents? I think its time to make a family with some new friends. Humans are social creatures, we win by supporting each other. 

Someone nearby you is probably feeling the exact same way, wouldnt it be awesome if you could be each others support? 
 
Just something to think about. Hope u find what u need <3 


“Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving... you will come to a better place.”"
1466,Do you personally practice that outlook?
1467,This. I feel exactly like this. Like I’ve been going through a tough time recently and no I’m not expecting anyone to stop what they’re doing to help me. But shit wouldn’t it be nice if someone checked in? But it’s fine I can handle it I guess
1468,"THIS. We’re social creatures by nature, if you can develop a community of friends, even a small one(quality is always better than quantity, remember that!!) you’ll still be responsible for a lot of the sucky things that happen in adult life but you’ll at least have that emotional support network that good friends can provide that it seems like you’re craving. And when the chips of down and things *really* go sideways, hopefully you can have *really* good friends by your side that can help you get through those *really* tough times"
1469,"While I personally agree with you (my family is great and I know they’re always there for me, especially when others haven't been), not everyone has that same support system. Family isn’t everything for everyone. Sometimes people have terrible family members, unfortunately."
1470,"You're on the early track of life too. Responsibility only increases...wait until you have a spouse and kids. You'll almost totally disregard your own issues so you can focus on protection and preservation of lives more important than your own.

Make no mistake though, it's absolutely glorious. I'll take the pain just to see my wife and kids look at me with love because that my friend is what it's all about.

My best advice to you is to make the effort to get hard. Your capabilities will only increase with exposure as will your confidence. Do things that scare you, things that make you uncomfortable. Life is about overcoming. 

We are all scared sometimes my friend. You can be scared though and still move forward."
1471,"The song ""Ain't it Fun"" is about being an adult and being on your own, but it's more specifically about being on your own after moving from a small-ish place to a big city. YMMV, but I find that in big cities, it's oddly MORE difficult to find friends and build a community even though there's more people and more social events/social opportunities. I don't know why this is, but I think it's because people and events are more easily replaced. Fight with your girlfriend? Well, it's easy to break up because there's plenty of other ladies in the city. Don't see eye to eye with a friend of yours? Just ghost them and fall out of contact, there's plenty other people with hobbies/interests in common with you. Invited out to an event you don't really want to go to, but are afraid to say no? Find something else happening that day and then say ""Oh man, I WOULD go to your event, but I already signed up for this OTHER thing.""

/u/bayfarm, put yourself out there and make a lot of friends, so if one or two flake out on you, you have others. Volunteer somewhere, use Meetup.com, try to befriend coworkers and roommates, etc etc. Basically what has already been said. 

Another thing I think you're getting it is that adulthood isn't one problem at a time. It's lots of issues at once. I can handle an unexpected medical bill or a car repair bill. I can handle supporting a sick elderly relative. But if your car gets a flat tire on your way to visit your grandpa who just had heart surgery and you also have work the next day...that's a lot. And learning to deal with that is part of being adult."
1472,"It sounds like you live in a place where you have not much community sense around. Is there any volunteer work, sports team recreational/club, yoga school, meetup group for nature walks, anything you like, that you could join and regularly be involved in?"
1473,"Well, yeah, most people don’t care about you. The world is a cruel and heartless place.

But there are plenty of other people out there who feel exactly like you do. It takes effort, but you can find likeminded people who empathize with you. You can create a social network of people who care about one another. 

Those relationships are what make life worth living."

1476,"Only recently. I've been stupid during my teenage years by following the bullshit trend of trying to be 'perfect' and 'pure' at the expense of not putting myself out there and making mistakes. I should have been making mistakes and failing because it would have allowed me to grow more. But better late than never.

&#x200B;

There's also a weird psychological element of it too. I don't have any siblings and I don't have as many friends as I'd like (which is not a good thing!), so in a way I can afford to embarrass myself since nobody's around to judge me.

&#x200B;

Graduating has low-key been a blessing in disguise.

1477,Those would help.
1478,And those relationships don’t always last forever. The foundation starts with loving yourself first so you don’t crumble.
1479,"Honestly, no one is ever going to care for you as much as you care for yourself. You just have to have that mindset and be your best caretaker. That’s just my opinion, it sucks to think about it but I do believe that you have to care and be your own best friend first."
1480,"I have felt that way many times in my life. Some were situational as I assumed new responsibilities in life. No matter how well prepared I was to go off to college or move a thousand miles away from home, etc.  sometimes it was about spiritual growth and knowing I was finding my own way. It can be lonely as hell but sometimes it’s the only way. I have great support dealing with life threatening illnesses that have tested my resolve beyond any words I have to explain it all with. My surgeon could find no one like me in the medical literature. I’ve been so very grateful for all that support, but I’m in those operating rooms being worked on alone. My friends don’t sit in the dialysis chair for me. They did not have sores from chemo nor have their skin slough off from radiation burns. It can be scary as all get out and calming at other times. Welcome to life as an adult"
1481,I feel a lot less people would feel this way if we back to mentorship and apprenticeship. I feel the exact same way and am scared now leaving college that I might not find everything I am looking for. I am scared that I am running from problems when facing them. And I feel like I should be doing more with my time. It really all comes down to what you want. We have been on this clock since Kindergarten. Each assignment. Each test and quiz. Each year of school all decided for us and now we make our own clock. It’s all about perspective just figure out where you want to be and make it happen. No need waiting for others to help you decide. It’s up to you.

People stand for you through everything. Good or bad or worse. Even if you kill someone. 
Those are - your mom. Your dad. Your brother/sister. 

And don’t get me wrong. This doesn’t mean I am demeaning friends and cousins. It’s just that the way we feel for them and they feel for us, irrespective of differences or distances will always be different. 
So no one actually cares except them."
1485,I think it's because there's too many people in the city. It's hard to truly be connected to anyone. People come and go real quick.

1489,Of course. Personally I’ve never felt alone in the way OP did. You have the power to not be alone.
1490,That’s me & I’m in highschool.
1491,"Yeah, I understand. It doesn’t help that you have no time to hang with friends that make you appreciate the little things in life."
1492,"Nothin’ wrong with being introverted. I’m introverted and have some really great introverted friends, we just don’t feel the need to constantly hang out and go out and do random stuff. But we collaborate on things and play stuff online and hang out every now and then. Sounds like the issue you have with your old friends is more that you don’t have much in common with them. 

Sorry guess I just took issue with the tone. Introverts don’t have to be boring, Western society just paints us that way and won’t let us forget it."
1493,"No it does and I definitely agree. I feel like we are friends because of our social status in school.

Some are still great to hang with because they also went to uni and have also engaged with new people and new experiences which (same with me) has brought them out of their shell more."
1494,"> It’s not that they don’t want to hang out with me, they’re just boring, awful people

I’ve got bad news for ya man. They don’t want to hang out with you.

Just accept that you have better friends at college and move on."
1495,"> calls them boring and wants “better” friends

> feels surprised they are making excuses not to hang out

Lmao"
1496,That’s good to hear for you getting away. I’m very eager to do the same :)
1497,You sound like a typical douche who thinks he is better then others that didn't go to college. They are more then happy to not hangout with you I wouldn't worry mate
1498,"We do hang out. I probably could have phrased it better, we do hang out but it’s usually the same, dull thing every time.

Also I didn’t say ‘awful’ so quote me better next time."
1499,"Was going to chime in and agree with you. 

That said, you can just tell from OP’s tone that they weren’t trying to insult introverts as it had way more to do with moving on and not having things in common."
1500,"I never left home, but once I started going to school, I realized how lame my friends were. They just sat around and smoked weed, then got average jobs they didn’t care for, but paid the bills. It’s just average people shit, there’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s like they never even had dreams. Their only passion was getting stoned and living paycheck to paycheck."
1501,"My friends and I are probably in the minority but we all grew up together and stayed closed friends through and after school. We mostly all went to different colleges, some in different states, but gravitated back to each other when we were done. We all made friends in college but none of them actually became part of our core group. 

I consider myself really lucky to have known these people most of my life and to stay so close as we grew up. Most people (like you) find more like minded friends in college because you *want* to be there and you’re studying similar things. It just makes sense. I had the unique opportunity of being super excited to come back home every time and reconnect with my “real” friends again."
1502,"Sorry if my tone came off harsh, I was annoyed while writing the post. But I have nothing against introverts at all."
1503,"I think there are a lot of factors that could go into this.
 
- Your friends from home probably aren’t boring - it could be that you all have realized you have different interests/not much in common in your life now so the only topics of conversation that can apply to everyone in the group are about people/things like you said. It’s not that your friends only care about these things, but that they feel like they can’t talk about the things they really care about with everyone. 
- There isn’t much to do in your area - assuming you’re from a smaller town. It’s not that your friends don’t want to try new things or go out, or that they only want to stay in, it’s just that there isn’t much to do as compared to the city your university is in. 
-  Perception/personal bias. You might have a bias that your hometown is lame, how could anyone be happy there, city life/people are inherently more interesting and cool, etc. and that you’re projecting this onto your friends. If this is the case, it’s pretty likely your friends are picking up on it and notice you treat them as “less than” so they don’t want to engage in conversation or hang out/do fun things as much with you. 

Just some things to think about, I guess. I’ve been in the opposite position where I went to school near my hometown and my friends went to the city and then came back totally different (not to say I didn’t change) and treated me like I wasn’t as cool as their other friends, like I don’t know anything, etc. even though I’m far from some dumb redneck hick who hates city life and doesn’t know anything about the world. I get where you’re coming from but it might be helpful to know how your friends feel too."
1504,"Oh man. I had the exact same experience after my freshman year. I went back to my home country, had dinner with my high school friends. And the entire time we hung out they talked about people or things (actual physical things). The topics of conversation ranged between the latest gossip or the branded purse one of them purchased last week. I couldn’t even keep up the conversation long enough for dinner. 
I had gotten to discussing ideas, politics, thoughts, experiences; and this type of empty conversation was just no longer interesting enough for me. 

I think they also felt the same way: that we no longer had much in common and we all moved on..so don’t feel too bad. Just keep the door a bit ajar and let them know that you’ll be there if they needed your support/company.

Edit: in terms of making new friends in your hometown, I highly recommend the meetup app. It shows you meetups near you based on your interests. I’ve met plenty of great people through it so it hasn’t failed to deliver!

Edit2: the meetup app is assuming you live in the US haha. If you aren’t from the US like me, then I recommend using other social media apps to find like-minded people who seem interesting. For me, that has been reddit+Twitter. I met a lot of LGBT folks from my country on twitter, a feat that would’ve been impossible without social media. Good luck!"
1505,i dont have a lot of back home friends from HS in the first place :ok hand emoji:
1506,"‘Keep the door a bit ajar’ is such a great way to put it. OP sometimes friendships and commonalities come back around. Full circle kinda. Not with every friend obviously, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised after having felt similarly to how you’re feeling and reconnecting years later. Super genuine and rewarding."
1507,"Yes! I was looking at Instagram recently in a while and god, I hate all the high school memories. I never really made any close friends and thought there was something wrong with me for the longest time. Turns out, when you leave a small town, it’s infinitely easier to find someone to connect to. I have plenty of great friends in Uni that I don’t deserve, but I feel so blessed ☺️"
1508,"No offense to OP, but you kinda sound like a 20 year who goes to Coachella or something and then comes home and says things like “oh man back at the festy we used to do stuff like this” and wears his bracelets everywhere for months. Kinda like that episode of the office where Michael comes back from Jamaica and wants to play steel drums and has beads in his hair. 

Everyone’s in different stages of life, even if they are boring...if they’re happy you can be their friend and they can be boring too."
1509,"I have yet to go back to where I graduated high school from but I already know I wouldn’t get along with any of them anymore.

Most of the people still there are either in jail, had kids at a young age, got married to someone from their class, meth heads, or drug dealers.

It sucks but sometimes it’s life. Just gotta keep moving forward, you’ll find new people!"
1510,"i absolutely feel this!

to be honest, i’m still trying to overcome my mental health issues and because of that, i don’t have many friends at uni, but my friends at home are even more boring than i am - like, boring to the point where they would genuinely rather sit inside with their grandparents all day instead of taking the train to the city closest to us for a day out. it’s painful. making plans is like pulling teeth and i end up sitting at home all day every summer until i can move back to my uni city months earlier than i expected to. 

sadly, i don’t have any advice on how to make new friends at home, since i live in a really weird tiny town where the only available people here never actually made it to uni - but i really know exactly how you feel!"
1511,"this is literally me rn, moving to a uni 6+hrs away in sept in hopes exactly this will happen :)"
1512,[removed]
1513,Same here. My closest friends are all from my hometown. I made some good friends in college but lacked a deep connection with them.
1514,"Not necessarily my friends, but the general “back home”. My area is also quite rural and has a pretty sizable “redneck” population. Being at school in a suburban/urban setting has exposed me to all sorts of things. My family constantly teases me about wanting to go back to school since I say I miss the city all the time.

I took my friend out for boba and it was his first time, and he asked why we don’t have anything like this closer (we had to go 45 minutes out to the nearest suburb). That kinda made me laugh. But you aren’t alone OP, I understand how you feel. I just hope that our friends get to experience cultures and ideas that we have."
1515,[deleted]
1516,"I always found myself as an introvert. But I feel that some people use that as an excuse these days. At the end of the day, you can't be the only one to be proactive or driving all the time. Friendship is a two way street imo.

Like I prefer smaller groups of close friends. Out of my highschool I only talk to a handful of people, but I am fine and happy where I am. But I am not afraid to meet new people or try new things."
1517,"No, but I do find them incredibly irresponsible and immature. I still love them, but I'm glad that I moved because I'm pretty sure if I would have stayed I wouldn't have been as successful. They all smoke copious amounts of weed and have no goals. 

Note: I have nothing against weed, but at a certain point it does become a problem"
1518,"Why are people like this? It’s just astounding to me. Like ffs, how can you have such little intrigue and passion? How can just sitting around all day stimulate you? It’s absolutely nuts. I really wish there was a place where you could meet people who were always up for doing interesting stuff and not dropping out of plans last minute."
1519,No worries :)
1520,I think there’s a big difference between watching reruns and going to the museum or exploring parks. Can you explain why you consider them to be the same or what wouldn’t be “rote entertainment” to you?
1521,"So, and this is just clarification, you don’t consider museums to be enrichment or exercise (going to the park) to be adding value?"
1522,It’s all meaningless until you choose the things that have meaning to you. Otherwise it’s just about doing  whatever you want (as long as it causes no harm to others)
1523,"I'm 26 and I feel the same. The thing is, yeah, everyone is going their own way. Our age group doesn't have a collective identity that you had in your teens or early 20s.

Unless you've carved out a place for yourself by aligning your identity with work, a family or a hobby, you're just drifting away. Like we are right now. And its lonely. Almost like other people our age don't exist."
1524,Sounds like it's time to start ticking off some things in your bucket list bro
1525,"Ask someone from work to come over, look for your towns subreddit, use a hookup app like tinder, literally solo travel and write about it, make videos or tweet about your life and eventually you'll find more than just this, you'll find what you believe is a purpose."
1526,"Step outside of your normal groove and do something you’ve always been curious about, that has a group or other people involved.

A yoga class or group, a hiking group, cycling, archery, martial arts, painting, ...etc.

You’ll have a group of people (potential new friends) pursuing the same thing. At the very least you’ll awaken that adventurous part of yourself, be learning something new, which usually takes your focus off of yourself (and your negative feelings) and onto the activity.

Most of the people who participate in these types of groups are positive and the distance a step like this can put between you and your former self can be huge.

Get out of situations where you’re isolated.

Good luck!"
1527,Look for an adult sports league. It’s how I made most of my friends after I moved to a new city at 30
1528,I believe this too. If a purpose haven’t been decided for you (which is a good thing really) then you get the opportunity to come up with your own meaning. What do you want to be your life goals?
1529,For sure. Trying new things is a must.
1530,"I’m (still) lost too. I’ve gone through countless identity crises but i resolved to reinvent myself. 

You’re never a fixed identity. You can change your life. It takes time to figure things out. There were times in my life when I felt like i was on autopilot and without a strong sense of who i was. 

The first step is awareness and then you do something about it. *“You don’t find yourself, you create yourself.”* The process may not be comfortable or easy but the effort alone would be transformative."

You don't need to belong anywhere.

Just being you is enough."

1536,"[moratorium](https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Identity+Moratorium) explained here

I’m about to be 28 and I just finished school weeks ago. Coincidentally got my masters in psych so this is my area. The first few weeks I was bored without school, despite not missing the stress. To fill that boredom I bought a beer making kit. I said for years I wanted to brew beer and now I have no excuses. Forcing myself to try new things"
1537,"Sorry for the long post, all of the stuff you mentioned really reminded me of what I went through myself and I always wanna help people in similar situations because it can be really fucking hard. 

I was in a similar situation but at a younger point in my life. I went from being very social and constantly doing things with tons of friends, playing football and partying in high school to not really having 1 friend at my university.  It got very fucking lonely and tiring because I would try so hard to put myself out there. On top of it my home family life was going down the tubes and I really had no one to talk to. 

The ways I combated all the loneliness is why I can actually say things have changed for the better in so many ways. The two things I found really helped me were getting into video games and weight lifting.... constantly. When not doing my academic stuff I would either be in the gym or playing video games. These may seem like solo unsocial past times but I’ve found so many life long friends doing both. Every night I’d play video games and eventually I found a squad that were pretty much all in the same boat as me. We sometimes wouldn’t even play the game and just hang out and shoot the shit. Great group of guys. We’ve been playing every night for like two years now. Completely makes me feel like I have a place because when I’m not on with them I’ll get a text saying we need you or they will just hit me up for life advice. 

The other thing I mentioned is the gym. It saved my life. In my first two years of college I went like twice a day to workout and hang with meat heads.  It did wonders for my confidence and my social skills. Through that two year period I lost 110 pounds and was no longer a fatty and I gained about 10 new life long friends. When I had no one to turn to I knew that if I just went to the gym and worked out I knew my friends would be there for me to vent to. I also worked there witch definitely helped. I can now say I have a great father figure who is a radiologist at the hospital in the city, huge dick head but a great dude. My best friend is a 4’5 man who escaped from Laos in a canoe with his brother (this dude looks like a a pit bull). In addition with many personal trainers and a few buddies I went to high school with.  I’m 22 and just graduated university in May so now I’m onto my next point where I’m going to do the exact same thing to find new friends. 

Anyway. You will find your place. Just try to do things you wouldn’t expect yourself doing and see what happens but my best advice is try going to the gym or playing video games obviously because it totally worked for me. Keep your head up it will all get better."
1538,Thanks. Definitely needed to hear this.
1539,"I find it all meaningless, and that is great. Honestly, outside of survival for me, and really for everybody it should be about the pursuit of happiness. I often day dream of living out of my vehicle and traveling the country. Not sure how the finances would work, but seems nice. The thing about our society, and place within said society is that everything is artificially constructed. We are no different than the pets we keep other than in the ways we tell ourselves and each other how we are different or special. You seem like you need to embrace change. If you are unhappy with the current situation do something different. Even small changes could lead you to stumbling onto something you hold dear."
1540,You are so not alone. I am right there with you. Drop the pressure on yourself and go with the flow and experiment being a “yes man”for many opportunities for some time. It’ll change
1541,"I’m with you on so many fronts. Not having to drink all the time at college and not playing sports 6 days a week at college frees up some time for me to get fat and read, and now I’m lifting again and loving it. Made some gym friends, who ended up being actual friends. 
You never know what’ll happen if you keep trying—but you know for sure what’ll happen if you don’t keep trying"
1542,May I ask why you need a role? Is there anything wrong with going with the flow and just being yourself? :)
1543,Don't worry it's not a big deal unless you're female.
1544,Try joining a club or sport that has a social aspect to it. I’ve been training jiujitsu the last six years (currently 32y/o) and it’s been one of the few pure joys I get on a weekly basis. PS: Rock climbing gyms are great for meeting people.
1545,"Purposelessness is a symptom of a lack of direction.

I think having a super long term goal is important to stay sane, and hobbies are what keeps things sufficiently balanced. Not to mention, make some new friends.

Some recommendations I have:

Start grad school - get an mba

Join the fighting game community and start training up. Smash is a very welcoming community... in my area anyway

Join a Crossfit gym and start showing up at the same time every day or every other day, you’ll start recognizing faces and next thing you know, you’re making new friends

Join discord servers around your interests

Start playing an mmo such as ff14 and find a welcoming free company, start raiding

Start taking random classes like painting, drawing, beer making, etc, and if any of them tickle your fancy, start showing up to their community events. Same goes to county fair type stuff, like animal raising, farming, gardening, baking, etc

Start playing warhammer or magic, see if the people in that community are fun to be around



If you don’t feel like your calling is to get turbo rich and run things or whatever, that’s fine. Just do your job and then find meaning somewhere else... there are plenty of jobs that exist purely to get get paid for performing duties that you don’t have to love, but are stable and consistent enough to enable you to devote time to doing actual fun stuff.


Last note: we have folks who work in our plants who’ve been running basically the same machine for 20+ years, and if you asked them if they wanted to move or get promoted, they’d say no. They’re some of the happiest people I know. Sometimes your role in society is to be a cog, and that’s fine too. Machines need cogs to run, and someone needs to be the cog."
1546,"I definitely have gone through this and am probably currently going through this again. 

&#x200B;

Let's go back to me as a teenager. I was a fat kid with no confidence. Generally, I was the punching bag of my friend group. I had the chance to go away to college paid for by my parents (not wealthy but they saved my whole life). I had no real direction of what I wanted to do–one of those smart but unmotivated stoner types. I thought moving five hours north to go to culinary school sounded like a great idea.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I developed a bit of an identity as an easy-going kitchen worker type who got along well with everyone. I partied way too hard and didn't really learn too much from school but I cemented myself as more of a workhorse than someone who was a creative mind and leader in the kitchen. 

&#x200B;

I went back home after two years and bounced around from job to job. I still felt out of place everywhere I went. I just sort of existed. I was a valued member of wherever I happened to work at the time but I didn't do much beyond work, pay bills and chill with friends (same ones as before). 

&#x200B;

Eventually I decided I was completely and utterly miserable and went down a very dark path of feeling like I had no worth. I didn't really like my friends that much and hadn't had anything close to a girlfriend in ages. I ended up in a suicidal mindset and took myself to the hospital.

&#x200B;

I decided to go back to school to do something I really love, which is writing. I chose journalism because I like non-fiction work and news so I felt it was the perfect fit. I took up running and lost a bunch of weight and felt like a million bucks. There was also lots of counselling, trying different medications throughout the years in all of this. 

&#x200B;

I made a new friend group, met the love of my life and absolutely excelled in the journalism program from early on. 

&#x200B;

I've gotten complacent now however where I mostly hang out with my girlfriend, lost touch with a lot of people and have become fat again. I'm feeling stuck in that mindset again where I just work (in my field however right after graduating), pay bills and chill with my girlfriend.

&#x200B;

I've felt the desire to do more. I live near a park with lots of baseball diamonds. I wish I joined an adult league. I feel like I want to take up something like hapkido or kickboxing. I want to pursue photography further and work on a documentary.

&#x200B;

The key is to listen to those desires and just go for it. Forget the voice in your head telling you no. Forge your path, be true to yourself and great things follow. Remember that there are ups and downs to life though. You'll get through this.

I don’t think living in a city is by any means necessary, but I think you’re making a pretty wide, sweeping judgment without taking into account the breadth of reasons that living in a city is attractive to people."
1565,"> People from the country drive to the city all the time to get the shit they need

Not really true as much these days after the advent of Amazon and 2-day shipping. It definitely used to be the case though. Now people travel to cities more for entertainment."
1566,Job is a good reason to live there. No criticism on that .
1567,"Me too. I live in a suburb that close to Chicago, as I’m close to a CTA Bus Stop and an L Stop. While I would like to live in the city proper, but I’m enjoying where I live. I get the best of both places. Lower taxes and things to do! Certainly better than when I lived in the Clearing neighborhood in Chicago."
1568,"Sure, if you’re talking about a small town that has one stop light. 

There are plenty of tinier towns that have jobs for people. I’ve seen it, just like you’ve probably seen whatever you’re trying to argue. Doesn’t make you anymore or any less right than I am."
1569,"Downtown LA is cool once in awhile. I’ve grown up here in Southern California my whole life and no one I really know that’s grown up here actually likes to go there, it’s mainly people that come from out of state."
1570,"Nope. 
I hate driving, hate commuting. I can walk, run, bike, or take the train to work. I’ve never had to sit in traffic to get to work. I’ve never had to worry about where to park or paying for parking. Not to mention the lack of driving anxiety: the #1 thing most likely to kill me is more or less eliminated from my life. 
If I want to go grocery shopping at 10 PM, I can do that. If I want to sleep in until 7 AM and still get to work at 8, no problem. If I want to switch jobs there’s a hundred more within walking distance. I absolutely love this life and wouldn’t trade it for anything."

1573,"I personally think LA is one of the most- if not the most- overrated cities in the world. People in foreign countries often say LA is the city they want to visit most, which obviously comes from Hollywood romanticizing it. Some other big cities are much cleaner, safer, and less densely crowded, but you still get a lot of the opportunity and social benefits.

On the other hand, I think there is something really special about living in a more rural area. Everybody knowing each other can be annoying, but there is definitely a greater sense of community. Having more outdoorsy activities close to you is a plus. It can be really nice to get away from crowds and people in general.

Not to mention, if society collapses, a small farm town is one of the better places to be lol."
1574,I agree. There’s jobs but other than that they’re only good to visit.
1575,Some people like being another face in the crowd and some hate it. Whatever floats your boat.
1576,"Yes, you took the words out of my mouth!"
1577,"Agree with all of this except better housing.  Housing in the city nearest to me is largly more expensive.  I guess you could argue it's ""better"" since it's housing nearer the city, but that's a circular argument.  

Housing outside the city is going to be much cheaper, more parking, more yard, larger space inside house/apt on avg.   

I live 10 minutes from the city, and my rent is roughly $300+ cheaper than my peers who live in the heart of it."

/s but actually not really because the state of things really does empower the military."
1592,"The military is definitely not a bad option if you need to get out of a financial conundrum. On active duty you get steady income, free health care, free housing, tax-free shopping, and iirc you can get your student debt cleared up with tuition assistance when you commission as an officer. Officer candidacy in the Marine Corps is more rigorous and selective than the other branches as you may have researched already, it’s going to be tough and you gotta become tough. But most importantly be humble. Humility is one of the greatest allies in a new culture and environment. Once you commission and enter the officer corps and mold into the niche I think you will be squared away."

Probably won’t be able to keep my weight above 200 either, because I’m assuming they wouldn’t be too keen on having to tape out their newest boot Lt. Lol"

1601,"Going for the CPA requires a lot of time and effort into studying and passing the series of exams. If she already doesn’t like accounting, it’s probably not the best idea to go further down that path. At least not unless she finds something in the field she wants to do."
1602,"I'm not an accountant, but i have a buddy who went into the accounting field and hated it as well. He ended up going into forensic accounting, and eventually became a federal agent for the IRS. He still has to stare at numbers in Excel, but he also gets to cop shit too, like raiding houses and performing arrests."
1603,"Same here. I am 1, maybe 2 semesters from graduating in Computer Science. Just walked out of the stats (which I failed last semester) final exam (which I absolutely, no questions about it, failed again). I have a good summer internship lined up and I'm going to work my ass off in the hopes that I'll be allowed to take a semester off to keep working.

&#x200B;

But my parents are super motivated on my behalf, so it's a real tossup if they will ""convince"" me to keep going, even though I'm constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown which gets progressively worse each semester, and the meds and therapy don't help. School/life is hell.

&#x200B;

At least I know I enjoy actually working in CS, I love programming and problem solving, but school makes me sick in body and mind."
1604,"It’s still the right path. An accountant with no masters or CPA is just a bookkeeper, and those are a dime a dozen and will be automated within 20 years. Not to mention that once you have the CPA you can actually do some less soul crushing stuff. It’s about 500 hours of studying, but If you’re under 25 studying for the CPA is worth approximately $370/hour in future career earnings. I hate accounting too, but I’m still studying for the CPA. (3/4 down!) If OP wants to use her degree at all, it’s worth it."
1605,"It's alright. People change. People often say that it's dumb that you have to make crucial decisions at young age, but they often left out that they are in no way final. 

Treat your studies as learning experience, because even if you don't end up working in your field, there can still be something useful to gain during them. Take opportunities that sound good, not just those that fit your education or experience. You'll be suprised how your life will turn out."
1606,Literally same. I am working in public accounting and hate every second of it. Taking the CPA exam in hopes to get out fast and do something meaningful
1607,"Damn, I’m a business major at a JuCo and I’m about to finish my associates degree in business admin. Not sure what I want to do if I should continue onto a 4 year degree or how to approach even getting an internship to try and find what I want to do lol"
1608,"I’m on the job hunt as well, it’s real out here. GL."
1609,"try data analysis / business analysis

pretty fun and similar skillset + you get to interact with people

not sure why you regret graduating, you don't need to work in the exact same job and it's a good start for a lot of jobs as you had math + business (I believe)"
1610,"I'm in a similar situation, though not accounting. I went into a major that I thought was a smart choice, and, while I enjoyed it for the most part, I don't know if I can see myself doing it for the rest of my life in a corporate environment. I've been thinking a lot about it, and I just don't know what I want to do. I took a job in the field that I wasn't super pumped about, but while I figure out what I actually want to do with my life, I'm just going to continue down this path. Student loans aren't going to pay themselves, and once I have that paid off, I'm going to be in a far better situation financially to pursue other fields I might be interested in.

I have a few friends that majored in Accounting, took the CPA exam, and went on to work for big financial firms. I'm not sure how relevant the CPA exam is to getting a job, but I'd say go for that. I say that knowing how much my accounting friends had to study and prepare for the exam, but if all the job requirements list that as a 'must-have,' I'd say go for it. 

If you're really really against accounting, it's not like other positions will deny you on the basis of you having a degree outside of the industry. What I've discovered after graduating is, for most entry-level positions, they really don't care what degree you have. It's pretty much just a golden ticket to even be considered for higher-level positions. So if you really want to set up your career trajectory in an industry or position different from accounting, now is a great time to do it."
1611,Become a part time student. Take like one class a semester and work the rest.
1612,You’re absolutely right! I was just going off the notion that OP might not want to use their degree and pursue accounting further.
1613,"Hey OP, I’m in the same boat just 1 year ahead. I graduated last May with my Masters in Accounting, only to realize that I really fucking hate accounting. I also wish I hadn’t gone to college right out of HS, but we did, so here’s how to cope with it:

Unfortunately we have to work, and that won’t change anytime soon. So go get an accounting job using that degree, work for a year or two, save up money, and then follow your passion. I’m likely leaving public accounting for a few years of traveling next summer, but I’d never have had the funds to do so if I hadn’t taken a job in our major. You have this education, use it to your advantage. You won’t find another job without your degree that pays as well, so unfortunately you have to suck it up for awhile, but it will pay off! Get your CPA, do a few years in public, and by the end you’ll have enough money to follow your passions for a few years and, if you need money, go back to a cushy, 35 hour a week, near 6 figure job that requires very little emotional investment. But seriously, get your CPA and public accounting experience first. It sucks, but it’s worth it. Your skills will be much more in demand, you’ll have more mobility, and youll always be able to find a good job. Accounting is just a means to an end, and that end can be whatever you want it to be. Best of luck."
1614,"you can work literally anywhere with a business degree, it's more about what else can you do / are interested in

for example, I work in a 5* hotel chain in revenue management and looking to move into data analysis (the same job, but more programming and statistics and less guessing based on a crystal ball) in another country"
1615,It’s going to depend on your location but generally I’d say $50-60k at the least should be your target for an entry level accounting/finance role.
1616,"No kidding, it’s such an amazing thing when people take time to figure out what they actually want and then do it. 

Pursuing some careers straight out of high school requires you make a substantial lifelong commitment at the age of 17-18 years old, when you have no clue what the ramifications of the decision are.

Not only is there nothing wrong with taking the time to figure out what you actually want to do, it actually makes more sense."
1617,Did you go for you cpa after you were already working at a firm? I know after you pass the 4 parts there is also a work requirement where you have to work under a cpa correct?
1618,Hey I’m curious about your definition of a good pay? Just wondering for where my future bench mark should be at
1619,"I’m in the process of taking the tests right now. 3 down, 1 to go. The best move is to take them between when you graduate and when you start work (firms usually provide you with 4-6 months to do so) but I used that time to go backpacking instead, and I have no regrets. Studying while working full time sucks but last summer made it worth it. 

Depending on the state you have to have 1-2 years of work experience under a licensed CPA to get your license, even if you meet the test & education requirements."
1620,"This sounds similar to my college experience. I went to school for CS; my parents always managed to convince me to keep going despite my desire to drop out and work for semester here or there; I dropped out two separate semesters due to severe major depressive disorder (one semester was refunded, the other the U told me “fuck you”, and in the end I had 11 Ws on my transcript); took 5 1/2 years to graduate and ended up repeating a number of classes during that time. But despite it all I somehow kept a passion going for programming and computers. 

I wanted to say all this because I can empathize _so hard_ with your situation and I’m so sorry for what you’re going through. It fucking sucks. Reading your comment gave me flashbacks of the stress. It can feel like a physical weight weighing you down. Idk where I’m going with this other than hopefully it can give a little solidarity... Your passion will help you excel after graduating and imo working full-time is the best thing ever in comparison to going through school lol. Hang in there, I’m rooting for you."
1621,"Congratulations, most people don't go into their field. you just made the first step of the post grad blues."
1622,"if you’re licensed to be an accountant i’d get in a job in accounting, starting salaries are surely above the 25k mark. if not there’s obviously still a hand for you with your bachelors degree. get in the door of an accounting firm and work hard like shit for a year. hand in your notice, go explore life, taste different things, go to the places you’ve always wanted to go, make mistakes, make memories, make friends. come back home, take internships and quit them if you hate it. find a company you like with people you like. work hard at that job for 5+ years you’ll be set on a good salary. you’re 22 not 60, say you have 80 years to live. you’re about 1/4 of the way there. don’t let the degree you took push you into a path you don’t want to go down"
1623,"I graduated with a degree in business and an emphasis in accounting/ finance. Similar enough. 

After I graduated I got a job in corporate fp&a with large company. I quickly realized it wasn’t for me (my management was absolutely terrible so that could have made it worse).

Eventually I looked at other options and got a job in inventory planning and forecasting. I’m working in operations rather that finance. Huge difference in everyday life (and it helps that I have great management here). 

Take an accounting (or finance) job and gain some experience. If you don’t like it, the analysis (and excel skills) you learn will help you find a job quickly."
1624,"Hey this happened to me kind of. I studied history and I loved it. I didn’t pay much attention to what happens after. I’m working in IT now and I love it. I was originally going to go for computer science. I don’t know what made me change my mind. Oh well though, I plan on going back to school and taking a different path. The thing is, now that i have life experience I know what I actually went to do. No one knows what to do when they’re 18."
1625,"Trade school. I graduated college at 22 with a mathematics degree and I’m welding at 25. You can work with your hands if it’s something you enjoy. Lots of tradesmen opportunities out there, and they are very much needed"
1626,"haha definitely not for me, but thanks for the suggestion 😁"
1627,There are a lot of careers you can go into with an accounting degree that don’t require being a CPA. I am a bank examiner and I studied accounting but didn’t get take the CPA or get my masters.
1628," Did you work a part time job while in high school? I made the same realization that you did while working a fast food job when I was sixteen. I remember being shocked that there were adults with families that flipped burgers, worked drive thru, all that. Not only that but at work since they were away from their kids they would CUT UP. I mean really funny conversations and silly teen like behaviors that caught me off guard at first."
1629,"cue ""ok boomer"""
1630,Yes
1631,"At some point people will stop seeing you as the kid. My boss is as old as my mother and i have better relation with her than any other collegue that is my age. I have also notice that older people aren’t necessary smarter, sometimes not even more  experienced because they do not won’t to learn new things due to job burnout.  I just stop looking at people through their age. I feel like it do not matter. As long as you aren’t being mean to anyone ofc."
1632,Well gosh darn it then I’ll shut up 😂
1633,"I dunno about sheltered, but media has a very persistent trope of workplaces being semi-organized by age. 

There are college (teenage) interns at the bottom, then entry-level twenty somethings, followed by middle management with a spouse and young kid(s), then upper management are all middle aged with adult children (teenagers in college internships), and the board/executives are gray hairs with grandkids and second homes.

Is it realistic? No, but media informs a ton of how we perceive the parts of the world that we ourselves aren't experiencing. So when you *do* end up in the workforce, it can be kinda jarring to realize that the people you consider coworkers/colelgeus/equals are in a variety of life stages. 

I think the myth of constant advancement also has something to do with this. Everyone thinks they'll work their way to the top of the ladder. But that's not possible, is it? There is only one spot at the top. Someone will have to take second place. And third. And fourth. And so on. And that even assumes no one just burns out/hits a wall/stops caring and becomes complacent in their position."
1634,"This was something very jarring for me. This is pretty much the first time your exposed to people who may ""failed"". I understand that's a subjective term but for me it was when I started working in sales and one of my coworkers was a 35 year old alcoholic who recently moved back into his parents house. He was a great guy until I started  having more success than him and he flipped on me very quickly. Sales is its own animal and I'm VERY grateful i got out. But we graduate from school thinking we have this blueprint for a guaranteed successful life. This is not at all the case."
1635,I love it when my coworkers talk about lawn care while I can barely afford my apartment lmao.
1636,That’s kinda what it is anyway for a lot of people. Adjusting to living life as an adult and not a student anymore
1637,"In my first job after university my best work friend was almost 20 years older than me. But we just clicked!! I don't work there anymore but we still send each other memes lol.

It was even more strange when I went from being the only person under 30 in my office to working somewhere that is 60% millennials. Huge culture shock lol"
1638,"Recent younger circles, and especially, online circles have gotten really bad about partitioning age groups that are all equally classified as adults. It’s not weird at all. In fact, it’s been the norm for decades upon decades. I used to be really bad about wanting to segregate age groups in all spaces because of ‘power imbalances,’ but age doesn’t automatically imply power imbalance. You can be 25 and the manager of a store with employees in their 50s. It all comes down to life experience and what path you’ve taken. Also, working with people who are older than you can really lower the bar in a positive way. Most adults don’t know what they’re doing, and this persists well past your 20s no matter what metric of success you’re applying to life.

Don’t let it weird you out too much. It’s standard, and it’s important to be able to level with everyone."
1639,"I skipped college and got a full time job, I fully expected to be in a company that would have people from different age groups and I'd be on my end tail trying to socialize with them.   


Having a work place with a varied age gap will help you understand them more, if you want to anyways. You can peek into what it was like in their time and how that usually affected a literal generation.   


Everyone's different, and the sooner you realize Sonder ( Noun. **sonder** (uncountable) (neologism) The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passed in the street, has a life as complex as one's own, which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it.) The easier it'll be to digest your thoughts."
1640,"I'm a 40yo and work in a restaurant, so working with 16yo up to a 65yo. It really is very interesting to see how we all get along. I admire my youngest coworkers and only wish I could have had the drive to succeed that they do when I was their age. And I love my older co-workers, they give me hope that I can make it as far in life as they have. We all learn from each other, and God knows, hanging out with highschool students keeps me in the loop! I know about dabbing and yeeting and juul pods lol.  I'm not going to be a boomer if I can help it."
1641,"At my job I’m 23 and the next youngest co worker to me is 32, then alllllll the way to 67.


“Ok boomer” has become my favorite phrase."
1642,"Very true.

I was just reading a thread on r/relationships where a 21 year old was dating a 30 year old, and the comments were saying a 30 year old shouldn’t even wanna hang with someone that young cause they have nothing in common. But I’m like, I hang out with 30 and 40 year olds all the time and we really aren’t that different. And with the invention of the internet, we all share the same memes anyways"
1643,It’s very cringe
1644,Ya I mean no disrespect to OP but I have no idea. I feel like I’ve always worked with all ages even when I was in retail but idk. Idk if they didn’t work while in school maybe? Or just worked an overall young persons job? Not sure
1645,It’s lit. I work for a charter school and work with a lot of millennials. There are some gen x and boomers but mostly millennials since charter schools have a high burnout rate.
1646,"I'm 29 and almost all my friends are people from work. Some younger, some much older.
When I was 19 I used to sell weed to a 78 year old man I worked with. He would call me while his wife was in the room and refer to weed as some type of art supply, like he would say ""that rice paper you have me was great, the ink took to it very well! Do you have anymore?""

And another coworker who is in her 60s came to our baby shower. I haven't worked with her in at least 6 years"
1647,I mean you can still have friends your age too.
1648,Oh yeah. I’m 25 and I’m the boss of 3 people in their 40’s. It was really weird at first.
1649,That’s how you learn and accept others.
1650,"My first job out of school I was incredibly aware and felt a little weirded out that all my coworkers were 10 years older than me (at first). At my job now, there’s a diverse array of ages, which allows for a lot of playful joking and calling each other “old man” and “kiddo”. I honestly love it, I have a ton of people I can get advice from about all sorts of adulting things - like home buying, retirement plans, etc. Plus being the youngest makes me feel less pressured to not screw anything up."
1651,No.

1655,Am I the only person who finds the phrase “ok boomer” to be super cringe??
1656,"I feel like the biggest problem with this is that this is an extreme generalization of what _school_ is and what that experience is like for everyone. This doesn't fit my experience of school, and in realizing how much of a generalization its ""school"" analogy is, you also notice how much of a generalization the video's main points are. The writers act as if the way of life they describe is feasible and fit for everyone."
1657,The channel oftentimes pushes its own narrative about the things it talks about rather than actually talking about the thing objectively.

1659,"I've watched a couple dozen videos from The School of Life. The reason why anyone shouldn't take serious advice from it is because Alain de Botton comes across as anecdotal and doesn't offer any evidence (not sure about his more recent videos). An academic system at least researches and uses evidence to push ""its own narrative"". Academia at least changes its mind when it's presented with more evidence."

“But don’t trust your boss, that guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Lmao ok, I guess that was true when I worked at a fucking pizza place but in the professional world it’s pretty easy to align your boss’ interests with your own unless you’re too dumb to actually understand what their interests are."

This is stupid and is saying that things that are boring are to be avoided. Waiting in line is boring. Going to the doctor is boring. Studying can be boring. Practicing an instrument can be boring. If you go through life avoiding things because you find them boring you'll have a hard time finding any activities that improve your life in any meaningful way. If you want to be passionate about something you have to be good at it, and to get good you have to practice. The only things that you can be good at without practice are games, entertainment, or consumption of food and other substances. None of these will help you thrive as an individual."

1674,"So you're telling me the value of an education is only measured in financial outcomes, but *I'm* the one who is only able to see a single path to success in life?"
1675,"Dude I'm sorry you don't feel like you got value out of your degree but in reality most people do. The vast majority of students either don't take out student loans or are able to afford their loans, if you look up default rates they're probably way lower than you'd expect. 

Every piece of data available shows that education is a good investment. It has been shown time and again in many different studies that there exists a strong relationship between level of education and income. If you really think college is a bad investment for ""most"" graduates that probably says more about your own biases and inability to understand data than it does about anything else."
1676,"Good vid. It is kind of an anti rat-race philosophy.  “There is no set path, do whatever it is your doing for yourself first, etc.”

However, I think most people who watch this will assume they are talking about leaving the actual physical location of school, which isn’t the case."

1679,"Yeah, seems like some people are pretty fiercely misinterpreting the purpose and message of the video."
1680,"Yeah, I mean take the risks if you want but I’lol play it safe thank you very much."
1681,Let's see this data bud.
1682,"Ah yes the classic ""I'm going to make an outrageous claim and provide no data, yet anyone who disagrees with me better cite their sources.""

In 2017 [65%](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/) of graduating seniors had student loans. 

The latest cohort data shows that the three year default rate is [10.8% nationally](https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/cdr.html)

Which suggests that roughly 93% of students are graduating with an amount of debt they can afford. Mind you this number includes graduates from all public and nonprofit institutions from all majors. Which should be enough to disprove your nonsense claim that 

> Only about 5 of those majors are actual careers that make school a worth while investment.

But ok you'll probably say something along the lines of ""just because students aren't defaulting on loans at very high rates does not mean their education was a 'good' investment."" Or more likely, you'll just skip past all this and start typing a reply because you don't actually want to read about why you're wrong.  

Fair enough, let's look at those numbers now. 

From the [BLS website](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/education-pays.htm)

> It’s hard to quantify the full value of an education. But U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data consistently show that, in terms of dollars, education makes sense.

> As the chart shows, the more you learn, the more you earn. **Median weekly earnings in 2017 for those with the highest levels of educational attainment—doctoral and professional degrees—were more than triple those with the lowest level, less than a high school diploma. And workers with at least a bachelor’s degree earned more than the $907 median weekly earnings for all workers.**

Wow, so the difference between the average person with a bachelor's degree ($1173/week) and a high school diploma ($712/week) is **$461/week**. That's almost $23,000 a year. 

But is an average increase of $23,000/year really ""worth it"" given the high cost of college and the opportunity cost of not working? Let's do some more math.

By going to school instead of working for 4 years, using the BLS numbers of $$712/week, you miss out on potential earnings of $148,096. Quite a bit of money. 

On top of that, according to the [National Center For Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76), the average bachelor's degree program including tuition, room and board, books, and living expenses is $26,120/year. That number is inflated by about 7k/year since it includes for-profit colleges which are notorious for overcharging, as well as high priced private colleges, but let's ignore that. That means the cost of the average bachelor's degree is $104,480, WOW.

So all in, cost of attending college plus the opportunity cost of not working, the average student is looking at a whopping **$252,976.** (In reality you would subtract the amount of money they make while working in college, financial support from parents, scholarships and grants but we can ignore that for the sake of this example).

So at this point our hypothetical student has paid a quarter of a million dollars to make an extra $23,000/year in their career. How long before it's a good investment and what's the payoff?

So the government considers retirement age to be 62 at the moment, since that's when Social Security benefits start. So if you were to enter school at age 18, graduate in 4 years with a bachelor's at 23 (assuming you turn 19 during your freshmen year) you'd likely work for 39 years. Assuming the pay gap between educated and uneducated workers does not continue to grow, and not accounting for inflation or pay increases, over that career you would expect to make $897,000 more than someone with just a high school diploma. So over your career your return on investment for the bachelor's degree is roughly $644,000. Plus you know, whatever value you want to assign to the intrinsic non-financial benefits of an education, such as the ability to do basic research like this for the purpose of disproving nonsensical claims."
1683,"Only about 5 of those majors are actual careers that make school a worth while investment.  Despite this, they are one-size fits all in the way they teach not the topic of what they teach. They all use test taking and hw as a way to demonstrate performance and this gives preference towards a person who can memorize and regurgitate well rather than someone who has actually learned and is focused on their own self-growth."
1684,"No but it's the definitely the primary one.  Young people are told that it's ""an investment"" and that it ""pays for itself"" when most of those majors do not.  Many, like myself, are put into debt because universities have a gravy train coming in by exploiting the naivete of young people who are further fed by the mantras you're preaching; ""there's nothing more valuable than an education"" or ""it's how you invest in your future"".

For the record, I believe education is extremely important, I'm just saying that there are many different types of education than the ones academia has come up with. That type of education is designed more to accommodate huge swaths of people than it is to actually educate people."

1686,No problem. What’s your current situation if you don’t mind me asking?
1687,"So I graduated with a degree in Poli Sci. Up until about a year and a half before graduation, the plan was law school, but after talking with a bunch of people, attending seminars, etc I realized that would be an awful path that would just leave me miserable and in so much debt that I'd likely never be able to pay it off.
So besides law school, I wasn't really sure what to do with my degree. I wanted to change majors to compsci as I had taken a few courses in high school and learned some R through my other classes and really enjoyed it all, but at this point I was only a year or so away from graduating and everyone (family, school counselors, etc) was telling me to just suck it up and graduate. 
So I graduate, and figure my only option to at least get a decent job is go to grad school, so I find an MPA program. I'm now about halfway through it, had internships, and it's miserable. All throughout I've been taking online CS courses so that I can at least learn something fun. Earlier this year, my wife suggested that I just go back to school and get a second bachelor's in CS, so that's something that we're looking into right now"
1688,"I graduated as an art major.  Took a job driving truck in the oilfields after graduation.  Got laid off, worked a few years as a newspaper photographer.  Got laid off, spent a year in a cabinet shop.  Got laid off, did some screen printing.  Got tired of getting laid off, but had taught myself a bit of computer programming (I'm an old fart... this was before there was a computer science major) and got a job as a computer support person.  Got laid off from that (seriously!) and took a job as a programmer.  Retired from that gig 25 years later."
1689,""" So I graduate, and figure my only option to at least get a decent job is go to grad school, so I find an MPA program. I'm now about halfway through it, had internships, and it's miserable.""

What about it have you found to be the miserable part?"
1690,"You're lucky.

That's all there is to it, luck. I worked my ass off at every job I've ever done and made no progress. Did the same as you, working harder than my jaded coworkers in retail and a call center (separate jobs) taking on additional responsibilities in the hopes I would get moved up once it was clear what I was capable of.

It didn't work for me. I just ended up working more for the same dogshit pay as everyone else.

It just feels like a never ending struggle digging sideways, rather than clawing my way up. Then I get told I must have been a layabout to not have made it. Do you know how crushing that feels? I feel used, have nothing to show for it, and on top of that I feel like a total loser.

I'm going to turn 27 in a few months and still live with my parents. I've wanted to leave since I was 18, but it's always seemed impossible. Even now, there is no way I can afford to live on my own. It's fucking embarrassing and I feel like a down syndrome child who only exists as a burden to others.

I decided I wanted to be a teacher since I really enjoy teaching (did it a few times in an unpaid setting) and want to be a full-time teacher, but even that seems like a dead-end with no way up either. Everyone tells me to avoid it even though I like it, and I tend to agree with them, but I figure if I enjoy it then at least I will be poor and happy instead of poor and depressed.

I'm sorry to sound so bleak in this post clearly meant to generate positivity, but I felt compelled to respond after reading how similar our paths were.

I wish I could be just half as lucky as you. Compared to me, you've progressed twice as fast in the same timespan and have already ""been-there-done-that"" with a career I haven't even started yet.

Accepting life isn't fair is the hardest part for me. Now I'm just another jaded drone fantasizing what I could do with a few more dollars..."
1691,"I’m a new teacher who is also thinking of leaving the profession owing to the poor pay/lack of job security (also the government’s obsession with exam results rather than holistic outcomes for pupils).

I joined teaching because I wanted to help kids learn to love reading (high school English teacher), and — same as OP — didn’t want to do something that felt ‘corporate’."

Sure, a degree can be nice, but you’ll save a lot more money by getting practical experience because the certifications carry as much if not slightly more prestige to employers.

1703,"In highly competitive countries like Singapore and Malaysia and some parts of China and India, you could make mad money as a teacher through private tuition. You’ll have to familiarize yourself with their education system, learn everything about the examinations the students go through, memorize past exam papers and even be able to predict potential questions/themes. Start with small groups to get used to it then make 2-3 groups of a manageable number of students, every day. Charge a little bit below the market rate. Say $20 per month per student. You’ll basically only need to meet each student for 1-2h, every week. For  three groups of 20 per day that’ll be 60 students. Say you work 5 days a week. That’s 300 students. At the end of the month you’ll be making $6000 minus the rent for the classroom. As your students succeed and your reputation goes up, you’ll be able to charge even more. The parents there want their kids to score very high marks and are willing to invest a lot in their education."

My best friend put it the best:
After graduating college you WILL do stuff you don’t wanna do, unrelated to your degree, and if you’re lucky enough to be in a position similar to your degree will be “cleaning toilets” or “bottom of the food chain”.

Don’t. Give. Up.

Surround yourself with a support system that challenges you every day to be better and keep going. Whether family or friends, get and maintain that support system.

Normally it’ll last for 2/3 years after graduating but as long as you get yourself out of this rut you’ll come out okay. And don’t be afraid to ask for help.

Finished cum laude honors and a leadership award. I can write Java, basic SQL, and JavaScript and have been working with HTML and CSS since I was 12. 

I can't find a job, nobody cares about any of it because instead of two years of official job experience I only have the one, and therefore I'm useless I guess. I got dropped after an interview because I didn't have direct experience with specifically Cisco's AV equipment.

Most people love talking about themselves) and then if it goes well get their contact info and ask if they would be down to grab lunch with you, or smoke a bowl. I don't know if you smoke weed, but that is how I made a lot of my friends in college.

Be consistent and constant with communication. You don’t come off as needy if you do that, you come off as fun and eager to go out and do things. 
Go out and do a lot of things! Events, clubs, extra curriculars. Anything to get your name out there.

Then this year I had a girlfriend at college all year and she was my best friend but we sadly broke up a month ago. 

So really, I’m going into my junior year with no real friends. Other than my roommate.

I’m really going to try next year to break out from this."
1757,"I met a LOT of people and made a considerable amount of friends. You just need to mind that they probably have a stronger group of friends elsewhere, so you probably won't keep a regular contact.

I usually meet mine when there is a music festival in the city, or when I'm visiting the city where they moved back home/to work, or I invite them to events related to our major (or when I'm going out of my way and into another friend's profession-related event), or when I'm venturing into some of their hobbies (like some that go hiking, or some that go boating now that they can afford it lol).

So my take on it is to deal with them more professionally, as it ends up becoming profession related because of what you're supposed to do after graduating haha"
1758,I don't think it's that your unlikable. It's just that by this time most people have solid friend groups and they just aren't into bringing someone else into it.

Maybe volunteer at a shelter or church, or help clean up your campus, or do something that puts your focus outwards. You get such a fulfilling feeling when you give, and don’t receive. Plus, you’re helping others and showing people your love and responsibility. And that might even attract some people who want to be around that kind of energy. 

Overall, don’t let a lack of community define you. And try to focus on changing the world through changing yourself."
1761,"Two things I’d say:
1) mindset:  I get the vibe that you count yourself out before even giving others a chance to give you a chance.  It’s something I do myself, and it’s no good.  Give yourself the benefit of the doubt, because while it’s fact that not everyone you talk to is meant to be your friend, the world is a wide wide place with many people and a large subset of them would want to be friends with you, and if you tell yourself things like “Im forcing myself into their friend group” you are counting yourself out before the fact.

2) skill set:  I was a very socially awkward person.  Sometimes still am.  For me I definitely lacked some of the social skills that many people take for granted.  You may not need it as badly as I did, but I suggest reading a bit about the topic (but don’t stop meeting people, you have to put principles into practice to make gains!).  One book I found helpful was “Everyone communicates, few connect”, and of course the classic “How to win friends and influence people”.    Might seem greasy to read in-depth about strategies to make people like you, but really what it is about is learning strategies to best express and act on your desire to connect with other human beings.  The goal is to put others first and act in good faith.

Good luck hun, we’re all gonna make it :)"
1762,I play on switch and trying to extend on steam now since I got a new cpu.  I really would appreciate it. Sometimes being long periods of time just alone with barely any interaction can be kinda depressing. I’ll be trying also to put myself out there like most people are saying.
1763,I probably do have to change my mindset drastically. I think since after the breast cancer I’ve been so hindered and over thinking everything which probably shoots down my self confidence and I’ll give the books a chance. I really want to get out if this hole I’m stuck in.
1764,"My advice is to address your sense of loneliness and depression— first and foremost— with a mental health clinician through the student health center. 

I cannot recommend how extremely important it is to take care of your mental health before you begin to manifest physical symptoms (isolation). 

Although I encourage you to still attend the groups you are already affiliated with, you may consider applying to a student government position.  These positions are usually paid, require you to be apart of social events, and student causes.  

Why would I recommend this?  Because these individuals “may be more serious” at forming outside friendships with likeminded individuals.  Just food for though."
1765,"I understand what that’s like, I would also echo the sentiment to join a club. For me I tried several volunteering/art based clubs and I only got some temporary friends from those. Then I went out on a limb and joined a sport club that advertised “no experience needed” and that’s where I finally found a solid group of friends. That’s not to say you need to join a sport, but definitely try new things!"
1766,"Does your school have a subreddit? Mine does and people sometimes post about having a hard time meeting people and making friends and a lot of people invite them to hang out or meet up. 

Always feeling like you’re bothering people is a sign of low self esteem. I know because that used to be me but I got really good at reading people and engaging them in conversation and then making friends became a lot easier. Im an introvert by nature but I like conversation and Im oddly interested in other people’s lives and stories and that works well for me because generally, people love to talk about themselves. 

To recap, see if your school has a subreddit and if it does, put yourself out there and say you’re trying to meet people and make friends. Second, don’t assume you’re annoying or bothering people and practice the art of light, easy conversation that centers on the other person (or on common interests). Good luck!

EDITED TO ADD: To meet people, check out meetup.com. There are meet ups for a million different interests. Find some meetups, go to them and be your most engaging self 👍🏼"
1767,"I really recommend getting to know people from your degree program. Once I was in upper division classes for my degree, it was only people in the English program, cause non English degree people don’t give a shit about Shakespeare or advanced short fiction courses or author seminars where you spend an entire semester on Virginia Woolf reading almost all of her works. 



So get to know the people in your courses and make study groups. They have at least one overlapping interest as you cause of the degree program. 


Joining a club is another great idea but I didn’t ever have the gd time for it lmao"
1768,I was considering traveling abroad. My school offers that to Japan. I had met some Japanese students who came here and we exchanged social media. I wonder if they’d be ok meeting up. It doesn’t hurt trying it and seeing new things.
1769,I see how people are specific on reddit when explaining their situation. I wanted to be as specific as possible.
1770,"I'm going to cinema school and, according to many people, classmates in cinema schools usually don't turn out as longtime friends, so sucks for me I guess.

I hear ya, i'm thinking on joining some groups in college (if there are any in Portugal) and see if I can fish one or two friends. I'll be honest, I have a big group of friends back at home, but more friends can't hurt, and I would love to have some that relate to what I love (cinema)"
1771,"Have you considered joining the student ambassadors or being apart of the new student orientation team as well?

Ambassadors give tours to prospective families and orientation leaders help newly accepted students.

Idk if your college has something like that , but it was an experience that I’ll never forget.

Good way to make friends and also build confidence. It’s great to work with other people who want to grow/mature just like you."
1772,"M21. I'd say it's more rare to have friends over after high school. I have a few good friends I keep in touch with often but none of us are ever really at each other's houses or going out, especially during the semester. At this point in our lives we understand that we all have our own lives and we will hang out when we can. As scary as it may seem, try to make some jokes in your classes and whoever laughs, talk to them. I've found that people who are willing to laugh at your jokes make the best friends and the ones who don't aren't even worth your time. I'm not sure when your birthday is but happy birthday anyway and if you'd like to talk to someone about games I'd be more than happy to have a conversation! Keep your head up and keep on moving forward, it's all any of us really can do."
1773,You have free time because you’re expected to take the initiative and learn about the work that a full-time employee does. Full-time employees are very stealthy and advanced with their bullshitting and fake-working. Learn from them and learn how they do the job.
1774,I started back to a full-time three weeks ago after interning at this place. I really don’t have a role; I’m mostly just in charge of long projects no one has the time for so I’m mostly just waiting around for people to email me back
1775,"Do not do any of the side work stuff at your internship. That is a surefire way for you to leave a bad impression. They are paying you to be there and be accessible, not to answer online surveys during work or whatever. If I saw one of our interns doing that I'd have a talk with him and let him know it isnt a professional way to act."
1776,"A summer internship is nothing compared to a legit job. I’m not trying to be purely harsh, but if you’re only temporarily interning you have no basis to compare a real full time non-temp job to.

Also, if you’re bored and scrolling through reddit, there’s a good chance you’re not making the most of your experience. How are you supposed to get a real job if you spend your chance to learn not taking initiative and just scrolling through reddit? What will you talk about in job interviews? This is also not how jobs in the real world function at all. 

When you leave interning and get a real job you will likely be flooded with work, especially because entry level jobs are competitive these days and usually pretty shitty (aka overworked and underpaid)."
1777,Looool OP is in for a rough awakening but you’ll make it brah (gj on getting internship)
1778,"Yeah, I had an intern assigned to me at work during our busy season. I had absolutely nothing for her to do most of the time."
1779,The reason you don't have much to do is because you haven't proven yourself worthy of increased responsibility. Ask your colleagues how you can help them. Automate something. Anything you can do to reduce someone else's work is a great place to start. Taking on more work is what distinguishes a good intern from a great one.
1780,Crazy how you can get paid to do the samething sitting at home. Some jobs are like that. It's  a mix of work and play.
1781,"Eh... good/high-paying real-world jobs don’t. I have way more to do at work than I could ever accomplish in 10 lifetimes, and unless I’m explicitly stopping for a break or food or whatever, there’s plenty to keep me occupied.

Edit: Ah, you’re an intern. Yeah that’s not going to be a great representation of actual work in 99% of places."
1782,Most jobs have downtime.
1783,"If you can, you should consider networking with the employees around you! I know for my internship, I didn't have a huge work load, but I benefited more from talking with others around me and learning about what they do. In the end, enjoy the internship and have fun before the real full time job wildness begins."
1784,"Agree with this. At my internship I was given 1, not so important task that is gonna take me a while to finish. I’m not getting super cool, time-sensitive work because I would be super lost and would keep harassing the other engineers for help. But my job definitely encourages me to come back full time. They practically invest time and money on interns just to  coerce them to come back next summer as an intern or next year as a full time employee."
1785,"While I think the advice shared in earlier comments is helpful, I have also been in a number of positions where I was not able to find or create enough work to fill my time. That’s common enough even when moving up the ladder, but I would say was more often the case in internships and entry-level positions. 

Definitely try and network, tell your supervisor you’re looking for more work, use downtime to do some research and professional development, etc. but also don’t blame yourself if you’re still not filling your time. Senior staff often have difficulty delegating even when junior staff take the initiative to ask."
1786,"Bro, soon you will be begging for free time"
1787,"Get a side thing you can do in your spare time on your phone or computer. Try things like mTurk or Appen if you’re feeling that dedicated. I’d suggest taking a look at the r/WorkOnline page. Otherwise, do tasks that can help you. Meditate, organize, finances, whatever the heck you want. Welcome to adulthood, I guess."
1788,"I’ve been a intern for the past 10 months and I can say that I myself have a lot of free time, somedays like today I’m extremely busy until I finish my project, and then I’m bored waiting on another to come through, but the full time guys I work with are nonstop and it’s insane, they barely have time to breathe"
1789,"Go into the restaurant business and be stress out under the clock for chump change, that’ll reset your perspective"
1790,"Pro tip: while you have the free time, take the initiative to find work on a project or try fixing something people are too busy to work on. Makes a great story for future job interviews"
1791,"I had a 8:30-4:30 job with zero free time. I was that classic overworked and underpaid office drone. My higher ups at work sometimes started trouble over the smallest things, like how exactly to organize a folder (do we put correspondence in the front or attach it to any of the forms it discusses?)

Now I changed jobs and something else has changed as well: plenty of free time, a much higher salary (I got a raise yesterday but I don't really need it), the freedom to slack off on Reddit and Facebook, etc. Like, it's very obvious very quickly when someone isn't working, but as long as you take care of your shit, the rest of your time is your time. 

It's really nice. I wish everyone could have a job like mine. 

And bring a damn phone charger each day."
1792,I wish my internship was like this. If im not doing something i should be cleaning the floor or repairing our dollys or sorting our messy storage.
1793,"I interned for a Tour Operator at their global HQ last year. I was an intern for their Guest Relations / 24 Emergency Department if you will and it was exactly the same. 9-5:30 and during the summer it was so slow sometimes that I literally was going to my colleagues and supervisors asking for anything to do. I spent a lot of time looking at the company's programs and planning my own trip I took earlier this year. That all changed in fall when we had the most tours on the road but there were still some days that I couldn't figure out what to do with myself. I was mainly busy when there were tour emergencies, deaths, or processing dozens of pieces of guest feedback everyday.

Overall I loved the experience, the people I worked with, and being able to actually have a work-life balance which I did not get working in hospitality beforehand or now. Working at a hotel makes me feel like I never have time to finish anything and one of my biggest regrets is going back to it. I wish everyday I was still in that office."
1794,Your job as an intern is to get trained.  You and the company are wasting this opportunity. Stop doing that.
1795,This is because most managers are 1 IQ point away from drooling.
1796,Become a physician instead. They never have a day off work.
1797,I have. I understand what it’s like to do that.
1798,I've never heard of those things but I'll look into it.
1799,You HAVE to learn the ways of handball or otherwise you are GOING TO DIE FOR REAL
1800,Tbh avoid smoking cigarettes

1805,Eat your vegetables. Trust me.
1806,Be nice to all the girls 90% of them will be super attractive in high school and they’ll never forget you
1807,"I second this but would add vaping or any other drugs too really. You’re going to love them because they’re great, so great in fact, that you probably aren’t going to want to stop doing them. There’s other stuff out there to focus and spend money on."
1808,"Well, you’ll be haunted, but in reality you’ll be the only one who remembers, but when you wake from a dead sleep when you’re 37 one night you’re gonna remember it, and you’ll probably have to tell your therapist and she’ll be super proud of the breakthrough that you just made... what the hell am I doing with my life?"
1809,These are all tips that could still apply for graduating high school and/or college
1810,"1st grade doesn’t have nap time. Mine didn’t anyway I had it in preschool, and I can’t nap, couldn’t than still can’t now"
1811,"side note: despite your best intentions, being nice to girls in 1st grade **does not** mean throwing things at them, chasing them or calling them ‘stink witches’."
1812,“dont pee yourself in class” was high school a hard time for you man
1813,“You peed yourself? That’s great!”
1814,Don’t talk to the girls bruh they got cooties
1815,"I accidentally called my teacher grandma once, was I not supposed to do that?"
1816,this.
1817,Ya I started in first grade too. Ruined my life.
1818,"Don't poop your pants in class, even if your stomach is in searing pain and the bathroom is all the way on the other side of the school. Poop smell travels"
1819,Do drugs
1820,Keep a stuffed animal with you at all times while that’s still socially acceptable
1821,r/CongratsLikeImFive
1822,Same
1823,I remember one kid in my elementary school that peed himself a few times. I did when the teacher refused to let me use the bathroom. No one really made fun of anyone for it which is astonishing because I was made fun of for everything else. No biggie 🤷🏼‍♀️
1824,"Learn to cartwheel, and use it as social currency during recess."
1825,You’re not cool unless you pee your pants
1826,"What’s this, a New York prison reference?"
1827,or the worm! i remember having a crush on a kid just because he knew how to do the worm
1828,Bitch wtf
1829,"A lot of people feel that way. I'm sure I will too. 

Try using your free time to learn new skills !"
1830,"What took my 6 hours in grad school now takes me 2.5 at most now due to advances in automation. 

If you arent learning another skill or using that time to make additional money, youre doin it wrong."
1831,"Don’t just ask for work — create your own. You should set a goal of doing what your boss does and more within the year. If none of this is possible, start sending out resumes."
1832,"If you are more a podcast person, NPR's Hidden Brain did an episode with the author back in Sept 2018. Bonus points if you listen to it with headphones while killing time at your bullshit job. :)"
1833,"1. Get everything done as quickly as possible 

Then with the rest of your day...

2. Learn new skills (new language. coding, investing, etc.)

3. Come up with your own projects (start a business, come up with ideas) 

4. Relax and enjoy getting paid for doing literally nothing. You have it better than the construction workers who have to work the full 8 and a half hours with a half hour lunch break."
1834,So I should day trade from the cubicle?
1835,"/u/EverythingSucks12 this is the best answer here. If you’re smart and capable enough to finish your work far faster than they expect you to, there’s likely an inefficiency in their process that you can fix! If you start taking initiative to create and finish your own projects that will act as a self-audit, an automation, or a data integrity improvement, you will see yourself getting rewarded in your career. If your company/boss doesn’t appreciate your efforts, update your resume to include the projects you’ve done and send them out. You might be surprised what you can get back."
1836,Even more bonus points if you listen to it with your speakers on max while killing time at work
1837,This kinda gets me ticked off because I work on a golf course and it’s pretty hard and then to find out where people just sit in there office and do nothing all day really grinds my gears :(
1838,"Thanks. I actually have done exactly that, I learnt some basic programming (primarily VBA) and automated a lot of my workflow. I have even less to do because of it and it's why I left my second job.

If only I could learn piano or just read at my desk, but my boss prefers me to look busy :/"
1839,"What you should do is try to angle for a ""Work from home"" position.   I moved into a position that had someone working 50hr weeks, and still ""drowning"", automated the hell out of it, absorbed FOUR OTHER POSITIONS...automated the hell out of them, and **still** only had to do about 30mins/wk of ""real"" work.

For a bit there, my day looked like...

* Wake up early, check the output from the automation, make sure everything's happy.
* See if any e-mail needs responding to, check for scheduled conference calls...
* Turn up the volume on the laptop, set it not to go to sleep.
* COMMENCE NAP TIME!
* Wake up in time for the ""mid-day"" jobs running, make sure they're happy.
* Check e-mail/calendar again
* Twiddle my thumbs/play games/read a book/etc until it was time to sign off."
1840,"Yes OP. You could use your time to earn certifications for unrelated or tangentially related fields. Imagine if you were able to get the CompTIA Security+ cert? It would only take you like 3 months of casual studying, and that cert alone qualifies you to work at the DoD. Also, it would look great on a resume and even help you springboard into another field. 

With all that extra time, the LAST thing I would be doing is wasting it on reddit. Write a novel or study for a financial certification or a CPA or something. Start a second business where you repair bicycles and use the free time at work for marketing/planning. Idk. Just stop using this shitty website."
1841,"Im a recent college grad with no experience so take what I say with a grain of salt:

&#x200B;

\-You could try moving to a way smaller company and playing a bigger role there

\-I don't know how your company works, but if you know people from other departments, try to find ways to help them and get your foot in the door. It will help you assume more responsibility from the company.

\-You could try and freelance some of your skills

&#x200B;

If all else fails you could pull an 'Office Space' and upload a virus and take their money"
1842,Once you gain some experience you’ll realize none of these are realistic/ viable situations. It is always easier said than done.
1843,"I’m in the exact same boat, I’m in finance, my jobs very laid back and there isn’t much todo. Reddit is my source of time killing along with replays of NBA games. But the money’s decent for a recent grad, no manual labor, and I’m getting 40 hours a week. I never realized how much of a benefit it is to have a fixed hour amount, so many people struggle to get MORE work hours. I’m out here struggling to minimize  my time at work."
1844,"Yup. For as much as ""the adult generation"" (assuming you're fairly recently out of education) boasts about how difficult/tiring/etc work is- it's all painfully inefficient. People spend half their shifts just shooting the shit and dicking around slowly. Just the thought of taking an *hour long* lunch break blows me away, yet people often still take even longer.

Honestly the most fucked up thing to me is that businesses can afford to have this in place. Like it doesn't even matter to them. Fuck it- waste hundreds of thousands of dollars on personnel every year, squander money on 3 day business trips so middle management can attend a two hour meeting, they're still profiting anyway."
1845,r/wallstreetbets
1846,absolutely not I nearly failed my senior portfolio project for going all in on AMD
1847,"Buddy don’t take this the wrong way but you said you have zero experience, so why are you trying to give cliche advice?"
1848,"Ah yes government work, should’ve known."
1849,I’d be terrified about my employability prospects if I spent all day watching YouTube and browsing reddit. Do you ever get concerned about that?
1850,"Trust me, most office workers would love to be out in the fresh air getting exercise."
1851,"I wonder how far technology needs to advance before average americans start seriously thinking about massive wealth redistribution. There is more than enough for everyone to live comfortably and still allow for expectional/hard working people to live extremely comfortably, but we are obsessed with this idea of fairness.

  


In 100 years will the system still require everyone to work 40-50 hours a week at bullshit jobs just so the ""moochers"" don't get a free lunch? It's insane to me how productivity has doubled a couple times over in the last century, but we work longer hours than we did 40-50 years ago.

It's even more insane to me that people are stupid enough to blame the poor instead of the billionaires and corporations."
1852,I feel the exact same way. The job I have now was originally an internship and I learned everything during that time..so I get everything done in under and hour.
1853,"Exactly why I'm on reddit. I'm skilled enough to do the bare minimum and then some in reasonable time but just lazy enough to not do anything else beyond what I feel like is worth my paycheck. Some days a caffeine pill hits right and I zoom through shit and leave myself opening and closing important looking tabs when people pass by. Not as bad as a co-op where I had zero overhead and literally slept most of the day. It was so pointless and excruciatingly dull.

Some days I get fussy and hate the low-key job, but then I remember retail. Remembering falling asleep standing up between being called to run lane on minimum wage will always bring gratitude back to my soul."
1854,"I'll start by saying there's only so much TL;DRing we can do before the message is lost. I highly recommend just reading it. But alas, I will try, my appropriately usernamed internet friend.


This chapter in itself is a summary of David Graeber's ""On the Phenomenom of Bullshit Jobs."" Basically, we currently have a situation where innumerable people spend their entire working lives doing jobs they consider to be pointless. Many of these positions barely add any economic value to their companies, offer low personal fulfillment, and ultimately take away more from society than they add. 


There is more money to be made in jobs that redistribute wealth (banker, marketing specialist, stock broker) than jobs that add value (waste management, physicist, nurse)


The solution? Tax the wealthy and tax transactions. This structure would ultimately lead to more people doing useful work."
1855,Well I’m currently employed so no. I don’t feel the greatest wasting hours this way but I’m honestly just lucky to be alive (brain trauma) and have a job that i don’t mind waking up for. I’m young so I’ll put in my year and see where to go from there
1856,"There really is something to finding meaning and fulfillment from your career. It can be hard to find, but you *can* take your own steps to finding that sense of purpose and it’s better than feeling like you add nothing to society and are wasting hours of every day."
1857,"my boss thinks he's slick and scrambles to make up bullshit tasks for the office workers to complete so we don't have any down time. it's so unbelievably frustrating. 

worst part is I'm in government as well and he's relatively powerful within the city, so he fills our schedules from 7 AM to 8 PM whenever possible. there's always an evening meeting to show face at... 

I won't last very long here"
1858,"Me: You’re giving advice with no experience on the matter

You: No I’m not, I’m giving you other people’s advice that I still can’t relate to."
1859,Me too! You’re almost there! Keep at it friend:)
1860,"Way to go, it's nice to be back home stress-free. I've got until June to be free of school."
1861,That’s great news. But if you think that’s the end to stress 😂 you’ll be looking back soon at college days and reminiscing about how stress free life was back then
1862,Thanks!
1863,I think this sub could use more positivity like yours! Thanks!
1864,Thank you! Best of luck to you!
1865,"God Bless bro/sis, hope to be in your place one day. School is my biggest obstacle in life atm."
1866,Congrats! Me too!
1867,Congrats! Good that you have a job right off the bat.
1868,Dude Im so excited for college in a year? Do you have any good advice for applying?
1869,Actually my first semester will be this fall!
1870,You go to Bethel University in MN? That's awesome. I graduated from Bethel last year. What dorm are you in?
1871,"Congratulations :) In a way, your 'real' life has started. I am about to graduate as well in less than 2 weeks and I have a feeling that this real life is going to be so much more amazing than we ever dreamt of!"
1872,"Yay, happy for you! 💙"
1873,"happy for you, i start college this september"
1874,I totally understand. School took up a huge portion of my time and energy. Add working 20-25 hours a week on top of that and I basically had no free time🙃 it’ll get better though. You just gotta keep going and finish strong!
1875,"I’m not saying that it’ll be the end of stress haha, just the end of school stress"
1876,Nice! What's your major and what dorm are you going to be in?
1877,Thank you!
1878,"Applying to college? Honestly I’d say spend your first two years at community college. It’ll cut your total college expenses in half, and it’s a good way to transition from high school to college. I did my first two years at community college, and I’m only graduating with 10k in debt. It’s not as fun or glamorous as a 4-year university, but starting out at community college is the better choice imo"
1879,This is 100% correct. Imo most CCs have teachers that care more about you actually learning as well.
1880,"BS in Biology, Getch (rooms have not been drawn yet but we requested Getch early so we should be good) 😄 I can’t wait"
1881,Ever take part in the whole “**GO TO BED FRESHMEN**” routine?
1882,It's a dumb routine but yes haha. Ironically I only did it as a Freshman while I was in Nelson. I think more Freshman do it than upper classmen haha. Then I realized it's actually super annoying for people trying to sleep at 2am and felt bad.
1883,2am!? 😂 They do it at 8 PM now which is hilarious
1884,Hold up... Bethel has a pool!? How did I not know this😦
1885,Yeah I’m very fortunate for that. I interned for a company for a little over a year and they eventually offered me a full time position contingent upon me graduating at the end of my senior year.
1886,"Yeah I mean, yes you don’t get the “traditional” college experience at CC, but it’s way more practical"
1887,Nice. I was an RA in Nelson 2 years ago but enjoy Freshman Hill!
1888,"Okay that's pretty funny! 

Make sure you go to the heritage pool during welcome week (before the upperclassmen arrive on campus) but bring a towel unless you want to walk back soaking wet."
1889,"I didn’t even graduate college until I was 29. At 31, I’m at my first job ever where my employers don’t treat me like absolute shit.

I’m probably considered way behind in life, but I’m just doing what I can now. My goals are humble: I want a job that allows me to pay the bills along with some disposable income, healthcare, and maybe a house some day. 

I can’t even comprehend why someone gets stressed about not graduating  college until *gasp* the ripe old age of 23."
1890,"Now I see, I'm half your age and we have the same type of issue lol"
1891,"No, I just responded my own comment to add this information haha"
1892,"I'm 24 and I got super anxious and stressed out around a month ago or so? I was just keeping it bottled up and after speaking with my mom it just kind of went away. It just kept being piled on as I was struggling to find a job, which I found and love, and am in a relationship with a guy I really love but I'm not in the mentality of ""I could marry him"" because I'm only 24! I don't want to get married yet! 

Then I just compare myself to my best friend who found a job right after finishing her Masters, moved out to a neighboring state on her own, and is in a wonderful relationship with a dude who really loves her and they are very likely going to get married. 

I let all that get to me, especially when I visited her I just kinda cried the whole weekend I was over. Idk why I cried and I was ashamed I felt that way because she had gone through so much! So really, just letting my feelings out to my best friend and my mom kinda put perspective and I didn't feel pressure anymore."
1893,Hahahaha oops. Had me scratching my head for a second
1894,"Yeah, i think society has the general consensus that 4 years right outta high school is necessary but it really isn’t. Now a days, people realistically go for 5 years or even more. I had no idea when i was actually graduating until the last semester of college, I couldn’t believe everything i worked hard for finally was going to pay off.

For reference, I’m 23 and just got my degree in August. A ton of my friends graduated a full year ahead of me and a couple more followed by each semester that went by. I definitely felt pressured into getting it done asap but really just depends on yourself and your life, not other peers."
1895,"I don't know if anyone has ever told you this, but just so you know, you don't HAVE to have kids. I'm a huge proponent of the childfree lifestyle, and let me tell you - there are bills and stresses that come with being a regular ass adult on your own. Adding a kid into that mix isn't always the best choice.
I've learnt that things happen when they're meant to; can't really rush this stuff"
1896,Yes cause we always compare ourselves to others instead of just enjoying the process and being patient
1897,You could've just edited your comment
1898,"I don't mean to say this as a humble brag, but this comment really gave me some perspective on where I'm at in life at 22. Best of luck to you in your journey!"
1899,Adoption is always an option for people who decide they would like to be parents after their fertile prime
1900,"True, didn't think about that possibility haha"
1901,"Oh 100%. I have a friend who is married and he just had a kid, he’s got a house. We’re in our later 20s but 30 is still a few years away. It’s not really that he’s done those things, it’s that he has a house and a family and sometimes I wish I had that stability and normalcy. I have a lovely girlfriend and we live in an apartment. She’s in college and I’m at the beginning of my career. It’s a different life we have and I love it but sometimes I wish I had that house, and small family."
1902,"Hey go when and if you want. I think school in all forms is worth it whether that’s a technical program or a bachelors degree. Figure out yourself before you commit. Makes your life much easier and it’ll save you money down the road. You’ll be more sure of your choices and future in a few years. I hate that we push kids in college when they’re 18. I’m 27 now and I had no fucking clue what I was going to do with my life when I was 18. I figured that out at 26 lol and I still don’t really have a fucking clue. I just found a job that I like. But! I still went to college and changed majors 9 times, and ended up doing something completely different than I originally planned."
1903,Comparing yourself to others will always make you feel more crappy.
1904,"Absoutely. I just turned 29, and I have gotten nowhere career wise. I have a crappy, useless bachelor's degree and have only worked part-time jobs, currently a place where most of my colleagues are 10 years younger and where I barely make it financially. Many of my managers are only a couple of years older than me - a few of them are even younger. I feel like such a loser but also have no idea wth to do."
1905,I’m going to be 29 in about two weeks and don’t have a degree. I’ve been thinking about going back to school next semester. I still don’t even know what I want to do.
1906,"I’m 27, still haven’t been to college, but I can’t complain honestly. I have seen quite a bit of the world and had many experiences that my peers don’t. Honestly I luck/ worked into a pretty comfortable life and if I could do it again I would elect not to go to school again. Still want to for kicks though."
1907,I have a friend who started out as a freshman at 32. It's never too late to go back to school. I have an ex-coworker who is going to school in his 40s.
1908,"Omg, some people genuinely don't want children. You won't necessarily regret not having children. Hell, I'd FAR rather regret not having a kid than regret having one!

Hey, you might have friends on your deathbed. Besides, there's no guarantee your children will care much about you as you grow old. Maybe your children die before you! I just attended the funeral of my mother's aunt; her three children and her husband had died before her. Who were with her when she was dying? Everyone else from her social circle.

People can lead perfectly happy lives without children. Period."
1909,"Nah, it's OK. There is a lot of pressure to perform, and we all make comparisons to our peers. But, yeah, I wouldn't worry about being a year behind your friends. It's nbd."
1910,I think it’s really hard to escape the “idea” of what you thought your life would be at a certain age. More than anything that’s what I struggle with because it’s not the issue of reaching a particular age but rather reaching a particular age without reaching the milestones I thought would’ve been behind me by now....
1911,Because they feel behind when it really doesn't matter.
1912,[deleted]
1913,"I know, at 32 I just see time coming near the point where people start thinking about it. Luckily I'm not a female, they're the ones who are under the most pressure with the clock ticking."
1914,"No, but I have heard of people regretting their children. I also had a very honest talk with one of my mother's other aunts who never regretted not getting married and not having children. Neither interested her. It wasn't for her. She enjoyed her siblings' children but didn't desire any of her own. She was over 80 when she passed - still no regrets.

Just head over to childfree and read some of the stories. They are heartbreaking for everyone involved.

""Blood is more important"". Do you realise how many adopted families you just shit on right there? What matters is bonds - not blood.
""""Knowing your legacy will continue will make you feel you lived a complete and fulfilling life because you did your basic primal instinct which is to reproduce and spread your genes."" Whew, that reeks of narcissism! When you're dead, you stop caring.

""not to sound like an asshole but her social circle visiting may be a result of pity because her family isn’t alive to be there."" You didn't succeed; you sound just like an asshole. We weren't there for pity. We were there because we all cared for her. She was an absolutely loveable person.

I am close to 30. I'm not 100% decided on whether I would want children or not, but have yet to feel any desire for them. However, I think it is extremely disrespectful of you to say everyone will regret not having children and that they don't know themselves and their own wishes."
1915,"I’m 31 and going back to college now. I’ll finish my BSN when I’m 33. I never dreamed of being a nurse, I picked it because it has a solid career outlook and so many advancement opportunities. 

I do feel that I should be more accomplished than I am, I’ve had opportunities I’ve let pass by because I was afraid to take on too much. I have a lot of regrets, but whenever I feel bad I try to remind myself that so many people never get the opportunity to get any degree at all. Wherever you are in life, if you’re not dead you have time to figure things out. 

On a side note the suicide rate among lower income, white males, in their 30’s and 40’s is the highest in America, and that is partially attributable to the social pressure of what society thinks a man should be. Obviously, this isn’t just an issue that affects white males, it’s an intersectional issue. Social pressure shouldn’t affect your quality of life or how you view yourself. Things can get better."
1916,Money wise it cost more to stay longer than 4 years but it really doesn't matter when you graduate.
1917,And some people study abroad or coop so that sometimes delays expected graduation by another semester
1918,Im jacking your comment to say please foster/adopt! I had foster siblings and it was a wonderful experience
1919,"I think this is a good mindset. Its easy to feel like you have to keep up with everyone's lifestyles, but it's hard to remember that everyone is at a different place in life.

I have a pretty diverse friend group in terms of financial stability and we just try and do things that everyone can afford. The biggest issue is free time these days as everyone has their own set of obligations."
1920,"In my circle, a lot of people had parents pay for tuition and living costs so they graduated debt free. More power to them, I hope I can help my kids when that time comes. As for me and my wife, we got our loans as 18 year olds because our parents couldn’t help us with that. It’s tough to see people same age and same paying job jump ahead but patience is a virtue and will pay off. 

Also, it’s undeniable that some people just straight up get lucky with jobs. Putting yourself out there on indeed and LinkedIn takes courage but could pay off."
1921,"This reminds me of a quote I saw once that was something like “there are the very rich, the poor, and those who are in debt to live as if they were ‘middle class.’” While I don’t agree entirely with the sentiment, I think there is some truth to it and it relates to your point."
1922,"One thing I realized is that you sort of aggregate all the things your friends buy with their money together (as multiple people with multiple interests and incomes) with yourself (a single person with a single income). So, one friend may spend their money on a nice car, and another may spend their money on expensive vacations, and another may rent a luxury apartment, but very few are dong ALL of those things at once. But when you compare your friends to yourself, you think ""Dang, all my friends are buying cars and clothes and houses"", when ALL of your friends aren't buying ALL of those things, and you very likely have something that your friends are envious of that you don't perceive."
1923,"Don’t compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday."
1924,"> I'm not trying to keep up with my friends and peers.

Thank you."
1925,"This is correct. It isn't a race but you absolutely should use it as motivation. If you're in school and all of your friends are prioritizing their professional life, maybe you should too or else you'll get left behind. 

When you graduate however, you shouldn't compare your careers and feel like you're doing any worse because they have a higher paying job in a more lucrative industry. Personally, I went to a business school which meant a lot of my friends ended up working in front-office finance jobs making very lucrative salaries. This doesn't mean they worked harder than I did or is doing better in life than me. It just means I'm working in tech instead of banking. At the end of the day, if you have a job that you're satisfied with and is happy at, it's all that matters."
1926,Needed to read this. Thanks
1927,yep yep
1928,"And this is really a thing? lol 20 here, haven't spoke or see any of my old high school friends since I graduated."
1929,"My parents paid for my college and living costs, and although I’m endlessly thankful, I think it caused me to fall behind in budgeting and managing my own money. So I think you’re absolutely right that patience is a virtue and the skills you learn during college while putting yourself through can certainly prepare you for “real world” better. Like, I feel like I’m still way behind my peers because I tend to overspend and not think of adding up costs so it’s a double edged sword. Even though I got the job and got lucky I still feel really behind."
1930,I needed this. Everyone I know has committed jobs and kids now at like 25.  I was scared I wasn’t catching up.
1931,"I always try to spend my money on what brings me the most happiness; sometimes that's drinks with friends, sometimes it's travel, and sometimes it's using instacart because I don't feel like wandering through a grocery store this week. I literally think about what will bring me the most happiness per dollar.

Clothes and material things have never brought me much happiness; when it comes to that stuff, I try to invest in things that I will get the most use out of."
1932,"At least you realize it. Some don’t and they end up wasting a ton. Saving feels pretty good, especially when you need it later on. Again, you’re honest about it so good for you."
1933,"I agree, as time is the essence and we need to spend it and save it wisely, just like money."
1934,Is there a country where people aren't like this?
1935,Anywhere except America
1936,"This absolutely sucks for the seniors, as another person here put it. The final semester of senior year was the best time of my life, and most of my emotional nostalgia is derived from the people I had to say bye to when my last class was over."
1937,"I am in the exact situation you are in! My university hasn’t said anything about canceling commencement or moving it, but I have a strong feeling they will. It just sucks that all of our hard work and dedication comes down to this. I’m just hoping that I can still graduate this semester."
1938,"I’m in the same situation, this is my last semester and my college has transitioned to online classes for the rest of the year. It’s a big shock, but I’m trying to adjust and still enjoy my time left in college. 

The one bright side is that I can pick up more hours at my current job and hopefully find (and start!) a full-time position before commencement (if it even happens)."
1939,"My college is closed to the start of April, but things may change. My major requires labwork in order to graduate; that's been thrown into chaos as well. Senior year, IMHO, isn't much of a big deal, but I really wasn't that active in college life due to being a commuter for 3 years."
1940,"Same here, lots of people are in this shitty situation and my heart goes out to all of you. I go to a design school that's switching to online classes. Yes, they have told us that if you're a senior and you're studying printmaking, furniture, textiles, glass,  ceramics, painting, apparel, metalsmithing, etc. that means you're going home and finishing your classes, probably your thesis, without access to any of the facilities that make our work possible. There are people here that have already spent hundreds of dollars on materials to build furniture, fabricate clothes or fabric, weld metal, etc, all to be told that we will finish at home. Imagine being in the middle of building a furniture set for your thesis using the school's woodshop only to be told you can finish at home. We're having access to studios removed next Friday. My class is in shambles, everyone is heartbroken. All that and they're not refunding us for any tuition. Shit sucks."
1941,"I'm in the same boat, while I couldn't care less about my classes being online, I am pretty pissed I might not get to walk at graduation. Plus, since I have an internship at my college, I am now out a paycheck too."
1942,"Going through the same thing! It’s not bratty, it’s sentimental. I didn’t get to say goodbye to the campus, the professors, people I’ve gone to classes with for 2 years. I didn’t know that was my last time going to class when it was. I’ve envisioned walking across that stage for over 2 years. It’s what all the hard work leads up to, to have your name called with some credentials behind it perhaps. To have friends and family be proud of you. It’s so sad to me. Who’s fault is it? Nobodies. It’s for safety, but it doesn’t make it any less sad."
1943,"Hey man, right there with you. My school as of now has only moved to online for three weeks, after that they will reacess. It seems like we’re trending in the direction of the whole semester being canceled. I go out of stay, so my tuition isn’t cheap; i don’t pay a shit ton of money to take online classes from my hometown. 

It has also been very hard coping with my college career abruptly coming to an end, needless to say i was looking forward to this last month and change, it seemed like a necessary time for me to figure out what i’ll be doing after school and just like that it is gone

Lastly, the possibility of graduation being canceled is severely disappointing. I worked very hard and have always dreamed out walking out on stage to get that diploma, the idea that might not actually happen is devastating.

We’re all in the same boat, it sucks. Just remember you aren’t the only one going through it."
1944,"Same boat, and I'm still in disbelief. I understand its a serious situation with the NBA, MLB, NCAA, etc. shutting down but I'm still in shock. I can't believe schools actually shutdown. 

I was expecting a week or two of closures but closing for the rest of a semester seems unreal. There's only a handful of people with the virus in my state (probably due to testing). I guess we are starting our adult lives earlier than expected."
1945,It’s dogshit I feel so bad for you guys
1946,I feel that. I worked my butt off for the last 8 years to get into my dream grad school and get my masters. Tuesday was my last class and I didn’t even realize it. I hope things clear up so they don’t have to cancel graduation.
1947,"I get it, I really do. This is a sudden disappointment for things you were looking forward to. Should you have a gradyation ceremony zi suggest you take a book along. I have 3 college degrees  graduations are boring. Inless you were going to have a siper fantastic speaker pull out a paperback or smartphone and read listen to music  whatever. You eill be aware enough when the time comrs to cross the aiske. If the university is a big one you likely would not have that even as an undergrad. Just letting you know that you won't miss much but can still throw a graduation party. Turn to the positicesm it puts the negatives into perspective"
1948,"> My school as of now has only moved to online for three weeks, after that they will reacess. 

Mine too. All lectures and other activities will take place via online sessions until at least mid-April. I also went back to my hometown to take online classes from there. It hasn't been a week yet and I am already bored here :( 

I understand that it's necessary for safety, but it's still a bummer :("
1949,">I was excited and trying to make the most of my last semester of uni and now having it all move online is pretty heartbreaking (not to be too dramatic)

ditto :/ it really blows"
1950,"Also sucks that I won’t be able to see a lot of people anymore, you know the people who would just be around and you’d hang out there on campus but wouldn’t really make plans with? It sucks, I’m gonna miss so many people and I feel like it’s been snatched from me (in a sense)"
1951,Same ://
1952,"You are not alone feeling like this! I am feeling this a lot! Last semester my school shut down unexpectedly and everyone had to relocate within weeks and then this happening this semester has been difficult. It is hard for me this semester because there was a lot going on on campus and I got to constantly be with all my new friends and teammates. I felt like something was taken from us student especially athletes because some on our team lost their last spring season and those in season have lost their last season of competition, and outside of athletics there was so much we had prepared for and were looking forward to on campus. I felt ashamed and selfish for feeling this way even knowing it was for the students best interest, and especially myself as my immune system is comprised and on top of that I just have major surgery around my heart. 

Having to say goodbye to your friends and professors early whether it’s three years or three weeks is always difficult! 
Don’t be sorry you feel this way it is natural, you are finishing this chapter of your life and leaving this place that your life has revolved around and where you have made so many memories the last four years this is emotional enough and having it cut short makes it even more so."
1953,"On the exact same page! Not to mention I’m freaking out about starting my career and what exact “path” I want to take. I already felt the post grad depression kicking in and now I feel it even more and I’m just feeling sad and helpless about the whole situation. 

I was excited and trying to make the most of my last semester of uni and now having it all move online is pretty heartbreaking (not to be too dramatic). I loved school and I don’t feel ready for the real world and all of this coronavirus stuff is making it even worse. I don’t think you’re being bratty, it’s a huge inconvenience and extremely upsetting. Sucks there’s nothing we can even do about it.

If your convocation ceremony gets cancelled I’m sure they’ll just postpone it until this is all resolved or combine it with autumn/fall convocation after the summer"
1954,I'm a junior but feeling the same way. My mom had called me and started making plans for me to come back home and I wanted to cry. Some of my friends are graduating/ moving on and even tho I'm returning next semester all the people I talked to the place im staying on campus etc. Is not gonna be the same.
1955,"My best friend is a senior art student prepping for her senior art show. Her campus is shut down, and she needs to get in to the studio to do her work. She’s been very stressed trying to figure out what to do. 

I highly doubt you’re alone with your thinking. It seems to be a big transition for so many people."
1956,"I’m in a clinical doctorate program, and some students are being pulled from the necessary clinical rotations that are required to graduate and sit for our licensure exams. It’s a fucking nightmare. I’m in my first year so it hasn’t affected me personally for external clinicals, but they’re making us do two weeks of online classes, and with how hands on being a physical therapist is, it’s a huge disadvantage to have to try and learn remotely, and be unable to even practice in our labs. But we need to flatten the curve and allow healthcare workers to do what they need to do, we still treat patients in our clinic, but it’s very high stress managing all of the precautions to do so. The inconvenience of this all is to save lives, so let’s all just do our part and try to make the best of a bad situation."
1957,My commencement happens to be on my birthday and there’s a chance it won’t happen. This has been super upsetting so I feel your pain.
1958,"I’m in the opposite camp; I just got accepted to a program that has two yearly ten day conferences, and I’m hoping it’s not going to get cancelled on me."
1959,"I’m in the same situation. So far, we’re only doing online classes for the first two weeks after spring break, but my professor is predicting they’ll go ahead and finish out the term online. It also sucks because I was supposed to go to Spain for study abroad this summer before I graduate, but that’s been “suspended”. 

I just wanna spend time with my friends before I have to leave."
1960,"I have an idea: In case they do cancel commencement, reach out to the nearest alumni association of your college (or just any alumni you know of in your area) and ask if they can organize a commencement ceremony. Order the robes, get enough chairs, and you can have a smaller commencement of your own with the new grads in your city/town/county. 

Maybe it sounds cheesy, but it could be a good opportunity to turn a crappy situation into something really memorable."
1961,"Not bratty at all- I was thinking of this as I was looking back at my own final semester like 20 years ago, and you being robbed of that excitement and joy and a bit of fear as you close one chapter of your life to open the next one really sucks. I hope this passes quickly for you so that you get the opportunity to enjoy it"
1962,You are not alone in that feeling. I’m just thinking how unfortunate the class of 2020 is to have this happen on our year. I’m sad and will be even more sad if they cancel commencement. What a crappy way to end our 4 years in uni
1963,"There’s a silver lining brother, all that fun and memories is just going to make graduating that much harder and more bittersweet."
1964,"I feel you. My school has moved to online classes until at least mid-April. I'm moving towards the thesis stage and most of my friends that I met this year are going to write their thesis abroad or in their home country. This means I will probably never see them again after next week. It is sad, but I also understand it's necessary to protect students from the virus :("
1965,I wouldn't go to my commencement anyway. I spent 6 years and I have no desire to go to a ceremony meant for something I don't really feel like I deserve.
1966,Anybody else feel like they’re unwantable and have already missed their chance at happiness while still being in their mid 20s?
1967,Man you hit it right on point. It is a weird time in everyone's life.
1968,"Same here, it’s rough. I work retail, and my coworkers are all either 5-6 years younger than me or 15 years my senior. I’m polite, friendly, but it’s tough relating to these folks."
1969,"why you do me like this, im too tired to be exposed like this rn"
1970,"YES! i am going through this 100% at my job and in my social life!!! i am 23 and i know i don’t fit your age criteria in the post BUT i am going through this at work a lot since i am much younger than everyone else by many years and then with my friends because i did all the “adult” things, got a professional job, bought a house, etc. (it sounds bad i know, like poor me i was able to do these things) but it’s hard for my friends and i to relate and i don’t have any kids at work to talk about!! so i totally get the stuck in the awkward middle feeling!!"
1971,I'm 22 and just finished a book called *The Defining Decade*... I recommend anyone in this thread that identifies with the OP also read it.
1972,People certainly come and go more. Something I can't get used to.
1973,Find self worth my friend. Another's opinion of you will make you happy for one moment and sad for the next. Aspire to finding accomplishment in small achievements and value in your successes not compared to another's.
1974,How’d you buy a house at 23? Asking for a friend.
1975,"I'm 26 and God, this is one of the weirdest and worse periods of my life. Time has gotten weird, years are whizzing by. I was 20 just yesterday.

And everyone I see either seems younger or older than me. Do 25 - 30 year olds even have some sort of social identity in common? Even Reddit seems to be for younger people now. Can we make one?

It's so lonely."
1976,Same here! It's like other people our age don't even exist. There's no shared identity.  It's so lonely.
1977,"What is your main priority in life? If you just want to have a consistent group of people around that make you happy, you might be more ready for a family than you think."
1978,Ya but it's not true. You only feel that because you think you're supposed to be somewhere by a certain age when their is no timeline.
1979,"Don’t even get me started on the few of my friends that are 25-27 that are already married, have kids, and a mortgage."
1980,"My wife and I bought our house at 22 and 21. We both worked hard and saved our money when we were in high school, we lived in a crappy apartment for a bit, then we bought a shitty, small, dirty house and we live in one of the lowest cost of living regions in the country. That let us build savings and fix it up so now it’s pretty nice and we both have “real” jobs after we finished school."
1981,I second this. Amazing book.
1982,"I feel lost but I’m starting to care less and just kind of do my own thing. And I try to make friends with and enjoy whoever’s around me right now.
So far it’s working! I feel a lot bette than when post college shock/adjustment hit me"
1983,"I totally agree. I feel so lost. Even as a loner in school, I still felt like I somewhat fit in. I had teammates and I had classmates to talk to.

After college you really have no one except the people who you make a big effort to keep in contact with. My coworkers dont really count, we dont share any similar interests at all."
1984,"Weirdly, at 28 and with a good job that has given me some confidence, I find I’m able to get quite a few more dates via apps than when I was say 22 (when I got literally 0 or 1 in like 6 months). And yet still I feel this way and have yet to find the right person. I wonder if those who find their happiness in college did it “right” and I somehow missed something - but I just wasn’t ready for any of that from 20-26."
1985,You should be asking for a house instead. That’s the secret.
1986,This is my life right now and it's tough to navigate.
1987,"Eh I think it’s more that life is just weird in general and it can be surprising to discover that after thinking that it was just “school, then adult”."
1988,"Find places in real life to meet people who have similar interests to you. You’ll find the right ones if you’re not quite looking for them, but also putting yourself in the spots where you’d like to meet people! Also at 28, you’re still real young. Make friends, don’t expect much from people. Be open about your wants, needs and boundaries."
1989,r/20Somethings and r/quarterlifecrisis both exist.
1990,"So its what?  The ""Just you and the SO stage""?"
1991,Yike
1992,"Don’t read too much into it although I see where you’re coming from

I thought I was ready for the same thing and I still am

Thing is, I already have it. I have 2 very close but separate groups of friends, my family is close as well and I have a girlfriend. I’m very lucky

Not close to being married or having kids or anything, but don’t underestimate the family and friends you already have"

1997,"I thought it was just Covid making me revert back to my middle school habits of talking to friends only online, listening to the same music, gaming, etc. but you just perfectly described what it’s like being in your early 20s. It’s the awkward stage nobody talks about because it’s so different for everyone but it’s good to know it’s just as awkward for everybody else."
1998,"Everything changes once you get out of college and enter the professional work force. I’m in my early 20s, and I always have to make myself seem older and more mature so that I can fit in with my peers who are all 30-60.

But it’s interesting. There’s a constant ebb and flow between being too young/immature and being too old/set. I work in tech, and one of my older colleagues told me that his greatest challenge is showing companies that he’s not too old and stuck in his ways to be hired—especially at a new and trendy startup. On the other hand, my biggest challenge is proving that I’m mature enough about the industry and about my work to be effective. I have to put on an uptight and ambitious disguise, while my colleague puts on a laid back and cool kind of disguise."
1999,"I've never felt this simultaneous feeling, of just wanting to break out of this post-college 20s shell and be an ""adult adult"" whatever the fuck that means, but also wanting to regress into my childhood and not be responsible for jackshit anymore. Doesn't help that it's a strain to live with parents who, in reaching their 60s, are starting to not care about fuck-all either.

Although, independence and self-accountability is the greater reward for all this growing-up business.

I didn't have a damn clue what I thought my 20s were gonna consist of as a kid, but I did think they were gonna be amazing. Maybe I thought I would be married with babies, like all the other adults used to say. Now I'm too poor to get married and hate the thought of having children in this state.

I too was quite plucky and naive during my last year of high school, despite my nerves about starting college. When I was 18, I thought I was gonna super-blossom into this sophisticated, well-adjusted person throughout college. Lmao no.

I'm still thinking that though, but for my 30s. My 20s self is fantasizing 30+ adulthood to be a place where I can finally exhale and get the fuck off the mountain climb. Neither ahead nor behind, no longer being judged or vying for someone's approval. Simply comfortable yet not letting my brainpower go to total waste with those processed food, electronic creature comforts. I'm probably gonna be in for a rude awakening though, looks like it never ends lol."

Two very similar companies, one was a no show during the interview and I was asked to reschedule, the other was bait and switch door to door sales where we never see a paycheck unless it’s commission.

Just remember that interviews for professional jobs are a two way street. You’re interviewing them as well! For places that are organized, ask questions during and after the interview and figure out what are dealbreakers for you. How the team/department gets along, values of the organization, certain pay level, hours, benefits, and more specific for your exact profession.

Best of luck!"

2034,"I had a similar experience when going for a personal training job. My qualifications are quite far above that of a personal trainer but I needed a job and this would be a good experience so I went to the “trial program” where I would take someone through a program that I made for them. (Without doing a pre exercise screening or interview with the individual it’s impossible to make a program for them but whatever I just wrote up a generic thing). 

I get there and they tell me the person I’m supposed to be training is at another gym filling in for someone who is sick, so it looks like she’s forgotten about me. The solution they came up with was for me to drive to another club 20 minutes away and train one of the employees there. At this point I was pretty annoyed but it’s fine mistakes happen. 

But once I arrive the only two people working there don’t even have personal training qualifications and weren’t interested in analysing or questioning me about my program whatsoever. Big waste of time for both parties and safe to say there was no further communication between us"

Boy was I in for a rude awakening... still getting on my feet now and knocked back down every month. Two steps forward one step back. All I can say is that IT GETS BETTER, but you have to let it. I was extremely self-defeating my first four months out and spiraled myself into depression. You never realize how deep a hole youre in especially when you’re digging it yourself. Try EVERY DAY to climb yourself out of that hole! One day, long from now, you’ll look back down at that hole you just climbed out of and be wondering where the next hole to jump into is. You’ll realize how much we as humans love overcoming obstacles. Even the fairy tale that is college gets boring eventually."

2042,"You can’t buy happiness dude, but you can definitely rent it"
2043,Try finding professional or common interest groups on [Meetup](https://meetup.com). It changed my life.
2044,"Retail therapy is def a thing. I started collecting records when I was younger and now that I’m older and make more money I’m able to like actually build collections and go after rare pressings and discographies and stuff.

 I’m like a little kid with my hobbies. I get excited every time the mail comes. It’s the only excitement in my otherwise very boring life."
2045,"You are not alone, as much as you may feel it.  I'm fairly sure every recent grad out there trying to make their way in the world has felt this way.  I graduated in May 2017 and moved to NYC, mostly because I had a job offer here and my 2 best friends came here.  I didn't love the city but I was hoping having friends already where I lived would help the transition out of college.  Long story short I quickly realized that my 'friends' were only friends of circumstance in college.  They were super mean to me, always making comments about me not being successful enough or pretty, things like that.  I'd make every effort to make plans with them and they'd ditch me last minute for other groups of friends they had.  I felt so alone and held on to those friendships because they were all I had.  Eventually I dropped them and although I did feel alone, it taught me how to be happy on my own.  How to go out and do things by myself and be happy.  And it was great. 

Once I dropped them I was able to focus more on meeting true friends.  And it took time.  I've been here 2 years and I still only have 1 close friend in the city, but I'd rather have that than many bad friends.  I met her through a workout class-I did Orangetheory and started talking to a girl at my studio during our workouts and she introduced me to her friend, who is now my best friend. It was so random and happened without me even trying.  Now I'm trying to connect with my coworkers, luckily they're all my age, and I'm going to try meetups to meet people with similar interests.  It isn't easy at all, but instead of focusing on how hard it is, focus on the possibilities.  Who knows, you may walk into the gym tomorrow and meet your best friend?  There are thousands of people out there looking to expand their networks, you just have to be brave enough to go out and find them.  Try a club sport if your city has sports leagues, typically you don't have to even be remotely athletic for their casual teams and it's a great way to meet people.  Find groups based on things you may like doing, even if you don't have any current hobbies.  Think you may like running? Join a running group.  Want to learn to cook? Join a cooking class!  Volunteering is also a great way to meet people, find a cause you are passionate about and give a couple hrs every week. Also, have you thought about moving in with a roommate? It may not be the best situation ever, but sometimes having someone to come home to and just knowing they're there can be super helpful.  I've lived alone since college and prefer it that way, but I do really miss the potential of having social interaction of some sort when I get home.

It's not going to be easy, life is hard and everything sucks sometimes.  But once you stop being so sad about it so much, you'll find a way to be content being alone and from there everything is going to be okay.  Join groups, whether they're associated with your school or not, and don't be afraid to strike up convos with people in your classes or just wherever you are. If I hadn't started talking to the girl on tread 2 at Orangetheory, I would have never met my best friend."
2046,"I really appreciate all of the advice, and the fact that I’m not the only one who thinks the “real world” bullshit is over played lol"
2047,"Try to find more common ground with your coworkers or just keep being friendly and interacting with them. I’d say that might be your best bet but yeah hobbies and things with common interests that other people are into as well also helps. Give it time.

Most friendships aren’t really that good to be honest. If you put in the effort the other party most often just doesn’t reciprocate and match your energy or care about you as much and there is bound to be resentment there. I would say leave them and focus that energy on yourself until you meet people that care about you as much as you do them. It’s only fair to you, respect yourself."
2048,"> I went to a Big 10 school, hated it for the first year because I was out of my element and ended up having the best 3 years of my life 

&#x200B;

> As of the last 3 months or so 

So it took 1 year to transition in college. It's been only 3 months in your new situation? It takes time. Keep ya head up. Keep trying new things. Keep putting yourself out there.

Anyways, some actionable things you can do:

* Get happy hour drinks with coworkers. People in their late 20's/early 30's still like drinking. If that seems like too big of a step, then just go out for lunch or dinner one day. Or just take a casual coffee break - ""Hey, I need a break, wanna grab coffee from the kitchen with me?""
* Join a kickball league - no athletic skill required, fun activity, time to chat with people, but it's not forced.
* Join your college's local alumni chapter. If you went to B10 school, your local chapter should have viewing parties for football and basketball games."
2049,Is it awkward going alone to those? Or are many in the same boat
2050,"I used to run a pretty successful meetup in my city and it's so not a problem to come alone! It's not awkward one bit. Take it with a grain of salt if you don't vibe with folks. 

If any of y'all have any more questions or need a bud ever. My inbox is always open and willing to chat! 

Meetup is so awesome and I'm starting it back up soon so if you have any advice how to get everyone who is afraid to come out to give it a go let me know"
2051,Really appreciate this comment! Thank you 😊
2052,"Ever gotten into literature? I find it to be an excellent stimulation that, when you find the authors that resonate with you, can be *so* rewarding. I thought I was kinda done with reading until I really jumped into the postmodern scene. It opens up entire worlds, installs multitudes into you, and IMHO makes you infinitely more interesting. Now I can't wait to get home everyday and just *read.*"
2053,"Life after college can be a hard transition, especially leaving some of your friends behind and a support group, i graduated in June, and it has been a rocky road for me, i've been unemployed since July-August. In a way i am happy that i'm no longer in college because it was a bubble to me, and especially in my senior year i was tired of undergrad and was ready to move on to the next step. I still talk to and hang out with lots of my college buddies, what i advise you to do is look into meetup events and group events in your area to meet people."
2054,"Hope it helps! 
Yeah dude I think at some point I remembered the phrase “Don’t take life too seriously” and things got a lot better after that lol"
2055,This has always been something I’ve wondered about too
2056,"No, it’s not awkward even in the slightest. The only one I ever went to that made me uncomfortable was a straight corporate hijacking where you became a captive audience to the chief architects of an international top 10 tech company, and the only reason that one bothered me was because I felt duped into sitting through an hour long product pitch disguised as something else. The event still was at their headquarters and catered and technically you could leave at any time, which some people including myself did, but it felt like ass walking out on a bunch of engineers in suits who you could tell didn’t feel entirely comfortable with the reactions they were provoking. 

Every other event with every group I’ve attended — more than an a dozen actively — has exceeded my expectations in every way. Even the most anxiety inducing ones like happy hour socials for artificial intelligence researchers have been great because all 85 people are equally terrified, and the result is that you really don’t care after the first 30 seconds because you get that sense right off the bat."
2057,Many in the same boat. Especially in those “friends” groups where people are there specifically to make friends
2058,"I'm in the same boat too. I'm encouraged to go but having to actively fight my preference to not go out, not to drive, and not go to a social event where my awkwardness can kill a cactus is a bunch of friction I'm working up towards to overcome. 


In college, I told myself tech meetups and the like are like, cooler, more engaging versions of clubs. But getting out of the house and being a functional social person is a switch I find hard to turn on, rip."
2059,"I have to drink a fifth of vodka to go out and socialize with people on the weekend, but I have never felt more at home than with the meetups I attend. Beyond the first 30 seconds, it’s pretty obvious that everyone else there feels the exact same way, so it kind of eliminates that inner terror."
2060,"I guess. For me the music, lore, and aesthetics associated with it are something that’s been pretty consistent in my life for the past 15 years(I’m 30). I can find most of the music I buy online for free but being able to curate collections and stuff makes me feel good. 

I guess it’s like owning a painting vs going to a museum or just googling a picture. 

Idk man. Niche music communities are weird."
2061,"Since AutoMod didn't pick up on this post, check out the wiki page on [meeting people after school](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/wiki/making_friends).

Hang in there and keep trying. It's hard out there. But you can do it!"
2062,"Don't know if you're religious or not, but regardless...my wife and I found ourselves in a similar situation as you. We both recently graduated, moved states for her to pursue her graduate's degree, and left all our friends and family behind. We got plugged into a local church almost immediately, and everyone was very welcoming and made us feel at home so quickly. We now hangout with these friends on a weekly basis!"
2063,Sup? Big ten alum here too. Not sure where you went but it’s definitely a biiiiiig change. Big ten schools in general have a very very college town feel to them for the most part. It’ll take some time but it gets easier. I was miserable for a couple years after college but it gets better as you adapt to more adult behaviors and thought patterns.
2064,"isnt this only a valuable skill to live in the shitty society we have setup? 

&#x200B;

Noone would have to cope with being alone (unnatural for humans) if society at large would recognize this issue and act to change it. Normalize making life/job choices around being close to friends and seeing them multiple times a week (even living together). De-normaize the asinine ""nuclear family""."
2065,"How can I make sure a meet up has people in my age group? 

I'm 25 and a lot of the meetups had people that were much older, and it was pretty hard to connect because of the difference in life stages."
2066,"Wow, this sounds like I wrote this. I’m getting my masters online too, and have a grad job at school that pays me close to nothing so even if I wanted to go out I basically can’t. I know like 4 people on campus because they are in my sorority, but they’re undergrad and busy. Got an apartment on campus all to myself and from 5pm to 11am I don’t see any other humans, and from Friday to Sunday same deal. 

I wish I could say I take that time to work on myself or something, but most of the time I just end up watching Netflix. I feel like just getting a regular job with the bachelors and quitting the masters, but with a CJ degree basically all I can do is become a cop, and don’t want that. 

Good luck tho, I hope it works out better for you!"
2067,"I feel very similarly. I didn't do grad school and as a last minute decision, ended up going the 9-6 job route and despite having some old friends I feel so lonely. I'm going to try meetup this month but after reading some soso things about it I'm not holding my breath really. Feel free to message me if you want, I love meeting new people!"
2068,It’s tough for sure
2069,"Sort yourself. Before you commit to something, develop a five year plan. Find not only a possible career path and education also something you want to do.

For careers, not only consider office work , try looking into the trades. It's minimal lag time from schooling to a career that pays well and offers flexibility. If you go to school, think about the school and debt. If you go to community college and transfer, you are saving money while getting the same education.

If you are not sure, don't rush. It would be better to take a moment to figure yourself out then to do something you didn't want to do and take more resources and time to correct that."
2070,"1. Be really excited and happy for a week or two as you hang out with friends and talk about what college you're going to

5. Cry yourself to sleep"
2071,"First of all, congratulations! You have a lot of options. What job field are you interested in? Are you interested in continuing your education? It’s easiest if you do that now, or even if you take a year off first, because of financial aid and most info is retained in your mind from high school, like math and basic English.

Trade school is also an option, depending on what you’d like to do. Joining the milk is an option as well and through the GI bill can help pay for school later.

Do you have any hobbies that you really enjoy that you think you could monetize? Also, take a moment and enjoy yourself, relax, you just finished high school, enjoy that major accomplishment!"
2072,"I completely agree! Just graduated from college,
but I am still a little unsure of my own career goals. Give yourself a breather from high school, and try to explore what interests you at a cc. I feel like I would have been more engaged with my own classes had I figured what I wanted to do earlier."
2073,"If you're considering joining the military, then I would *strongly* caution you to triple-check every seemingly awesome claim that your recruiter makes.

For some people the military is a good fit, but a recruiter's job is to get as many people to join as possible. If you have a shitty one (which there are a lot of) they will promise you the moon and not care about giving you decent advise.

Avoid recruiters that promise you a specific job (unless your ASVAB score is phenomenal) or promise to station you where you want to go. Once you're in, it's basically a crap shoot. Some commands are better than others, but most of your superiors will have you do whatever makes them look good for promotion even if that's working 12+ hours while working on unnecessary qualifications.

Source: my father and boyfriend have both been in the Navy, and my little brother is in the army."
2074,"I'm definitely continuing my education, I'll probably do something with coding, as it's something I've been interested in for years.  As for hobbies I could potentially monetize, I've thought about giving YouTube or Twitch a try but I don't know if that would go anywhere.  Probably going to get a part-time job soon regardless."
2075,"College, trade school, could take a year or a semester off. Get a job."
2076,Are you speaking from experience? Were you in the military?
2077,"That path I took after graduating high school was enlisting in the Army (Active duty). Gonna start college pretty soon. 

But there are other options: trade school, find hobbies and see if you could do a career out of that, find a job and save up money, just take a year or so (or less) while your saving money to go travel a bit."
2078,"Just because there are clearly cops who don’t behave correctly, doesn’t mean all cops are bad. Are reforms needed? Definitely. But clearly law enforcement is needed in any society."
2079,"My advice is to take something thing you enjoy (you mentioned coding in another comment?) and look at the jobs you would be interested in getting that relate to it. Then look at the education or training it will take to get that job and figure out if it still sounds good and what's the best way to get the edu you need (definitely make sure you have a plan for how to pay for it). Name brand colleges don't matter as much as people think. Have a few backup plans and keep your options open for a while. Sometimes what sounds good after his graduation will turn out to be totally different than you expected or just not your cup of tea. 

Coding would probably be pretty lucrative but no matter what you choose, make sure you do your research and are aware of pay potential and how hard it will be to get a job in your area of interest. I know a lot of people who dove into stereotypically ""bad"" majors and ended up unhappy, but I also know people who took those same majors and with some planning, made something great out of them. 

One other thing I wish I had known sooner - if you end up going to college for a STEM major, be careful with choosing to do a semester or two of community college first. A lot of universities have well-defined paths for high credit-hour majors and doing cc can actually set you back. That said, it's often a great money saver for more flexible degrees like those in humanities. It can also be super useful to take a cc class or two over the summer for cheap, helping to lighten a heavy credit load or fulfill miscellaneous class requirements so you can graduate on time.

Edit: Also have some fun! There's a lot more freedom post-high school. I realized my answer makes it sound like you should have everything figured out and that wasn't my intention. You just finished hs, you've got plenty of time - don't pressure yourself to find the exact ""right"" choice. People change careers all the time."
2080,"I’m assuming you haven’t applied to anything yet? Will you be living with family? Lots of people take a year or two “off” after high school to figure things out. It’s a good idea if you’re unsure about your future. But you can always change your mind too. People change majors and careers. I have that problem. I still don’t know what I want to do, so I avoid making serious commitments of money and time into anything. But now I’m older and i feel more pressure to pick."

2098,"Damn, I just thought this yesterday. Going on LinkedIn reminds me of writing a cover letter. It’s full of people pulling out their best professional personality and it just seems so unnatural.

EDIT: Also, happy cake day!"
2099,Empty lizard people who think “the hustle” makes them interesting.
2100,People are creating and promoting their own brand.
2101,This sounds like a LinkedIn posting
2102,LinkedIn gives me status anxiety
2103,Yes. It's also kind of annoying because it makes other people who aren't as successful feel bad. :(
2104,It makes me cringe so hard but tbh it’s a networking site and posts like that get a lot of interactions so probably result in them getting a lot of internship/grad role offers. Might as well take what you can from the circumstances life offers you.
2105,It's disgustingly fake... But after a while you realise it's the language everyone speaks
2106,"Check out BestOfLinkedin on Twitter. You’ll laugh

But seriously it is so annoying because some posts are just straight up annoying. LinkedIn is nice to try and get connections and I see a lot of recruiters genuinely trying to help people. But then people are like “wow I did something so amazing today at work. I turned away form my desk and ate yogurt and it was SO PEACEFUL” and it get 10,000 likes. wow you took a break 👏👏👏 I’m being dramatic but not really"
2107,"I started off on the ground floor of an inverted funnel corporation selling bath-bombs. I used my experience to found a company selling micro-sink-bombs and now am the CEO of a corporation that employs thousands of stay at home moms and college students with zero real world work experience making millions an hour.

Here's a photo of my next to my Model 3."
2108,I HATE LinkedIn. It make me either feel like shit or roll my eyes.
2109,"I almost never look at the LinkedIn news feed itself. I use it purely as a platform to network and apply for positions, and to find out about other people (i.e, the background of a hiring manager or someone who I'm about to have an interview with beforehand). Although I don't disagree with your thoughts about it, it just doesn't bother me because I never look at it."
2110,"Half the time, LinkedIn “homeless” means sleeping in your car for one night because of an argument with your rich parents"
2111,"I mean you can talk shit about when other people post stuff like that, but if you had some sort of sob story wouldn’t you use it to your advantage? If i had one i certainly would. Who cares if it’s cringe, employers seem to eat it up."
2112,"/r/antiwork 

We bash linkedshit daily its truly fucking garbage among many more other things"
2113,Add in all the really awful advice on how to find a job and it honestly makes me want to vomit constantly.
2114,Using “hustle” as a fake reason to justify why they’re above their counterparts when it’s really because of connections and generational wealth
2115,Yeah I noticed that as well. Let’s connect!
2116,"Literally I never go on it unless I’m looking for a job, got a job and need to update my resume, or if someone at my company asks the employees to amplify a blog post."
2117,Don’t know why people are downvoting you as it is true
2118,I've honestly never found that people are really willing to network on there unless you already know them.
2119,"Personally, LinkedIn is how I got my post college job and has aided me in connecting/networking with other alumni. I think it's great, I can see how people's individual posts could be kinda cringy but I don't knock it
  They are networking and putting themselves in a better position when its all said and done. That's what LinkedIn is for right?"
2120,"I check every once in a while, but most comments I see between people is essentially just circle jerking and back patting, praising each other for how genius they are and wonderful job they do. It's literally like any social media but with a slightly more formal jargon. Ugh..."
2121,"OP and others such as u/srssrh u/69_sphincters are right. It's all posturing and I feel so fake when I update my profile or share some project I did, but if everyone else in your job field uses LinkedIn I have to also"
2122,I block anyone who ends a post with “follow me for more”
2123,LOL
2124,"Yeah, or the week you were in a hotel between luxury apartment rentals.. lol"
2125,"Worst part is when people start using as another social media platform. Thanks Karen for letting me know you’re a bit racists, I’ll make sure not to hire you."
2126,I saw three posts extolling the accomplishments of Trump. I reported all of them. Has LinkedIn turned into Facebook? I thought LinkedIn was supposed to be a career and job site.
2127,"I feel like that’s the purpose of LinkedIn tho? They’re trying to impress employers and mentors, not their instagram followers. I personally don’t like LinkedIn because of this but I do understand them for doing it I guess"
2128,I feel ya. I graduated in May with an IT degree. Can’t land a job :/ I didn’t do internships. Nobody wants to hire me because I have no experience.... Feeling stressed and depressed tbh.  I’m so stressed out that my eyelids are both twitching and I also have back aches.... 😫
2129,Thanks for sharing your positivity and inspiration !
2130,"It’s tough. I still haven’t found one either (graduated in June). Keep going. Read some of the previous posts on here, a lot of people had to search for way longer to land a job in their field. You are not alone, my friend.

Also, since you mentioned God I will say: if you’re blessed to have a place to stay and/or supportive family, don’t take it for graned. Remember to be grateful for how far you’ve come and keep praying and sending resumes. One of them will stick.

Good luck!"
2131,I am here for the comments because I’m now 9 months out since I graduated in December 2018 and I’m in the same boat as OP.
2132,"I'm in the same place as you are right now. It's challenging, but don't give up. This one is important but: GET THE HECK OUT OF YOUR HOUSE! Just because your unemployed doesn't mean that you have to sit at home and mope, and also you have to trust god during hard times, he knows what you are going through, but you have to keep the faith and pray that things will improve. Read the bible as well, it will open your mind. But seriously though: get out of the house, it will destroy your mental health."
2133,It ALWAYS about who you know. Connecting with your Alumni network or getting into touch with your schools career services can open doors.
2134,"Get to doing certs, don’t waste the precious time"
2135,"Don’t let it get you down, it’s tough for anyone to find a job. College gives you somewhat of a false sense of achievement in the sense that people make it sound like you’ll be able to get a job right away without any experience just because you got a degree. Well, everyone’s got a degree and the job market is competitive (especially in a place like NYC). Obviously, you’re finding that out now and i know it sucks. Keep applying to the jobs you really want, but in the meantime, take jobs that you think you’re too qualified for that are meant for people just starting out in the workforce - if you were an accounting major, maybe try to get a job as a bank teller, if you majored in IT, try working in a computer sales store, etc. This will give you some experience to build off of and also connections with people in your field. If you can’t find a job that’s somewhat related to your major right away, oh well - any job is better than no job. But you have to stop feeling sorry for yourself and move on. Life is tough for everyone in some way and it doesn’t stop for anyone or anything, so there’s no point wasting your time taking it personally and getting depressed about it. Just make the best of your situation and don’t give up trying to get the jobs you really want - but realize sometimes you might have to take a couple steps “backward” in order to move forward in your field."
2136,"Trust me when I graduated with my business marketing degree I couldn’t find a damn work or internship in my degree, after I finished college, I worked as a part time job coach to help people who were on the spectrum to find work and that was hard, but every morning that I would wake up I would apply for work just took an hour out of my day and applied, I applied for everything on indeed and nothing, nyc is a competitive place, even being born here in this city I learned that I just had to keep on applying, so from June of 2018 I didn’t work my first real job till October of 2018 but as of right now I work for the fire department and got hired as a emt, job is ok but I got benefits and a pension and easier to move up and around  but you see you never know where you land, apply for everything, even in government and you’ll never know where you land, good luck to you. Don’t give up hope, always be hopeful, I had like 5 job offers from government agency’s In nyc, although it took some time but I got them. So trust me you got this."
2137,"Dec 2018, can't even get a ""not-real"" job (takeout server). It's pretty soon I'll be homeless, then broke, then dead."
2138,"Same situation! Born and raised in NYC, graduated in May and didn’t start working until Oct and that was only part time. 

The grind don’t stop, even if you’re in a city. If anything, it’s a lot harder bc there are people outside of NY coming in to compete for the jobs you’re applying for as well. It’s really all a luck of the draw."
2139,Unless you’re like 91 years old never talk like that!
2140,"I'm waiting to hear from my last chance by the end of the week. If that fails, I'm through; like legitimately done for."
2141,"I'm two months away from my graduation and i literally can't wait untill i will be free to do what i really desire to do. Don't forget what you already achieved. Meet up with people, live your dreams."
2142,"One thing that might be good for you is to apply for a position at a service or retail job. Jobs like that can help you make connections, give you a sense of purpose, and a pay check. They’re not particularly intellectually stimulating but they have lots of their own challenges and could help you develop problem solving and people skills. Or at the very least, give you something to do while you search for a position you really want."
2143,"I'm sorry to hear what you're going through. 

It can definitely be hard to stay positive when you're going through a period of unemployment. But I think the biggest thing you need to do is break the cycle you're in right now. Locking yourself in your room is not going to help, and it actually could be hurting you emotionally. I've been there, and I know isolation personally made me a lot worse.  

I would encourage you to try and get out of your room a bit. Get out of the house. You need to try and find joy and fulfillment in yourself and your life outside of work. Do something social or fun with family or friends. Lean on them for support. Participate in things that make you happy or feel good. Stay away from too much negativity (consider limiting the news you watch, unsubscribing from negative subs - and that may include this one - etc.), because consuming negativity can only bring you down more when you're already suffering. 

If you need money, or even just to get you out of the house, consider taking any job just to start working, earn some money, and feel like you're doing something productive with your time. In the meantime, continue applying. Go to your school's career center if you can. Get some help. See if they can review your resume for you. Are you open to relocating? Are you open to jobs outside of your major? That may increase your application range. I would also encourage you to post an anonymous version of your resume to r/resumes for feedback. Sometimes a few tweaks to your resume may really help you get some callbacks. 

This period you're going through is temporary. You are also not alone. There are so many others who are struggling to find jobs after graduation. You will find something, eventually. Your self-worth also should not depend on your ability to get hired. Please remember that. There are a million factors that can go into a hiring decision, there are a million other aspects of life that are so important, and you not getting a job yet does not reflect on your worth as a human being at all. 

If you are severely struggling, please consider talking to someone if you can. I don't know what your financial or insurance situation is like, but a doctor or therapist may be able to help if you are seriously becoming depressed. You're not alone and you don't have to suffer alone. You matter. Please consider seeking emotional help and support if you need it."
2144,"Hi, i am exactly in the same position. Any update on your job search"
2145,"Exactly so you gotta really be up everyday and apply and apply and understand that out of 20-30 applications you apply only 5 will be looked at and you’ll be lucky if you get more then 2 interviews but your not suppose to give up
At all; your suppose to be hungry for this enough to apply every damn day, a bachelors don’t matter, it’s about the experience on your resume and what you have done with your life and why your better then the 1000 other candidates that they got lined up, but Im set for life now working for the fire department, it’s not my field of study but I’m damn proud of what I do."
2146,What is your degree in? Where are you located?
2147,"Hi there, I graduated in May 2018. I only started finding jobs in July 2018 and landed an okay job in Sept (which turns out to be a shitty first job).

I understand the super low feeling as I just got rejected yesterday for a position that I really wanted. After making into the final round interview. Ugh. Felt like all the efforts were wasted.

There will be many hurdles in the future, just wanna let you know that this is definitely a very common experience and please don't think that you have failed."
2148,"Your mind and body need to be in sync.  Working out positive body you’re proud of eat good, cook good.  It stimulates the mind helps all around.  Doesn’t need to be expensive either everything you can do in an apartment.  I wish our minds could run interrupt task when stuff like this happens and shake you out of it. But we don’t you’ve gotta drag yourself back to be the best you!"
2149,"Never in God, Stay up young king. The time will come."
2150,"Hang in there! Still the same, I get calls/phone screenings but nothing happens after that. Some days, I get three to four rejection emails from jobs I applied for. I’m trying to be positive but it’s hard :/"
2151,"New Yorker here too, I’m on my second college year landed a good gig for the summer, and I will take the upcoming NYPD test exam this November, I don’t care what the media says about our police force, is a lot of opportunity to grow in the department, good luck and I hope you become a Firefighter because is tough being a emt in the city"
2152,Went through the same cycle over a year before getting a job with an BSc. engineering degree. Granted that I only looked after graduation and had to learn a lot to present myself well in interviews.
2153,Me too but it’s been 1 year for me.
2154,"I was just in your shoes! I graduated in december 2018 and i applied to SO many jobs. That was all i did. I worked at retail on the weekends, and the rest of the week i would wake up, go to my neighborhood's coffee shop with my laptop and spend my days applying to jobs. This was easy to do the first cpuple of months, because i was still so motivated. But once march/april hit, I felt so discouraged because 1, i saw people that graduated with me getting jobs, 2, i had a stem major which apparently ment that i would ""get a job with no problem"" according to many, but i didnt so it made me question my skills, and 3, because of all the rejections i got. Like you, i also got far in the hiring process at my dream company and was not chosen at the second to last step. But I landed a job a couple of months ago (6 months to the date of graduating lol!) And it is the best job i could ever ask for. 

Never lose hope and persistence. I know that sounds so cliche but those two will get you through. Gain some perspective, and let that give you hope. You graduated! You are qualified! These companies know you are fresh out of college so they dont expect you to know more than you do. And that means that when they reject you, its not just about skills. They are looking for a ""fit"" and they analize your future goals, the way you talked and dressed, everything! Eventually you will run into the company that aligns with you and they will be glad to have you! Let that be your hope.
And make sure you never loose that persistence. Find networking events and go to them even when you feel like they are a waste of time because you didnt get anything from the last one. Apply to 4-5 jobs a day online. Over prepare for interviews. Eventually youll find your fit!"
2155,"Have you considered the military? With a four year college degree you could go in as an officer in the Reserves. Reserves would be better for you since you wouldn’t have to be deployed anywhere. You would be able to have another job as well as receive good pay and pension from the government. Plus, they could hook you up with some GI Bill $$$ if you were considering a Masters for example. Your degree gives you an advantage over regular guys just enlisting."
2156,"At my daughters masters degree commencement, the speaker actually said at one point...now get out there, and good luck finding a job in this market
I wanted to strangle  him"
2157,What degree did you end up graduating with if you don't mind me asking
2158,What are you going to wear after work and at weekends? I get changed out of my office drabs as soon as I come home
2159,I still have my old merch shirts too. Love them except I’m too fat now.
2160,"There are many places that either don't have a dress code or a relaxed one. If it's that important to you, try to find a place like that. 

I wear jeans to work every day and am in total comfort. You also have to find the clothing that works for you and is comfortable, regardless of what you need to wear to work everyday."
2161,Have them sewn into a quilt! Then you can enjoy them every day :)
2162,"Although I don’t have much of a fashion sense, i felt quite upset about this when I had to work in an office as well. 

It made me wonder how people could ever spend so much on clothes if they’d to be in offices with a dress code for half the day."
2163,"I thought about doing this to all
My old baseball jerseys. Great idea!!! Now, how to sew...."
2164,"I start work next year and my plan is since I’ll wear what I want less I’m going to purge my closet of the stuff I’m eh on, I still have shirts in there from middle school lol, and start investing in fewer higher quality pieces that I consider my style exactly. That way when I do have days off I can be extra happy with what I’m wearing"
2165,"This. Every job I’ve had since college has had no dress code or a relaxed one .

Maybe look at startups if it's that important to you"
2166,I wear Lululemons ABC pants and Wolf and Shepard shoes to work every day paired with H&M no iron dress shirts. Feels like I'm in sweats and running shoes everyday. The cost is worth the comfort 100%.
2167,"I actually have noticed a trend in accounting firms and other businesses like that in my city switching to a “dress for your day” type of policy. Wear jeans if you’re in the office all day, wear a suit if you’re meeting with clients. I don’t think this is all that uncommon these days. Definitely depends on the industry/company and location though."
2168,"Welcome to the working world. 

There’s a reason why your dad still has T-shirts that are older than you are."
2169,I’m surprised no one else has said that you can still try to express your individuality/ dress the way you want on a smaller level! Throwing on some funky accessories or maybe edgy (but still professional) shoes might make you feel a little better about your professional outfits. I think there are definitely ways to make it work. I hope you find some!
2170,Depends on your job. As an engineer I just wear jeans and a t-shirt
2171,"Lots of places that employ engineers have switched to jeans and a shirt with a collar. The tightening labor market is to thank for that. One CEO (of a 10000+ employee company) I spoke to said they werent getting enough fulltime hires from their intern class and dress code was one reason cited. So they said if dressing down gets better employees than it's a no brainer. As long as unemployment stays low, you'll see benefit inflation to attract talent even from ""old school"" companies. Working from home, paternity leave (and more maternity leave), 4-10s and 9/80 schedules, etc are all being introduced nowadays in a wide variety of sectors."
2172,"In my company, one of our offices dresses business casual, while in the other it's casual. No sweatpants, beach flipflops or the like, but I've seen employees in ripped jeans and undershirts as t-shirts and no one said anything. One guy came in with his sports jersey and baggy jeans to work.

Edit: it's an engineering firm."
2173,"There are a few people in the Dead scene who do this with old tie-dyes for a fee (you ship them shirts and PayPal $ for the work), if anyone is really interested in doing this make a post on r/gratefuldead and ask to be pointed in their direction."
2174,"Sure. It depends on where you end up working. Some fields are more causal friendly than others.

But outside of that, there are weekends, holidays, nights out, etc. that you want to be comfortable in/look nice in. You may not need a closet full of those clothes, but you're far from not needing it."
2175,How relaxed? Business casual or basically wearing what you want?
2176,This is exactly what I've been looking for thank you
2177,"I don’t have a dress code that’s enforced. But I also refuse to get a job at a place where I have to wear slacks and uncomfortable clothes. If black pants or a sweater or a long sleeved shirt isn’t ok, then it’s not the place for me. I can’t afford a whole new wardrobe."
2178,"Other than startups, which kinds of places allow this?"
2179,Any tech company
2180,This is why people gift ties on Father's Day.
2181,"I feel like you can almost use it as a sign that you need to be doing more for yourself, at a certain point. Like, ""Hey, I haven't worn clothes I like in a while. Maybe I should go out and have some me time."""
2182,Find a job with a more progressive company or just come to the west coast. Almost every company out here could care less what you’re wearing.
2183,"Most of the offices where I live? I never had a dress up code. But I mostly worked in culture or marketing/journalism they don't really care about suits. 

Also NGO and non governmental organisations. My ex was an engineer in UK I have never seen him to go in a suit to work. Neither his covorkers in France.

My brother in law is a project manager and I see him wear jeans to work."
2184,"It wasn’t every day, but I worked for a large international corporation and Fridays were always casual. People wore jeans/whatever they wanted (within reason) every Friday."
2185,"My last job was at a fairly large recognizable company and basically they just required no offensive language, exposed undergarments, or otherwise obvious ""no gos."" Besides that you could ""dress your day"" so most people, including the C-Suite, were in anything from shorts and t-shirts to maybe like the casual side of business casual. You only had to dress up if your day required you do — for example, you were visiting a vendor office or something."
2186,"Not sure how strict your dress code is, but try to buy clothes that you can wear in various other settings such as a bar or a night out. Also, look at the positives. Wearing your street clothes less means fewer washes and less wear and tear."
2187,"Its funny that I have the complete opposite experience - all through School I had a strict uniform policy that included how you cut your hair and being clean shaven. I'm now in my first full time job as an Engineer and everyone in my office gets to wear want they want as long as its not inappropriate. We're respected enough to make the correct call - when I have meetings with certain clients then I might put on a collared shirt but my day to day is T-shirt, Jeans or Chinos and Sneakers. Super comfortable and it instills a relaxed vibe in the workplace."
2188,"The good spring weather is vividly reminding me when I graduated high school and college. It sucks because I have no time to be nostalgic or emotional, I have work to do. I'm purposefully avoiding music I listened to back then (Weezer, Sunny Day Real Estate, At The Drive-In) because I know it's just gonna make me feel depressed."
2189,"A year after I graduated college, I was standing at a bus stop with some college seniors in the city I had moved to. 

I felt kind of like I had won an Oscar in 2010 and was attending the 2011 awards: still doing okay, but clearly yesteryear's star. 

Another part of me wanted to tell them ""Guys, enjoy the celebrating now because you won't have many reasons to celebrate after you get the diploma"""
2190,"no regrets here! I’m not made for school at all and that debt because I want a piece of paper everyone else is getting, isn’t worth my sanity at the moment..."
2191,"I feel the same way! Like it’s weird, they’re so happy in their pictures and their captions are so hopeful and they sound so on top of the world...I hope they are still that way a year from now lol maybe post grad life won’t hit them very hard"
2192,"There is an oxymoron on the value of education.

Say someone did 7 years of college, but never finished the required classes to get a degree, and then leaves.

Is that a waste of time?"
2193,"Makes me grateful to be done. But I absolutely hated college, so.."
2194,"Personally I would say it wouldn’t be a total waste of time, but definitely not a good choice. A degree is very valuable to have when getting a job, without a degree there isn’t always proof that you know your stuff. That piece of paper proves you knew it fairly well."
2195,"i agree, i hate when people say that college is the best 4 years of your life"
2196,"For me personally it was just the heavy academic workload, how friendships seemed very ephemeral and rarely lasted beyond a term, and how I never really found my social ""niche"" like some do in organizations like Greek life. 

I enjoy working life much more, my job is a lot more flexible and well finances my hobbies and lifestyle, with plenty left over."
2197,Yeah I disagree with a lot of these people. I am so much happier now that I'm not in school
2198,Makes you miss the bliss of naivety
2199,"I definitely agree. It’s better to do the absolute bare minimum, 2.0 average for four years and get a degree than that first scenario I mentioned. The value is in the degree, not the education. It’s just weird to me"
2200,"For a long time it made me feel like a loser. I didn’t finish college or graduate at the same pace of all of my friends.  it took me a really long time to find my purpose/degree path.  

Now I just remind myself that life is a journey not a race and we don’t reach the same destinations /achievements at the same time as everyone else. 


Now that I’m seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. I’m just grateful I didn’t go the traditional route because I don’t have half of the student debt my friends do now."
2201,Wow haha awesome  Fuck is that really how everyone feels
2202,"I’m graduating at 30, almost 31. It feels weird man, just part of the package I guess."
2203,"I'm in the exact same scenario and it does feel kind of weird. I look back at my convocation and it all feels surreal to me. And then came the uncertainty about what to do with the future and the fight against the daily grind of an inexorable job. I do miss university but at the same time, I'm pretty settled for now. If I'm honest, the thing I miss most about university is the abundance of free time and the absolute multitudes of like-minded and similarly aged people. The wacky adventures and the continuous learning was incredible as well but freedom of using my time the way I want it? That's what I miss the most.

Huh. I guess I can no longer say ""I just graduated"" now. That line belongs to the newly graduated."
2204,Lol it would if I hadn’t thrown myself into an intense one year grad program right after I graduated (cries in exams). Can’t wait to be done (again)!
2205,"It’s bittersweet, but my QOL has gone up greatly after graduating."
2206,"It for sure does!! This year all the people I graduated high school with are posting their graduation photos and it’s making me feel like I missed out. But I’m also glad I didn’t finish my bachelors, it just doesn’t seem worth the debt."
2207,"What was so bad about it for you, just curious? I’ve just finished my first year and loved most of it, it wasn’t easy but I didn’t completely hate it either. I made a lot of friends and miss it already. What did you hate about it?"
2208,"I did not have the traditional “college experience.” I transferred from a community college. My field of study required constant collaboration, something that I kind of hated. I liked to keep to myself, get the work done, and go home. Most assignments caused me extreme anxiety and the whole time I was attending I felt lost. I had no idea what to do with my life, and my professors did little in the way of encouragement. It was a lot for me. I had to go to counseling eventually because I became extremely depressed. I guess I just never found my place in college. I never fit in and it was not easy for me to complete it."
2209,"Well fuck me, I’m about to graduate and this post is depressing af 😂"
2210,My birthday is this week so I bought myself a cookie cake. It says “happy graduation class of 2019” on it but idgaf
2211,"Completely agree. If college is the best 4 years of their lives, they really need to explore/get out more. I personally found more happiness and less stress when I’m not in college."
2212,Ooh same. All my old classmates are leaving school in the next couple months and im still a year away from leaving :p
2213,Little bit. You learn how to not be petty but happy for them.
2214,1 year out. Having money (even tho it’s been hard to meet people/girls) is waaaaaaaay better than college ever was
2215,Sammeee
2216,I graduated last Saturday and there’s already certain aspects of college life that I’m really missing.
2217,I graduated last Saturday and there’s already certain aspects of college life that I’m really missing.
2218,"Have you ever been tested for ADHD? If this has been a problem your whole life, and is getting increasingly worse, it may be something you can treat with medication if you see a doctor. 

My older brother was diagnosed in his 40s. It’s sad that he struggled so much before that."
2219,I agree here. I didn’t get diagnosed until after college graduation. Do make sure to speak with a professional and ask for a QB test. It may point you in the right direction!
2220,"How long have you been out of school? Are you working? I ask because life right after you graduate can be very stressful: you're either underemployed and scrambling for more money or you're employed full-time, but your job exhausts you mentally. 

Added stress can lead to issues with concentration and motivation."
2221,"Second this, Read both"
2222,"I have depression and anxiety. I treated for a couple of years and today I'm in a much better place that I was, but I still struggle in some degree"
2223,Audiobooks are also an option
2224,"I find the pomodoro technique for timing yourself for reading works for me (and I'm ADD and don't take medication for it and still managed to come top in my class in uni. So even if you are ADD or ADHD don't let people sway you). And tbh I've even pavloved myself (and friends...) with small rewards whilst studying/reading. Just anything to make it a little more enjoyable.
Also if you really want to learn something new, my best advice is to put all of your best efforts into taking really good, effective notes. It's always better than just attempting to stare at a book for an hour. 
Maybe give yourself some mini tasks, or mark out some objectives you'd like to find out from some material and make notes on those for a set amount of time?"
2225,"One year out. I'm employed, not exactly under but I'm not making tons of money nor working in my field. I think my job exhausts me physically more than mentally. But I have concentration problems since before starting to work"
2226,Lack of attention/struggling to concentrate can definitely be symptoms of depression. Big life changes can retrigger it even when you’ve been treated so some counseling could definitely be helpful. I’m actually in that exact same situation right now
2227,"This. As someone with ADD this sounds all too familiar. Here’s an article from a website that I have found very helpful in navigating ADD as an adult. https://www.additudemag.com/symptoms-of-add-hyperarousal-rejection-sensitivity/
https://www.additudemag.com/add-inattentive-adhd-symptom-test-adults/"
2228,"It can’t hurt to look into it and have a doctor evaluate you. 

Take care of yourself."
2229,"Probably some form of ADD or maybe cut back on caffeine, smoke some weed, or maybe you’re like me and you’re better at doing multiple things at once, like maybe study and do push-ups In between or stand and study, there’s several different remedies I just know this because I used to have the same issue until I started trying different shit,"
2230,"Shoot for 8 hours and watch your life change. In the US when time goes back even 1 hour and people lose 1 hour of sleep, the rate of heart attacks increase by 24%. Then when time goes back an hour heart attack rates decrease because people are sleeping an extra hour. Sleep is the single most important thing in our life and it’s the number one change we can make to our lives that will influence everything we do."
2231,"Trick yourself into learning. Here’s what I do: 1) browse on reddit/internet or listening to a podcasts or find something to watch on YouTube/Netflix 2) find something that naturally excites you that doesn’t need to be relevant to your life just something that you personally think is interesting 3) spend some time googling it or watching educational videos 4) find a book to learn more about that topic or move on to something new you’re interested in. if you can’t focus on text, try audiobooks and follow along with the book"
2232,I actually love studying. My field is purely academical and I love to read thesis and whatnot.
2233,Are you getting in a consistent quality 8 hours of sleep?
2234,[deleted]
2235,lol
2236,"No.... I try, but my sleep is very irregular. But I never get less than 6 hours at any given night."
2237,It’s the exhaustion. Try go to gym
2238,"Read fiction - start with Fight Club, Ready Player One, The Road, No Country for Old Men, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Reading easy but engaging books will rekindle whatever chemical in your brain that is causing you to feel this way. 

Go to the gym - try to run 5 miles a day and workout 3 days a week. Or buy a bicycle with the money from your new job and try to identify popular trails. 

Learn new things like cooking or computer stuff. Learn how to set up a Plex server (/r/homeserver /r/plex). Learn how to use photoshop. 

Now: set goals - 
* read a really intense and long book like Suttree, the Entire LOTR series, Don Quixote, or write a short story of 30,000 words. 
* Work up to deadlifting 300 pounds, or benching 265, or running a full marathon, or biking the Great Allegheny Passage. 
* Earn an IT certification like the Sec+ (essential in any job even tangentially related to government) or the A+, or an Adobe test to verify photoshop skills. 

Work can’t be the only thing in your life. Work is just a way to pay for the things that make you better than you were last year."
2239,"> Work is just a way to pay for the things that make you better than you were last year. 

Today I (a fresh graduate in her first career) am speaking to my boss to ask for a switch into a new department at work, because after 6 grueling months of trying this role, I've learned I am not happy with it. I needed to read this today. Thank you."
2240,"Often people who get a good response from weed for their ADD end up dependent on it (i.e., if you start smoking for ADD you better not stop and you're going to stop getting stoned in a couple months and high after a year or so)."

2246,Just started first job out of college feeling the same way but kinda expected it. Learning new job and everything but also from middle to high school to high school to college it seems like the cycles we go through
2247,As a Brit it's really hard to understand the frat stuff. Our college is from age 16-17.
2248,"Depends, man. Your frat boofin’ tonight brah??"
2249,"I was never really felt lost as a child, I just lived in the moment and learned as I went. So I’d approach it that way instead of feeling like you should know everything about experiences you haven’t had or skills that you’re still building. 

School is a contained environment, and if you’ve had the average 4-year course it’s going to be a transition from the academic setting to the professional. Honestly it would suck to have peaked in college and feel like you know everything. Life would be pretty boring if that were the case. Imagine if one of your older coworkers only talked about their college days. Or if you had a younger coworker who just done with high school and only talks about high school.

It’s hard to be at the bottom and feel clueless, but I’ve realized it’s kind of a privilege to be a fresh grad because no one expects you to have everything figured out. Since you have a job, it’s good that you have a structured environment and a way to keep moving without being completely lost. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. People at your work have probably been in your position, everyone has experiences to talk about, and a lot of people love helping.

It can still be hard to be the youngest one at work. Since you were in a frat I’m guessing you have a lot of friends you could talk to. I’m assuming there’s opportunities for you to be a mentor and guide for members of your frat who are still in college, so your college experience is not completely obsolete. It’s also what led you to where you are now. Share your knowledge but look forward and ask questions. I recently graduated and that's helping me."
2250,SQUEE?!?
2251,You are sorta at the bottom of the totem pole as far as work experience and age goes. You’re in a different world/game now. Give it some time and hard work and you’ll be climbing up the ladder soon enough!
2252,"YES. Oh bruhhhhh it’s you Bart!!!!???? Hahahaha man heard you’re doin’ well. Got some top law job? Nice, nice. Gotta get back to the basics n’ party more one of these days."
2253,See maybe I'm old fashioned but that description you gave makes me pray Europe never does come round to that idea. 😂
2254,The transition from middle to high school and then from high school to college
2255,Yeah we didn't have anything like that in my Uni to my knowledge. I think it's just strictly an American thing. Then again I didn't really go clubbing or party much in Uni either.
2256,[deleted]
2257,With one semester left I started my first internship this summer and it truly feels like its back to square one. But that can be a good thing because it also leaves you open to learn and not feel like you already know everything. I have been learning various things about how the professional work environment works and what type of work is expected out of me.
2258,"I’ve felt like this ever since I graduated 4 years ago... i’m starting think that everybody feels like this, and some people are just better at hiding it than others."
2259,I get the feeling OP has based a lot of his personality on his frat and his social standing in it. All of a sudden his support network has completely fallen away.
2260,I’m recently just out of my second bachelors degree and in my 30s in a new career and I still feel like a fish out of water. But it makes my days off feel so earned... I love it.
2261,"Imho this is why co-op is so important, gives you a taste of real life in college while still not having too much responsibility or consequences."
2262,"I think it makes it harder because in college you were in a social group where status meant a lot. It definitely is a much different world. 
I say, enjoy the challenge of trying to learn the new skills and even social interactions. Eventually things will fall into a routine. 
I’ve noticed that a year or two after college people really stop talking about it. You’re building new experiences. If you’re not, try joining some clubs after work or finding new hobbies. Some of my male coworkers do disc golf together. Or coach teams. 
You seem like you’re doing a good job so far. Keep it up and just remember a few years down the line you’ll be the guy that new workers think have it all together."
2263,"For me the jump from college to real world is very big and there is not much help. Sure your parents can help, but learning to manage your money, all the things your parents did for you, and maintaining an adult social life is tricky.

But it is a learning experience. Don't be afraid to fail. Learn from your mistakes. You are young, take advantage of it.

If you are into sports / have a hobby, try finding meetups where you life to meet other adults."
2264,I’m scared
2265,">Nobody cares where I went to school or what frat I was in.

That's probably because it doesn't matter."
2266,"I am one year out from college and I can definitely relate. My advice would be to learn a lot at whatever job you're in from anyone you can. This way, you can see what direction you want to take in your career. Build on the experiences you already have and have that shape your personality. I'm sure this will help you moving forward!

&#x200B;

Also, work towards your more personal goals and use your income to fuel your passions you weren't able to achieve during school. For example, saving up money for that new car you always wanted or going on a trip with friends/family."
2267,"Here's a bit of my experience after graduation. One thing to remember is to be careful with your words. Oftentimes employers test newbies by making other employees ask you questions, like ""what are your hobbies, do you want a coffee, when did you start smoking"" and so on. It's easy to get lost in a conversation during a break or during work. Anything you say can be used as a reason for you to get fired. The first thing to learn is self criticism, as one question in particular (which ended my first job) was ""do you think you worked efficiently today"" or some variation of it. If you are still learning, it's better to show your interest and passion for the job. If you for example finished doing your tasks, ask for more. Persistence is key to both getting a job and staying there. Don't be overconfident though, learn as you go what you are good at, by doing extra work. It's sure kind of depressing that noone comes forward and starts a conversation, experienced people usually get annoyed by silly or long stories about your past. Don't get fired up when asked a relatable question like videogames or where you go out in your free time, as I said, it's easy to get lost and say something you shouldn't have ever mentioned. The truth is, if you are consistently in the workflow, the job will get interesting and exciting, depending on how involved you are. It's like doing homework while listening to music you enjoy  (my choice is ambient like Aphex Twin, C418, Daso, Legowelt or Vaporware, Jazz). You forget about your worries, or to check Reddit. I learned this much later, but you should know now"
2268,Being careful with my words is something I'm not accustomed to. Of course I'm not gonna swear all the time but feeling like anything I say can be used against me is annoying. I don't want to feel like all eyes are watching or as if I'm in prison.
2269,Every day.
2270,This is basically me. It’s like I’m in college still except now I work forty hours a week. I still play video games all the time outside of it.
2271,"Just like being top-dog in grade 8 to being little pup in grade 9, and being king ring in grade 12 to being little man in year 1. This isn't the first time it's happened.

I'm trying not to comment on your frat status, because I don't know or care about anything about you, but *if* it made you feel like you were untouchable in university, the shock of the real world is going to be like falling into a cold lake, fratso."
2272,The problem with me is I did the opposite. Felt pressure to  know it all when I should've been learning.
2273,Can't deny that
2274,As far as I'm aware we don't have them in Australia. We just socialise normally.
2275,"Identify the small (and large) things that you find interesting and pokes at your curiosity/wonder. We look over and underestimate how the little things can take us into rabbit holes that can eventually turn into possible careers a decade and a half later.

It's important that you reflect on the differences between what's ""fun"" and what piques your curiosity. Something can be both, something can just be one, something can be one and lead to the other. Knowing why is also important, e.g., was it the teacher, the learning environment, or was the concept/theory/idea just straight up interesting (e.g., mind-blowing). Especially if it's the latter, look into it and see what professionals are doing with it or about it."
2276,"STEM fields are massively on the up with amazing pay grades and are at a low risk of being taken over by automation. 

More generally, The future is always daunting but remember go with the ebb and flow of your life but nothing comes easy at all just put in a load of effort and you shall be rewarded. I left school with terrible qualifications and have now sacrificed so much to work incredibly hard through the college system to go to uni, I finished my final exam coincidentally today and I'm track to get a first class honours degree. It seem impressive but for the last three months I've barely seen my friends, not had a drink to celebrate and been doing 45 hour a week library stints for no pay. I know my effort now is beginning to pay dividends but others may look at think it comes easy to me. Take your own journey but at least at the end of it don't have the thought of, I wish I could have tried better. Certain environmental factors will stall your progress but a true champion is someone who works through all the weeds and bad shit.

When you feel like no-one believes in you, I do. If you need anything at all, guidance or questioning etc then please do not hesitate to message me and I'll do anything I can to help :)"
2277,"My advice: if you do stem, its still easy to change to non stem. If you did non stem, you are pretty limited - someone who changed his major from psychology to computer science"
2278,"Is this true? Ive been told that compsci is pretty saturated right now, and its honestly making me scared to continue with my degree"
2279,"Your a smart kid for thinking like this. Look closely and try to avoid same mistakes that others make. But besides that, enjoy growing up, and have fun in high school it’s not gonna last forever :)"
2280,"True computer science and web development are *completely* different fields.

If you’re doing compsci, be prepared for tons of math and tons of abstracted concepts.  There is lots of exploration too, so not everything has a solution.

Web development requires almost no math and a solution exists for almost everything, and your job is to fit it together.

A real analog is an architect versus a builder.  You still need people that build houses and you’ll never be out of a job. But architecture takes a lot longer to learn, is more lucrative and much more challenging.

That said, if you’re not passionate about computer science, don’t do it. I watched a *lot* of my peers drop out due to burnout because they were in it for the wrong reasons."
2281,"In high school i was a pos. I sucked. My grades were ass and I never cared. I had no friends, unless it was ball season. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Now, I’m married, have a degree and have the best job in the world! Just here to tell you everything comes together, just apply yourself and believe in yourself! You got this!"
2282,"If you have somthing you enjoy doing, throw yourself into it. And if you can’t get paid to do it, work a job that will give you the money to support that. 

Some people will tell you if you love what you do money will come, reality says chances are that won’t happen. And also the other thing people don’t tell you is when you do something for work everyday, like building cars, you probably won’t want to spend your day off working on your own car.

That’s why I chose a degree that is something I’m interested in, that will pay well enough for me to live and afford to have a hobby of building and driving cars and bikes."
2283,"I (20m) was failing school at your age. It took me another couple of years for me to mature enough to understand the importance of  school and to learn how to revise.

I retook a year of school which sucked at the time, but allowed me to ace my exams. School isn’t that difficult honestly, you just need the right tools and the motivation to succeed. You can succeed if you put your mind to it!"

2285,"When I was 15 I was doing shitty in school just from lack of interest I ended up having to do an extra year. After I graduated I spend a couple years doing shitty jobs. And one day I got in at a small construction company my buddy worked at for one afternoons worth of grunt work. That was 4 years ago my buddy quit I was made full time salary with great pay. All I’m saying is don’t worry about it, it will all work out. Best advice I can give is always be on time never say no to extra work and make yourself an asset they wouldn’t think of getting rid of."
2286,"""If you do what you like, you'll never work a day in your life."" Just trying your best and doing what you enjoy are 2 of the most valuable things you can do at this point. I'm also still in high school, and I'm here for the same reason. However, I know that I want to do computer science, so I'm putting time into it outside of school to get ready for college. Just fo what you like, and if you don't know what that is, then just keep searching for it."
2287,"Most importantly: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE SOME OF THE SAME MISTAKES PEOPLE HERE HAVE MADE!

Yes learn from the people here, but don’t be afraid to take some risks in your schooling or career path. If you play safe and over think our mistakes you may never have a story to tell of your own. Keep our mistakes in mind, but do not let them take your energy away. 

You do not have to be an A student. Just get your HW done. Try to study a little for quizzes and tests. You’ll pass. High school for me was social. I got C and B grades all through 9-12 grade. What you don’t realize is this time in your life is that you will always look back at it. It is up to you whether you get to look back on it as a positive or a negative. Make it a positive memory!"

I used to work a soundboard and it’s my favorite job I ever worked, but I didn’t like the pressure that came with it."
2291,"Hey little homie. 

I had great grades in high school. 3.9 GPA. In college, I had a full ride, but got kicked out due to me doing things I shouldn’t. I flopped around job to job and finally found out: I really like helping people. So I started as an entry level employee, then ended up making about 25-30 an hour (dependent on weekly bonuses). I quit that and started helping people in other ways (smoking cessation). Find something that makes you feel accomplished. When you do something and finish it, and it feels good to complete it: chase after that. College isn’t necessary. It’s a good opportunity for networking (meeting other people in different fields of work), but so is starting off entry level somewhere that you can grow in. Best of luck!!!"
2292,"I’m a career professional who helps people transition into new career fields, and I can say in my experience what your degree is in (especially if it is rather vague) does not really matter that much if you can apply it or your previous job skills to the positions you are applying for. I’ve had jobs (including right now) that had nothing to do with my degree. 

All you need to do is demonstrate how your degree and experiences qualify you for the position. If you’re worried they may not, think about how you can more broadly apply them.  Skills like time management, team leadership, organizational development, and efficiency measurement always look good and you can almost always say you have them."
2293,"Look into the military if the idea of 4+ more years of school sounds shitty. I’m ten years in, make $80k/year, and I go to Japan for 3 years in August. I get to bring my wife and son at the Army’s expense as well. Plus I work in satellite communications so it’s not like I’m in a job where I am out crawling in the mud all day."
2294,Just join the military. Either you do it when youre 18 and get out at 21 or do it after college and get out at 25 and wish you had gone in earlier.
2295,"I did not do well in high school...not well at all. I got into a decent state school, but nothing to write home about. I fucked around for my first two years and took care of my gen ed classes. In the middle of my 2nd year I started to lean towards something in the realm of business and in my 3rd year I picked accounting. What you do in life should depend on what you want of course. I wanted to make sure I was employable and that my degree would get me a job, and accounting will do that for sure. There are many majors like that. If you have a passion for something and plan to pursue that, then make sure to do some research and find a smart plan to pursue that passion. Taking big leaps without having a goal in mind is definitely not the way to do it. If you want job security, definitely do some research on that. STEM and accounting seem to be in pretty high demand right now. I can't think of a single person that I've met in the accounting program who couldn't find an internship in school or a job after graduation. That being said, not everybody wants to do accounting. Bottom line here is that I was fucking around in school until about 20. You are only 15 so while it can't hurt to try to improve your school performance sooner than later, realize that your performance at 15 probably won't negatively affect you TOO much in the long run, if at all. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or wanna talk about anything."
2296,What if your interested in both fields?
2297,"If you dont mind me asking, what did you major in?"
2298,You're better off doing CS and doing the boring shit that pays the bills but doesn't ruin your life like game dev. Medical and business software is big but low key.
2299,Fire fighting sciences and emergency medical services!
2300,"The demand for the CS field is rising at an exponential rate as a ton of tech startups start growing as well as larger scale companies. As stated from the person above, as long as you have some decent knowledge of coding, that should secure you a decent paying job, if not more. Obviously the more experienced you are in the field, the more you’d get paid but yeah"
2301,"Im actually studying as a music composer part time once a week which is completely doable since it’s my hobby anyways - this way I just improve a bit quicker.

Going for a career in music as major is super risky and unless super talented or insanely hard working, I wouldn’t recommend doing that as  major.

That doesn’t mean however you need to completely give it up!!

Just doing something in STEM allows u to have a lot of options later, because with these studies you can basically still go anywhere after a major but it’s not the other way around"
2302,"Best advice I can give you from someone that only went to one semester of college: learn a trade. Find someone to teach you how to weld, work on plumbing, fix HVAC, look up technical school classes. You'll pay way less in school costs and I guarantee you'll find decent paying work. 

My girlfriend's dad was a research physicist for 3M for years before he was laid off/forced to retire. Now he works as a general mechanic for a machine plant, fixing things and welding things back together, making the same money he did before - about 90k/year."
2303,Surprised no one has mentioned looking into the trades.  Nothing wrong with good old blue collar work. Often times very rewarding and allows you to move just about anywhere. Sometimes I wish I’d stayed but moved into corporate. Done well but offices are life draining places.... keep you options open and good to think early...
2304,"You can always explore trade school, University is not for everyone even though it seems that schools always push you in that direction. But you could be a great tradesman and make a decent living"
2305,"There is no other time than ""now"" dude. The future never shows up because it's just your best guess at what's going to happen next, and 99.999% of the time you're wrong.

I'll be 33 in 8 days. I feel like I'm a little behind the curve too, but I'm doing pretty well for a single guy with a job he would prefer to leave. We're in the same boat. Lemme break it down. 

I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 20 with no identifiable cause and it hit me like a train. But in that dozen years, it taught me one thing:

*Some obstacles are not part of what I anticipated, and I never anticipated that some obstacles are instant and irreversible.*

Accepting that fact - and it can be applied broadly, like your transmission dying for $3000 repair - was harder than accepting the epilepsy itself.

Gotta play the hand your dealt because all that shit can be snatched away instantly, without your consent or any forewarning. You must act because you are constantly at risk of being acted upon, or exposed to actions that create obstacles.

Do what you can to get what you want. Embrace the immediacy of life and live like you're still going to make it, because if you do, you will.

Cool like the other side of the pillow. RIP Stewart."
2306,">all much further along in life.

Maybe it’s helpful to think they are simply further ahead in their careers, not in life. As long as we’re alive and healthy, were all the same ways along in life"
2307,No i just thought I'd be there by now.
2308,"Tons of people think this. I'm only 25 so maybe I can't speak for your exact situation, but I feel much the same.  I thought by now I'd be married and well on my way to a fantastic career.  I'm single as can be, broke, and working a 9-5 boring office job making average money.  I've watched friends find love, get married, get high paying jobs, buy houses, etc, and I feel so behind, but everyone has their own path.  Your season will come. 

In the meantime, chase your happiness. If you want to get married and have kids, keep dating and go to singles events.  If you want to travel, save some money and go. You can travel for much cheaper than you think you can.  If you want a house, create a plan to save up for one. And it's never too late to start down the path to your dream career, you just have to be gutsy enough to give up what you have to start the journey."
2309,I thought I’d have a boyfriend in college but it’s my last semester and I’ve found no one so here we are.
2310,"Also it’s important to not equate an *impressive* career with a fulfilling one. Yes there are some people who seem born to work in some roles and truly appear satisfied. However there are also countless stories of people who have the kind of salary and prestige most people dream of, only to give up everything mid-career and completely pivot because they can’t take it any longer."
2311,"You’re not the only one, I thought I’d have a girl.  But here we are.. parents starting to question my sexuality, even I’m starting to question myself... all it takes is time, so don’t worry."

Also, we were raised in a time where it was realistic for all of that to be accomplished at our age but truth is we don’t live in that world anymore."
2318,"It’s still not too late to pursue your dreams and get where you want to be. Screw the deadlines you had in mind and continue to work towards the things you want. I once felt like I had fallen behind in life after becoming very sick, but then I realized we are all going at our own pace. There is no race to be won. Just continue your journey in the way that works for you best."
2319,"I love this answer. You described my exact situation - I'm 25, I work a job in my field, but there are a myriad of issues that come with it. Feels like a pointless uphill battle leading to nothing. Persistence is key, I suppose, and hoping for the best with just continuing onward."
2320,You’re absolutely right!
2321,"I’m 27 and I’m still finishing up my final 3 college credits. Last semester I was an intern, and I’m about to be laid off from my mediocre retail job because the store is shutting down. My boss and her store closing has taught me so much about how life changes and there’s never a clean cut path. That said, I’m constantly convinced I’m behind my peers, and all that does is fuel catastrophic thinking. People do full career changes at 40-years-old all the time and have to start from the bottom and climb to the top.

As much as I judge myself for where I am all the time, I don’t think 32-years-old is too young to do... well... anything, frankly. In some places, people still view that as ‘kid’ status. 

You’ll be okay, man. Just know nothing great comes to your door because you simply want it to. Give it some thought and figure out a plan. I was so lost this time last year, and while it’s been grueling getting back on my feet and feeling okay with what’s thrown my way, I’ve managed a huge perspective change on what age really means."
2322,"Oh yeah, I feel you. I haven’t even graduated yet but I already feel like I should have already done research or had a better internship. A lot of the people I went to high school with have already graduated (it was dual enrollment). It’s frustrating, but remember that everyone has a different path. You’ll get where you need to be."
2323,"I mean, if you were coming out of school prior to the 1990s, and relationships worked how they're portrayed in the movies this would all be viable. Realistically though, as millennials we're living in a wildly different world than our parents' and can't really expect the same things they've told us to strive for. And your 30s doesn't seem too out there for a number of things you want. It could always be worse too- my neighbor is almost 40, still single and at this point trying to screw divorced women, still living in our rental clearly as he's a free lancer (assumedly not doing well enough to buy a place).

On the jobs point, many people are happy simply to have a job, given how crushed they are by debt and cost of living.

Marriage, well relationships are tough. Finding the right woman is on you though. I don't know if you're looking for a playboy bunny who also holds a PhD and is willing to be a housewife, in which case yes, your expectations are too high, or if you simply just haven't had time to date or met the right person. Being single in your 30s isn't that abnormal though.

Good money? Well, wages are crawling along, even as cost of living outpaces them, simply because of dumb economic policy- either tax the living daylights out of the middle class for ineffective government programs, or conversely deregulate everything so businesses can gouge the common man. Blame Washington, and the champagne communists at your local university- this is out of our control. The house bit goes along with this.

Traveling the world? Ok, totally on you. Even on a shoestring budget, you can make that happen. Work overseas. Go backpacking. Do whatever- this one is completely attainable."
2324,"Yes, that’s a part of life. On one hand, you’ll need to renegotiate your expectations and do some introspection into what’s really important to you. On the other, bro, why haven’t you done any traveling? Like what are you waiting for? Book a trip."
2325,Every. Damn. Day.
2326,"Welcome to real life dude. Keep improving, keep making forward progress, it's all you can really do."
2327,"I frequently struggle with the same thoughts you do--That I'm behind, not good enough, slacking in some way. Just try to remember that comparison is the thief of joy and, if you really can't stop this silly little game of comparing yourself to others, at least play fair and compare yourself to one person you're ahead of on top of comparing yourself to someone you think you're ""behind"".

I've noticed that I literally never compare myself to my former classmates that are in active addiction, part of MLM schemes, unemployed and playing League of Legends all day, etc.

The point of the exercise should ultimately be to remind yourself that you'll always be below someone, and you'll always be above someone. Just focus on yourself, your goals, and work relentlessly towards things that will bring you some inner peace."
2328,"We all do, you're not alone here my friend, i'm only 23 but i thought that i would have my own apartment, a full-time high paying job, lots of money, a significant other, but nope, i'm still looking for a job, single, having money problems and still living at home. It's easy to feel down when you compare yourself to others. Marriage isn't all what it's cracked up to be, lots of marriages have ended up in divorce."
2329,I feel the same way. Graduated college with a bad major and couldn't get a career from it. At this point I'm just cutting my losses and moving on.
2330,Thank you for your optimism.
2331,Man parents have been bothering me like that also! “Hurry up I want more grandkids”
2332,How much have you saved? And if you don’t mind me asking what has prevented you from saving more than you ideally wanted.
2333,"Thought I'd share my experience as well. I'm 25 though so I'm probably not as anxious? But at the same time I do have that nagging sense that I'm not progressing. Spent a year working in a dead-end job and now starting over fresh as the lowest associate in a big firm... Feel that I'm stuck making the same money year after year. 

My friends who graduated and stayed in the United States are making 60k to 100k at their first jobs in finance/tech. I can't compare myself to them. I'd be so frustrated. I am just glad that I got the chance to work at where I am now and hopefully it's a good enough springboard to elsewhere. 

I do have a partner but we're nowhere close to discussing marriage; I don't think I have the financial ability to own a house. Technically I can take a house loan but I'm not willing to for now.

As for travel, that's the thing I'm least concerned about. I do like exploring new places but I don't have FOMO if I don't travel somewhere. Cheap destinations can be great too."
2334,What did you do throughout your years to achieve that goal? Did you network with other professionals in sports journalism? Did you start maybe a sports blog to heighten your credibility? Did you take any risks to get where you wanted to be?
2335,"An employer lying to get candidates?? You are a bold-faced liar!!

""We're urgently hiring!""

""Great! I'm urgently looking for a job!""

""Yeah, okay.... So, we'll probably get back to youuuuu.... Mmmm, I don't know, how's next month sound?""

2340,Along the similar lines I went ahead and did a master's on cybersecurity without any experience. Helpdesk positions won't consider me because I'm overqualified and security positions won't consider me because of no experience. Unemployed for two years still. Life is a joke.
2341,An associates in liberal arts 😂. Took me 3 years and in the end never used it. Got a warehouse job at quest diagnostics with matching 401k and have 80k saved in it in only 5 years plus its a 5 minute walk and make 21 an hour. Should even have bother going to school. The only good thing is my scholarships paid for it so i got the degree debt free for whatever that’s worth
2342,"For me it was just a little less than a year, and the only reason I got a job was thanks to my uncle. I got interviews, even far into interviews, but it never panned out. All that time spent on “assignments” which were basically free work only to get to the final interview and get declined."
2343,"The thing you have to keep in mind is that all it takes is a foot in the door. One job in your chosen career path is all it takes for you to get another one without nearly as much stress. The first time seeking a graduate job is a slog. The next time will be a breeze by comparison, I promise you."
2344,My dad and I to a T.
2345,"Mannn, so you are who they picked over me. I salute you sir."
2346,"Four months is pretty good by graduate standards, particularly when you're focusing on your field of expertise rather than seeking out jobs more widely. 

What you have to realise is that when you're graduating, so is every single other final year student in the country. You're competing against people who have the exact same level of experience as you, but that surge goes down after a few months."
2347,"Always the way! All it takes is one thing on your CV, and suddenly everyone wants your experience."
2348,Thanks I'm cured.
2349,I agree with you on that . The amount of pressure we're all putting on ourselves is too much.Nothing is set in stone. Just live. Still I'm glad I can find others who I can relate with.

2361,"You know, I’ve gotta give people a bit of sympathy. I am diagnosed with depression on top of many other things. It sucks and it’s painful and it’s hard. But nobody really can change it except yourself. It’s frustrating being told that. I used to be one to downvote things like I posted, too. That sorta thing takes a long time to accept and sink in. However, it’s the truth. 

There’s going to be a lot of shit that goes wrong in your life and a lot of times where you feel you don’t have much to be grateful for. I’ve been homeless multiple times in my life. I’ve almost failed out of college twice. I’ve had my fair share of adversity. But you’ve gotta be the one to turn it around. Nobody wants to be depressed, but a lot of people feel they can’t do anything but accept it. It takes a lot of time to realize that you can turn it around and get the energy to do so."
2362,It’s unfortunate you have so many downvotes. You’re way of thinking is definitely more positive and productive for everyone. It seems like everyone wants to be depressed.

2364,"Every story is relative, everything is relative. For those people it does suck and nothing else going on changes that for them in their situation."
2365,OK boomer.
2366,It’s amazing what a positive mindset can do for a shitty situation. Training yourself to think positively can be hard to do if you spend too much time with negative thoughts and mindsets.
2367,"I've also gone through bouts of depression, and the main thing I've learned is that you can't focus on the bad. It's dangerous to say ""I hate my life"" because all it does is pull you a little but deeper into a rabbit hole of despair that you do not want to go down."

2374,"Thanks, but I really dont need it anymore. Doing fine right now."
2375,I'm glad to hear it!
2376,"I 100% agree. To be honest, this subreddit is full of fucking whiners. Get off your ass and go get your happiness. Don’t sit here and whine about how you picked the wrong major etc. find something else. I picked a major that I’m not really using right now, I have a lot of debt too. Try something else then. I don’t feel bad for you."
2377,Go see a therapist then. The base assumption for a discussion forum shouldn't be that everyone needs to be treated like they have clinical depression.
2378,"I still don’t understand why upper education, and k-12 education don’t work like they use too. Graduating high school use to mean something, and going to “upper education” basically meant interning with an expert in your chosen field for 5 or so years, not formal school."
2379,Why don't they? It's bs.
2380,"Sounds like everyone in this thread has taken the same attitude as my coworkers when it comes to technical proficiency. Yeah you can get by as an engineer with the basics, but I’ve seen master degree electrical engineers look at me funny when I mention pull up resistors, god forbid someone ask them to do op-amp analysis. 

If you want to graduate and get a job where you dick around all day and talk in circles in meetings, go ahead, that’s what most people end up doing. But if you’re trying to do a job that’s more than managing a few excel sheets it helps to be able to synthesize information, apply it, and document it rigorously. The people who get recognized on a regular basis and end up in expert roles are people who have the massively overlooked skill of producing a readable technical document the same way you would in college. You can seriously turn in B level work and instantly stand out just because you have a portfolio of documents showing what you’ve done and why it worked. But nobody does it because it feels like homework and they want to pretend like they graduated so it’s fine to just zone out and let their brain slowly turn to mush over the course of their entire career."
2381,3 years out of college and I’m still trying to build my social network. Kinda hard when you don’t have friends to start with.
2382,"I guess part of it is the disconnect between companies and the schools. And I’m not talking about just universities but high school systems as well. They are so off in terms of what is taught, expected and examined from the same in the job world. It baffles and saddens me that the companies dont invest anything into changing this and creating an education and gauging system that’s much more aligned with what they want in their future employees. It’s a win win for everyone. They get a better class of employees who are actually good at stuff that matters and students are more prepared for jobs. But instead we come down to spending years in school and finding job requirements on linkedin and then finding ways to show we have all the skills

Edit: I know of few companies through experience (maybe there are more) that actually are getting involved in k-12 education and providing kids with hands-on experience, invoking problem solving rather than asking memorized answers. But I still dont know if they are planning to work with educational institutes to change the ways of gauging skills and all that.

Edit 2: disconnect not lack of disconnect"
2383,"Well i’m starting college few months from now and was (until now) really worried i would forget everything once I graduate, thank you!"
2384,"I think my best advice is to be welcoming. Like, you’re passively inviting people to talk to you at all times. I always smile, say hello or good morning, ask how people are doing, and put forth real effort into remembering details about their lives. In turn I have too many people wanting to become friends with me. It’s annoying because I’m a recluse/shut in that just wants to play video games alone, but I suck it up and do it because I know it makes them happy to talk and it helps me develop that social network. “THESnowman191? He’s a great guy! I’d work with him any day. Of course I recommend him for this position.” Boom, job offer."
2385,"When I'm training people on the job and I see them taking ridiculously diligent notes on what I'm saying, I literally tell them to stop.  Pause for a moment, and instead of focusing on copying down everything I say so you can reference it later, *think* about what what I'm saying right now instead.  Think about *why* we're doing what we're doing.  What's the problem we're looking to solve?  What's the best way for us to solve it?  

I find simple memorization often *impedes* a person's ability to actually *learn*.  For me, step-by-step documentation of a process comes after or during completion of said process.  While *learning*, focus on understanding what's going on.  Then, while *doing* it, pause to take some notes for your to reference in the future.  Those notes will make much more sense to your future self because you'll write them with an understanding the appropriate context."
2386,"The trade job was easy, I live near a major Navy shipbuilding company that churns through thousands of employees. High school diploma, pass a reading, math, and drug test, you’re in.

Fast forward a year and the churn is happening, a 1500 man layoff rumor. It’s ‘last in first out’ seniority based so I knew to do something. I asked around and decided to get a couple IT certifications that meet a DoD mandate requiring them for military contracting. I got laid off but I knew a guy working on a contract and he got me the interview. I didn’t know it at the time but they willing to completely overlook my utter lack of experience since I met the DoD mandate, had “military experience” from my last job, and were underpaying by a wide margin.

Fast forward a few more years and a coworker left for a much higher paying military contract. I figured I got enough on paper experience and talked to him about it. He ended up referring me."
2387,"Ever since 6th grade I had what is called an IEP (and a 504). It basically allowed me extra time and extra credit work to make up for a failing grade. It was great! I could fuck off all I wanted, never did homework because I knew I could get a small packet at the end of the quarter to bring my grade up to C or D to pass. I never had to challenge myself.

Now, as a 29 year old with no college degree, I’m finding it really hard to push myself, motivate myself to work harder and to challenge myself. I get very upset and frustrated when things aren’t easy and tend to shut down or break something. I never paid attention in school and was never challenged and it makes things really hard. But I’m now in trade school to be an electrician and I’m in my second year of the trade. The hands on work makes the schooling easier because I get to learn everything twice"
2388,"I think most colleges assume the ""job you want"" involves more than just zoning out for 6 hours a day on reddit hoping that someone leaves bagels in the break room. I would say that 90% of the successful projects in my lab are done by the 10% of people who are lifelong students of their craft, sit at desks with a bunch of textbooks, and meticulously document what they do so that others can understand it. Most other people in that same role just kind of throw projects together with no documentation or explanation of how they work, then end up just abandoning their mess in such a poor state that the person who takes it over might as well just start from scratch.

It's one thing to say ""I understand how this works when the person who made it explains it to me. Why would I need to memorize these principles?"" But it's a completely different thing to actually look at a problem and recall the exact principles you need to implement in order to solve it. And then even if you know what needs to be done, you need to actually do the math required to apply the solution."
2389,"“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”"
2390,its Really more about understanding the concepts of whatever you’re doing. Obviously it’s not a requirement for a job but if you have a good base of knowledge it will help you.
2391,How did you get your foot in the door for those jobs?
2392,"I always thought I'd use math in my career since I had to take differential equations.  Turns out that the math is extremely minimal, and it's a rare occasion that I'll need to use anything more complicated than what I had learned in the 7th grade."
2393,"I only adjusted to my current method after seeing the diligent note-taking not pan out for a few people.  I found they either A) completely forget about their notes when it came time to do the task again, or B) were unable to fully do the task even with the help of their notes.  

Another problem I very commonly saw was that they would zone out and completely miss the last 7 things I showed them, while they were busy focusing on their notes.  Granted, that was more of a focus/distraction problem than a note-taking issue.  But it definitely appeared the notes seemed to facilitate that distraction. 

I wasn't being dogmatic in my approach; rather, my approach *was the adaptation* to help these specific employees learn more efficiently.  It also wasn't all auditory.  The scenarios in question were highly visual.  I was doing the work with them, and walking them through the problem and our approach to solving it.  Anyway, long story short, once I got them to actually pay attention, be present in the moment, and think *with* me through the problem and our solution, I've found they're actually fantastic learners and even have a lot of their own input and improvements to add.  

I totally agree that it's possible that other individuals wouldn't learn as efficiently this way and would be served much better by their personal phenomenal note-taking abilities.  That's why, as a teacher or boss, your first and foremost teaching method has to be **adaptability**.  You have to be able to handle each person flexibly.  But it was clear with these particular individuals that their note taking tendency was more of a school habit that was working to their own detriment."
2394,"Kinda, but I’m in a medical field so some basic memorization is kinda important LOL. But as far as basic stuff I learned in high school, the critical thinking skills and study habits I had to cultivate to try and memorize honestly half pointless things was way more important than actually memorizing stuff like mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. As far as my secondary medical education though, it is good to memorize aspects important to my job. But honestly the hands on experience is a hell of a lot better teacher than flash cards and tests. I’ve regained a good bit of knowledge that I basically just memorized for tests and forgot because it was pertinent to my job but hard to apply until I actually got my hands dirty. Or I have half memorizations which is honestly kinda funny to think about. “I know this muscle here originates here and attaches here, but I can’t for the life of me remember what it’s freaking name is!” Not all muscles are named fun things like tensor fasciae latae(the coffee muscle we called it in school bahaha) google has been my best friend in those situations..."
2395,"Unfortunately the most valuable currency in the job market is experience which you know requires, you having a job to get it."
2396,replying to save. nice comment
2397,"I was just doing some training for my new job that talks about this exact thing: the concept of shuhari, in which you learn a process first by doing it verbatim, then by tweaking elements based on experience, and finally by being able to make your own personalized process."
2398,"I hear this a lot and can definitely understand how it looks to the person talking. I try to take minimal notes if someone is teaching me one on one or in a small group. 
That being said, I’m not an auditory learner...if I don’t write something - anything - down, it’s not gonna go into my brain. Doodling and note-taking is actually what keeps me an active participant in the conversation, not the opposite."
2399,"Because that’s not what they do... Schools exist independently from jobs. They aren’t job-training companies.

You go to school to learn something."
2400,Happy cake day!
2401,Not denying that. I’m saying teach students for stuff that matters in the professional world not just memorized answers. Make the learning more wholistic.
2402,Thanks for pointing it out!😃
2403,"Looking back on college, what I learned was how to be independent. You have to hold yourself accountable, you have to study (most people do), and you have to learn how to make good decisions on your own. These are all valuable life skills. And then when you graduate, many opportunities are open to you that wouldn’t have been had you not gone to college. Think of it like a screening process for identifying who can keep up with higher demand jobs in the real world.

Graduate programs, including business school, are different. As someone who went to business school after working for 5 years after college, you will learn many things that you will apply in your next career. But it takes several years of being in the working world to fully appreciate and be able to apply the concepts that you learn. 

In other words, don’t worry! College is about growth as a person, not necessarily as a professional (at least that was my experience)."
2404,Yes! And my co-workers either have to ask someone else or Google of we come across a complex issue that no one knows the answer to
2405,Google is my best friend/coworker
2406,"A guy I met in a hospital told me, you remember what you use."
2407,"Yes. It depends on what you do; not all jobs are like this.

There’s no way I’d be able to do my job without the formal education I received in school."
2408,"Because life in college doesn't map to the reality of what goes on outside. College is a bubble that teaches you theoretical knowledge that contains almost zero practical value. If you want to be a professor or a researcher, going to college/graduate school is a sound decision. Otherwise, no. 

Most of us go to college, hoping to find meaning and purpose in life. But this current education system fails miserably at doing so. Whose fault is it? Or rather, how can we make it better? I am still looking for the answer myself and wanting to help more people break away from the outdated values and norms people believe in today."
2409,I think it's a sound decision to go to college if you want to be an engineer or work in healthcare as well haha
2410,You have to make your own purpose outside of school
2411,">Was so excited to see my name with **my degree** behind it on business cards and email signatures, my first ""reaL"" job after university, **my boss ruined that for me** and it felt like all four years felt like nothing.

what degree did you get and how did you boss ruin things ?"
2412,"It's understandable that life is full of trial and errors, but it sucks that our society doesn't allow room for any flexibility without big consequences (i.e. years and money wasted for those who fell into that situation)"
2413,"Education matters for getting a job... but it is now just a paper needed for some bureaucratic reasons behind the hiring process. Like a checkmark for the hr department. Skills and knowledge you acquire from the degree are not practical at all and nobody cares about that...

Exception: Doctors, Lawyers and Scientists who 100% need education to do their job."
2414,"I have a Bachelor of Commerce. This boss didn't see any value of me being educated and disregarded it. It was actually a manager from the same company in a different city who had to remind him that me having my degree next to my name meant empowerment. All he said was ""Sorry I didn't realize"" and that's when I quit my job."
2415,"I've always made an effort for people who always come to me for help, etc.. It's not the same for when I make the effort to reach out and no one is actually there for me. It really hurts thinking I have family or friends there, and they're actually really not there at all."
2416,"That’s true but also you’re coming into an age where you need to start figuring it out for yourself. High school kids are young and stupid, they need some guidance. By the time you graduate college, god help you, you should be able to put two and two together. You can’t expect someone to lay out a life track for you your whole life. What’s next, you need your job to prepare you for retired life? 

The fulcrum of the human experience is learning by experience, and trial and error. If your whole life was on a guided track that wouldn’t be a life. You can’t expect to be prepared for everything in life."
2417,"Yep. I’m a fresh graduate, just graduated last spring. I never knew what I wanted to do in life but I was told that as long as I had a degree then it’d be fine. It’s super not fine and I’m having some kind of crisis, I guess. I can’t find a job and that sucks. College wasn’t so hot either. I didn’t have friends for the first half and felt like shit. I didn’t really do anything worthwhile either, no partying or anything only because I couldn’t figure out how to get into that stuff. I feel like I wasted my years and I hate everything. I’ve tried talking to so many people about this but nobody’s helpful. 

So it’s good to know there are other people out there who feel the same way. It’s less likely to know we’re in the same boat."
2418,This is EXACTLY why I made the Post College Podcast
2419,[deleted]
2420,"Seeing this post was interesting to me. I worked hard and played hard in college and had some of the best times of my life. Now I’m living at home, thankfully working a job that I love which I can see a career in, however, there’s just something missing in me.

I miss the innocence, excitement, and spontaneity of college. I miss weekend adventures, late night food runs, and getting drunk with the guys. I miss walking outside of my house and miss my friends and I miss living with people my age. 

I agree, some days there feels like there is a lot of emptiness. But I also think there are small glimpses of good moments that take me back to those feelings I use to feel back in college. They’re just harder to find and might not be as strong. Maybe this is something we have to accept as we move onto this next chapter of our lives."
2421,"I used to think that people just naturally figure things out as they get older, what they want to do in life, how to be happy etc. But then time passes and I graduated college and I found out that you have to work hard for these things. Wisdom isn't gained with  time, but with experience."
2422,[deleted]
2423,"What I always say is, if you're not making mistakes or failing it means you aren't trying.

But real talk, it does suck when societal pressure and people in your life push you in a different direction only for to realize that original direction was a much better fit."
2424,"Workforce puts us in a really weird place. I'm 27 and the youngest on my team.

I feel like I'm back on kindergarten with all those cool older kids, but without a whole bunch of people sharing the same moment in life that I am at.

Idk, after this covid thing I really hope we can find a solution to this adult social dilemma of fitting in the portrait of the family (wo)man vs being yourself."
2425,"Get dreaming, find a goal for way into the future"
2426,"I was nihilistic and hedonistic until I realized the meaning of life is having children. They don't tell you this anymore, thanks to the hippies. So far, I'm loving the traditional path."
2427,"That funny to me. I’m 22 and I’m the youngest of my team. However our team average age is 23.5. (We’re all a part of an entry-level pipeline program, 2-3 graduates per year, all on the same marketing team). But even I feel like I’m in kindergarten. 

I just miss getting beers after work or playing ping pong or random chats about everyone’s weekend.

Edit: but yeah, it’s hard to live up to the expectations society has of us all."
2428,"There are ways around this. 

If someone can get an internship before leaving school, or right after, that would be ideal. The earlier the better. It would at least give you some kind of real-life exposure to what it could be like working in your field. If you hate it, great - you’re still in school and you can switch to something that will fit you better. Maybe you could also see if you could shadow someone, or simply reach out to people and ask them about their careers. 

If you’ve just graduated, and do well at the internship, maybe you’ll get a return offer and can work at this company while searching for something better and learning the skills you’re striving for in your own time. 

I don’t know what kind of job you are or were aiming to get, but more schooling isn’t always the answer. Some fields and majors are broad, and there can be a lot you can do without needing to get another degree.  Or maybe there’s a shorter path you can take, such as a certification, apprenticeship, bootcamp, connection, self-learning, etc. that can help you get to where you want to be. 

You could also try just getting your foot in the door with any kind of job, even if it’s not super relevant, and use it as a stepping stone to the job you want to get. You could spend some time at a job and then might have an easier time switching departments if you wanted to try something different. Some larger companies even have rotational career programs specifically for new grads, where they cycle through different departments every few months or up to a year and then determine the one they want to stay with. Or you could use the connections you make at your first job to help you get into the field you want to be in for your second or third job."
2429,"Post podcast name, interesting"
2430,"100% me. It's like, between the ages of 16-23 (for me at least), it was always looking forward to the next big leap, the next big thing. Now that I've graduated and have a job, it just seems just so...empty? I can see why all of my friends are actively pursuing relationships and getting married. This whole routine of just work work work is terribly mind-numbing and it seems like everything after college has become a blur."
2431,How do we do that? I’m 22. I don’t know how that goes.
2432,I will listen. Thank you!
2433,It’s called the Post College Podcast
2434,Welcome to the club. So what are you doing now?
2435,"I literally both did internships, a fellowship, and freelance work in my current field, and thought it was for me. Yes there were issues I saw but none of them seemed like dealbreakers. I just got a new job in the field (after trying for a year) and realized that I cannot see myself doing this long term.

The new field I’m going into (teaching) requires more education in order to get a license so yes I do have to go back. Teaching has its own issues, but it’s the only thing I can see myself doing long term. There is absolutely no way I’m going to stay in marketing or a marketing adjacent role."
2436,Nostalgia is one hell of a thing. Transitions are tough and this pandemic doesn’t make it any easier. I guess the best thing we can do is keep our eyes focused on the good things ahead and the new people we are sure to encounter.
2437,"Think about where you want to be in 1 year, 4 years, or 5 years. Do you want to be living or working in a big city? Do you want to be traveling the world? Living in a different country? Do you want to be enriched by friends and hobbies? Getting a master’s degree or PhD? Adopting a dog? Being closer to family? Being in the best physical or mental shape of your life? Building or buying a house? In a committed romantic relationship? Getting married? Having kids? 

I would think about the overarching goals you want to achieve first (if you don’t have those, I would recommend doing some soul-searching), and then break them down into the smaller goals that will help you get there. And just continue working at it, little by little, day by day. 

It’s up to you to live your life the way you want to live it. No one else is going to live it for you. It’s up to you to determine what’s going to bring you happiness and joy, and work towards achieving and seeing those things in everyday life."
2438,I’m a studio intern at a comic book production company. :)
2439,"Congrats! Still struggling to figure this out myself ! But I’m glad you found a job! It’s hard, but I know I’ll get thru it too"
2440,"It’s a lot of fun so far! Lots of computer stuff where I’m at and not quite as creative as I’d like, but it’s a creative space and I have some actual say in the final outcome of some published comics, which is pretty cool. 

It can lead to anything in comics, graphic novels, or video games! I have a degree in illustration so I’m kind of going where the wind takes me lol"
2441,"Honestly all I did was apply for like, 30 jobs a week on Indeed. The hard part was waiting for interviews and then sitting through some shitty ones lol"
2442,"> and it’s only minimum wage

It's awesome that you landed something related to your degree and that's great for your future, but this suggests they don't value the position much or there isn't much competition.  Get some quality experience but be sure to keep an eye on what the next step is (likely a different company).  Still - congratulations!! What you've done is not easy!"
2443,I'm still in school too but already feeling anxiety over life after graduating
2444,What’s the gig
2445,"Hey! I graduated with a degree in illustration as well in may, with minors in graphic designer and animation. I've worked as a childrens book illustrator while in school (seems fun but it actually isnt lol) and as a graphic designer during my senior year and right after graduating, and in August I started my job as a motion graphic artist currently, and while I do love it, hopefully I can move to be a creative director sooooon. I just love being able to creative!"
2446,"Congrats! Being an art major is hard, and the discouragement around you from hearing people say ""You will never get a job ever"" is even harder. Sounds like this is potentially kicking off your career. Good luck!"
2447,"What’s that like 🤔

Also what career path does that lead to?"
2448,"Oh yeah, this is obviously a starting point!"
2449,congrats... im on the verge of getting my first job out of college.. would make the holidays a lot better
2450,That's amazing! Congrats on getting the job and I admire your perseverance during all these past months
2451,"I'd say if it is full time, yes"
2452,That’s awesome and inspiring! Good job!
2453,lmao the success story the rest of us dream of
2454,Congrats!!
2455,"I love your enthusiasm!
Best of luck on your endeavors, keep us updated !"

2458,"Advice from my old man to me about school: “having a degree doesn’t guarantee anything, but it definitely doesn’t hurt anything”"
2459,and time...
2460,and mental health
2461,You are where you are now as a result of going to uni. I know it sucks but you got there in the end. I’m 38 and have finally this year got to where I should have been all along. I bring so much with me into my new job and I am so thankful for that.
2462,And liver.
2463,And asshole
2464,This is somewhat common...your life isn't over. If you can live at home and pay off college debt you'll be fine
2465,"I got a degree and am now excelling in a plumbing apprenticeship, fuck it dude do what makes you happy"
2466,"Think of it this way, the choices you made have already passed and been long gone, so there’s no reason to think of “what-ifs”! You’re happy now and that’s what matters :)"
2467,"this might have been true when you could pay college tuition with a part-time summer job. 

&#x200B;

These days going for a degree is a massive gamble in opportunity cost and outrageous tuition fees that can be a serious setback."
2468,"You will have picked up a lot of good traits at university that you won’t even realise, such as how to keep to deadlines, social skills, build a work ethic and ultimately figure out that its not for you. Which you may never have known unless you did it."
2469,Think about this. In the future you’ll need that schooling to ever get advanced in your degree. To something even higher up. FYI marketing isn’t really a direct major it’s kinda all of if the place like business is
2470,"Yes I really do, still got a long way to go but being fully licensed and the freedom that comes with that is all the motivation I need!"
2471,Life isn’t always cut and dry. Do what u love you’ll be a happier person in the long run.
2472,You’re absolutely right. It’s been awhile since my dad was in college so his original message is a bit outdated
2473,That has been my advise to a lot of people is the trades is where it's at. I'm happier than I ever was and I enjoy my job. Not to say it's for everyone but I love it.
2474,"No one can take the degree away from you. You solved problems, you completed projects, and you achieved an endgame/goal. You accomplished something HUGE. Now, no matter what, you have something to fall back on. 

My best friend has a degree in finance and is now a diesel tech. He doesn't regret a single thing. It is something you get over and realize eventually."
2475,Happy for you that you found something you love!  I think Americans need to encourage more gap years to figure out what you want to do with your life before taking on debt. Thanks for spreading this message. 💙
2476,"I cases such as these, I do not think you made a bad decision, rather, you are just experiencing an unfavorable consequences. You must have a reason why you opted for a degree in marketing in your past. Regardless, human beings are always constantly seeking for the place they ""belong"", and you'll never know where and how your degree or your current job might bring you in the future. So, just put on your best in what you are currently doing."
2477,"That's crazy cuz I wanna go BACK to college to get a degree in Marketing. I see marketing jobs on the rise these days, and I'm fascinated by the psychology/sociology/influence of it and how, I feel like anyway, our world is like 10% products but 90% marketing."
2478,"Yes! As an American I agree entirely. College was pushed very fiercely as ""the next step"" during my last two years of high school. I'm in the workforce now, and planning on taking an electrician apprenticeship once I have a year or two of experience at my current job."
2479,$30000 is implied
2480,"Honestly I feel the degrees are just a bureaucratic thing in some organizations/companies. For example I’ve done library work for years and already practically did what a librarian done but I needed my masters in library science to actually be considered a librarian and get that pay boost. 

In your case whatever you do it’s all about that transferable experience and trying to sell yourself. You may have worked at xyz place whatever but find the similarities at where you wanna be.... and hit the keywords mainly. And even if you decide to do trade school instead etc depending on the organization having the higher degree might just be what gets you up in the career ladder at the end..... hope this helps"
2481,"I do too, even though I'm always told to be proud of it. It's really not an accomplishment. Not to me.

Just no passion like that to fall back on.

We need a better system than this."
2482,"Honestly, I’m the same way. Graduated with a Business Admin Management and been working at a retail job since. But I got to be in theater, get lead roles, improve so many things, had so many opportunities and while the grass was always greener, I picked the choice that I thought was right and I came out a different human being.

Instead of wasting time and energy in regret and what could have been, the fact you graduated AND learned what you want to do now, is miles miles above. Don’t put yourself down for wasted time. College may seem like a waste, but always try to look on the positives and bright sides. 

It’s okay man. We’re all in this same boat, but we’ll get through it."
2483,"Damn dude. I got a degree in New Media. 

I've always wanted to paint cars.

2485,he never said he was in debt though.
2486,Do you like it?
2487,Way to not cave to the pressure & make YOUR decision on YOUR timing! 💙
2488,"This was awesomely cathartic. It took me a year and a summer to find my first job. It’s contract work and I have no benefits. I now work a second job that (surprise) is also contract work and pays even less than the first, but it rounds out my hours. I’m dreading starting the application process again, but I need a salary and benefits."
2489,"That guy literally said what has been swirling around in my head for months during my job search. It’s soul crushing, but it’s nice to know I’m not alone."
2490,"Here's the thing about applying to jobs, and it's certainly frustrating, but you could certainly find reason for hope in one small statement.

""All it takes is one""

One clandestine opportunity, one connection, one stupid job fair, one pompous networking event. 

All of these things match real jobs to real people, and they do work (just not all the time) and they can be good jobs. 

The business school parlance is nauseating, but they aren't steering you in the wrong direction. What else are they going to say? There's no secret... maximize at-bats, that's it. Put yourself in a room with people who might give a damn about what you have to say, and eventually the 1 in 200 will be you."
2491,Nothing works great. All it takes is one clever hiring agent to think of a question no one has asked (or at least phrased) before.
2492,This is amazing
2493,"Wow. I feel personally attacked by this relatable content.

What I really hate is how companies will string you on for fucking ever.

I think the worst experience I’ve had with this was for a big company that had an insanely great position open. I would’ve basically been stupid to not apply. 

It all started when I applied for a position with another company or something, I can’t really remember, but the guy referred me to another guy at another company. Well, I waited nearly a month, and had almost forgotten about the position all together, when I got an email about how so-and-so recommended me blah blah blah. So we set-up a phone interview for the next week. The day came, did the interview. I got an email the next day about how great it was, whatever. Well, they wanted ANOTHER phone interview the NEXT WEEK.

Ok. I do that as well. It goes great, same things. THEN. FINALLY! A REAL IN PERSON INTERVIEW FOR THE NEXT WEEK!

I go, duh. Talk to the guy I’ve been emailing and whatnot. Well, guess what? The person who is over the position is unavailable so we set up ANOTHER INTERVIEW FOR THE NEXT WEEK TO MEET WITH HER!

Ok. I go to it as well. And, long story short, I wasted over a MONTH for them to say, “It was down to you and someone else and we went with the other sucker bc they had one skill more than you.”

Jeezus H. Fucking-Christ.com what a joke of a waster of time!"
2494,Pro tip: I read another persons post that said if you're applying to jobs online have two resumes ready. One resume that has **ZERO** formatting with all the normal important info at the top few lines. This way the program easily can recognize words. Next have a fancy resume you can upload separately in place of the zero formatting resume.
2495,Fuckwaffle - my word of the day!
2496,"A few years ago I was post-college job hunting for writing jobs, and a company in SoCal was super cagey about pay/benefits. 

But I’d had enough, and at the end of a third phone interview I just bluntly asked “are you the best person for me to talk to right now about pay?”

The reason they were so cagey?
It was a full-time internship where you could work for 2 years for free before being considered for hiring, pay was minimum wage if you did get hired, and because of some loophole there was no benefits.

I kindly told them to fuck right off. All that contract work and internship shit can get the fuck up out of my face.

I haaaaaaaaaated job hunting."
2497,This is why I damn near cried when I got a phone call saying I have an offer
2498,"I think this post is basically pointing out what an infuriating hassle the application process is. It takes so much time and manpower to submit one job application. It’s genuinely infuriating when they ask you to upload a resume, then ask you to manually enter all the information *thats already on your resume*. It wouldn’t be so bad if the rule was just “submit a 2-page resume with all this information on it on a Word/ PDF + a cover letter”. The latter to me should be the biggest hassle, but even then all I should be doing is changing the company information in each cover letter and tweaking it to highlight my skills that are good for the job. Customer service? I’ll highlight how I worked at a call center for over a year and how I’m bilingual. Something more science-y? I’ll highlight how I worked as a field tech for a semester and my undergrad research project. 

I was looking for jobs for an entire month with radio silence. Then an opportunity for a company within my field, but that has the possibility to pay me a wage where I won’t need food stamps, popped up in my town, where I least expected it. I applied knowing it was a long shot, but being an early applicant has its perks, I guess. 

I have an interview in 3 hours. (I should go get ready) Anyone reading this have any tips for dressing for an interview in southern Arizona weather? I know that khakis and a button down are fail-safe, but it’s gonna be 100 degrees by the time of my interview and I was wondering if a dress and laced shoes (not sneakers) were appropriate"
2499,This the realest shit I’ve ever seen. And they didn’t even cover references/ letters of rec.
2500,This has happened to me MULTIPLE times! Multiple interviews week after week and by the end of the month—rejection. It’s like how do they string people along and not give a damn about it smh it’s so messed up
2501,"Some websites have tried a version of this, like Indeed allows job seekers to apply using their standard profile if the company allows it, which saves time. Honestly though I think maybe 1% of companies actually want the process to be seamless and most actively try to make it more difficult. I don’t mean that they want it to be soul crushing for potential applicants, but just that they want some way to make it easier on themselves.

On LinkedIn they give estimates of how many applicants have already submitted, and often that number is 200+. Think about having to find one person out of 200+ who have all jumped through their hoops and played their stupid little games. Now imagine if everyone had a Job ID and could just cast a wide net to jobs they barely qualify for without thought and that number was 500+. I think if a form filling app existed it would have to be aftermarket and it would be actively fought by job sites, to be honest. 

I don’t know what the solution is, but from everything I’ve seen in my own process it’s terrible for both employers and applicants."
2502,"**FUCK THIS GUY**

I lined up a job in November of my senior year because I did everything that this person isn't willing to do. I graduated with a BS in ME in 2013 from Virginia Tech (a very good school/program, but by no means Ivy league) with a mediocre 2.7 GPA. I hated engineering, so I worked super hard (probably about 10-20 hours/week, more time and effort than I put into any class) at applying, interviewing, and networking to get a job completely unrelated to my major. And it paid off.

>You  apply to the same jobs all over the city, most of them online, because let's be honest, who in the fuck has the time to scour the city or ""network"" at job clubs or career fairs or other social ""business professional"" events where you have to pay money to get in or buy food/drink when you've got to pay rent, front money for bills and insurance so you aren't fucked if you get into a car accident or end up sick, and gas isn't cheap, and who in the fuck actually wants to show up to a ""career club,"" at 8 o clock in the fucking morning to listen to some Gen X New Age type talk about people energy or networking?

First of all, who the fuck taught this guy how to network? Has he heard of the internet, or LinkedIn or cell phones? You don't need to fly 500 miles to attend a career fair; almost anyone you want to talk to will be on LinkedIn.

I use LinkedIn to search for Virginia Tech Alumni who have jobs/are at companies that I'm interested in. Then I send them a LinkedIn message saying ""Hi, my name is /u/vtfan08, I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2013. I was researching company X and came across your profile - I'd love to take 20 minutes of your time to learn more about your role, and ask for some career advice. Do you have any availability in the next two weeks?""

You'll noticed that I started by establishing that I'm also a VT alum - If possible, you want to start with something you have in common with that person - you share an alma mater, you both volunteer somewhere, you're both avid fans of some sport, etc. Once you establish some common ground, you ask for a quick meeting to ask that person about *their experience*. Doing this search and sending this message to about 10 people takes at most 30 minutes, and requires no spending on gas, airfare, or hotel. I probably get a response from about 50% of the people I message. About half of those actually get on the phone with me.

Once I get on the phone with someone, have three insightful questions lined up for them, for example:

* ""I saw on your LinkedIn page that you went from manufacturing to be a product manager at Facebook. That's quite a transition, can you tell me about how you made the switch, and what skills helped you be successful?""
* ""From reading your company's quarterly earning report, I know that you get a lot of revenue from European Markets; I'm curious to hear how you're dealing with the new GDRP laws""

You'd be surprised how many people love talking about their jobs. Three questions like this, with a few follow up questions should easily take up 15 minutes. Then you can ask something that hints are your actual goal, such as:

* ""So I'm a college graduate, really interested in working at Company X or in Industry Y. If you were in my shoes, what would you do to break in to this company/role/industry?""
* ""Thanks for your time today, it was great to hear your thoughts on topics X, Y and Z. Given my interests, is there anyone else you think I should chat with?""

These two questions will often give you some really useful and applicable advice, a warm intro to someone with decision making power, or (best case) an offer to refer you for a role.

>And career fairs? Ha! Good luck.

I wouldn't go to a random career fair, but school sponsored ones are pretty good. My former employer hired about 100 new college graduates each year, that we sourced from about 5-8 different state schools. We typically have about 20-40 interview slots at each school, and from there we narrow down to about 150 total candidates, 75-100 of which would accept an offer from us.

I know what you're going to say next - ""Every company wants work experience, and I don't have any because it's impossible to get you're first job"" - Here's two ways to addressed this:

* Get a job during a time when there's less competition - Everyone wants a summer internship, but if you're willing to take the fall/spring semester off and get an internship/co-op, you'll face significantly less competition. I wasn't able to get a summer internship because I had no experience and bad grades. But in the spring, company's still need help from interns, but didn't have as many choices. Well, I had bad grades and no work experience, but I interviewed well, so the company settled for me.
* Compare your current experience to the job - When  I was working in software consulting, we met one kid from the University of Tennessee who's only work experience was being a high school football coach. But he did his research on our company, and knew that one the key parts of our job was troubleshooting software issues. He told us about how when he coached football, he used software to cut and edit video for recruits, and was able to relate this back to what we did. **WE GAVE HIM AN INTERVIEW BECAUSE HE DID HIS FUCKING RESEARCH AND WAS ABLE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD THE SKILLS WE WERE LOOKING FOR!**

If you're still not doing well at career fairs put on by your university, it's probably a you problem, and you probably need to put in the effort to sharpen up on these skills. Conversation/networking skills can be practiced, your university's career services department should be able to help you practice this. I spent at least an hour a week in VT's career services building each week until I got a job getting resume advice, doing career fair practice, and interview practice.

>So you go online and you start applying to jobs.

WRONG! Don't bother applying to a job online unless your resume is an EXACT match for the position and you absolutely can't network with anyone at the company. [WSJ estimates that 7/10 jobs are filled based on networking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-job-advice-you-wish-you-knew-how-to-give-11557135000), so it doesn't make sense to blindly apply.

>And if you want to even try to stand out, you have to write some dumb ass cover letter. And it can't be some cookie cutter bullshit. No. It HAS to be special, and it HAS to be original with some ""research"" that shows how ""interested"" you apparently are in this company, because apparently we should be dreaming night and day about working for your company, and following your Twitter handles and your Facebook feeds and your LinkedIn page, because the only way anybody would want to hire you is if you aligned with the mission statement (another worthless modernist business practice, the mission of all modern businesses is to generate income, not whatever idealist dribble they post on their website for PR reasons) of the company

Fuck this guy. You want me to hire you, but you're not willing to put in the time to even research my company? You know what that tells me? You're fucking lazy, and you're not going to put in effort when you're actually on the job. I spend hours each week in coffee chats talking to random people who ask about my career, taking skype calls, answering questions for random people who send me PMs on reddit, forwarding resumes to friends and introducing people on LinkedIn, and I don't mind doing it; in fact, I enjoy it because I know that in the past I was that guy, and in the future I will 100% be that guy again. But if you aren't willing to take the 30 minutes to google my company and read the three most recent articles, check my bio to see how I got to where I am, and think of three mildly interesting questions to ask me, then you can go fuck yourself, I'll give my time (and job referrals) to people who are actually willing to fucking hustle."
2503,"Yeah I was thinking that like how do I take in information without it turning out wrong (keywords, phrases, etc.) In the post the dude was talking about companies using similar online forms so I thought that maybe there is a way to have a sort of job ID that you can send to these websites."
2504,"Honestly I completely agree with the post. I just wish it wasn’t so absurdly negative. I wish he had talked about how people do get jobs, also I would be curious what the percentage of people who enjoy their jobs in just 1st world countries is. I would guess it’s significantly higher. Giving people no hope for finding something they enjoy is needlessly reductive and discouraging in my opinion.

Get out there. Meet people. Do some volunteering. Talk to some friends. Join some Facebook groups. Reach out to recruiters. And don’t bother applying for any job traditionally unless you know that you will be the most qualified candidate applying. Or if you’re just a masochist"

2511,"OP wasn’t just aimless, he literally said he wasn’t willing to put in the work to research every company he applied to. 

Put yourself in the shoes of someone hiring people. You have to take 4 hours out of your day to talk to candidates at a career fair, in addition to all you’re existing work. One of them comes in and doesn’t even know what your company does? I don’t care how good your resume is, I’m not hiring you. It’s not just dumb, it’s rude; you’re wasting my time."

2531,"I'm of South Asian origin. The way our society is built is that most kids have only 2  options for their career - Doctor or Engineer. 1.5 million Engineers get out of Engineering colleges in India every single year and the vast majority of them do not have the skills necessary to obtain jobs in that industry. ""Become an engineer and then do whatever you want"" is how my dad put it when I was about to graduate high school. 

&#x200B;

Even the ones who do get jobs aren't passionate about engineering and so they work for a while, and then start exploring other things that they actually care about on the side. For example, my friend become a wildlife photographer after working a job he didn't like for close to 5 years just to please his parents. One of my other friends got into music after becoming an engineer while another stopped engineering and went into sales. You get the idea. It's not necessary to know what you want to do when you are 18 because we have the time and opportunity to explore options outside of our ""career"" and get into it.   


I'm an engineer too and although I like engineering and job a lot, I do not want to stay in this industry for a long time but I still don't really know what I want to do. We have a long time to go and explore our interests. I don't believe you have to give up on your dreams if you don't do it right after college. After starting my first job out of college recently, I've just got into that comfortable place where I don't have to worry about feeding myself and now I have time to think about the rest of my life and what I would enjoy doing.   


You got this, my dude! Some know what they want to do early on, the majority of us don't."

2533,"I’m 23 in a month and just realized wood working is a passion that I can potentially make money with. So I quit my shitty retail job and now work in manufacturing (granted with metal not wood) to start to save up to buy tools and wood to start experimenting. I’m also looking at workshops and stuff to learn more than what I remember from middle school shop so I can start making things that I would be happy with. So yeah, I get it. Just work hard and don’t worry too much about other people."
2534,Take online classes. Talk with people in the industry. Do your homework and research. You are not a victim of your past or your circumstances. Be goal oriented and not constraint oriented. You got this!
2535,I worked in a restaurant all throughout college and got a degree in psychology. Thought I was going to get into social work or continue my education for my masters. Wound up just working for a few years after college and realized I’m much better at working in a restaurant than anything else. Started managing last October and am going back to school for a cooking certificate at my local community college this September :)
2536,"I'm 28 with a bachelor's in political science. For most of my time in undergrad, I wanted to go into immigration law, but after a few pre law classes and talking to various lawyers, I decided against that. By that point, I was only about a year from graduating, so I figured I'd stick it out and decide what to do later. Because a poli sci degree can't get you much of anywhere, I decided (unwisely) to go to grad school. After a few internships, I realized that I hated the type of work that I was doing and that I am more inclined towards technical/analytical roles. So starting in September, I am going back for a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

So yeah, I definitely feel like a late bloomer as well. It's super discouraging seeing all these 22 year old kids getting jobs that I will hopefully be able to get when I am 30, but it is what it is."
2537,"Y'know, this actually makes me a lot more confident about only finding out what I'm passionate about and getting *another* masters degree at age 26. Thanks!"

2539,"I’m 25 and discovering that I might want to completely change direction and get a PHD in a STEM field as a life-long liberal arts person. This will massively increase the amount of time I’m in school and I’m afraid I’m too late, since PHD programs take so long to get through."

People tend to rush into college and choose a program they don’t like, then regretting it later. I believe the best thing to do is wait until your 100 percent sure you know what you want to do, and that you will love what you do when you make that choice!"

2543,Thats great
2544,"I’m the same, spent 5 years in uni and got a degree only to feel like I wasted 5 years pursuing an area I’m not interested in. It didn’t hit me til after though cause I was just in a tunnel vision of finishing an undergrad no matter what. But, I should’ve gone to what I wanted/was more interested in regardless if its difficult for me. Its comforting to see that there’s others going through the same though"
2545,"100% isn’t going to happen unless you’re a statistical anomaly. Waiting a bit to let yourself settle before picking something is reasonable, and smart, but at some point you do have to jump."
2546,"I often ask myself what I would say to anyone who was in the position I was in back in college; which was... ""I have no idea what I even want to do when I graduate,"" ""I'm not as good as my peers who are all getting jobs straight out of college,"" and ""it seems there's only one path to take in this career field and I'm definitely not on it."" 


What I have to say to that now is ""look, there isn't just one path for ANY career. There are plenty of scenic routes which will take you exactly where you want to go. You may even end up somewhere you didn't even know was an option but turns out to be everything you'd ever wanted.""


I was a year and a half out of college when I found my first job that was what I actually wanted to do. Now that I'm 5 years out of college I'm taking a completely different path that I didn't even know existed. Yes, it can be a little awkward to have people younger than you working right beside you (or above you) but that shouldn't stop you from doing what you want to do."

2559,"Just got my associates in Design and Media production to do animation. I got this after dropping out for a couple years because I was just sick of school. I enjoyed getting this degree and I hope it’s going to pay off. I got an internship that wrapped up at the end of May and I’ve been unemployed for the last month. I feel comfortable with the software I’ve learned, but I’m trying to be a better artist before I can really feel qualified. Unfortunately animation internships aren’t super easy to come by in Atlanta area, especially competing with SCAD students."
2560,I got a degree in stats and i really like doodling. Don't know where it would take me but I like it.
2561,"Yeah I have struggled over losing touch with friends I had in 2001 to 2005. Around 2003 my social life really took off. I was hanging out with friends who lived in a college town. I kept that going into early 2006. People moved away. Poof, they were gone. Making new friends can be incredibly hard. I have moved on from just about all of the people I called friends in high school. One of my best friends out stayed his welcome and started to mistreat me. I found the relationship toxic. I rarely speak to him. I really miss the friends I had in college though. I think about them often. Some of them I cherish. I wish I could be back to hanging out with them. Nothing is perfect but it sure was fun."
2562,"I feel this pretty often (though less so as i get older - i’m in my late 20’s).  That feeling of distance can really get depressing, and used to lead me down a darker hole where i would fail to see the point in keeping any connections alive.

It is true that without cultivation and active nurturing relationships wither away.  This isn’t something you can change.  And the fact that it makes you genuinely sad isn’t something you can change either.

But what we learn as we grow older is how we respond to these feelings.  When you start feeling this way (trust me this will keep happening) - the first step is to recognize that you feel this way.  Then, realize you can do something to change that.

My go-to in these moments is to do one of (call someone you haven’t talked to in a while, watch/listen to happy moments in my video/audio collection with my family, go for a walk for some fresh air).  Since the other 2 are possibly only effective for me, i’ll recommend calling someone.  Calling is better than texting since it is more personal.  And just talk.  Sometimes the conversations are not great, but sometimes they are.  If you open yourself up, a lot of other people should respond in kind.  If they don’t, try not to be upset with them right away - realize they could be busy or have something going on too.  However, if they continually do not respond positively to your attempt at connection then you should find better friends or talk to someone more mature.  Parents or relatives generally (though not always) have been through this a lot themselves so they will be happy to speak to you.

It’s ok to be vulnerable.  In fact, these moments are great opportunities for you to find amazing friends around you.  Friends who recognize when you need a pick-me-up and give it to you are the keepers.  And of course you do the same when they need it.

Hope i’m making some sense + hope this helps!!

P.S. society stigmatizes negative emotions, but they are often precursors to some deeper level of introspection and if possible you should use it to learn how to be alone and be by yourself.  Allow yourself to be lonely and it will help you become mentally healthier in the long run!"
2563,"You can remain friends with people beyond moving and fading- but it takes work, and if you want that you’re gonna have to accept you’ll probably put more work in than they do. I’m friends with childhood friends still, but I’ve had to go out of my way to set up FaceTime game nights, visits, care packages, etc. (that’s for my closest friends of course). Others that I want to stay in touch with, but not as much work, I’ll host a party twice a year, usually once in the summer and once around the holidays, to catch up. Then I’ll give those people a phone call individually once or twice a year. It’s effort. It’s a lot of effort. But if you want them in your life still it’s worth it. Reach out to them, they’ll probably love to catch up with you."
2564,"> reduced to instagram followers that occasionally comment on my stories

For me, they're reduced to distant memories, occasionally with a social media connection, but not necessarily."
2565,"This is something extremely sad that I honestly was never warned about nor prepared for. I actually cried real tears when a good friend of mine a year older than me graduated. He moved far away and likely I won’t be seeing him much in the future. We still keep in contact occasionally but like anything else it will eventually fade away. Very sad. 

People say just make new friends but you can’t replace people. The only thing I could say is appreciate the time while you have it because before you know it it’s over. It almost feels like he’s dead."
2566,"I know how it feels man as I grew older i noticed my circle of friends becomes smaller. I lost the connection with my highschool friends and some of my college friends as soon as i graduated. The only friends i got right now are the people i met when i was still in 1st year college which i considered my best friends because we still update each other about what's happening in our daily life even if we are busy on our own careers.

2568,I’ve had the same friends forever doubt it will change
2569,It's  just how life is. It was very frustrating for me at first. At one point I stopped caring about getting close to people because I knew I was never gonna see them again. Talking to random people on the fly was the norm and I absolutely hated it. I was like can talking to random strangers in public stop?  I just wanted a set group of friends but it's so hard once you're an adult. People's time is more limited and valuable so they aren't gonna be easy to get a hold of unless you have something to offer. I learned that you really have to put in effort if you want to stay in touch with people  and most of the time I don't care enough.
2570,This song is a pretty somber look at exactly what you’re describing. [Minor Threat - Look Back and Laugh](https://youtu.be/boRw7_ORR_Q)
2571,I moved away from my hometown to got move out from my parents and go to university. I am not that far away. So When I can I will visit my parents for a couple days or weeks and then meet up with my friends from there. I also mostly stay in touch by playing videogames with some of my friends and speaking daily over our discord. I couldn't imagine how lonely I would be without discord.
2572,"Yes, but life is supposed to be about meeting new friends that align with you in whatever aspect of life you are currently living right now. 

However, I think the fleeting friendships problem is particularly hard:

a) after graduation because it’s the first time we transition from having school as a current shared life experience to relate to others on

b) a nightmare, social isolating pandemic that at least for me has cut the head off any friend making potential I’ve had."
2573,"Find the real ones and keep them close, there are usually only one or two."
2574,I struggled with losing touch at first but I managed to reignite distant friendships through late night group calls. The most heartbreaking thing tbh is having friends for a long time until their true colors show and you find out that they’re a POS whether it’s from screwing you over or them just genuinely being a human shit stain.
2575,"It is sad, but I’ve gotten used to it at this point. Leaving secondary school was a big shock to me at first but then I got used to the feeling after high school/college. People come and go, but it’s all about quality, not quantity.

Just kinda sucks for me that unless you post on socials you’re basically invisible to people these days. Even if you have their number. I’m back on social now though.

Like the others said you gotta put in work when you can to keep those friendships alive. I should probably take that advice on board too."

2586,I didn't even pay for my degree and I still don't think it was worth getting
2587,"It’s generally hourly unless you enter into management positions which is a good possibility if you stick with a company. 

Currently most shops operate under a union unless you are doing contract work for Air force/Navy. So all vacation is thrown in there. (Really don’t know enough about this though) Most of not all will offer medical if under the union. I have a fair amount of friends that have retired recently maintaining their benefits and have a healthy 401.

Job security, uh have you seen how complicated most aircraft are? They are always going to be breaking and requiring maintenance. Most companies hold onto their technicians. Want job security? Work on a eurocopter plenty of work for Rotorcraft in general.

I don’t know a specific cap, but I’ve seen people easily reach 150k"
2588,"I agree with you, it’s one of the bummers I considered. Pay cap is very real with trades. For me, I know how to be happy with very little so it doesn’t get to me all that much as long as it’s a comfortable earning. Certainly not right for everyone tho. I’d hope people choose what they are best at and can enjoy. I know a good handful of students in my classes that were just not cut out for it. Always good to shed some light on those lesser known paths though!"
2589,These are questions that would vary greatly over the trades and even inside a trade (different locations). So it’s kinda redundant to get these numbers just to find out they’re better/worse where you are.
2590,"Don’t forget pilots. After their certifications, they be making nearly six figures. Of course it takes lot of flight hours and several certifications because you are flying a plane."
2591,"I’m not currently employed as of yet. Still weighing my choices. From what I’ve heard, airlines will fly you places. Smaller shops will either fly you or send you on a road trip. Commercial airlines you gain the benefit of free flights."

2596,"Can you speak to total compensation package beyond 60k base?

>Is this salaried/hourly.  w2 or 1099?

Almost always hourly with a w2 until you start your own business or get a more leadership position

>Vacation/time off policies


Depends on the company. If there’s a union, you usually get a good amount. If it’s a small business then probably not much or non.



>How is job security in your field?  How long will people generally stay at one employer?


A lot of people will stay with a company for decades, for better or worse. The average age for a welder is like 56 so the need for workers I really high, so jobs are mostly secure. If you go union, it’s almost impossible to be fired or go without work.



>When people do leave is it on their own volition or laid off more frequently?


Often depend on the business or the demand in the region/industry itself. Like I said there’s a lot of people who stay at 1 company for 20 years plus. But sometimes there are lay-offs if there isn’t enough work to do.  Again, unions help this.


>Is this unionized? (particularly germane question for trades)  Either way do you view it as a pro/con for you?


It can be, either within a company itself or 3rd party unions. Some states require it and some don’t. It’s usually a pro for the workers but the wage has a lower cap sometimes. 


>Medical/dental benefits? 
⁠

Unions and big companies, yes. Small businesses, probably not.


>Retirement plan offerings such as 401k?
⁠

Same as above


>What does earning potential generally cap at for a tenured long career?


Depends on specialty and skill. Can be as high as 300k for stuff like underwater welder or something intense like that. Can be as low as 40k for a small business production welder."
2597,I know plenty of classmates who did! Got tired of office work and wanted to mix it up. Always good to keep an open mind and try things out. Plus you can’t beat sweet flight benefits.
2598,"Not an A&P but I’m a new grad in Aero Engineering and I’ve worked with A&Ps and seen them do their thing. I may be able to give some limited insight. I worked at a small aircraft modification company that had maybe half a dozen licensed A&Ps on staff with another dozen maintenance personnel that were working to pursue their full license (requires school and/or on the job training through work experience). Many large community colleges in the US at least offer A&P courses.

They worked nearly around the clock in shifts, with the more junior personnel getting the less desirable shifts. Worked hourly and non union, seemed normal for such a small company. Our salaried senior maintenance personnel that had high up managerial roles with almost no regular hands on work had started as maintainers at other companies or worked their way up, so there definitely is room for advancement. 

As far as other trade work is concerned, aviation maintenance commonly occurs in a (mostly) climate controlled hangar, so that’s a big plus when comparing it to other trades. Lastly, airplanes are only going to get more complex with more complex failures and things to fix, especially within any avionics, powerplant, or composites related specialization so I’d personally say the future outlook is good as long as you’re willing to move to where the work is."

I now have much more direction and am really enjoying my classes so far. I’m always baffled by how many kids I hear wanting to study finance, economics and investments but have absolutely no clue how to save and balance their own accounts. I would think of myself as a hypocrite if my job is telling everyone else what to do with their money while I can’t figure out how to manage my own. Your job sounds very interesting. I love the analyst side of money and finding patterns and/or ways firms can save or cut back costs. Thanks for the good read!"
2601,Knowledge is invaluable. As long as you took interest in what you learned theres personal value in that. I plan on going back to college to just learn about things I find interesting.
2602,"Putting qualifiers on a response for a geographic region or what ever other constraints don't make the questions useless. If anything more valuable insights.   Base pay alone for any career is going to vary based on area, but people still talk about it.  If anything I'd say that's the one data point that would have the most variance"

2604,Got my A&P out of high school and it didn’t cost me a dime! Well except to go take my writtens. Had an interview with an airline last week and they shot me down pretty hard for lack of experience so that stinks. Gotta keep looking around I guess.
2605,Reedly college as in the Fresno area?
2606,"From my experience, people have always complained about their job. Even in college, working a service industry job flipping burgers, my coworkers complained. The complaints were usually just centered around the ""missed opportunity"" of work taking their time away from going to the bars or a concert or something. I felt that from time to time, too. That type of complaint is unavoidable but transient.

From my perspective, though, full-time work after graduation elicits different complaints and feelings of discontent. I believe people's hatred of their job is rooted much deeper than ""missed opportunity.""

What I've seen, work rarely ever satisfies people's *intellectual* needs. Sure, companies may satisfy a lot of *quality-of-life* needs (benefits, compensation, office perks, etc.), but rarely does the work itself address the *intellectual* needs of employees. Most importantly, this need is to satisfy one's *curiosity*, one's need to answer questions that they want answered. This is especially difficult to grapple with right out of college where intellectual curiosity is regularly encouraged not only through classes but also through independent research, study groups, extracurricular activities, clubs/groups/organizations, and more. So going into full-time work and suddenly having responsibilities and *only* those responsibilities is a little difficult. It could be said that certain industries, namely tech, encourages self-development and intellectual curiosity through company-sponsored further education programs, but that isn't always necessarily in-line with one's curiosity.

Also what I've seen, people rarely are in a job that satisfies their *purpose*. This is true for almost everyone, in every age, in every industry. It's a difficult hurdle that raises a whole bunch of existential questions:

* *Is this how I'm going to spend my 20's, wasting my youth away at a desk?*
* *Is this what my life will amount to?*
* *Will I be proud of this in 10 or even 20 years?*
* *Where is my life heading to?*

but also structural/societal questions:

* *Is the personal/mental/economic toll worth it just making money for the boss?*
* *Is making a lot of money really what's most important in life?*
* *Is the company I am working for ethical to the community/environment/etc.*

This, I think, is the big reason people start to hate their job. The loss of autonomy, the need to tie your financial health to an organization, the need to confront big life questions that can't just be solved overnight. So when someone is complaining about their job, they may point to general stressors (clients complaining, heat from their boss, disorganization within the company, etc.), but I believe that's just a symptom of the larger, overarching existential anxiety.

As others have said, people who have left their job to start their own business seem to be much happier, I assume because they have control over the direction of their life and can satisfy their intellectual needs by doing exactly what they want. To be honest, I feel like there are a lot of stresses with that that you might not see, and it's very difficult to do *well* at it.

I know this has been a sort of downer comment, so I'll end on a positive not. What I find so great about life after college is you can go literally *anywhere*. Want to travel internationally? Go teach English in China for a year. Want to change professions? Start applying to different positions. Want to start working with your hands? Find a welding apprenticeship or get into glassblowing. Want to work outdoors? Look for a job with a national park. Sick of the work grind? Start saving up for a van and and plan to live a nomadic lifestyle for a 6 months at the end of next year. None of these options will be easy; almost nothing in your life will be. But knowing that takes half the stress away. Existential philosophy posits that we are in a constant state of becoming, and that means that you can become anything you want. For me, becoming as interesting as possible is important. I want to find myself in a nursing home, talking about the time I moved across the country for a year, the time I lived in a van for a year, or the time I joined a cult (I know it would probably be a bad thing, but I think it would be a good story). Of course there's the pressure of student loans, taxes, expenses, but why worry about those? Everyone's in debt (almost), so why worry about it? Pay it off to the best of your abilities, but your youth, your life, and who you are are much more important, in my eyes. Maybe that's irresponsible to say, but when you find yourself at the end of your life, what will you have to show for it? You paid your student loans off in your early 30s as opposed to your early 40s? It won't matter, but what you did with your life, who you became, the experiences you can share with your grandkids will matter."

2613,"Definitely not true.  I don’t know who could’ve come up with 20 hrs/week of work but it likely assumes that the only real work is killing, processing, and cooking animals/other foods.  

What about all of the preparation involved in doing so?  Scouting out land, creating all of your own equipment, stalking animals, organizing hunts, etc. etc.

Bottom line, with the small, nomadic structure of hunter-gatherer life, one spent almost all of their waking hours furnishing all of the goods and services that we simply pay for in the modern day.

2616,"Currently live in Asia and a lot of my expat coworkers are trying to find jobs working for American companies or are thinking about returning to the west because the working conditions are garbage and the pay sucks. I had a coworker work 50 hours of overtime in one month and receive about $50 USD in overtime compensation. So basically she was working all that overtime for $1/hour. Before taxes of course. They were shocked when I told them that my old job in the states paid 1.5x base pay for overtime. I work a 9-5, but most of my coworkers work either 8-5 or 9-6. It’s not so common in my workplace, but for a lot of jobs here you’re required to go out drinking with your coworkers and your boss after work some nights. It’s not a written rule, but if you don’t go, people will look down on you for it. So basically work consumes your life and you’re left with not a lot of free time to spend with your friends and family lol, and the pay isn’t even very good so it’s not worth it."

2630,"I just finished college and my first job is fantastic. It makes me sad when people end up working jobs they hate... leave. That’s what I do. Unhappy? Leave. So I left the United States and I’m working on an island and couldn’t be happier! It’s possible, friends"
2631,The problem is 99.87% aren't qualified to do the intellectually challenging jobs and end up being *net-negatives* if they let you try.
2632,"That's very true. I graduated with a CS degree and 0 experience from internships. I was under the assumption that I'd be able to find a software engineering job right out of college. How naive, right? I found that I needed constant improvment and learning of new languages/skills/frameworks/etc. in order to be valuable to employers, and I frankly don't have the motivation or energy, I feel (depression and all that).
With that being said, I don't think it's that companies are decidedly against hiring new grads, people with less experience, etc. It may seem that way when you see job listings for an entry-level positions that require, like, 7 years experience, but know that a lot of companies do that just so they can hire cheaper visa workers. It's easier to acquire a work visa when they can say ""we couldn't find anyone qualified enough to fill the position."" It's a ridiculous thing that I've seen, mostly in tech, but it is a thing.
Moreover, companies do like to hire within. The last company I worked for had me doing a very administrative, boring job with no real difficulty involved. It wasn't a bad job by any means, but it wasn't what I really wanted to be doing. The job listing required an Associates degree, and I applied with a Bachelor's. As soon as I started, my manager told me I'd be moved up eventually to a position with more responsibilities, more in-line with what I wanted to do. I left after a year due to other reasons, but even when I left, they tried finding a position for me within the company, because they thought I was valuable. The work I was doing wasn't even difficult. Now that I'm back looking for jobs, I've found a bunch of companies that have advertised their entry level positions as ""transitionary"" in which you'd work on the team and move on to higher positions after a year or two. You may be thinking ""That sucks. I'll have to work in a job I don't want for awhile just to get to the position I want."" I think there's this idea that people find their dream job right out of school, but that's really not the case for most. A lot of people switch industries once they get out of college, because they find they don't like the jobs they majored in in school. Plus, not having experience or the skills for the job you may want (in my case, software engineer) are difficult, though not impossible, to acquire on your own. But there isn't a schedule or time table to your life, so the way I see it, I'm still progressing towards my goal taking a position that promises growth.
Lastly, if you feel you can't find a job due to lack of experience, consider other options to make yourself appear more valuable. For example, I ""volunteered"" as a software developer for a small non-profit. As shitty as it sounds, I did nothing at all. I was brought on, did a few small things (ran scripts, helped out with a couple of small changes, attended meetings), but I did nothing. I left after a couple of months, because I also just started a full-time position, but I have that on my resume now. So volunteering is a great way to get experience. Also, maybe consider jobs that you didn't necessarily go to school for, but think you might enjoy. You may find you like it. For example, I saw a couple of really cool job listings for ""Investigator"" with my state's liquor and control board. That sounded VERY interesting. Imagine telling someone at a bar you're an investigator for the state? I didn't take it, though, cuz I don't want to be a professional narc, but there are a lot of interesting jobs out there if you're willing to give it a go."

2639,"You're absolutely right man what you're doing isn't a problem. The problem is that you're worried about the perspectives of other people and second guessing yourself when you really know what's best for yourself. Living in your parent's basement isn't an exciting move but it really does make the most economic sense. On another note, I thought I should let you know it's ""full fledged."""

There are a hundred reasons people stay back, get married young, pull out a mortgage, and continue to be low-income earners, and trust me, being small-brained doesn’t have much to do with it more so than not.

Humility goes a long way in life, dude. We’re in an era where elitism is the worst PR. Be kind."
2644,"Oh my God I'm an idiot, I mixed up fleshed out and fully fledged. Haha. But yes, thank you! I know I'm doing the right thing. It's just a giant change of pace.

I can fix up shit around the house this weekend. It can wait."

Whatever you do appreciate the fact that your parents let you live with them!"
2651,"To play devil’s advocate, I can understand what OP’s feeling (especially if they're _actually_ being harassed by family/friends), but the phrasing could certainly have been better.

I grew up in small town Iowa, but decided to pursue college and ended up moving to the west coast for work. My brother-in-law never went to college, and is assistant manager at a pizza place. He just bought a five bedroom, three story house with a huge backyard.

I make low six figures, my wife makes $60k, and we live in a shitty duplex.

Part of the reason I don’t get bitter is that I tell myself that we have different priorities. He’s focused on building a family, and I’m focused on building my career.

I really wish I could be in your situation. You’re doing it the right way imo. Not a loser at all"
2664,What saved cash * laughs in stupid expensive audio equipment and camera gear*

2666,"10/wk is light, especially if you're not currently busy with other work. You should crank that up to at least 10/day. When I was applying, I'd get up early and spend the first hour or two of my day searching/applying for work. After a while it becomes routine. Cast a wider net and you'll have a better chance of getting something"
2667,"Agreed. Short of having a parent strong arm you into a position there’s nothing you can do. I have gotten referrals but that’s usually it. You still have to get interviewed through the process 

I’ve only seen this happen when a higher up demands their child get hired which unfortunately happens all too often"
2668,Word of mouth doesn’t mean they got hired because they know somebody. It means they heard about the opportunity from somebody rather than say finding it on LinkedIn or a jobs website. There’s a world of difference.
2669,Would you recommend that book to someone in a non-business field?
2670,"I made 0 friends in college, kinda depressing cuz I am such a social guy.  Literally 0 friends, wich has to be some kind of fucking world record. Anyhow, I just graduated in August and I’ve been trying to get into video games. I moved all the way across the country and have no connections but I’ve been putting in the work to send out so many applications that I can’t remember half of them. I’ve had 9 interviews all leading to second rounds and 2 of them were this week. Im waiting for a yes or no from 3 jobs and I’m finally feeling super confident I’ll get one of the three just because of how well the interviews went. Anyway, if you just are sending a dozen applications it might seem a bit more difficult. You gotta bump those numbers way up. The volume of applications seriously matter when you have no connections. I sent out well over 100. Sounds crazy I know but it seems to be working in my favor. Also something odd I noticed is that I’ve had a higher success rate with getting interviews without a cover letter. I know that’s probably not the norm though. But definitely just apply apply apply and the saying I use all the time is hurry up and wait. You’ll get one but you just have to keep pushing."
2671,"Yeah, unless the person doing the referring is like executive level or above, most people cant just ""give"" other people a job at the company they work for. The best most people can do is ensure that human eyeballs look at their friend's resume when they apply and act as an impromptu reference. That's about it. The real value here is just having someone you know give you a heads up that theres an opening at their company."
2672,"Not really true tbh. I have gotten both of my jobs after uni by just applying & hoping for the best. 

Depends on what sector you get into though."
2673,"100% - Regardless of your industry or function, your network will be key. Additionally, the way in which you build your network (through your alumni network, your professional network, your social network, etc, via mediums like LinkedIn, email, phone calls, coffee chats, etc) will be the same."
2674,You apply for jobs and then go to interviews. I've never gotten a job because I knew somebody.
2675,"For those still in College, it's true when people say half of college is classes and the other half is networking. It really is about who you know and the stronger your network, the more doors it'll open professionally.

For OP: I don't think cover letters really matters all that much. It's true that having someone refer you can get you an upper hand but it's also important to have a strong CV. There are still tons of jobs that don't get filled from referrals and you have to be one of the candidates that stand out when applying. If your network isn't that strong right now, make it better. Go to networking events, hit up alums and ask to go out on Coffee and learn about jobs. Don't do it expecting a referral but go into with a genuine interest and build your network from there.


But again, most importantly have your CV reviewed and make sure it's great."
2676,This is bad advise. I've never gotten s job because of who I knew. I applied for the job and then went to the interview.
2677,"Agreed. Number one thing I hate about the workforce by a large margin. You have people lining up with multiple years experience but we gotta hire a kid with a comm degree because of their parent. 

Drives me crazy"
2678,How am I wrong about what had happened to me?
2679,"Nothing happens in a vacuum. If the person ends up being a dud the employee starts losing a lot of face and resentment builds up. It’s definitely a partial factor when people leave if they feel like others are getting special treatment, I’ve seen it happen plenty of times and left my last job partially because my manager was essentially the owners nephew and a piece of shit that would never face any consequences. The best way to voice your resentment is leaving"
2680,Networking events are key.

EDIT: here's [a longer post from another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/dpkdgu/how_to_build_an_impressive_resume/f612slx/):

>I cold reach out to people all the time on LinkedIn, I'd say at least half respond. That said, you do want to be tactical in your outreach - you don't just reach out to people and say ""Hi, I'm planning on applying for a job at Google, I see you work there, would you mind referring me to the role?"" Instead, you want to learn about their career, how they got there, how they're excelling, etc. A message like ""Hi [/u/\_Floydian](https://www.reddit.com/u/_Floydian/), I'm a graduate from school X, interested in Product Management. I found your LinkedIn page while searching for fellow alumni who work in product management at Company Y. I'm really impressed by your work experience, may I have 15 minutes of your time for a phone call or meeting to ask some more in depth questions?"" From there you can meet with this person, ask about their career, and start building a relationship with them, and eventually get a referral (or get introduced to someone else of interest).  
>  
>Anyways, I highly recommend reading [The 2-hour Job Search](https://www.amazon.com/2-Hour-Job-Search-Technology-Faster/dp/1607741709). It's geared towards MBA students, but it really applies for any type of job search. It has example LinkedIn message templates, talks about how frequently to reach out to contacts, how to pick which companies to focus on, etc. It really revolutionized the way I search for jobs."
2683,Ok well then I guess OP is just never going to get a job because he doesn't know anyone.
2684,"For me it was applications after applications until something stuck. I had some interviews that ended up going to someone already in the company or they didn’t hire anyone at all, so a lot of it is luck. The job I’m currently in happened to have someone who went to the same college as me (10 years ago but still) and another who I went to middle school with. Since I interviewed with all of my future coworkers as well, it happened to be a good conversation starter but I’m not sure if it made any difference in their final decision. 

It’s such a frustrating process but hang in there!!"
2685,"To be honest, you don’t. The odds are heavily against you. You’re going to get auto filtered out. You have to know people. It’s nothing about what you know, only who. Once you get in, you can be that branch for other people. A vouch goes a lot longer than a resumè.

Go to your cities local job fair, walk into companies, try and ask for coffee talks on LinkedIn. Gotta expand that network."
2686,It is bad advice though.
2687,I always wait until someone else leaves then write a review slamming the company with just enough hints that it’s probably them in order to deflect suspicion. Also if it’s hot a huge company with lots of data on them you can start reporting vastly undermarket salaries in order to try to mitigate their ability to recruit new people. Plus companies can respond to interview write ups and reviews but can’t respond to salary postings.
2688,"It depends on your major, but I know for IT there are recruiting companies that will push your resume to companies and talk you up. Get to know them. The company pays them, and it is no cost to you. 

Also, make sure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date."
2689,"I’ve been in HR for 16 years now and have been thinking about a way to get this information out to college and post college graduates. I’m currently an HR director with an app most people use for music. Would people find this information valuable? An “insider” overview of employment, how to find it, etc?"
2690,"I'm still trying to answer that question myself. 

I once talked to a local TV executive. He ran a few stations in different cities. I asked him a similar question and he replied with this small story: ""My first job in TV was given to me because my father pulled some strings when he was working there. At the end of the day, I was fired. Why? Because I bragged that my father was the producer, I thought I knew more than anyone else, and I was an ass.  When my father found out, it was hell. No one cares how you got the job or who you know. You have to do the job you were given. If you don't, you will be fired.""

As someone in the same boat as you are, it is hard out there. Most of the advice in this thread is good and I'm going to use some of them as well. 

You can take or leave my advice because it could not work for you. You have time to figure out what best. 

First, try to increase your job output. Meaning, just apply for more jobs. Make a goal for everyday. I apply for at least 5 a day and maybe 3 on Friday to ease into the weekend. Make sure you use something to scan the job description in and see the keywords. 

Second, use LinkedIn Advice. I assume you seen it but it is like AIM or messenger back in the day. You put what advice you want and what you are willing to give. Then start a simple conversation. As someone's go is introverted this is a great tool. (Hint: Always ask about themselves. People love to talk about themselves. )

With the combination of these skills, I get at least a phone interview/interview a month. It shows that I am a viable candidate to HR.

I hope this helps, OP. Remember to breathe. You got this because you got this far. There is no stopping you now."
2691,Yes.
2692,Thank you- I'm in grad school and really need to figure out how to network. I'll pick up a copy of it.
2693,"Go to networking events, be likable, and tell people what you're looking for. Meetup and eventbrite have dozens. Nothing is stopping you from knowing people."
2694,Temp to hire
2695,"Some really bad advice in this thread OP. 

You need to learn the side door approach to  applying for jobs. You can use LinkedIn as a way to broaden your network. First look at the companies that you want to work for and see if they have job postings that interest you. You can use Glassdoor to research the companies. 

Instead of just applying cold you should try to see if you have any connections in your network to that company via LinkedIn. If they’re a second or third connection ask for someone you know to introduce you and/or message them. Your goal is to setup a quick “informational chat” about their company and/or job. Most people are willing to give a little bit of time to help someone out.  Give times you’re available. Make it easy for them to say yes. 

When you meet with them it can be over a call or in person. Be friendly and curious. Tell them about your situation. Ask them about their company and or their job. Ask them what they would do in your situation. Ask them about job leads. But also ask them about themselves. Build a rapport. 

If it goes well you might ask them if they would consider referring you for the role. Companies often have a referral bonus for people making successful referrals. If it goes poorly you can still add them as a contact in your network. Every person you add to your network opens up the number of other connections to your next job lead exponentially!!

No matter what happens thank them for their time and connect with them on LinkedIn. Your Goal is to find a way to separate your application from the rest. Only the absolute best resumes and applications cut through the noise. If you’re starting out this isn’t likely to be the case. You need a side door approach to applying and this means making connections with people out of the blue. 

Just remember. Most people want to help. You should just ask."
2696,It’s too hard man. Biggest thing is people are with their significant others most of the time
2697,"I'm from the batch of 2019 and just graduated. Looking at your answers is kinda freaking me out cuz I haven't really made true friends at college. 
Everyone were too competitive, selfish and busy in their own shit. I couldn't connect with anyone. 
And I'm not really in touch with my school friends either. 
The idea of not having a chance to make friends anymore is tad bit freaking the shit out of me."
2698,"Highly recommend this Ted talk about frientimacy.

For me, consistency was key to establishing new, deeper friendships when I moved to a big city. I joined a local toastmasters, volunteer at habitat for humanity every week, and joined a trivia group with my lawyer, who o met here via social media.
Find a meetup or group activity that lets you talk (gym classes don't count), and be consistent with going.

Good luck!

https://youtu.be/hmJyWreER7A"
2699,"I’ve noticed that too. Maybe because they feel lonely too, so that’s why they need a SO to feel complete."
2700,Are you me?
2701,"Join a sports team, or a place to volunteer at, or something like that. Do it for a whole season/project. If you really enjoy it, then you know they're good friends. If you don't, try something else."
2702,"Yeah I’ve kinda started noticing that’s potentially a big reason why I feel such a longing for a relationship, I mean i want to have a family eventually and everything, so that’s an obvious desire. But really it’s hard to get together with friends when they all have significant others..."
2703,"Yeah, hobbies are the key here. If I hadn’t joined Meetup or started playing DnD I’d still have zero friends.

Before I found hobbies I basically skated by making friends with the friends of whoever I was dating. It was an okay strategy but it just meant that when the relationship ended, so did those friendships"
2704,"I made a lot of friends after leaving school and moving to a new city for work. Honestly, I think my social life is better in my new city than it ever was in my old one. I made friends here through

- sports (joined softball and flag football teams, found some squash buddies)
- trivia nights (the same people tend to go week after week and I actually made friends with one of the other teams just by participating and making that initial small talk connection - they kind of adopted me into their group)
- volunteering with my union’s young members committee
- taking work friendships out of the office
- friends of friends. When I moved here I didn’t know anybody so I took advantage of every “friend of a friend” connection that was around to see if there was friendship potential there. For example, a friend’s sister was living in my new city and I grabbed a drink with her just because I didn’t know anyone. She and her husband ended up becoming pretty good friends of mine."
2705,Can't judge everyone but some people really are only together just to not be lonely. Worst decision ever.
2706,Yes it is hard and because of that I sometimes fall into the trap of trying to make great friendships with people that are not quite right and ending up disappointed.
2707,"Same. Even the few people i’ve managed to meet up with one on one, it’s still hard because for some reason people feel like they need to be talking or engaged the whole time or else it’s “awkward,” which honestly makes socializing that much more exhausting (which is one of the reasons I think people feel less inclined to do it). And even when people feel obligated to talk, it’s usually meaningless because no one will open up or be themselves for fear of the other person disagreeing with some aspect of their personality and thus ruining the chances at a friendship. Like whatever happened to just doing fuck-nothing with your friends? Used to be fine to just chill at someone’s apartment and not give a fuck what was talked about or what was done. Used to actually enjoy the company of others, now I sometimes dread it."
2708,"People are not going to come to you. I suggest instead of going to see a ball game you join a community league. If you like community service if some sort go volunteer. Be you, but the outgoing you. Engage with people. If politics is your thing go work on a campaign. Just get out there. It is more difficult because you don’t have thousands of people all spending time together for classes and if a residential school then living on top of each other too."
2709,"Same here! Kinda wish there were a place for people like us to try to make friends with each other, but idk if fear and loneliness is a good source for a friendship. Kinda a Catch22 situation"
2710,Same here! I was a transfer student at my University so everyone already made their friends in my major. My roommates became my friends but not super close. Now everyone is gone.
2711,I was just texting about this with my highschool friend who luckily I'm still friends with despite not seeing each other so much nowadays :[ Its so hard to make a deep connection with new people. People seem to already have their good friends set by their late 20's and 30's. Some are in relationships and seem to only be friends with their significant others. For the athletically chllenged joining a sport might not be an option as you'll probably just annoy your hyper competitive teammates. Add introverted and not easy to trust others and you can feel really alone. But all's not lost. I find being very observant has helped me. If I see someone with a t-shirt of something I like I make sure to point it out. That starts a small talk discussion about one of your interests and then something deeper can evolve little by little. Thats how I managed to make friends at my old workplace. I saw my coworkers wallpaper was of a show I loved and pointed it out and then we became closer. Don't be afraid to show/express your passions or interests and others will want to talk to you. :]
2712,"Yes and no.

You can find true friends at any age. I met a super good friend of mine in graduate school. I consider him one of my best friends.

But my inner circle remains super small and the people I consider “close friends” are ~3 people. 1 from childhood. 1 from high school. 1 from grad school."
2713,Substantially more difficult with work but not impossible
2714,It has been the same for me and some of my college friends who’ve tried too.
2715,"Omg same.  I'm in my final year of college and while I do have a few friends,  I am freaked out.  I really want to make good friends with whom I can discuss,  be my own fucking self and not just someone who agrees with everyone. At this point I have really lost hope :("
2716,it’s true but only because it is always hard to find true friends in college or not. i guess in college everything feels more free and so you think drinking together is friendship but after college you mature and learn that there is more to that so you become increasingly picky about the people you talk to
2717,This is essentially what I did too and can confirm this works. You really have to go and put yourself out there.
2718,Good luck finding a true friend *in* college.
2719,"I know it's not the popular opinion here but, churches provide a community (specifically weekly home groups) that I haven't found matched elsewhere in normal adult life."
2720,"This should get more upvotes. 

Frientimacy = Positivity + Consistency + Vulnerability 

On a related note: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5n6gbpCqA5g I think it is possible to make new friends after college. It is definitely harder — but only because fewer people are willing to be vulnerable after college.

Once we step into the working world in our 20s, it is most important to be “professional” and a lot of us adopt a work persona, which tends to be impersonal and distant, even cold for some. 

We seek solace in our partners and the romantic relationship sphere becomes the safest place where we can be vulnerable. We solidify our relationships with our family and relatives. 

We may realize too that some of our friends from college or our younger years become different. We are all changing in our 20s and 30s. We realize we liked them only because we hung out with them consistently but we didn’t in fact like their personalities or we had not noticed that we were frenemies with people who come together with the purpose of keeping up or upping up one another. 

But if you have healthy friendship groups, please count yourself lucky and don’t take them for granted. More than consistency, I think it’s important to allow ourselves to show vulnerability when we meet new people and seek to build new friendships. It won’t necessarily lead to a best friends forever scenario but it could at least lead to more authentic interactions."
2721,"I appreciate the response. I actually found my life long friend group through the church I grew up in but now it’s not so much my cup of tea. Maybe that’ll change later in my life. My life long friend group also fell out of religion similar to myself but we still found eachother through the church which I’m super thankful for. We’ll see though, and great suggestion. Most of my friends and family friends were found through that church and they’re all amazing."
2722,Meetup.com has groups and activities for just about everything.
2723,Ya I'm not into that needing to talk. I think people do it because they feel lonely to.
2724,"Vulnerability - yesss!!! 

This should have more upvotes too! 💙

About to watch the video now, but have you watched Brene Brown's Ted talks or Netflix special on vulnerability?"
2725,"College dropout here! It’s very hard for me to find friends. I know this isn’t my place but the world isn’t the friendliest place. Adults lead different lives and making that shift from seeing people every week or so to not knowing anyone at all is tough. I struggle because of my personality though, I’m too honest, one of those nice guys who’s been screwed with too much so I kind of have trust issues type. It’s really tough, just don’t think you’ll have a shit load of friends because most of those won’t last long either.... good luck."
2726,"Right? It feels good being able to dictate your own time table.

Although I haven't figured out how to get rid of the ""I forgot to study and the test is in an hour"" feeling in there morning."
2727,"The only thing I can relate to is the money, which doesn't matter because I have no time to use thing things I buy. This year I spent 600 bucks on miniatures which would have been paradise to me as a teen (also it's not too expensive compared to how much I earn) but now they're all just collecting dust as I have no time or energy to paint them. 

I'm stressed and sleepy all the time and I can't just take the day off like I could in school. 

I don't like living by myself, I'd rather live with other people even if I had to pick up after them a bit. I've hung out with my old friends once in the year since we graduated. 

Life after school has been hell for me."
2728,"All this did was make me realize how much of a failure I am lmao. 1 year out of high school, dropped out of college working a dead end job, haven’t seen my friends in ages, no energy and not enough money. Lmao life is greaaaaat"

2730,"I definitely don’t have a job as exciting and satisfying as yours, but it is awesome to be making the most money I’ve ever made. I also love not having to study or worry about assignments ever again. My time off is my time off"
2731,"Thanks for this post man!  I'm starting my first full-time job in September and the transition has been crazy.  I remember being so worried about paying bills during college while working two part-time jobs, always pinching pennies and silently cursing myself whenever I ran into someone who found a place with cheaper rent than mine.  This past week I went apartment shopping in my new city and the difference was night and day compared to college.  I could easily afford the large A3 layout instead of barely being able to rent the tiny A1?  I could live in a newer, safer complex close to work instead of in a cheaper neighborhood further away?  Anyway, my point is that it's good to know that I'm not going crazy and that other people feel the same way!"
2732,"I studied Aerospace Engineering, now I work as a Robotics Consultant!"
2733,"Yikes, sorry my dude, didn't mean to make my post feel that way. I hope things get better soon! 
Are you looking to upgrade your work situation?"
2734,"It was.... Difficult at times.

While math is a fundamental block of most the engineering disciplines, it isn't the be-all/end-all people make it out to be. 

I definitely would encourage you to give it a try. Chem or Bio might be more of your style. Or Comp Sci, which is less number intensive but more algorithm based.

Either way at most colleges it's easier to swap from Engineering as opposed to swapping to."
2735,"i'm 26 now and still feeling great about post-college life. college was hell for me (also an engineering major). i hated exams and quizzes and homework and studying and all that fucking stress.

since college i've lived and worked in NYC and now LA and i get to do all the cool shit i never had the time or money to do in school. definitely worth the 4 years of undergrad suffering. cheers, OP!"
2736,I still have the occasional nightmare that I’m about to graduate but forgot to drop a class so I’m gonna fail and not graduate/lose my job offer
2737,"You’re right about the hobbies. I bought a bike the other day and have been going on 10-15 mile bike rides once a week which has been a blast. I never would have had the desire to do this when I lived with parents. The bike was $150, which isn’t prohibitively expensive but also made it near impossible to buy when living on a college budget. 

Its great making decisions for your self, and realizing that you are solely responsible for your destiny and success. Sure other people help and guide you, but it is your sole responsibility. 

I definitely hang out less with my college friends now and more with my work friends, which has its ups and downs. In general I find it a good bit more lonely and “uneventful” than college, but there’s still plenty of new things to explore and master.

Sitting at a desk all day is rough as well. I stay pretty active, but it’s hard to offset sitting 7-9 hours 5 days a week."
2738,"Completely agree OP, I actually have time/energy/ resources to pursue hobbies I never had and to join sports teams and local social circles. The struggle was worth it and I’m glad you are experiencing the same!"

I wake up feeling like my life is ruined."

2747,"Currently in my summer semester of college and reading this makes me really excited for the future. I’m happy to hear how life is going great for you! Many “after college” stories include negativity of the life following an education, but yours brings a new light as to what is possible. Thanks and good luck!"
2748,"Whoop whoop, let’s get this positive energy out there ya’ll, you can do a lot if you set your mind to something and have good work ethic!! Can’t wait to hopefully be in your situation. I’m doing alright, definitely absolutely LOVE my job, just still living with my parents and don’t have a ton of free money yet but I think that will pick up once I get a better car with better gas mileage. And I mean my money situation isn’t horrible, most of it is just going into savings but it’s nice not having to worry a whole lot about eating out, and my parents are great letting me just sink almost all of my paycheck into saving for a car and eventually some sort of house or apartment down payment or deposit. I see bright things on the horizon, keep it up ya’ll!! The only thing can control in life fully is the amount of effort you put in!💪"
2749,"Sounds confusing haha.
Was it a hard subject to study?
Thinking about engineer but im not very good at math."
2750,"Yes! Been loving the post-grad life (though I didn’t have a too terrible time in college either). Very similar to you, 2 years out of college, living in what I gather is the Bay Area, and former STEM major here. 

You’ve hit the nail on the head with just about everything. 

Work? I genuinely love what I do, it lets me travel (not too much though, 3-4 times a year), and a good enough work-life balance where I can actually do things when I get home. 

Friends? Found a good group in my current city and I know I’ll always have something to do on the weekends, but I’m still close with my college friends and it’s great to have someone to visit/be visiting. 

Housing? No more shitty student apartments. I put a work order in last week and they sent someone to fix it the very next day! And it was fixed. I live with my boyfriend, so it’s a bit like having a roommate and I’m still trying to get him to always put the toilet seat down, but definitely not missing the having to look for a random person to fill a spot in my house kind of scramble. 

Money? I’ll admit that I’m very fortunate and a combo of scholarships + tip money got me through college debt free, so I’m not worry about the crushing student loans, but I love being able to have extra cash to put into retirement, invest, send my parents on a vacation, and still have leftovers to get eyelash extensions."
2751,"Yes sir!

It makes all those sleepless night worth it.
I did the same, finally got the chance to pick up soccer in a beer league. Something I never got to try!"
2752,"Haha no, I wish, merely a consultant!"
2753,"I went with mechanical because an aerospace engineer working with robots is like an aerospace engineer working as a software engineer (I knew one personally): They are smart enough to do it, but it doesn’t fully utilize the skill set they were taught in college.

Edit: Also, engineer myself and many engineering friends. The MEs all took it. Some CEs did. No CpE, SwE, or EE majors did."
2754,Ma’am* 😉 but I did exactly the same and I’m loving it! The social aspect is definitely different after moving to a new city but there are so many ways to get out there. Our 20s are our golden years for sure!
2755,You could be a civil engineer and work somewhere that does sustainable urban development
2756,"Thank you for sharing this man, it’s such a refreshing thing to hear when people persevere and stay strong through hard times. It inspires others to keep going regardless of the circumstances and it definitely did that for me."
2757,Absolutely agree and I would advise you to not minimize your accomplishment as just something! With all the challenges you have faced you managed to do something people always talk about but never do. And you were successful at it. I encourage you to celebrate every moment and continue chasing an ever brighter future :)
2758,Thank you for sharing your story. Congrats on your book!
2759,"I'm glad it helps to hear some positivity. 

I think one of the most important lessons I learned at university (from mostly forcing myself to go to networking events) was that *your degree doesn't define your life*. Heck, most of the people at met at those same networking events were in a completely different field from what they originally studied and were still happy."
2760,"That's awesome, congratulations!!!!"

2765,I view this as one little step to greater success. Thank you for the kind words!

As for the troubles with speaking when it comes to anxieties, this book was designed with people like yourself in mind. Globally, public speaking joked to be more frightening than *death* mainly because we never practice it till the day of the speech.

I've put plenty of things in this work that should help you and a number of recommendations of other texts to expand your confidence on. I sincerely do hope it helps you as it has helped others!"

2772,"It depends on where you work! My office is extremely pro work life balance, lots of vacation and time off, and it would be really rude for somebody to contact you outside of work hours. My boss doesn’t have my phone number; and I literally can’t check my work email out of the office due to security protocols. So it’s definitely possible, you just need to vet the company first.

2778,"It’s truly a mentality and culture. Mentality: if you want a balance, you’ll find it. Culture: people like your professor find it important to showcase their “busy” schedule as a way to embolden their sense of importance.

2782,"I'm with you. I crave 9 to 5, or just a general set time in the morning where I can have nighttime, weekends, and holidays off. When I tell people that I would love to work a 9-5, they always look at me weird. I just want a set schedule so I can plan the fun things with ease and I would have set time for a hobby or kids I want eventually."
2783,"Once you landed a solid gig, it became more comfortable, but it probably took a lot of work to support yourself while gaining enough skill in your craft to become eligible for a full time gig."
2784,Work for the government. Probably the purest form of 9-5 out there.
2785,[deleted]
2786,That’s badass
2787,"I think also professors are more likely to be the type who value independence and doing engaging work, which is likely why they chose to pursue becoming a professor over an easier and maybe more lucrative job in industry. It makes sense that they wouldn't like the idea of a 9-5 corporate job, because they likely avoided it on purpose to get where they are."
2788,"What’s your occupation, if you don’t mind me asking?"
2789,"i work in IT. It varies wildly company to company, but with my current company there is pretty solid work life balance. When it's grind time, i may be there an extra hour or two. When the work load is more standard and there's not a ton to do, i can leave an hour early, or take a two hour lunch without much attention. Again, this will vary solely based on your role and company."
2790,"IT/Tech is generally a lot more progressive than other fields. I set my own hours, often work only 10-3:30pm, and can work from home anytime I want.

Tech is a great field to look at if work-life balance is important. Healthcare and law are on the opposite end of that spectrum."
2791,"This made me chuckle. Also, treats."
2792,You have to separate the two. Imho i will never do a at home job because then it’ll always feel like my home is my workplace which would suck
2793,"All depends on what your job will be. Lawyer, CPA, military officer? All those jobs follow you home. And after a certain point of executive management at companies you will always be ""online."" But thats why you will be compensated better. If you pick a job like nursing, it ends when that shift is over but the mental aspect may still follow you home.

2795,"WLB is generally *better* in entry level positions. Sure, the work is shittier, but your responsibility and expectations outside work hours are usually rock bottom."
2796,"I've been in both and initially I felt like you. Now I like that the work kind of follows me home occasionally because it gives me license to not feel guilty about leaving early when I'm not busy, scheduling doctor's appointments during the day, leaving to attend to personal business when I need to, etc. 

It's important to like what you do. If you spend 8 hours a day just wanting to leave and not think about work, you might need to look elsewhere."
2797,"Depends on your degree and career. I work in HR and when I clock out for the day - that’s it. Nothing follows me home. I might get a text from someone if I’m on vacation, but it’s usually simple and rare. 

Don’t show loyalty to companies that don’t show loyalty to you."
2798,"Yeah, I work 8:30-5:30 and it's awesome coming home and never having to worry about homework or studying for tests! Working 9 hours a day sucks, but it's better than school!"
2799,"Work in tech. You might not find a work-life balance in many traditional jobs, but the tech sector is extremely relaxed.

I work from 9-5, but I can go in at whatever time I want, and I have the option to work from home once a week. Also, my boss works in a different office, so it’s nice to not have someone keeping tabs on me. I’m under no obligation to do extra work, and I’d only do it if I saw a clear opportunity to get a promotion in the company. Otherwise, the plan is to do the work that’s expected, then move into a higher-paying role at a different company in a few years.

In my opinion, there’s one key difference that makes tech so much more relaxed than everywhere else. It’s that tech companies need talent a whole lot more than, say, investment banks. In tech, people constantly hop from job to job, so they’ll leave in an instant if the company isn’t comfortable."
2800,"It absolutely depends on where you work. I would say that every industry has bad and good examples.

Consider my line of work, software engineering. I considered working for SpaceX and ESRI, but found that both companies expect you to work overtime to meet deadlines. This leads to 10+ hour work-days for a lot of people.

I turned down an offer from ESRI because, among other reasons, when I was discussing the salary they offered me, they said that it didn’t include overtime, and they said I’d almost certainly work 10+ hours a week of it. I’m sure they meant it to be a positive thing, but it was a huge warning sign for me.

I was able to find a highly-regarded institution that encouraged a better work-life balance. The folks I work with rarely check their devices on the weekends, and take vacation fairly regularly. Managers in general are kind and understanding, and don’t put undue burden on you.

Find a place like that, and you’ll be happy. You might not make as much as some of your college friends, but your family will appreciate it."
2801,"This depends on how is your work time calculated by your employer. If you have assignments that ""only"" realistically cover your 160 hours/month, you will be in a sweet spot."
2802,"Appreciate the advice, definitely gonna try 8"
2803,"I’m working as a mover while being a competitive fighter. Yes, you definitely need to sleep more. It’s the most underrated aspect of recovery. Nutrition is a factor as well; try upping your protein and healthy fat intake, as well as maybe investing in a vitamin B-complex supplement. Just my two cents"
2804,"Good point about eating, I don’t think I’ve been getting enough protein"
2805,"If you’re almost falling asleep at the wheel, definitely try to get more sleep. If that is not possible for you, I would make sure that you having continuous sleep. If I am waking up in the middle of the night compared to full sleep after workout, I am significantly more exhausted"
2806,"I agree. According to OP though he’s nodding off during the day. More sleep seems like an obvious to box to check, eating a little more could help, there’s no lack of things he can change to address that."
2807,"Yes yes yes yes. Your body needs more sleep to recover so get some more sleep. 7-9 is optimal, 8 being better than 7. If you can get 9 with your schedule then that’s great"
2808,"See a doctor and get a sleep study done. You may have sleep apnea and not realize it, and now it’s being exacerbated by the exercise.

Even normal, healthy people can have sleep apnea, though it’s more common in overweight people.

The sleep study is very easy, you just wear a machine for a night when you sleep at home, then the doctors let you know what’s up. If you need a cpap machine or something, it’ll all be mostly covered by your insurance even if you have pretty bad insurance.

I had it done and super recommend it. It’s an easy fix if it is the problem, and if it’s not, the sleep study should help identify what’s going on.

Don’t sleep (lol) on potential medical issues, that’s what insurance is for... if you don’t use it, you’re wasting your money paying for it."
2809,"One of the few journals that are actually publicly accessible 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28642676/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
2810,"Not having enough protein will definitely make you more tired.

Also, if you’re so tired that you can’t function properly while still getting enough sleep, you may simply be working out too hard. It’s a tough balance when you’re working full time and have so many life demands!"
2811,For some people 6.5 hours is not enough sleep to be considered healthy. For others it’s plenty. Physiology makes all the difference in the world
2812,Honestly 7 is the minimum for most people and people who claim they can get by on 7 are probably right but aren’t operating at 100%
2813,?
2814,"You need more sleep, try 8-9 hours"
2815,"I also felt that. Short of eating or sleeping more I find that doing a shorter routine each day makes recovery easier, still letting me achieve my lifting goals but not feel as exhausted later and needing like 9 hours of sleep. Basically I used to go to the gym for like 2 hours at a time because I enjoyed working out, but now I try to keep it around an hour because I recover a lot faster and am not as tired all the time. 

Also after a few weeks of settling into a routine the exhaustion fades to where it’s not as noticeable."
2816,"You’re body has a good way of telling you what it needs. If you’re thirsty? Drink some fluids till you’re not thirsty. If your hungry? Eat till you’re full. Same deal with sleep. If you’re tired, you need to sleep more. Especially if you’re falling asleep at the wheel. That’s a good way to get into an accident if you ask me."
2817,Just get addicted to coffee like the rest of us
2818,"Iron deficiency is another thing that can cause fatigue. Regular exercise increases the body’s need for iron, so it’s possible that you’ve depleted your iron levels. 

It might be an idea to get a blood test to check your iron levels."
2819,Make sure you’re eating enough too. Your body needs materials and fuel to repair damage from the workouts and if you’re gonna run yourself ragged if you aren’t upping intake to match.
2820,"Dude u need 8 hours.that last 1 hour makes a HUGE difference in performance and recovery.
When u go to bed at night make sure it’s a dark room, keep your phone away and close your eyes an hour earlier."
2821,Naps help!
2822,"how many days are you working out? going from nothing to a lot is a big change to your body. A lot of people who are new to working out or getting back into it start off too strong, wear themselves out, and then end up quitting. Take an adequate amount of rest days, go to bed early, and get in the mindset of eating for energy!"
2823,I work as a carpenter 7-4 everyday and try to get to the gym after work 5 days a week. The best advice I can give you is eat and drink water (obviously) but also take micro greens or ingest more vegetables. I significantly noticed a difference in my energy levels as well as my quality of sleep. I assume the water is helping my sleep but the micro greens really help me out during the day.
2824,"Obviously. Sleep recharges your battery so to speak just like food is fuel. 

Your going to need more sleep intill your body adapts to the sudden change in energy consumption."
2825,Yes.
2826,"More than likely yes. Your body most likely wasn’t used to that much exhaustion (for the muscles). Over time you might be able to cut back a bit and return to your regular schedule.

OR

You can drink more coffee :)"
2827,"Absolutely this. Very simple. Our bodies need 8h period. It doesn't matter that you feel fine on less, unfortunately, because there are processes happening in your body that will suffer from any less sleep than that."
2828,Sleep and calories are not universal things you can recommend as heathy by a certain amount without knowing a person’s physiology.
2829,"im so depressed, fuck"
2830,Yay!!! Congratulations! It feels so good to finally have things fall into place. Wishing you all the best as you keep progressing into your future!
2831,I really needed to hear this thank u
2832,What a lovely positive post :-) Congrats !
2833,"congrats friend, impress them!"
2834,Thank you!!! Just wanted to spread positivity and let people know that there’s always hope. ❤️
2835,I’m proud! What school and degree?
2836,"As cliché as it sounds, but it really does get better. Hang in there, and know that there is something in store for you somewhere out there. ❤️"
2837,Thank you!!! ❤️
2838,I know that feeling. I’m a month into my first “big kid” job after being out of school for a whole year. The year between school and working really messed with me mentally and I felt so low. But it gets better and I am so so happy you are doing so well! Congratulations again and please know that you always have a purpose no matter what your situation is❤️
2839,"Awww, thank you so much! And I’m happy for you too! All the best for you, I really appreciate it. ❤️"
2840,Thank you! ❤️
2841,"It is, because it’s still the learning and adjusting part. Thank you!!! ❤️"
2842,It really does! There were lots of days and nights that I cried because I felt so lost and out of purpose. But life is full of surprises. Thank you so much! ❤️
2843,Just hang in there! We all have our own pace. ❤️ A workmate of mine took 6 years to finally land her first job. Don’t lose hope. ❤️
2844,"Thank you!!! My degree is Psychology, but sadly in our country the field is not yet very well-established, so there’s very few jobs to get into that’s related to the field."
2845,"Yeah I totally get that.. hobbies are expensive, animals are expensive ect ..

Hoping I can make something work down the line where I can have a more flexible schedule and have those things as well!"
2846,"I feel the same way. Many people, although working isn’t their idea of fun, still have a drive for their career. Or a some passion for it. I guess I was born without that part of me because I desire something different. How I can achieve that in this day and age is the hard part. I’m the type of person that a full time, stressful job just completely mentally breaks me. It has in the past. To pursuit that again for me is like trying to get myself to step on hot coals."
2847,Who actually wants a career? I don’t want to sit in an office all day and work long hours but how else do you pay the bills
2848,work towards building a business around the lifestyle you want.
2849,"This is a big fear of mine to be honest. We plan on getting married and you know being together forever. But life happens and forever is a long time. 

I have a great background working for the government and other good work experience, but my fear is that if I leave for an extended amount of time, having such a large gap looks bad on a resume... I guess I still have to have some productive thing going on that makes sense. It's just going back I hear is hard, especially if you were a stay at home mom for a long time.. it was hard for my mom and it sucks how professionals look at those gaps.

I probably won't leave my professional career until like 2-3 years down the line.. it just not my dream to continue being a career women.."
2850,"That's what I am thinking about too. But let just be real, you need MONEY to do all that, and I wonder where you got your money from? Unless you were born in a RICH family, so do whatever you want then. And also, do your wifey or the one that you love is also want to live that life style. Or it's just me overthinking.."
2851,/r/ihadastroke
2852,"I do not want to work too! Although I see myself as a career woman very much. But given the choice, i will choose to stay home."
2853,"Absolutely. I just don't want you to be stuck!

Advice from a random redditor also in a relatively young (yet committed) relationship: Figure it out as you go and continuously communicate with your partner.

Best of luck :) I'm sure things will work out!"
2854,"I remember when I was in school I never really thought about my post Uni job. Then when I graduated and it was time to job search a part of me knew I had to it, mostly because I had aspirations like wanting to move out and travel and for that I obviously needed money, but another part of me thought the idea of working in an office 9-5, five days a week for 40-something years was a terrible way to live. I remember getting an interview for one of those office jobs and having a panic attack about the possibility of getting the job and being miserable doing the whole 9-5 thing. 

Ultimately I didn't end up getting the job, but did start freelancing which at first didn't make me much, but over time it became my now current job and I can afford rent and food and have a little savings. So for that, I am grateful because the lifestyle suits me a little more. Some people are made for the business life and thrive in it, I have friends that do it and they seem happy enough. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is it's totally normal to not want the ""career woman"" business life. Some people just want the simple things in life, I know I do"
2855,r/antiwork
2856,"Honestly I am, not denying that there. Blessed to have such a supportive SO and have a future opportunity to live more freely. A lot of people don't I get that. Life isn't equal for everyone ... Sadly"
2857,"I have a classmate at university who said she's studying against her will. She said her goal was always to marry young and take care of a husband, not even necessarily having kids (she didn't mention them and I didn't ask) but just being a caretaker/homemaker. And honestly? That's totally valid. The workforce is brutal, and some people are okay with even the most basic things. If you build yourself up with a craft and you're mindful of your finances, you can live frugally and comfortably.

Just make sure to be realistic in the craft you choose. You have to be good, and for that you need to dedicate time to it. Try to have a side job on the meantime until you have some savings and have had some clients.

I know that with planning things will work out."
2858,Fucking privilege
2859,"I can relate, it's hard being passionate about something. I was very lost in highschool and had no idea what to do but my friends all had these ambitious goals. And they're still following that. Not everyone is the same and I get that now!"
2860,"I graduated in May. A few friends entered the workforce full time and mostly look forward to 3 of 7 days a week. 

I wasn’t so keen on selling my soul to a 9-5 but I didn’t want to be a bum, so I’m taking my job a hockey referee seriously which pays bills for now. What was once a weekend job in school is now my day job that in itself is a career. 

In the process I made time for personal enrichment classes, a brief internship and short contracted job. I even interviewed for a full time job and was turned away for being too *passionate* about the field. 

With all that happening, I know I want to go to grad school now and that’s what I’m doing immediately because that’s where my head and heart are. I also know I wouldn’t rely on reffing ice hockey forever because that job is killer in its own right. 

There is nothing wrong with wanting to not be in that groove. I’m sure you’re college aged like me. We have the rest of our lives to work. If you’re not at least satisfied then don’t stop trying. Follow opportunities and take your passion with you."
2861,"While OP may (or may not) have a mentionably privileged situation and a possible way to escape what we are conditioned to believe is a normal life, we should recognize that the current culture of work in this world is unsatisfactory - that no matter what station or status the worker resides in, our work culture is in some way harmful to us all."
2862,"Honestly working on a farm sounds awful, being a stay at home mom sounds awful and so does sitting in a office all day. I didn’t even ask to be born, 22 years ago two people had sex and now I have to work the rest of my life."
2863,Yes thanks for the advice! I'm hoping everything works out 🤞
2864,Lots of people make consistent choices to follow the rules and work hard and still don’t have these options available to them.
2865,"I view work as a means to a end, not as a life goal. But my goals require money and working generates income. 
I work so I can have the funds to do what I love, but I also make sure my work schedule allows me the time to do what I love too. Sometimes work requires overtime and obviously that’s a bummer but that’s just the nature of the beast. 

Find yourself a job that allows you to do what you want but doesn’t make you entirely dependent on your SO ( money is the biggest reason for altercations in a relationship ) or some way to bring home a lil something to help until your projects kick off."
2866,"The life you describe sounds like a dream, all I want is to have somewhere quiet to live and be able to write and record music and work on whatever ideas I have. Running a small business like a coffee shop seems like it could be really rewarding to me. Mostly I want freedom, and it seems like in order to have enough money to have a home and support kids I’ll have to have something more like a career. I don’t know. I don’t love the job world. It’s hard to navigate and it feels like it’s easy to get trapped."
2867,"Well before feminism you married a competent man and supported him to become more successful. You manged the household and so could manage it to a T to your liking.  
Go back a little further and both of your jobs were on the family farm that you lived at so taking care of the house, the kids, and doing the work was all together all the time.  
This idea that you would build a perfectly fine house then *leave it* for most of the day to go sit in a dingy cube or even worse today out in the open listening to your coworkers' every noise would have been unthinkable to that generation.  
This is also what has given rise to the phenomenon where our young women must chose between the life of their would-be child vs. their future prosperity and society encourages them to chose the money."
2868,"I know this sounds corny, but I'm so happy for you that your freelance career has taken off. My hubby is trying something similar right now and it's a battle. But I know he'll be on the other side (it taking off) someday too."
2869,[deleted]
2870,Actually I've taken the test and I'm an infj haha. They struggle a lot with careers as well which aligns with my dilemma
2871,"Yeah we have he definitely doesn't mind being the breadwinner. He thinks it's wonderful that I have these desires as well, very supportive in such that he wants to have land and raise animals as well. Luckily his career will allow us to maybe get something like this down the line. It's just hard if I'm not contributing since life changes and expenses run high"
2872,"Thank you! that really means a lot :) It has its ups and downs and getting started can be quite daunting. Good luck to your husband, I hope it works out for him"
2873,"I kind of got into it accidentally tbh! 

I was looking to get into copywriting as a career but all the in-house job opportunities required a portfolio showing previously published work, of which I had none. I managed to get a job writing for a travel agency that paid an abysmal rate, but at least it was a foot in the door and was a chance to build a portfolio of non-academic work. 

After that it was a snowball effect. A portfolio meant I can advertise my work to other clients, more clients lead to a more diverse portfolio, which leads to more opportunities, which leads to upping my rates which means more money. After doing that for 3 years, I figured why should I go work for some shmuck in an office when I'm doing ok freelancing?"
2874,"I’m in a similar boat, in not wanting a conventional career.  I’ve always thought that if I have children, I want to be with them until they are at least 5 or 6. My partner and I have discussed this, and of course money is an issue with this old fashioned plan. I’ve recently been thinking about unconventional ways of earning money while still primarily being at home, the front runner at the moment is running a private home daycare. I will shortly have a BA and hope to work in the government before getting married etcetc, but you’re definitely not alone in feeling this way!"
2875,"""lEaRn To CoDe"""
2876,"Bro same same same, fucking same. Graduated a year ago with B.A. in Chinese and minor in Military Science. Two international internships, study abroad, top of language department student. Every branch of the military refused me cuz I had an eye surgery at 12 years old. State Department told me I needed more life experience, Home land Security refused me, had no choice but to return to my shitty suburb hometown to work my first job out of college as a pizza delivery driver, then Amazon warehouse, then Starbucks, then a shitty loan company, and now I’m jobless no money with loans. My next bet is to go teach English in Asia as soon is covid is over. All the while my dad, and engineer, barks at me everyday for not being a STEM major and says it’s all my fault yada yada yada. So bro your not alone."
2877,"I absolutely *hate* when people just toss that around like it's nothing. It takes months and months of learning the basic fundamentals, it will take at least year to become marketable. Not to mention, coding is definitely not for everyone. People also don't realize you'd be competing with Comp. Sci majors, who know the ins and outs of coding in general..

Seems to act as the default answer. I took up a few coding classes back at my community college - I had to hire a tutor for both classes, and I passed with the skin of my teeth. The tight deadlines, multiple all-night marathons, and my dwindling patience.. just not for me."
2878,"Yeah, maybe my view is a bit skewed because I spend a lot of time on reddit."
2879,"This may not be exactly what you want to hear but the professor I TA’d for got a BA in anthropology, top of his class but could only get a job on an art gallery that quickly went under, and was working as a waiter when he decided to get an MBA. After finishing his MBA he spent a decade at Ford earning a bunch of money in a supply chain/logistics management role before realizing his true passion was behavioral economics and getting his PhD and becoming a highly respected researcher in that field. So do with that info what you will."
2880,There are jobs in every field and successful people in every field. Some fields just have less opportunities than others. You have to put yourself out there so much more in those fields. How about a YouTube channel? It’s a great way to learn and market yourself and your knowledge.
2881,"And from my experience, the average person with functional knowledge in code or development will be overlooked for non-US remote workers who are self taught and will accept a third of the salary of a US based employee. My boss tells everyone to not bother with a CS degree."
2882,"Someone will literally have to bail me out of jail the next time someone tells me ""learn to code"" because its dismissive of literally every other skillset."
2883,"Dude, I love marine Biology, doesnt mean anybody is going to pay me to do it.

&#x200B;

Instead its my hobby and I go on scuba diving trips and maintain a reef aquarium that I have in my office as I do my accounting job which pays me to pursue that passion. 

&#x200B;

That being said, STEM is a meme also at this point. Plenty of accountants, engineers that I know personally cant get jobs in the field. Actually was listening to the Joe rogan podcast with former Mr olympia Ronnie Coleman and learned he graduated with an accounting degree with honors but couldnt find a job for 2 years and became a cop instead. 

&#x200B;

The sooner you realize many degrees are just passion hobbies and not actually careers, the better. Even Indiana Jones had a side hustle and full time job when he wasnt going on his archeology adventures."
2884,"Hey, just wanted to say that I feel you completely. I literally just graduated from college  about three weeks ago with an Anthropology major (as well as Gender Studies -- I was a double major) and I often feel less-than in comparison to my peers who majored in Economics/Business/Finance (don't know if one would consider that part of STEM necessarily) and have great jobs right out of college that have allowed them to live comfortably in major cities. I've realized that as cliche as this sounds, everyone has their own path and you never know where you'll end up and just because you major in one thing does not guarantee success in that field. Also, from talking to people 10-20 years out of college, I've realized that this is especially the case with humanities degrees since liberal arts education give you critical thinking skills that makes it so that you can perform various types of jobs in various fields -- for example, did you know that the former President of the World Bank (2012-2019) Jim Yong Kim got a PhD in anthropology? So was Stephen Reggio, the former CEO of Barnes & Noble.

With that said, I've also accepted that depending on the path I take I may make less than friends but that does not mean I'm ""lesser"" than them by any means. Just want to put that out there because when you do start doing the work *you want to do,* you may still potentially be making significantly less than your friends (esp. if you're into social work and they're into STEM/finance). So make sure that you're not tying your self-worth to your achievements or paycheck. And if your friends are ever being assholes about it, kick 'em to the curb cause they're being haters.

Also wanted to say that we have such similar interests! Like I said, I just got my BA in Anthropology and I'd like to go to graduate school in the near future for an MPH/Master's in Medical Anthropology and eventually (after being in the workforce for a few years) would like to get a PhD in Medical Anthropology! Like you, I am struggling to find work so I am considering jobs that you only need HS diplomas for (i.e. retail at the mall or grocery store jobs) and was worried about the stereotypes that may come with it (""oh she got a useless degree in anthropology/gender studies/snowflake shit and is never going to get a real job"") but have honestly stopped giving a fuck as I am too worried about my own financial situation to worry about others' opinions."
2885,"I wanted to do Peace Corps at one point, but I can't because I'm disabled..."
2886,"Yeah I'm in the same position as well..

Graduated last year with a degree in Econ, which I was told by a million different people it was a solid degree. Well I can't get hired for shit, on top of that I have no internship or ""professional"" experience, so I don't qualify for shit. 

I got hired at a nice company right before everything went downhill - I've basically written that job off, so now I'm back to square one. Who knows when things will turn around, I have a feeling months and months."
2887,"Graduated in May with a degree in a super technical field with equal amounts of achievement to you and a great portfolio and I haven't been able to get any kind of job even a crappy service job. So don't feel bad, you're not alone."
2888,"No offense, but you sound like a spoiled child and unemployment and poverty will probably change your attitude fast. It did for me early in my career. 

And you dont have to be good at it, you just have to do it lol. Most jobs dont need unique levels of talent to do, you just need to put the time in."
2889,"There's the STEM and Trade School Circlejerk here. Even in the STEM fields, you are still competing against those who have higher skills than you and better connections. Stem doesn't guarantee open doors for everyone."
2890,"I feel you. I was originally a psych major but ended up getting paralegal education and planning to go to law school. The criminal justice system really fascinates me and I know why I want to become a lawyer but HOLY FUCK, there are no jobs out there. Law Schools are chugging lawyers out like anything, and at this point, just like with an arts degree, people are taking low-level jobs just to get by. And law school is SHIT expensive. A few years ago, I was sure that if I enter a profession that I do not like, I'll suck at it and I'll hate it. But looking at the tuition fees for schools, the time, the job prospects, all of that often makes me think if I'm going in the right path. Plus, plenty of people who choose law end up hating it and doing something else entirely.

I have a friend, he's 19, he dropped out of college and he knows how to code. His father back in India has a website designing company, and he is now working for him. He's bloody working, and making deals and projects, and earning a decent amount of money. Now, the fact that his father owned the company might be a good reason why he's able to work in the first place but if he wanted to apply to another company with the experience he has gained now, he totally can. Coding is a skill you can learn out of school. Things like history, law, anthropology, etc., you can't. So I will be 26 years old when I fucking graduate and have a job related to my profession. And that too, is a big MAYBE.

It's honestly really frustrating, but when I dive into the books, when I think of the impact I can have, when I think of the reasons why I chose this field in the first place, I feel a bit better.

The thing is, you can't go back and change the past. You can't undo things, and you can't magically start liking something you don't. College is a scam, but this is how the society rolls. It sucks but it is what it is. Just know that even in STEM degrees there is a big variety. Software is hot right now, possibly it would be for a long time, so that's great for all those people who are interested in it. There are millions of people, as we speak, working in jobs unrelated to their field, and are overeducated. Fuck the system, honestly but know that we all stand in solidarity with you.

In the meantime though, you should seriously start considering small gigs. I tutor students and am considering opening an etsy shop. My friend sells weed to get by (we're in Canada), and I and some of my girlfriends have considered porn. Those can be considered extreme examples but in this day and age, and I believe it's going to get worse, it's important to have 'side hustles'. Don't do anything illegal, but consider being an entrepreneur--it really pays off sometimes. I know I wasn't much help but, I know how you feel mate. Good luck!"
2891,"99% of jobs are not fun, especially not initially.

Accounting wasnt but I learned to love it in a way. There is a meme about how nobody else can really appreciate this spreadsheet I made but I do. I dont think anybody starts out loving working in excel 12 hours a day but some develop a love for their work.

Apart from that, you think the trashmen love cleaning up trash? The chipoltle line workers love scooping rice? Most jobs arent ""fun."" They are paying you to do something because its not fun. The way it works is that fun things are usually what you have to pay for. 

Work is like fitness in a lot of regards, nobody loves being in the pain at first but as you get better at something like running, you may develop your own love for it. Likewise eating cake is something everybody loves and wields no results, of course we all wish we could eat cake all day but thats not how the world works. 

Or you can keep living in that fantasy land where you pretend you want to be indiana Jones and wont be happy until somebody pays you to do it."
2892,"A lot of people start out filming from their iPhones and use free editing software. Tons of tutorials online. Hell, I’ve learned to fix my computer from like 11 year old kids on YouTube who are definitely just using whatever is available to them. Amazing times we live in. 

Finding success is about taking chances and constantly trying new things. Don’t be afraid to fail at things you try either, and don’t assume you don’t have the skills to do something. Everything you do for the first time you will pretty much suck at, but that courage to try again and to learn and to make a genuine effort is what makes the difference between someone who is able to control their own life and someone who just watches as life happens to them. 

Don’t discount yourself."
2893,"That's just fucking sad. Yes it might be how the world works but some of us, including OP,  are fed up with being told to waste more than a third of our fucking life on something that we hate and kills our soul. That's fucked up."
2894,"I’m a STEM major and it’s outraging how some folks belittle the non-STEM majors.
You have a lot of potential. My friend’s mom majored in Anthropology and went on to manage in an insurance company. What she told the recruiter was that since she had studied Anthropology, she understood people and therefore knew how to deal with people. 
It’s all about how you sell yourself."
2895,No worries :) Thanks for sharing
2896,"I don't think ""left-wing pacifist"" would be good for any branch lol, but I certainly don't look down on everyone who joins. I understand why people choose the military. Working for the VA might be neat though. They actually employ a lot of medical anthropologists."
2897,that's not true in my line of work but I'd imagine that's true for positions that just need some code monkeys
2898,"Everyone told me my communications degree was bullshit and I got a job starting $50,000 where they encourage and push for upwards mobility in the company. I get a company car that I can use personally with everything paid for, a company phone, great health, dental and vision for next to nothing and they kept me working with 80 extra hours of PTO on top of my current 80 hours. I’m freaking happy and anyone who talked shit on my while getting that degree is an asshole. You can get a degree in anything and it be useless if you aren’t willing to put the work in to make it benefit you.

Follow your passion. Even if it’s a struggle now, don’t sell out. I’m so glad you found something to study that you enjoy and have some sort of love for. A lot of people are pressured into degrees and are miserable at their jobs because they were so focused on the bullshit aspects of it.

You got this."
2899,"Plus why enter the military after you've graduated from college. Like you'll still have to repay the loans, they won't. The GI bill only works for future schooling."
2900,"Yeah, I’d see what anthropology videos are out there now and see how you could do it better, make it more interesting, etc. people watch all kinds of stuff on YouTube and they will keep watching if they find it interesting. A lot of people watch more YouTube than they do tv."
2901,"Don’t be so hard on yourself, entering the job market after uni is ridiculously competitive no matter what you studied. I graduated in Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry last year and still haven’t landed a job - I’m lucky if I get a reply from recruiters! 

As for your plans for future study, I honestly think that’s the most important thing; I’ve been working in a dead end retail job since graduation and my whole family thinks I’m a disappointment, but it doesn’t bother me anymore because I know my passion is chemistry and I’ll keep applying until I get to where I want to be. 

You’ll get there, you’ve just got to keep plodding along with your goal always in mind."
2902,"I wouldn't give up on State; this administration hasn't been filling positions and has downsized a good bit (kind of a philosophical FU that conservatives have on the issue) so they largely aren't hiring, but a competent administration would definitely need to fill those FSO positions to function as a superpower."
2903,"lmao, I can understand that. I've seen people rejected for the dumbest things imaginable, heck they just updated the tattoo regs for our branch a year or so ago to stop loosing good recruits to a few too many tats."
2904,"Right, so anyone who throws out a “learn how to code” as some condescending sink or swim advice is not considering that coding skills themselves with no other supporting experience/degree can get you stuck in a lower paying or “code monkey” position."
2905,"I loved how there was always an end in sight. If I hated a class, it would be over in a few months. I had all of this future potential in front of me. Now I work a very demanding job and it’s so hard to keep up the motivation when it’s just ongoing and there’s no end date to look forward to.."
2906,"A lot of us struggle with the transition between school life and career life. It's a totally different mindset. Usually school asks you ""how well did you do the job?"" and work asks you ""Did you do the job?"" So in one world it's important just to do the job and in another it's important to do the job well. So many places I've worked have been so overworked/understaffed that doing your job well didn't get you any more recognition than people who just did the job. 

School also gives you access to all kinds of people. My college class was small, but it was still hundreds of people my age. Now my office has like 14 people, maybe 4 or 5 of them are my age. 

In school it was easy to make friends based on interests. You had clubs. Clubs met regularly. After school it becomes much more work to find/start a group hobby for your free time. 

Lastly, a good class had a syllabus that spelled out exactly what to do in order to succeed. Workplaces don't have this. Maybe they have a code of conduct, but that talks about how not to fail, not how to succeed."
2907,"My biggest issue now is not having the means or the drive to do any of the things I wished I could do during school. While studying or attending classes I was always dreaming of the time when my days were my own I had the time to do what I want. Now that I’m here post grad I struggle to shift gears and find projects in the evening. Classes always preach self care, I wish they would have made it more of a focus than a disclaimer."
2908,I think the money alone will make working a bit more better than school ever could be.
2909,No not really. I hate my job but school is much worse
2910,I like that making more money and full time means saving and not spending everything
2911,I have been kind of struggling with this a lot myself. I have been so conditioned to being in school for so long with very little real responsibility that I am somewhat struggling with responsibilities right now. I’m sure that things will get better.
2912,"I’m 28, and goddamn this is still something I long for."
2913,Absolutely yes. There's nothing greater in this world than the feeling of regret.
2914,No. I had to be around my parents 24/7 during school breaks. Fuck that
2915,That's what bothers me. I think that's a reason why a lot of people hate their jobs. They know what it's gonna be like everyday with nothing new to look forward to.
2916,"Plan out some summer related activities. Day clubs, BBQs, picnics, rooftop bars, etc. Those are all activities you can do over the weekend. If you have the extra time for it, do a quick trip with a few friends. The thing with summer now that you’re working is more small things here and there instead of one huge vacation."
2917,You get a new job every year?
2918,I'm in construction management
2919,"Every day is different and I get to meet all sorts of people. I worked in interiors up until recently and just switched into base building. It can be stressful sometimes, definitely not a 40 hour a week job but that's partly why theres a demand and the salaries are so good. No plans to change industries in the hear future."
2920,"That’s a great gig. I know a lotta people who are absolutely loaded from working in construction management. 

Is it fun though? About to start college and still undeclared lol"
2921,"I think you may need to make new associations with summer. For example, I worked a lot during my summers in college, so I mainly associated my summers with working, spending more time with family, hot sunny weather, and watching a summer TV show, rather than having a lot of time off. Although an old boss of mine did choose to take some half days during the summer to spend more time with their kids. 

Setting a summer goal could help. If you like to read, see if your local library has a summer reading list for adults.

Assuming the weather is nice and warm, you could also simply try to spend more time outside. Take more walks. Go bike riding. Go hiking. Go swimming. If you're near a beach, go to the beach. Swim or lay out and get some sun.

Find some other events or activities you can partake in that are summer-related or only happen in the summer."
2922,[deleted]
2923,"I second this. A lot of cities also have free events in parks during the summer, like plays, concerts, or outdoor movies."
2924,Can I ask what you do?
2925,Hi. Where do you get a few friends willing to do this? ... :(
2926,Yes! I forgot about concerts and outdoor movies. Where I’m at there is usually one concert every weekend and tickets are usually in the $20-30 range
2927,"Go for a bike ride after work on a Friday and or during the weekends. It’s been really feeling like summer for me recently the more I do that.

Seeing people outside mowing their lawns, grilling, sitting on the porch puts me in a great mood for some reason lol. Also the fresh air, exercise, sun on my skin and wind in my hair is just amazing for my headspace"
2928,"Start golfing, and spend as much time as possible outdoors. Just sitting on your porch drinking, going for walks etc all help with enjoying summer Imo."
2929,"So I recently moved to a large city about a year ago (I graduated college from another large city about 2 years ago) and once I got here, I messaged anyone I went to college with, regardless of how close we were or if we graduated in the same class, and asked if they wanted to meet up for drinks, coffee, etc. 

Luckily, there is a decent amount of alumni here, but I also had to actively try to make friends. From there, I was introduced to some of their friends/former colleagues and now have a decent friend group that I see on a regular basis. It really is about putting yourself out there and being very proactive about making friends."
2930,"You have to get outside. When I had summers off during school, I just found myself outside a lot. Disc golf with friends, the lake, basketball, it just sort of organically became summer. Now, I need to make an effort to have a summer. Really all that means is planning ahead, but it certainly does feel weird compared to a summer while in school"
2931,Take off July 5th this year and take a trip for the four day weekend! If you’re in the states that is
2932,"If you like hiking or just walking and being outside, try disc golf. One starter disc is like $10 and you can play as much you want for free after that. Its has helped me keep the desire to go outside. Its a great excuse to be outside and enjoy the summer"
2933,Very common among Younger millennials. It’s expected for us to bounce around and is very advantageous.
2934,"I mean, that's true to an extent. Also dependent on your industry. As an entry engineer it won't be beneficial for me to do that for like 3-5 years."
2935,"I'm in university and summer does not feel like summer at all. Until August **it's finals time!**

I've accepted it will never feel like summer again, and that's OK."
2936,"You will feel it in the streets

On a day like that , the heat

It will feel like summer"
2937,Thanks!
2938,Yeah I think that’s where I’m at. Lets get ice cream?
2939,*Donald Glover has entered the chat*
2940,F :(
2941,meetup.com
2942,Yeah!
2943,That’s what I actually plan on majoring in!
2944,Go to the beach or lake! If there’s none nearby then go back to a fun hobby gouge been missing! I love to sail and ride motorcycles and bikes! So I’ll take the boat out or bike 🏍. Or I’ll get a workout in and go on the road bike on a group ride to socialize and compete a bit.
2945,Do summer things! Go for walks in the park on your days off. Open all the windows. Maybe set aside decorations for your space that are exclusively for summer.
2946,"I had the “so that’s it” feeling yesterday. I always guessed that I would be sitting in the giantass arena waiting forever for my name to be called (I’m a Tr) and see my giant family in the stands after spending three days together before everything and that’s when I would hit me. Instead I got a zoom call with the few of them and some cards in the mail. The only real confirmation that I got was my final grades coming out. I got a 4.0 for the very first time, but I wasn’t around my friends that I’ve had since freshman year when I came to a campus in a different time zone without knowing a single person. I’ve gotten to be on good enough terms with our university president because of my campus involvement that he recognizes me and I was looking forward to him handing me a meaningless piece of paper. I keep having to remind myself that I actually have done something that not everyone does (is is able to do)."
2947,congrats!! and thank you for this! i'll be finished with college next week and i really needed this
2948,"Congrats! I am the first person on my dad’s side to graduate college for at least four generations so this has been a big deal for my family. It’s very anti-climactic but hey, at least I have a job lined up to start in August."
2949,"as a new college grad, thank you so much for this post. best of luck to all of my fellow seniors! ❤️"
2950,Congrats my man that is a very very very amazing accomplishment and I wish u goodluck further in life
2951,"> I think the main group of people who enjoy college more than life after it, did not have to worry about finances during college and now that they are in the real world supporting themselves they are struggling. 

👌spot on bb"
2952,"I definitely agree. More free time, more money, more time to spend with family, I actually have hobbies now, actually have a work/life balance, and way less stress. Of course there have been challenges adjusting to life after college, which is why I got on this sub, but overall my life is a lot better. But I’ve had people get really offended when I tell them that irl (usually in the context of explaining why I don’t want to go to grad school ever)."
2953,"Honestly thats how it should be, i wouldn't say easier, but it gets way better, high school was better than middle school, college was better than high school and the real world can be better than college if you play your cards right. Life improves each year and decade. Truth is the people that are enjoying their life are not venting, crying and whining online.  The years after school can be the best years of your life, i've known people who have improved their social life after college, got more attention from the opposite sex had good paying jobs, an apartment and house, and have traveled all over the country and world."
2954,High key hate academia. Love learning. Hate academia. Did poorly in college but thriving in the labor market.
2955,Yep or didn’t do their homework :)
2956,"Yup. I was stressed out all through college because I couldn’t work and keep up with my course load (wasn’t prepared for college in the slightest). 

Even if I wasn’t working and just focused on school, thinking about my dwindling account just exhausted me. After getting a job with decent money the weight of it all just came off. I have no trouble managing money but I have to be making it to budget properly."
2957,"Just to say that I think I'll feel the same in two years when I graduate from my night course!

30h week and engineering is a hell of a weight to carry."
2958,"Only been working a few weeks but I'm already enjoying it way more than school. I am on a good team doing interesting work though.

Plus making money on top of that is nice.

I had much more of a social life in college though."
2959,"That's a great analogy with the relationship subreddits. On the flip side, the points your raise are also probably a sign that I should spend less time on Reddit and more time ""focusing on my life,"" as you say!"
2960,Gives me hope! I am graduating early and I think I will enjoy post college life because of the things you describe. I hope I do!
2961,It's nice to not have to study or do hw anymore.
2962,"> explaining why I don’t want to go to grad school ever

That's a big-ass mood right there.  I'm not going to school unless I absolutely have to."
2963,"A lot of subs on Reddit can be pretty negative (and I'm of the opinion that too much negativity isn't good and at a certain point you start to internalize it). Also, Reddit can be pretty addicting. So I totally understand how you feel this way. I think stepping back can be a good thing. Everything in moderation."
2964,"This is me. I hated every minute of college and just gritted my teeth all the way through. It took some time to find a career type job once I graduated but I am so much happier working. I like getting to work towards career goals, big projects instead of surface level information on lots of different topics, getting to have a life during my off hours and being able to afford a comfortable life and a family. I grew up in a bad/unstable environment so I craved the stability I have now for so long. 

I’m even looking to go back for a grad degree, but if I do it’ll be a remote program designed for full time workers, paid by my employer, so I don’t think it will bother me like undergrad did since it won’t be a repeat of student life."
2965,I think it comes down to whether or not you worked full time in college. I “work” half as much now and make like 4x the money and have so much more free time. Same story with my wife. Yeah it would have been nice to not need a job in school but this is pretty nice too.
2966,"Yes! Like you I tried hard in college. Although I’m not done with school, my internship was significantly easier than school because I had a work-life balance. In college, the studying never stopped."
2967,"I feel this way now. The first year following college though, did not feel that way. 

The majority of feeling lost and confused post-grad is often just due to the dramatic change in daily schedule/structure of life. 

But after a year or so and adjusting to the new schedule, I’ll take my life now over college days any day"
2968,"You're definitely not alone, it just happens to be the majority of this subreddit feels the opposite. This is probably because majority is still having a tough time finding work in their interests. However once you've kinda gotten yourself financially stable, life is much better. You don't have to worth about the studying, the finals and the ever anxiety of getting a job before graduation. Being to afford things and not having to worry about small things is probably the greatest thing that comes with graduating. Once you graduate you get to enjoy the smaller things in life, its pretty great."
2969,"Yes and no...college was very hard for me and contributed a lot to my depression. I did fine academically but I was socially inept and always exhausted and stressed from doing just the bare minimum. I feel so much better about my life in a number of ways since graduating. I do feel a sense of freedom. 

But the thing is, I’m having such a hard time finding a job since graduation. I only just graduated in May so I can’t complain too much, but it’s hard to watch everyone around me have a job so quickly after school (I’m not even trying to get a job related to my degree necessarily, just _a_ job). I feel like a deadbeat piece of shit. I worry for the future. Although I realize this is a thinking trap, I can’t help thinking that the future doesn’t look so bright if I can’t even get a minimum wage job. My degree feels useless and I feel like I’ve been duped by the system (I would probably feel this even if I got my dream job the day after graduation, I guess I’m just that angry about my college experience). Every few weeks the existential crises get really scary. 

The funny part is that, the summer before my senior year, I got a job so easily, loved it, and didn’t want to leave. But I had to because it was on one side of the country and my school was on the other. And I stayed in the city where my school is located after graduation. But I do remember how I loved the feeling of going to work and not having to worry about school in addition. Hopefully I will have that feeling again soon. Until then I will continue to genuinely feel like the laziest scum of the earth, even though I’m trying so hard. 

Even with these shitty feelings about being unemployed, I actually have been able to appreciate my life much more since graduation. The amount of time I have to read self help books has probably contributed to that. My _life_ isn’t shitty at the moment, _I’m_ shitty at the moment, and working on changing that."
2970,"Yep, struggled the whole way through. 

Now I’m in an 8-5 salary job making a lot more than I thought I would at this point. I can read for pleasure now, don’t remember the last time I was able to do that. Best part is once I get home I don’t have to think about work, whereas classes were always on my mind in college."
2971,Me except I never partied much in life
2972,I hope I feel the same way. I already feel this way during the summer when I’m not in school and just working.
2973,"College was hard for me, but after school has been harder."
2974,"Hey dude, just out of curiosity what's your major and state you live in? Guarantee you aren't posting this from somewhere like New York or California"
2975,"It sounds like you've gotten a job that you somewhat enjoy and that respects your time off. Many posters who post here with dissatisfaction either have a job that pays little, is boring, or has toxic employers (or all three)."
2976,Lol I wish.
2977,"I think this is true for most people. But for me it's /r/AbsolutelyNotmeirl.

Most people who are struggling come here for support. You guys don't really need this sub."
2978,"Yes. Sometimes if you know an officer or see them every day, they will tell you not to salute them as it becomes kind of a nuisance."
2979,"So I’m not in the military, but do you ever really need to *tell* someone to salute you?"
2980,"I feel you, I mean there are two levels in my opinion. 

1. Can be that the person is just letting that promotion get to their heads, which isn't right.

2. If you do get a promotion, there often times comes a large amount of responsibility with balancing regular life and the job. The person will want to do their best at that and will drop the ball in other things like hanging out with friends. This will make it to where the friends feel underappreciated but if you're a good friend you'll allow for them to find that balance and slowly return to normal once everything settles down. This is for when you get that boost hopefully the friend now in the other side will do the same for you.

I'm going through 2 myself haha. And I hope my friends understand."
2981,[deleted]
2982,"I think this is more prevalent in College and early out of College. I went to a business school and even during school there were people who acted snobby if they landed a certain type of finance internships, generally front office roles like Investment Banking or Sales & Trading etc. 

After we graduated, it was less of an issue. Once our friend group and our network of colleagues all got jobs, it didn't matter too much what how prestigious the job or firm was anymore. Everyone went at their own pace at climbing the corporate ladder and their careers."
2983,"College puts everyone on the same playing field. We're all not working in our ""career"" position yet, going to the same school, maybe in the same major, so people start to think that their cohort is all in the same place in the world. But really all college does is put a temporary pause on the reality that some people are connected as fuck and will have no trouble landing that job at their dad/uncle/family friend's company."
2984,Oooh please do share the story. Did the CO destroy him or did the CSM take care of it himself?
2985,"If you’re feeling a little alone, I’d definitely recommend picking up a new hobby or activity to do to keep your free time fun and busy. I live in a city with a ton of fun cafes, so I made a point to try to visit a lot of them and explore the different districts when I first moved. This gave me something to do, and made for a really good topic to discuss when I met new people (they’d either recommend places for me to visit, or would ask for recommendations, and conversation usually flowed from there).

Your friends may be busy getting acclimated to working life. It’s tricky, but if you’re patient, some of them may come around, and there’s nothing wrong with making more friends in the mean time."
2986,"I'm not a high school guidance counselor, but I think the 101 here is that when kids act ""too cool"", they're compensating for their own percieved inadequacies."
2987,Unable to change original post :-/ maybe mods can help
2988,Too but yes
2989,"People like this are probably compensating for something. If you're truly confident you don't have to flex on people. Real successful people don't have to show you anything and they don't want to, they're humble. I wouldn't think twice about anybody who thinks they're better than you."
2990,"Jokes on you, I have no friends"
2991,You're a dick.
2992,Dunno.
2993,LT outranks the CSM though (not defending LT js...)
2994,I mean mine.. it’s what I’m here for!
2995,Username checks out?
2996,"Just a heads up, it should be “too cool” instead of “to cool.” Also you should try correcting the grammar of these people who think they’re too cool as a power move"
2997,"I felt the same last year during the months following graduation. I do miss my friends who were down the hall; now they’re multiple states away. Going to a corporate environment from college was a shock, and though it got easier socializing just isn’t the same. When I go out now I have to plan in advance, and most times I don’t have anyone to hangout with so I go into doing things with my family or my solo hobbies."
2998,"Man this musical was really embarrassing to go to with my parents when I was 13.

Puppet BJ scene lol"
2999,"man, my parents took me to see this when i was 12

don't think they realised just how inappropriate it was

and it's what introduced me to the word ""porn"""
3000,I’m a senior in college right now and I graduate in May. I already miss it.
3001,I went with my mom on my 20th birthday and it was still pretty damn awkward.
3002,Im still in college i changed my major 3 years in and finally started passing exams and everyone is youngrr than me but you gotta do what you gotta do
3003,Lol I don’t believe what you say and I’m in college.
3004,"Man, I miss college every single day. Life is so full of possibilities. You're constantly learning new this every day. You're having fun doing extra circulars like clubs and projects. I'm really happy to say I took full advantage of college and stayed an extra year for a minor. But man I would have 100% stayed longer if I could have afforded it."
3005,"Yup. Even if it took 6 years to get the really hard (marketable degree), it pays off for decades later."
3006,Ahah this reminds me that I still need to watch this
3007,"Man, I need to re-listen to this musical...this hit hard lol"
3008,"I think what your looking for is called ""grad school"""
3009,I absolutely believe what you say and I’m in college and that scares the hell out of me.
3010,"Oh I plan on grad school, but I do wish I’d taken better advantage of college at the time."
3011,"I thought this way too. I hated college when I was in it. Now I'm out and making better money and I fucking hate it. I'm surrounded by older people who aren't working to better themselves like all of my peers were in college. Not to mention the lack of freedom since you work practically every day.

It's a trap. Enjoy it while you can."
3012,I will keep your words of wisdom in mind.
3013,"The ""I wish I'd have taken more pictures"" line...DAMN that one hit home. I miss college"
3014,"Yes exactly! I feel so unqualified, like I am wasting people’s time just being there. I don’t even know where to start honestly."
3015,"Oh my goodness, I feel the exact same way! first thing I have to say is you are not alone. I just graduated with my bachelors in psychology, and I have no mental health experience whatsoever. I’ve worked in day care‘s for the last five years and I have this really bad fear and anxiety of working in a field that I have no idea about. If you happen to have some money in your savings, continue to apply for jobs while you are still in your job that is not in your field. I guarantee that the job you’re going for/applying to will train you to your core lol and you’ll learn it inside and out. 

If you have really bad anxiety about whether or not you will be able to work your new job, at the job interview make sure to ask if they are going to train you, when you get interviewed for the new job and also interview the job itself. I think you will do amazing, and take it one day at a time.

I also have to add, that if you were smart enough to attend all your classes and graduate with a degree,you are deserving of a better job environment . School is a major accomplishment that is downplayed because so many people have degrees nowadays, if you were able to make it this far and the job requires the degree that you have, then you are more than qualified."
3016,You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
3017,"I am working for an unpaid internship that *might* lead to employment. The fear of putting so much to impress the employer but at the same time the fear of the uncertainty certainly stagnates me from time to time. Nonetheless, I try to work SMART, not work HARD."
3018,"It’s ok to feel like that. Someone once told me that you’re not wasting anyone’s time by doing these interviews, the only person you’re wasting time is your own if you keep procrastinating. Life is meant to take risks, so go for it! You’ll eventually find an employer who’ll want to hire you!"
3019,"This is imposter syndrome. I totally get it - I’ve been there.

I’m leading a small team at work for the first time and now I’m starting to see it from the other side, where the people I supervise feel the same way I did/still do if I’m being honest. But the truth of it is, I don’t think of them as wasting my time. I don’t feel like they should have shown up knowing how to do this job or knowing more than they do. It’s my job to teach them and guide them and support them — I don’t resent that at all.

Honestly, I still feel this way a lot. Sometimes I’ll be in a meeting where I’m the most junior person in the room and I feel like a complete idiot and like I should know more than I do. Sometimes I’ll go to my own manager with questions and feel like I should have just figured it out on my own. Sometimes I’ll be with my own team and I’ll think that they can tell that I don’t have a clue what I’m doing.

The truth is, we’re all still learning how to be better. What you’re describing is a feeling and it’s important. But don’t make it more than that."
3020,— michael scott
3021,"I do feel this. I've been fighting through it, not letting it cripple me, but it has been enough to lower my productivity. The hours and effort I was putting into school before graduation hasn't matched those I've put into my job search. 

I think the important thing is to stay conscious of your progress and not let yourself have ""zero days."" Inching forward is the way to not let mental health issues derail you so completely that your life stops."
3022,"You’ve described the past year for me in that post very well. I have a bachelor’s in Physical Oceanography. I was too crippled by burnout and frustration at the end of school to complete my math minors. I got a job waitressing because it’s easy and I’m good at it and make plenty of money. It gave me so much time to think that I drove myself in circles, cycling through waves of intense fear that I’m wasting my mind away, so I sit down to apply for jobs in my field but, what’s the point? Will they really be better than what I’m doing now? Someone’s better and more qualified anyway. I try to apply for jobs that’ll pay less than what I make now. I’d have to move across the country for some of them. Hours and hours spent feeling like absolute shit about myself, knowing I won’t get a call back. Wondering if I even want a call back, at least right now I get enough sleep and live my life still relatively free from the commitment that a professional career seems to be. 

Take time to sit with your thoughts. The fact that you’re not working in your field means you have time to think about yourself, who you are, what you see yourself doing with your life. I mean with brutal honesty. For me, a lot of my time has been spent reconnecting with old hobbies. I’ve always liked hiking, so I hike. I set a goal for myself to be strong, so my body can carry me everywhere I want to go, so I can enjoy the experience, and so I can feel the joy of reaching where it was I was venturing off to. Experiencing improvement and progression is healing if you’re feeling afraid, and as a result, crippled. 

I started to realize I’d be happy if I could actually be aboard the ships that collect the scientific data I studied. Seeing the world and expanding my knowledge. Feeling alive because of the work I’m doing, because I’m connected to the earth and solving problems using techniques that I’m good at. Find in yourself what things make you feel alive, and look for those in your prospective jobs. Fear, to me, seems to stem from a lack of understanding. When you know why it is that you want a particular job, you won’t be afraid because you’ll know deep within yourself that it aligns with who you are. You might then feel frustrated, because it’s hard applying for jobs right out of school. Frustration might guide you towards improving the things you think you need to get better at for that job you really want. 

These things take time, which I think is the worst part. It takes a long time to get to know yourself in the real world, and what’s important to you, and what your dreams are, and how you’d rather spend your time every day. It takes daily consideration, for months and months, in many different moods and seasons and settings. You’re thinking about what you’re feeling, which is important. Just don’t give up. It’s ok not to have all the answers right now, and giving yourself the time you need to learn and grow and direct yourself in the right professional direction is not a crime. You will be better for it. Jobs will always be there. When you know where to look, you’ll do everything it takes to get to get what you want, with incredible focus."

3026,"I felt the same way when I finished all my classes and graduated!! It was an awful feeling forcing myself to go for interviews because I had such a hard time 'selling myself'. I felt like I didn't know anything and that no one in their right mind would want me to work for them. I still feel that way sometimes...   


In the end, I just set a target to apply for at least 20 jobs a day and see what I'd get and took any interview as practice. It got easier. While I was working at my first job, I applied more selectively. It was tiring to work and go for interviews but in the end it was worth it... 

I'm still feeling quite anxious and fearful though. I don't know if the feeling ever truly goes away."
3027,"That was so helpful and kind, thank you for the advice. I will definitely be sure to ask about the training part during an interview, didn’t even think of that!"
3028,"I feel that for sure! I get so much anxiety thinking of where I’m supposed to be and life and what I’m going to do. I feel pressure on moving out of the house, how I’m going to afford everything, and if I’m at the right pace.

I have to trust the process, it’s a constant reminder you have to tell yourself. Everyone’s on their different timeline and it’ll come into place eventually. I like to think that there’s a lot of others thinking the same thing and I’m not alone in it."
3029,"I graduated in 2005.  Its always scary when you are in a transitional period, even between jobs.

3030,"My issue is that now I’m responsible for a bunch of bills (rent, car, insurance, etc) and if I lose my job I’d be fucked within a couple of months."
3031,That was so helpful and calming to read. Thank you for your advice.

3035,"You're not alone in thinking this, everyone always has doubts in their mind if whether or not they're enough. I recently started working and there's a feeling of helplessness that just stays with me because I don't know the process or I can't resolve an issue etc. The best you can do is to just keep learning and improvise whenever something unexpected comes your way. We're in this together :)"
3036,"It's not just work. It's figuring out what you want to do, where you want to live, saving money. getting married, having kids, buying a house, etc. You're feeling the pressure of societies expectations and putting it all together."
3037,"I've been searching for a job for 5 months post graduation and my advise is to get over the fear as quickly as you can. You're not going to get a job right away, you're going to get rejections, you're going to get ghosted by companies, and you're going to fuck up interviews. That's just all part of the process. It'll happen, it'll suck, but you will move past it and get a job. If it's not your ideal job, work it and get the skills you need to get your ideal job.

Keep moving forward."
3038,"Yes. However, fear only holds you back. Imagine how far you could go if you had no fear of failure. Imagine walking into a huge project within your field with absolutely no fear. You would perform amazingly well and have the confidence to know it. Fear only keeps you from your full potential

Edit: that is not to say you won’t fail or make mistakes. You probably will make many mistakes, but having no fear means bouncing back despite you may not know exactly what you are doing/are not a master yet"
3039,"I'm going through a really rough patch right now, and my current job is great but the people I work for are toxic and driving me insane. I've been paranoid about quitting before I find THE JOB for me since it'll look bad on my CV (third job in a year), and I need a source of income. This helped calm me down so much, thank you!"
3040,Well said. I can relate to what you write.
3041,Wait until you feel responsibility it’s gon stretch ya out
3042,"This guy has a good idea if you have a solid relationship with your parents. 

I graduated in May of 2018. Moved to a new high COL city earning a salary I could have earned living at home, while loosing 2k+ a month in living expenses.

After a year I moved back, and now I’ll be saving around 40k a year. Money in the bank account. Going to ski the alps next year, all while saving for law school. Meanwhile I have friends who moved to NYC who are now poorer than when they lived at home earning minimum wage part time. 

I wish I would have started doing this since I graduated.

Granted, my parents do have one reasonable rule- I can’t live at home not paying rent and show up with a brand new Porsche. That’s a rule I can get behind."
3043,"I ultimately went straight into masters after undergrad, much at the behest of my parents, who said if I took a break I wouldn't want to go back to school. I did do that (it helped I was fortunate enough to have no debt for undergrad through scholarships), and ultimately graduated last spring with my masters. Having all the free time is pretty overwhelming, but I ultimately took a couple months off between finishing my degree and starting work to go home to NYC, and then do some traveling around the US. 

I definitely would say you should spend any downtime you have traveling, since you're not going to get another large chunk of time like this for a while, save after your masters or when you're in between jobs. The other thing about traveling, and I'm not sure it applies to you, is that if you are going to a new city or moving out, it's nice to get an apartment a bit in advanced of your travels (and work) to get acclimated to your new environment. While it might not be possible for everyone, I picked up my lease a month before starting work, stayed at the place a week to get myself settled down and acclimated to my new home, and then went traveling. It was nice being able to go to work and not worry about getting furniture, food, etc., plus it definitely eased any homesickness and confusion, already having spent a bit of time in my new place and knowing where everything is and just coming back from my travels feeling like where I'm going back to has been lived in."
3044,"Congrats! As much of a relief as it is to finally finish undergrad, I hate to say that it’s time to get your act together and get a decent paying job ASAP.

A lot of grads will think that they have all of the time in the world to get a “real job,” but the student loan collectors will come knocking sooner rather than later. I recommend getting a head start on repaying your debt quickly.

I do not know the field you’re getting into, or the area you’re in, but the job market is competitive overall. Good luck and be fairly aggressive with your job search!"
3045,you got this!! i’m rooting for you ❤️
3046,"Felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders since I struggled a lot in school. It also felt weird. School was all I had known my whole life basically and then once I was finished it was like “ well that wasn’t so bad was it? “ 

Be proud of yourself. You’ll see how many people DON’T have a degree and it’ll make you feel more confident. 

Also, save up money, try to find a job in the mean time doing anything really. Just to get some work experience and keep you occupied otherwise you’ll lose your mind with all the free time you have and no money. Plus, girls like guys with their degree and a job."
3047,"I was thinking of traveling after I walk the stage in May, finds are too tight to even go somewhere for the weekend lol. but thank you!"
3048,"That's completely understandable. When I went, I was doing the hostel thing or finding friends and relatives in different cities I can stay with. Unfortunately a lot of us are torn between money versus having the time while we're young and have few commitments to actually do these things. If nothing else, maybe try bugging some of your friends to do a road trip to split costs- I know my girlfriend did that when she finished her bachelors degree. There are definitely some experiences where I'm like, ""I'm not going to have time to this later, so I'll tolerate digging into my savings a bit for it."" That and if you want to travel, definitely don't be too proud to ask your parents to help like some of my friends were. When my dad heard about my plans and that I was keeping quiet about it because I was trying to be an ""adult"" and as self sufficient as possible, he said ""you're a young guy and should be doing this stuff, and I know you make responsible decisions and were diligent about keeping schooling costs down. If you want to go anywhere on a family trip, or me to spot you some cash for a weekend trip, it's the least I can do for you."" I've been very fortunate in having a supportive dad, and I can't deny I lucked out immensely when it came to the scholarships. Definitely food for thought though- you only get to be in your 20s once in life."
3049,I went on to gead school. I had just sobered up a year before graduation and started figuring my next stsge in life. I moved from the Midwest to New England. It turned out very well
3050,Always appreciated 💖
3051,"When I graduated, it took me almost half a year to get a decent job, and I wish I had taken smaller jobs sooner. IF you don't have a plan for what you want to do, take smaller jobs to build up resources, and when you figure out your next step, maybe start taking jobs that will help you with that next step."
3052,It never HITS you. Don’t wait for it to hit you. Plan for the future and start taking steps that you know are possible.
3053,"I agree. Since I’ve started working full time after college, I’ve become very good at Linux (/r/Linux), and I’ve created a Plex server for my friends (/r/plex), on my home server (/r/homeserver), which I remote into using a VPN on a RasPi (/r/raspberrypi), and getting some IT certifications to make me more employable (/r/CompTIA) 

I love getting off work now cuz I have a google docs ToDo list that I made that I add to for stuff to work on when I get home. Makes work more fun cuz I get to look forward to these things and makes home life better because I don’t burn entire evenings on /r/pics or The Office."
3054,"Along with the hobby recommendations, I’d also suggest using your newly found free time to pursue side projects/adult things that you didn’t have the chance to learn before. Im assuming you’re in your 20s being out of college/uni so it’s a good time to start investing/future financial planning or adopt some healthy habits you want to have in life (being active, eating healthy, good social life etc.). These things are hard to set up but pay a lot of dividends later on. It can also be difficult and gruelling being consistent at these things so if you treat it like an assignment (while you have that mindset still left over from your study days) it’ll be easier for you to accomplish them in the early days and for it to become second nature to you later on."
3055,"Sounds like a great problem to have. Extra free time that can now be filled with hobbies instead of homework. See friends or you can now find an activity and if you’re missing learning, you can now learn or read up on whatever you’d like"
3056,"This 100% after college I started to fill my free time learning technical skills primarily around programming and now I use both my degree and coding at work. 

Now that you’re done with school you know should have a good idea of how you learn. So go out there and learn what you’re interested in regardless of the subject matter."
3057,"Yep this. The #1 thing I was looking forward to after college/not having homework was time to actually go to the gym, do my laundry, cook more extravagant meals, and generally get my shit together as far as my daily life and routine goes rather than scrambling in the 5 minutes of free time before the next assignment or activity. Also I have been hanging out with my grandparents and other extended family more often! It’s great."

3059,"pursue hobby, learn to cook, organize your house, take care of your health (cause when you get older this is becoming more important), vacation somewhere, read a book, watch the news

you're a person more than just homework and grades"
3060,Over a decade of homework indoctrination will get the best of us!
3061,"Concur with all the hobby comments. I have several homework like hobbies... like researching historical events (selected history class? Haha), language studies (become bi/tri-lingual?), and things like that. These things fulfill my itch to keep learning in an academia like fashion... I’ve been considering law school as well and have found myself really enjoying the logic games and getting better at them"

3063,Still in uni but Linux changed the way I use my computer. I really recommend it to anybody. later today I might even pull the trigger and switch to archbtw

3065,"I understand you. I have this giant gaping hole in me that I want to fill. I call it my god hole. Most people on this world try to fill it with religion but you see I don’t believe in god so I have to fill it with something. Money, illusion of power, puss..."

3068,As a student myself I honestly can’t wait to be in your position!
3069,"To OP and anyone reading this: this is the ideal time to start seriously working out or playing a sport. You’re young, fit and have free time. Already do that? Good, then just go harder and make amazing gains. Easy new hobby and you can start from literally any point with tons of support, whether you’re out of shape or whatever."
3070,"You miss homework? I have your answer! Grad school! Even just part time and you will get that back. Otherwise, maybe consider tutoring kids to help them with their homework"
3071,Start your side hustle/biz!!
3072,"I’m learning french on this app called busuu and its kind of like hw because i took french in school.

I’m also writing.  

But maybe your life is about to get way more fun because you can find stuff you enjoy and enrich your life."
3073,"Looks like you need hobbies. You could learn to cook fancy stuff, make homebrew beer, learn a language, read, hang out with friends. You’ve got the luxury of real free time now, you can do all kinds of things with that."
3074,"Start learning a language! It’s a lot of fun, a lot of work, and it’ll really broaden your horizons.

I learned a language and I found it to be very rewarding."
3075,This is so relatable. I always get the same feeling in the summer between semesters. I just **need** school to keep my mind busy.
3076,You said financial services? I hear that studying for the CFA can take up a good chunk of time :)
3077,"You need help. Go online and learn some cool shit. Find a hobby, start a small business and invest the money."
3078,"The gym is a good way to keep busy once you’re done, that’s what I’ve been doing homie"
3079,"I totally understand. Thats what I feel like on break 

Read some stuff. Play some video games. Do chores, maybe workout. There are endless possibilities"
3080,Care to share your ToDo list? In need of some ideas + would love to learn some computer / coding / IT type stuff
3081,"I work in IT so some of my stuff is a little advanced but here are some things I did earlier that are definitely accessible for fresher people, but are still challenging and actually useful. 

* Get a RasPi, make a DNS Pi-Hole network-wide ad blocker. Works better than any chrome extension. Tons of YouTube videos and resources 

* Get a RasPi and make a RetroPie video game emulator. Mine is in a little N64-style case I got from Etsy. Can play any game from Gameboy, GBA, N64, SNES, NES, etc. 

* build a RedditBot in Python and host it on a Raspberry Pi or an old PC. Mine just parses all comments from the top 10 posts on 1 particular sub, and then responds to any comment that has a certain word. This is a very easy python coding project and there are lots of resources online. 

* get an old desktop computer and install Linux on it and create a Minecraft server. You need the Minecraft Java edition ($26) to play it though 

* on that old desktop, install Plex and host some videos 

* find an open-source project on github and contribute with testing.  Software Testing is easier to learn and contribute with and still extremely useful. 

* Learn Bash scripting or Powershell scripting to automate updates for your PC. 

* Study for the A+ certification and then build your own computer with that knowledge. 

these are all things I’ve done already and I only suggest them because there are literally thousands of hours of YouTube tutorials for each one. I know RasPis can be a bit of a meme in the tech community but they are so popular that there isn’t a single issue that you could run into that doesn’t have 1000 forum threads about the same thing happening to someone else. And the new version, the Raspberry Pi 4, just came out yesterday and it looks great. 4K 60 FPS dual monitors with its own dedicated NIC. $35 for one of these and you can buy cases off of eBay (although I just have a cute little mini-rack for three of them stacked on top of each other.)"
3082,set some new goals and work towards them! they can be hobby oriented like others have said but it could be something that you’ve wanted to change in yourself or your surroundings
3083,"Same sentiment when I left. I love love love my college times and everything about it, but I also understood that I needed to move on and grow. I wasn’t ready for the next chapter but I was hopeful."
3084,"With mobile they are...though it is a bit taboo on reddit. Not generally well received (nothing against OP, though. Good for them!)"
3085,🍆 😮
3086,"Life after college is just as good as life in college, ignore all of the people who say it sucks, they aren't doing anything about it. It's hard, but it's worth it, and also the college life gets really old quickly, your final semester, you are ready to leave campus and move on from it."
3087,Sadly they are very compatible...
3088,"This gives me hope lol! I have one more semester after this, and it’s been freaking me out. The idea of not being in school anymore scares me a lot. Especially cause it’s been such a big part of my life for so long. But I gotta remind myself its all part of a process, and it’s not necessarily a bad thing!"
3089,"Yeah I know exactly what you mean, I had the exact same emotions in my final year. By fourth year you have done it all - taken all the interesting classes in your program, participated in all your schools traditions, too many parties to count, been to all the bars in town 100 times and it all starts to get old. It's time to become an adult and welcome in the next chapter of your life."
3090,I feel like it’s different after you physically leave. I think I felt the same way when I started my senior year and I was rushing to get through school but now I wish I had taken the time to really enjoy the moment and realize this was the only time that my life would be like this
3091,"I was the same way. Just leaving that lifelong routine so suddenly is weird, and I know that’s going to probably be a bitch for someone like me to get over. At the same time, I’m excited as hell"
3092,"Yeah that’s become my daily goal, to enjoy every moment because December is right there. I know I’ll be looking back wishing I took in my whole college experience more"
3093,"I went to a pseudo high school reunion (big bar crawl in my town the thursday before thanksgiving), I am 2 years out of college, there were kids from my high school that were currently in college, kids who graduated 2 years before me, everyone in between.

The first two hours were just ""catching up"" with everyone, but in reality they're just trying to gauge by job title + accompanying 2 minute interaction to determine whether or not I'm more successful than them, adjusted for age.

I found myself doing it too. Some of my friend's and acquaintance's successes made me feel bad, and I'm sure mine made other people feel bad. It's a really shitty habit that we all find ourselves in."
3094,The book “12 Rules For Life” talks about this. Only compare yourself to who you were yesterday. It’s a fantastic book that everyone should read.
3095,"Sad but true

""It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society"""
3096,"When I stopped comparing myself to others, the best things in my life happened."
3097,I don't suspect I'll see a friend go to Europe for quite some time given recent events.
3098,Thanks bud
3099,"True things said. It's a blackpilled fact, someone out there will have a better life than you have, but you also have to know too that you shouldn't be ungrateful about your current life, because someone out there is looking at your life wishing they had the things you have, for example the minimum wage worker and the lowly payed blue collar worker, would kill and love to have a salaried 9-5 desk job, a working reliable car, and a decent place to stay, or the person who's unemployed would love to have your job."
3100,"I’m going to reiterate what others have said... I’m one of those people on social media who have one of those “lives”

I travel (I have a plane and a pilots license), make a lot of money, have a lot of free time, and I look decent lol.
On my story is a different location, a different club, a different country every time...

And trust me when I tell you Instagram is just a HIGHLIGHT REEL. Nothing more nothing less.

There is so much crap and annoying things that go on between the scenes. Nobody sees when Im upset or when I’m praying to God to fix a situation. Nobody sees the deaths in my family. Nobody sees when things go south.

People who are truly happy don’t use Instagram."
3101,Well said.
3102,Deleting the socials is really the only true answer. Social media exist solely for putting youself on a pedestal to show off to your friends. The memes you can get elsewhere
3103,"Some people had life get in the way and couldnt even finish school. Like me.

I dont look and get upset though, just mentioning some people wish they could just go and get the degree they spent almost two decades working towards, but theyre stuck in the work grind."
3104,Thanks man
3105,you dont lose is you are not the best. you win when you graduate.
3106,I’m still in it with insta but I completely feel you. Although for me Instagram can serve a function outside of putting yourself on a pedestal. For example there is a thriving webcomic scene on insta making it the best platform to keep up with my favorite cartoonists. Necessary? Absolutely not. But kinda nice 👍🏻
3107,Because school is dunzo for the foreseeable future
3108,I'm 15
3109,What are you doing on this subreddit?
3110,Can’t argue with that logic
3111,"This is a hard step for a lot of folks first coming out of school and entering the workforce. Assuming you're referring to college being closed due to COVID, but this does give a taste for what it'll be like, albeit a harsh one. In both cases though, work or COVID, we're as social as we force ourselves to be. Nothing stopping you from picking up the phone and texting/calling a friend, nor in the real world from organizing a get together or joining a group. It's just important to put in the effort- you really get what you put in when it comes to your social life outside of school"
3112,"When school is over, that social life will happen (mostly) at your job. That's why choosing a good workplace environment is key to a happy life."
3113,"Very true, but it's also not a bad thing, it's good to have quality over quanity of people. Tbh there are people from my college that i could care less if i ever see them again in my lifetime."
3114,It’s my senior year. Wasn’t ready and still not ready. And now this happened. Ik how you’re feeling
3115,"University is also a good place to make some friends / people you can hang out with. 
Here in Berlin it’s also a lot about Meetups where you can connect as well as other activities which offers you some social life if you want to."
3116,"In my lab we do some really weirdly specific work that most people have no experience in, it's also a large company. The only ""real"" path into our team is through an agency position. Then when direct positions open up we are required to post them ""for the public"" for a certain period of time even though the job is really already spoken for by one of our agency staff. The posting is literally designed for a certain person to apply. Outside candidates are not even considered, the posting is entirely a formality. 

This is basically how every large company operates. Every job you see either requires a very specialized skill set or more than likely is spoken for by someone the hiring manager knows. Don't get yourself down when these positions don't work out, it's not because you're a bad candidate, it's because they're more than likely not even looking at outside candidates.

Large companies love to staff their offices with agency people. It allows them to lower headcount and cut costs without technically ""firing"" anybody. And it also gives them potentially years to evaluate candidates for direct positions. You would have to be an absolute rock star to come in off the street and get a direct position over all of the agency staff working under that manager, which does happen but is very uncommon.

If you really want to get into this team/building/company then try to figure out which staffing companies they use. All things considered it's never going to be as good as a direct position, but at least agency recruiters respond if you contact them on LinkedIn or apply to their job board posts, even if they only want you as a backup in case someone quits or headcount goes up."
3117,Yup. I mass apply now rather than focus my energy on one application.
3118,Try to find someone who works there in hiring through LinkedIn as well
3119,"Ya know you’re not the first person I’ve heard this from, sad reality tbh."
3120,How do you figure OP picked a bad major?
3121,If anything it’s sad the state’s laws require these postings before just promoting from within.
3122,[deleted]
3123,"Honestly, if you’re still up for it keep applying for that job whenever it’s posted!! I applied for my job each of the three times it was posted - after I was hired, no one remembered that I’d applied before because the university I work for gets a huge number of applicants for each position.

I found out later that the first time I was rejected because they had a better applicant who backed out at the last second (they were probably using the offer as leverage for negotiation at a better job, it sounds like.) The second time I was rejected was because funding for the position was cut after it had already been posted but before interviews started. The third time I was hired.

tl;dr There may be reasons why you aren’t getting through that are outside of the info you’re getting - don’t assume it’s that you’re not good enough!

And I’d second the comments on here suggesting reaching out to the company’s HR dept or whoever has their contact info attached to the job posting. Be respectful and kind and open, explain that you’re passionate about this job and you’d like to improve whatever is holding you back from it. They might not be able to tell you anything specific, but if you can make a good impression (and especially if you can actually meet someone there), they might be able to help as you move forward!"
3124,I feel you. I truly get this. I'm so mad i don't even know who to be mad at. All i know is i am and right now everything kinda sucks.
3125,"Fake job listings.

Companies do it for a variety of reasons, especially if listing is free or cheap.

It makes it look like your company is doing well because you need more people to handle all that extra work you've got.

Managers who get a higher level and can have 7 employees isntead of 5 now can put out 2 more listings, never hire anyone and put the extra budget into other stuff, mostly their own pockets.

It's free advertisement if it's cheap or free to list."
3126,If this place is so close to your house you should walk in and request an appointment with the supervisor or hiring manager of the position. This will go much further than sending in another application.
3127,"Don't get discouraged. Keep applying everywhere you can. Are you located in a highly competitive job market? I got a really great job right out of college, but I'm in an area where jobs are plentiful. It's not exactly what I wanted to do, but gaining the experience will get me where I want to be. Biggest thing is keeping your head up, and staying persistent."
3128,"And on top of that the contract houses use a shitload of people here on a work visa. Making it impossible to actually demand fair pay. My first engineering job out of school was 53k which was around 15k higher than most of my Indian or Chinese coworkers. As soon as I went direct it bumped up by more than 30k. Agencies suck, but they do open doors."
3129,"Well the thing is it's not really a ""promotion from within"" it's still a new hire so you need to give everyone an equal opportunity to apply. Also consider that the agencies themselves don't really like having their people poached so even if it weren't the law companies would still likely do this just to give the illusion of fairness when it comes to stealing the best employees from agencies."
3130,"Exactly, can’t really blame them, I’ve put in 45 applications (on my last semester, senior year) and I’ve literally had two of them call back. TWO. Just decided to give up until I actually graduate, landed a decent retail job that works with my schedule so that’s all I can hope for atm. Eh what can ya do."
3131,This would gel with the 94% of new work being contract statistic. Mind-blowing and really messed up
3132,So? I heard the same story from engineers and other STEM majors. People who graduated with good GPAs too.
3133,"it’s better to make friends with like 1-3 people that can actually get you a job than it is to collect 200 business cards you’ll never talk to again. People think networking needs to be this super extroverted activity, but for me it was just having lunch with the same few people every day and discussing random shit, which eventually turned into working on projects together, which eventually led to a direct position."
3134,"For those that have been suggesting it, yes I have tried reaching out to both HR and a recruiter there. Never got a response. Only phone number I could find was a generic office number, which lead to a receptionist giving a very tired ""We'll reach out to you if we are interested"" answer. I even tried to visit the office in person, my parents own a flower shop so I went down there at the beginning of December to drop off a poinsettia plant along with my resume and cover letter. It was actually a secure building and I got lucky because an employee thought I was a delivery guy and held the door for me. The receptionist thought the plant was really sweet but then her expression and tone immediately changed when I handed her my resume and cover letter.

Some have mentioned that I should keep applying for the job any chance I get, so I wanted to ask about that. So, the company has its job portal website where people look at postings and apply. The first time I applied my application was forever ""under review"", and I would keep checking up on it to see if it ever updated. Until one day, my entire account on the job portal website was deleted, which I thought was kind of odd. I didn't think much of it so I made another account and applied again. This time though they actually reviewed and rejected me within a couple days of applying. They never sent me an email, I didn't find out until a week later when I checked up on it after dropping off the poinsettia plant. Since then, my application still shows up as ""reviewed rejected"", and it won't let me reapply for the same job. I'm guessing my only way around this would be to create a whole new account, but I'm not sure if that is advisable."
3135,"Dude, you pulled a very little league move dropping off flowers and your resume."
3136,Network with some people in the company so you can get a referral. Most resumes don't get seen by a real person
3137,"I don’t really have a good way of mapping the agencies to their customers, most of the time they’re even weird about disclosing it during interviews. I would check out Ladders though, it’s like a job board for positions that require a fair amount of experience. I’ve also had good luck with job boards hosted by professional societies."
3138,You have heard the minority. Ofc there will be exceptions.
3139,"Send your CV in with some gifts like a nice box of biscuits. Or better yet, hand deliver the baked goods with your CV. 

For whatever reason your cv isn’t getting the attention it deserves - being more personal and out of the box will set you aside from the many applicants they get. It’s no guarantee of a job but you will be more memorable and more likely to have your CV looked at."
3140,"Is there an email listed on the posting? At this point I’d email and basically say you’ve applied to this posting previously. Ask if there’s anything you can do to make ourself more marketable towards this particular position. Mention why you want to work at that company, specifically."
3141,If you tick all the boxes you are either doing something wrong in your application or else nepotism is screwing you.
3142,Yep.
3143,"Thank you for spelling it out this way.   

How can I learn what Agencies are common in the employment sector at mid-higher levels, that I'm applying for?    Google searches yield more entry-level Agencies, and I've worked with those, but they're not opening the doors I need.    

I see exactly what you're describing:   PERFECT positions that I'm qualified for, but receive no callbacks, and the listings disappear quickly.    It's Agency / Promoting From Within, and that's ok, but I am having trouble navigating this.   

How can I discover those boutique Agencies that are beyond entry-level / temp / admin positions?"
3144,"Yeah it's just human nature. Who are you going to hire, someone you've worked with for 1-3 years and know on a personal level, or someone you don't really know who seemed nice in a 45 minute interview?"
3145,"> most of the time they’re even weird about disclosing it during interviews.

I've definitely encountered this, and I've tried asking simpler agencies for higher level leads, or looking on Glassdoor, etc.   It's all so secretive!!!!!   

Thank you for the Ladders tip, that is a new resource for me.   Much appreciated."
3146,"I actually studied pre-vet and got into vet school but aborted mission last minute (graduated undergrad this past May). Every vet I’ve shadowed in undergrad told me not to do it, it’s a trap. 

Long story short, a lot of people want to be vets. A lot of people will do ANYTHING to be a vet. There are a very limited number of vet schools available. Because there are so many students who are willing to do anything to get in, admissions can be super competitive and they can make tuition insanely high, since the demand for those schools isn’t decreasing. 

Most careers with animals pay lower than with humans. Therefore, while MDs, or pharmacists or dentists etc make decent money post grad/ post grad training, vets maybe start out around 60-80k? If they’re lucky? When you’re looking at up to 300k-400k in loans (and that’s my instate school mind you) that doesn’t cut it unless your family is rich or you have a SO that can cover food, rent, etc. 

Also, as of recently, the distribution of males to females in vet med has skewed. As more females took on the profession, the pay stopped adjusting with the market. 

Suicide is a massive problem in the profession right now. The massive debt, inability to pay it off, and emotional toll of the profession is no joke. People assume bc vet visits are expensive, vets are rich and are robbing them. Vet med is only “more expensive than human medicine bc most people have health insurance for themselves, but not pet insurance. A lot of people pull  the “if you really loved animals you’d work for free!!!” card. When emotions are running high with someone who is loved by their human, and high amounts of money are involved, people get UGLY. This will emotionally mess with you over time, whether as a vet, vet tech, assistant, receptionist.

The profession needs a massive shift for it to be healthy. And it sucks, since these vets are critical for human health as well. 

Sorry for the rant lol. These circumstances took away my “dream job” so to speak. It hurts. But I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I hope long term it was the right decision."
3147,"Yes, unfortunately it’s pretty common for vets to go into really bad debt, like over $100k."
3148,"It’s a very strange thing. Vet school is as hard as med school. The practice is much harder (your patients try to bite you, and can’t tell you how they feel). And the money is lower. Maybe some industry jobs pay better—but I really don’t know.  

The American Medical Association can be greatly blamed for the absurd medical costs that Americans pay, but at least MDs are well-paid. This is a result mostly due to politics."
3149,"This is why I picked a trade. Cheaper, on-site training, and some places will pay for your classes. 

My work was a ma n pa printing company before the buy-out and they sent me from Nashville to Seattle to take some classes from HP about there digital presses..... now I’m certified by HP to be a tech and I’m considered a journeyman digital press operator, either job should get me paid 25$+ an hour and didn’t cost me a dime either.

3156,Student debt does not go away in bankruptcy.
3157,"I'm one of them. I assumed ""my major is computer science (coding). video game programmers make 55k out of college. so i'll take out ANY amount of debt, it's not great but hey there's no other way."" 
Little did I know, I wasn't the only person who dreamed of being a video game programmer. There are millions of kids who go to school for programming and want to be game coders. Companies like Blizzard and Sony hire like .01% of applicants, it's extremely competitive."
3158,"Because there are no good alternatives as they see it. And we’ve designed a system so that, really, that is more or less the case for anyone who doesn’t have $200k in cash just lying around to pay for school."
3159,The elite schools continuously rank at the top for return on investment.
3160,"Or you know, smart kids go to high achieving schools and get connected to a network of extremely successful alumni. It's a lot more complex and merit based than you're making it out to be. Plus it's not like that many of the kids at those schools really qualify as ""rich."""
3161,I wouldn’t say no big deal but yes a lot of people coming out of HS are money illiterate and aren’t fully aware of what they’re actually getting into
3162,"Except they are. If legacies were anywhere near a major part of those schools 1) I would have seen a lot more of them when I actually fucking went to one and 2) the academic performance of the incoming classes would be noticeably impacted. The number of people who earned their way to these schools is far, far larger than the number of people who are born into it. I graduated from one a few months ago after coming from a St. Louis public high school. I'm not making 6 figures, but I'm in that neighborhood and of all my friends (which includes zero legacies and maybe one 1%er) I have the second lowest salary. These schools set everyone who goes there up for success and that can be found in pretty much all of the post-graduation data that exists from them."
3163,"Beyond what everyone else has said here, some people just are not willing to give up on the idea of being happy in their careers, which is completely fair. I would rather be in debt than work in a job I hate. You spend such a large amount of time working, it better be something you enjoy. Money isn't everything, as long as you have enough to get by."
3164,"I can’t agree with this more. Learning a trade THEN going to school is such a smart way to go about it. You can work a valuable and decent paying side jobs while in school to help pay for life, and if you learn that whatever you choose to go to school for isn’t for you, you have something to fall back on."
3165,"Rich kids go to rich kid schools and get rich kid jobs, this isn't surprising"
3166,"I went to an expensive school, about 40k/y. Luckily I got a high paying job and am working everything off.

I have a friend that said they would declare bankruptcy after school in order for those debts to go away. I tried to explain to her that those actions are going to be on her record for a long, long time. Her credit will be ruined.

Nothing I said went through to her."
3167,"Vets don't seem to have that low of a salary over here in the UK. I suppose they have less debt to contend with too.

It's a shame, the job definitely isn't easy. For someone who truely wants to help animals the reality of it all must suck."
3168,Thank you for understanding
3169,"This is patently false. 

It seems you’re still under the delusion of “The American Dream.” The elites in our country go to Ivy League schools because their parents and grandparents went to Ivy League schools. 

Sure, a small number of people get into those schools though years of extreme dedication and unbelievable luck, but those aren’t the ones who graduate and immediately start making 6 figures on Wall Street."

3171,"That would be great for her to know, yikes"
3172,I think that's because the game industry pays low compared to the general tech industry.

3182,Make more money or live with your parents/roommates.
3183,Major caveat: it certainly depends on the relationship you have with your parents. Sometimes your relationship isn’t as rosy as you’d like and it’s okay to want to get away from that.
3184,Ya you can pretty much kiss dating goodbye. No girl wants to go home to your parents house. That's one aspect where my confidence is ruined.
3185,Honestly being two years out living on my own. I wish I had spent a little more time living at home. Being able to save the money otherwise spent on rent can be so much savings. So when you do finally move you’ll have actual options.
3186,"Just leave. The Bay Area is one of the most economically unequal regions in the US. “Very low income” in the Bay Area is considered below $73,000.

You’re either a millionaire in the making or dirt poor. There is virtually no middle class. The wealth divide makes it extremely difficult to make a living and pull yourself out of poverty. You need a bachelors in a STEM degree or a very marketable talent to break through that poverty line.

Renting an apartment in the Bay Area costs around 3 times as much as the national average. On top of that the taxes in California are also notoriously high.

Go somewhere else, it’s the right option. Find a small town *outside of California* and start your career. Maybe if you make bank you can go back but starting out in CA, especially the Bay Area, is economic suicide early in your career.

And trust me, there’s this belief that big cities have the best job opportunities, but that’s reserved for the upper middle class that can afford the living expense without sacrificing a large portion of their money. I’m in a location where the cost of living is approximately a fourth of what it is in the Bay Area. I’m working as an engineer making an average salary and living with my parents. Even if I was out on my own, I’d have plenty of money to thrive."

Everybody wants to live on the West Coast.  Therefor, it's expensive af to live here.  Also, it's difficult to start a career in a place where everyone wants to live, because employers can basically have the pick of the litter.   Living here is not the means to an end, its the end.  

If this is the end you want, move away to the best place that suits your career.  Get proficient.  Build a resume.  Come back when *you're* the pick of the litter."

3196,"Live with your parents.

1) set up boundaries with them. This is the single best thing I’ve done for myself and my mental health. This doesn’t mean sitting down with them for a Talk, this means changing your attitude and talking to them as an adult not as their child. This means figuring problems out on your own. They will get the message pretty quick.

2) save up money for a house if that is your gig. That’s what I’m doing. I don’t want to rent, I want my own place. It will take longer but be more satisfying. Save for your goal and feel empowered by your ability to do so.

3) get over it. Not “exciting” you is a silly reason to not do something. Do what is best for your future and, tbh, your mental health. Worrying about rent and roommates for the next few years isn’t worth it. Unless your parents are abusive or controlling, invest in your future."

Living alone is unaffordable in today's society.""

I took that advice and abused it. I still live at home. It's my dad's rules that they charge me rent... Been paying rent to them since I was about 17. It's not the best, but I've learned the value of money, budgeting, and what to expect when I'm on my own. Learn from your parents, absorb their advice even if it doesn't appeal to you, and then move out when you're ready."

3202,true. good point
3203,Move to a different city
3204,"Yeah I don’t get why so many people are so desperate to move out or see living with their parents as something shameful. Obvious this depends on your relationship with your parents, but if your family are decent people, then you should definitely 100% cherish your time with them."
3205,Ya you're right. It might suck but it gives you the opportunity to do things. There's pros and cons to both.
3206,">First thing, ""plans"" are just your best guess at what you hope happens next. They can be immediately annihilated with zero forewarning, zero consent, and zero rhyme or reason.

This is such a great point that so many people (probably most people) forget. A very tiny miniscule amount of people have been able to look back on their life and say ""Yep, just like I planned it"". Most people won't end up where they expect to be 10 years from now. You might have the same family and the same career usually, but the people you meet, the places you'll have visited, the place you'll live, the things you own, and so much more are up to chance.

Eventually we all get lost in life and we end up somewhere we never would have guessed when we were young. The trick is to get lost in something you love rather than something you hate. OP, the best advice I can give you is to try new things. Try a new videogame, try to paint something, go audition for a play, go out to a bar or concert or something and try to make a new friend, hit the gym and see if you like how it feels, etc. It doesn't have to be anything big or anything you have any experience at. Just do something and have fun with it. If you fuck up, who cares? We'll all be dead in 100 years and no one will care. Shit, no one will probably care a month from now except you. So try to have fun, think outside the box, and don't be afraid to be weird. Hopefully something will grab you and that thing will put your family troubles, your debt, and your feelings of hopelessness into perspective."
3207,"Didn't really see anything there that remotely sounded like advice, and as an adult, I'm sure they know all this already as they hear it from their mom daily.  
  
Thanks for being ~~a cunt~~ curt, I guess."
3208,"The only reason I'm even capable of remembering how unreliable ""plans"" are is because it was crammed in my face with a medical diagnosis that happened 12 years ago.

As far as my future was concerned, the diagnosis fucking threw all my great plans into the wind, flipped me the finger, and said ""so much for that idea.""

I call it the Cosmic Punch. You didn't ask for it, you didn't do anything wrong, you didn't make a mistake, there's no reason behind it, there's nobody to blame, there's no sourcepoint for you to focus your anger...

Sometimes things just don't break in your favor. It's not personal. It's just part of being alive."
3209,"That sounds like a hard place to be in, I’m sorry. When I graduated college I was in a fairly similar boat, not great living situation and about 100K in debt. 

As much as it sucks right now, I might try and take advantage of presumably not having to pay for rent and food. Maybe work with your loan companies to see if you can lower your payments or maybe get on an income driven repayment programs. I spent months working with Sallie Mae to finally get my payments lowered. 

Have you considered careers that are in the medical field that you don’t need to go to med school for? Maybe you could volunteer as a first responder. Sometimes we have plans for what we think will happen and they just don’t align with reality. Get creative in trying to find your new plan that fits your current situation."
3210,"Sometimes you don’t have a choice. If the choice is being with their mom or being homeless with no food/water/electricity, it’s not much of a choice. Anything not on a sidewalk costs money in some form, unless you’re lucky enough to get into a shelter, and even that’s limited. 

Not everyone has the same access to resources as you do."
3211,"Please consider talking with a professional psychologist or counselor. You sound anxious and depressed and you have solid reasons to feel that way.

Congratulations on your accomplishment, btw!

You could crash with your friend until you get a job. Any job. Wait tables. Volunteer somewhere. Make more than one friend. 

If you’re not making enough money to pay back your loans, defer."
3213,"What type of loan is it?

If it's a direct stafford loan (most federal gvmt undergrad loans are),there is a public service loan forgiveness program that allows your loans to be forgiven in exchange for 10 years of work in the government or non profit sector. If you're that far in debt, i would look for something where you can use your degree and get credit for the forgiveness. Even if you're only making a small amount, you can look at it as a $100K bonus after 10 years.

There are also an option to switch to an income-driven repayment plan, and also deferment and forebearance options.

It's really tough when you lose passion for something. It really couldn't happen at a better time though. Take a little time, then ease your way back into it. There's a great job out there for you, the passion will come back eventually, and there will be a way out. You just can't bury your head in the sand. Rooting for you!"
3214,Let your mother motivate you to leave and study for your exams.
3215,"I don’t have too much to say other than you are 200% not alone in this. There are a lot of people in this exact situation, unfortunately, and there will be a lot more if colleges/high schools don’t open back in the Fall. 

The only thing I can promise you is that even though it totally feels like it right now this is not forever. Things will get better, the job market will eventually get back to normal. The student loans don’t need to be a priority right now. I would look for some sort of work even if it’s food/grocery delivery just to get you out of the house and away from mom more than anything else. 

Also, there is no excuse for your mother’s behavior, but I would try to understand that people are very scared right now, they are anxious for things to go back to normal and that worry sometimes manifests itself as negative thoughts and behaviors. Even though she is wrong try to give her some grace. Try to do something nice for her, even though she might not deserve it, and see if that might change her mood a bit. It doesn’t hurt for you to try to be the better person."
3216,"Yeesh, ok. Take a deep breath.

First off. Your mother. Your mother literally has no room to talk, much less insult or put you down. And you mentioned being homeless for a brief period due to her bad decisions. So when she asks you what you want to do or what you’re going to do with your life - well, she shouldn’t even be asking you that because obviously she didn’t do anything noteworthy with hers or you wouldn’t have been temporarily out of a home, a car, etc. 

Second. I am going to hope I’m right in assuming that you do not live in a country where debtors prisons are a real thing, because that’s the case in a few very unlucky places. However, most likely that’s simply not the case and isn’t a reality that you could face. If you end up defaulting on your $100k loan, the worst that can happen will be probably be the annoying phone calls that you get fairly often, but that you can also easily block. My advice is to try to be proactive about it before it reaches that point, though. The loan officers are people, after al,, they’ll work with you. Especially post-pandemic. You’ll figure out some way, some how, to eventually get it taken care of. Because if we’re being honest, you’ve figured every single thing out up until this very moment. And you’ll figure this out, too.... It’s just life... Just trials and tribulations, my friend. Temporary, just temporary. 

It’s ok to be or feel lost; I’ve never met anyone who said “oh yup, my whole life went exactly the way I thought it should, just like I planned it!!”, because that doesn’t happen. I actual do not make plans, of any type really, because if I don’t have a plan, it can’t get fucked up and I can’t get disappointed. I just go with the flow. Roll with it. Like water off a ducks back. 

Another thing. From the sound of it, you’re pretty hard on yourself. For why?? So. just please try to be more aware of the negative self-talk you might have going on and try to cut down on it if you can because you really don’t deserve it, and it’s not good for you.  Smile even though you don’t want to. The same with laughing. Because the whole “fake it til you make it” thing is actually true, eventually you’ll be back on track and happy again. Promise :)"
3217,"I'm not in nearly as terrible of a situation as you are, but my parents and I also don't have the best relationship but I've been forced to shelter in place with them as well, and it hasn't been amazing for my mental health.

I won't go as far as to claim that I know exactly what you're going through, but I will say that no matter how alone you may feel, there are thousands of others who do have some sliver of understanding of what you are feeling. And for me, that sliver is enough to stop myself from taking any drastic measures such as taking my own life. 

Good luck my friend, we will all get through this together. I am rooting for you."
3218,"Thanks so much for these words! It really helped me feel better and put things into perspective. Honestly, if this involuntary gap year from life, and the COVID pandemic, has taught me anything, it’s that plans are bullshit. You just don’t know what’s gonna happen, like you said."
3219,"Hey, thanks for this! The major issue with the loans is that they are Parent PLUS loans and so they are in my mother’s name. (I have loans in my own name as well, and thankfully I was able to get $0 payments on those.) We tried getting the payments lowered last year and the loan provider said no. 

The only way they can stay in deferment is if I enroll in school half time, which is what I did this past semester. It’s looking like I might have to do that again. Last time, though, my mom had to pay for the classes and she doesn’t want to do that again. So hopefully I can land a job so I can at least pay for them myself if that’s what I have to do. 

And I’m looking at PA school potentially but honestly I’m feeling more and more like I don’t want a medically related career at all."

3221,"Why waste all that education you got? Sounds like the honeymoon phase of your studies wore of and you seem like you are suffering from some level of depression. If you can, try and seek some help because it sounds like those two are feeding off each-other and you are stuck in a rut of negativity. Just my 2 cents, not an expert of course"
3222,"I am close to your age, I hope you will get through this dont forfet that you are only at early stages of your life so things flow like a river. I hope you got sunny days there because I recommmend you to take some sunlight and treat yourself. Best wishes"
3223,"I’m definitely in the US, so you guessed right. You also guessed right about the depression. My mental health has been shit for the past year. 

To your second point about other medical related careers, I’m toying with the idea of possibly pursuing PA school. However, quite honestly, I’m still figuring out whether I want anything to do with the medical field at all. I have a degree in communications so I’m also thinking of taking that out for a spin. 

Thanks for the tip about quantity, and about temp agencies - I hadn’t thought of that!

This is the plan. 

Thanks for the words of encouragement!!"
3224,I stopped living with my abusive mother the second I wasn’t forced to because I was a minor. Hence my comment about not talking to her for a decade
3225,The advice was kick mom to the curb and go do something else. That or simply use the escape hatch. Op says they had to move in with their mother: they didn’t “have to” do shit. Obviously op is far less aware of reality than you give them credit for.
3226,"You are an adult and aren’t forced to live with anyone unless you are in prison and assigned a cell mate. I haven’t spoken to my mother in a decade, it’s not that hard to literally stop interacting with someone. You are obviously benefitting from free/subsidized food/shelter/support from your mother, which explains why you are staying with her. Many people on earth dont even have that option, they just live on their own in the street like animals."
3227,"I’m 31, I finish my bachelor’s in August. I had grand plans to work in sports management on the business side and am probably moving in a completely different direction. Life sucks. I was barely an adult during the ‘08 recession, my friends graduating out of school worked the same shitty jobs I did. We now all do different things and  are on different paths. This is a good time to be inventive and think about who you are and what skills you have and dig into your network and see what’s available."
3228,"It totally sucks knowing that you worked hard, sacrificed a part of your youth, been given great opportunity, and then getting curb-stomped by circumstances that ruin the ""plan.""

If you asked any person if the country is working the way its suppose to, they will most certainly say no.

We live in a society where if you are not productive, you are shamed upon, but now that jobs are becoming more scarce, even for recent college grads, the turmoil is going to be felt by a lot of deserving people, especially during this pandemic.

When i graduated college in CS, i burned out massively afterwards because of a death march project and still not being good enough to get into a technical job.  I felt like a massive loser for not putting this education to work.  I said fuck it and from then on did things that are worth living for:  I confronted some of my childhood fears like driving on the highway and looking people directly in their eyes. I got a girlfriend (somehow) and got a ""dead-beat"" retail job to give me perspective on this insanity we live in.  I'm slowly becoming less crazy and now i'm feeling less burned out on programming and with more work ill probably land a decent job at some point.

&#x200B;

anyways...

\-you should try to work on your **sanity** as much as you would for any homework assignment, try to drag that productivity you had in college and put it towards building your resume AND yourself up.  You are tasting the bullshit and you shouldn't let it leave a bad taste in your mouth.  Do gardening, chores, and support your parents that have helped afford your gift of college education.

\- as for money, i have no idea at this point.  unemployment for low-skill jobs is very high which means the competition for getting a low-skill job is a lot tougher.  Even technical businesses are suffering from productivity issues and even have hiring-freezes. according to our quasi-capitalist society you should just die, which is complete non-sense.  Atleast its not WW3."
3229,"Are you me? 

I was 18 during the last recession and joined the Army because of it. 

I just graduated in December with hopes to work in Sports Marketing, absolutely no luck in the job hunt. I thought that the May hiring season was my best chance, but now that has changed. Most likely going to grad school in the Fall till this blows over. 

Best of luck to you, we all need it."
3230,"Hey man, I’m 25 and just leaving college (maybe for good). COVID-19 is throwing a lot of us for a loop. No one is expecting you to find a job in this climate. The biggest concern, where you’ll live in the meantime is settled. Just like a lot of people in the world right now, the best you can do is shelter in place and wait for things to blow over."
3231,"A bird sits without worry on a branch not because it trusts the branch will hold, but because it trusts its wings. You’re smart and humble, you’ll get something that you’ll love, even if it’s in a few jobs from now. Have faith, don’t doubt yourself, and keep on keeping on. Your confidence will be contagious and your perseverance will be worth it.

Signed, someone in a similar boat, two degrees from top 10 school and two years at a start up who just got laid off."
3232,"Having that company on  your CV already gives you a leg up. I wouldn’t stress so much, you’re going to be okay. It just might be a while until you can find something equivalent. A lot of people are going through this right now :("
3233,"Hey man. Sorry about your situation. I’m honestly impressed by the amount of clarity you have for your age. I’d say look at your own words: you are still absolutely blessed to be in the situation that you’re in despite the fact it doesn’t seem that way. 

Last summer, through no fault of my own I was laid off along with most of my company (startup type of company that was bleeding money). It sucked for me because I’m in grad school and that’s how I was paying my tuition. But I also saw coworkers around me who were in far more serious trouble. One guy had just had a kid like 2 months earlier. Another guy was afraid he’d lose custody of his kids if he didn’t find another job asap. I’m luckily enough that I go to school in my home city, so I commuted from home. Tuition was the only responsibility I had. In another cruel twist of fate, my grandma died from cancer two days after I was laid off, and I spent the next week and a half out of the country mourning with family. Didn’t even have time to process that I’d lost my job. So when I finally got back home, it wasn’t even a huge deal to me that I had no job. Those two events happening so close together gave me perspective.

I hope I’m not sounding like I’m critical that you’re upset you lost your job; you have every right to be upset and nervous about what the future may bring. But think of this as an opportunity to sit back and think about life. That period immediately after losing my job was the first time in years that I’d had time to just work on myself. No classes or job to worry about. Obviously it wasn’t a circumstance I wanted to be in but I did my best to make the most of it. That’s what you should do. Take some time and work on yourself. Enjoy the time with your family. Think about what you want in life. Then when you’re ready and the time is right, go out and start looking for jobs. You have a good temperament. You’ll be alright."
3234,"It’s very rough. Without sports operating, they don’t need new hires."
3235,"I totally feel you. I have a roof over my head, my health, food, etc but my offer was also taken back and it has been taking a blow to my mental health.

But just know that you’re not alone in this! COVID-19 has turned all our lives upside down. Take this time to focus on yourself, your hobbies! You can be productive by reading, listening to TED talks, etc :)

Just gotta make the best of the situation and keep moving on and growing yourself!"
3236,"As someone who is in the exact position you described right now, it sucks. No one will truly understand it. Some people may think it’s nothing and it is compared to other people’s problems. However, you’re allowed to grieve. Eventually, you will have a great job and the economy will boom again. But right now it’s hard to sit here and not be sad about the graduation ceremony we don’t get, the life right out of college we pictured disappearing and the validation that would have came with those things. It is sad, because the class of 2020 does not get this time back. Lots of people have it much worse than us but your feelings are valid. If you want to talk to a stranger going through the same thing I’m usually on here, because what else do I have going on!?"
3237,"Can I ask if you could elaborate a little on what happened with your CS career path? 

I'm considering getting a CS degree after nursing didn't work out for me. However, it is a very challenging degree and although I know I can complete it, I'm just not sure if I am ""smart"" enough to get a job afterwards. 

I'm not looking to be the next Zuckerberg or work at Google or FB, I just want to be able to enjoy my job while having a good work/life balance for my family (I have a 2 and 11 year old)."
3238,"Going through the same thing, it's rough to have everything upended like that. Stay strong, try and enjoy the free time and quiet, pick up a hobby or two if you can, and keep an eye out for new opportunities. You'll land on your feet."

3245,"I don't know, maybe it isn't as bad as you think. 

I have a job that I love. It's a desk job, 8-5 Mon-Fri but I do maybe 2 hours of work a day AT MOST. My coworkers are cool, my supervisor is cool, and when I DO have work to do it's for a very good cause. Pay is great, benefits are good. 

But it's also a lot like /u/theglenz's job: I don't always have a lot to do so I wouldn't be surprised if that's also the case for my coworkers. We do complain to each other about changes we'd like to see in our office, but management often gives us reasons they can't make those changes (like a work from home policy), so commiserating is all we have. 

And right now going home and sitting on the couch sounds like a good weekend to me! A lot of my coworkers have little kids at home, so their home life is a lot more chaotic and busy than office life. Our office is quiet and peaceful. It sounds weird, but I like going to work because it means I can relax; my SO usually plans a ton of stuff for my free time at home and 75% of a good relationship is knowing how to say those two important words: ""Yes dear""."
3246,"It's why we need to stop thinking of 9-5 weekday office jobs as the norm. We get more done more quickly in 2019 than in the 1950s or whenever this became the norm. 

If I can do my job in four hours a day, I should be able to go home and do other things that are important to me: family, friends, hobbies etc. 

Of course, employers would probably say, ""Oh, four hours? Well, we'll pay you only for those hours then."" which makes we employees dedicate ourselves to busywork."
3247,">TLDR are all offices just groups of unhappy people there for a paycheck?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Yes.  ""[Office Space](https://youtu.be/8afqoDL3Qsk?t=97)"" is one of my favorite documentaries.  So, after the first few years of being bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, you become numb, and you do this for the next \~45 years, praying that a comet wipes out the planet or getting [Donnie Darko'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PUFJmsCZLE), and if you're not lucky for either of those options, hopefully you save enough to retire.

3254,"Yeah it’s definitely a crazy difference to go from a minimum wage job in retail/food service to a salaried/office position. You’d think getting paid more means more stress/work etc. but I went from like 90% productivity during a shift to like, 30-50% max. 

I often feel guilty about this but when I told one of my friends they said “that’s why you go to school!” Which I think is true. You might work 3 hours a day but you’re bringing in enough value and knowledge in those 3 hours to be worth your pay. 

Not only that but I also think advancements in technology and automation have brought us to a point where a full 8 hour day isn’t needed in most cases anymore."

3256,I had one job so far and it was a desk job but we were spending 1/3 of the day with meetings and planing and arguing about how something should be done. It was pretty fun and everybody was challenging everybodys ideas technicaly. It was a software engineering job.
3257,"my office like was like that, I was working for a large car manufacturer as ERP security developer. before i quit i got to the point where i was only onsite MAYBE 10 hours a week and most of that was so i get a free lunch and ensure i stay squarely in the good ole boys club that consisted mostly of my superiors, i was probably working 4 hours a week and attending 5 hours of meetings from home, i would reserve conference rooms to watch movies in so people thought i was doing something. it got so boring i quit and became an independent contractor in the tech industry. we are hired on by companies who have large projects that their FTE's dont have the time or expertise to do. this is different than a consulting firm taking a gig too because each one of us are hired hourly by the project manager. 


dude its a completely different world, everyone works their asses off every single day and never ever quits, i logged a 108 hour work week and slept at the clients site one time. people get fired within a week if they dont immediately bring a shitload of value, saw one get get let go after 3 hours. its a completely different and crazy lifestyle, most of the contractors are flying in from around the country every single work week. there were some slow weeks, but the vast majority of it was hair on fire 60-90 hour weeks."

3259,"Not all jobs. I love my current job. All my coworkers are friendly and helpful. I get fun work everyday, and our office has a bunch of free perks and events.

3261,"I did a year at a military contractor. Actually 11 months. Couldn't stand it one more.  
Desk was literally in the basement at a second, offsite leased building because they ran out of room in the primary campus. I was pretty young at the time and sat next to two other younger guys in a  (small) converted conference room into cubes. We we all engineers but none of us worked on the same thing.  
  
Just outside our area was a hallway converted into cubes where a large number of salty old fucks worked. They were all contractors because it paid better and they had amassed wealth over the years and didn't need overcharged bullshit HMO insurance and they enjoyed the time off when they were let go first. When the ship starts sinking the first to go are the contractors which means they get relieved of duty first and don't have to endure the mind-numbing ""look busy even though we all know the project is about to be officially cancelled"" fallout."
3262,"My previous office job was great. The environment was great, people were friendly, fun, and helpful, and everyone seemed like they enjoyed their jobs and what they did every day."

3264,"Here’s what gets me - there is some work that you’d think should take 4 hours to fill - add in your meetings, lunch, chit chat, and that’s the whole day to do a task. *BUT*, if someone told me as a young lawyer I REALLY had to do this eg Legal research task in 45minutes (like back in a school open book exam), I’d for sure bang it out and it’d prob be better than what I slowly did all day at my desk . Sitting in an office and doing work makes things way way slower than moving about, multi-tasking, etc. And in school you could always say hey I’m done, I’m gonna hand this in and leave. Office life makes you think “hey it’s 3pm, gotta do something. Might as well look up 4 more cases cause why not?”"
3265,Hi fellow addict.
3266,"definitely not

in my office I sometimes feel like an asshole for not being passionate as much as them

look at Fortune 100 best workplaces and pick one at the top

side effect: you might end up working with careerists / workoholics who often tend to be arrogant and a bit on the psycho side. but you can get used to that. it's still fun if you're strong enough to keep your sanity"
3267,"Not all but this is far too common.  
Even in relatively well run places"
3268,"I’m on my third job now (consultant at a small/mid size firm) and can now say that offices that don’t suck do exist! They’re just insanely rare. I’m very lucky to now work with a lot of passionate problem solvers who have similar interests and values, but that hasn’t always been the case.

Most offices I’ve worked in or visited are filled with people just doing the bare minimum to collect paychecks or blowing things way out of proportion just to feel any form of excitement in their lives or complaining about everything. It can be really soul-sucking depending on the place. Golden handcuffs are very real. There was one job I worked where everyone was so miserable that I felt like I was in the death ward of a hospital instead of an office; everyone was baking under six feet of fluorescent light chained to their life support (paycheck) just waiting for the pain to be over (retirement). It can be really easy to let these places make you bitter and nihilistic. I definitely echo the sentiment that you should spend as much time as possible at your job working on skills that either make your job easier (Excel or some other reporting/data viz tool, version control, automating small tasks with either code or Microsoft Flow, etc.) because it opens up more time in the long run for you to focus on the things that really excite you 🙂"

3273,"i mean, we are in very different industries, and i guarantee you they were from a company that was contracted, meaning they were as shit as the FTEs (full time employees). military contractors are beyond wasteful. i have no doubt they were the first to go because they offered no/little value and are way easier to fire (paperwork wise)."
3274,Sign up with a couple of local temp agencies! That’s how I got some out of college experience and eventually got my foot in the right doors! Yeah it’s hard work and not regular but it’s something.

I’m just curious about your situation because any of us in college could find ourselves in the same position and I am truly sympathetic to what you’re going through. Regarding your internship, I assume you looked for an opportunity with those places. Are you in a big city or a more suburban area? Maybe a change of venue would give you more job leads. You earned a degree so you’re obviously skilled in what you do. Something will happen for you. Even if it’s not a dream job, it’s experience you can put on your resumé.  Just don’t give up!"

After a year/year and a half where I kept applying, even while employed, I FINALLY got a job I love and that’s giving me great professional experience. Is there any volunteering, part time, intern, or even remotely related (but not in your field) work you could do to gain skills and not have a resume gap? Have you looked at AmeriCorps? (Bad pay but can get great, meaningful professional experience). Others have said temp agencies, which is a great idea!"

3289,Have you tried freelancing?
3290,"What’s your degree in?

Also, use temp agencies!  That’s how I got my first job after college.  It wasn’t much, but it was my first little stepping stone to a better job (which also sucked) and then to an even better job where I am now which is okay but more money!

It’s not easy, I know.   But if you can sell yourself you can get places you wouldn’t expect.  Hell, I was a philosophy major and I’m doing pretty okay now."

3297,"Majored in philosophy, minored in business.  

It’s all about the stepping stones.  I started doing administrative work at a law firm, then moved to sales, then moved to aerospace.  A lot of it is networking and a bit of luck.  

Most importantly, you must be able to sell yourself!  Practice interviewing!  Study the company!  Prepare responses to typical questions and be articulate!  Confidence, confidence, confidence."
3298,"One year. After I graduated from college I worked as a receptionist for one year for $10 an hour. I went through countless applications, cover letters, phone chats, and interviews. I only got offered positions at 4 places —2 were fishy companies who treated their employees like cattle, 1 was a part time job for 12 hours a week I actually accepted before I was offered a full time job with benefits at an interview last Friday. That job isn’t even exactly in my field, but it’s pretty close and I’m both thrilled and nervous about it. 

But I’ve seen people get jobs before they’ve even graduated college, 3 months after, whenever. The point is, at the point when you’re about to give up looking, just push a little harder because that’s when amazing things happen."
3299,"Yup I have a portfolio from school that i send with every resume. I have been struggling to update it with new stuff.... every time I try to sit down and design anything i just feel so judged like i cant relax and make something for fun.

Went to school for it, graduated, and got a job playing professionally, but it's not everything I wanted. Now Im in this strange transitional phase trying to break into the computer science meme. Because I've only loved two things, music and computers. But it's almost impossible to start a field and be competitive with people that have been doing this stuff their whole life, just like it would be if I was a computer engineer who decided one day to become a professional musician. You just kinda decide to do something in this life and do it until you really really don't want to anymore. Thats basically my philosophy."
3305,"I'm the opposite of you. I graduated with a CS degree but played music all throughout college and I've continued to gig professionally after graduating.

3312,"Yeah I feel you exactly dude. Here I am at 20 and I have no idea where my life is headed. The whole idea of knowing is scary, hell even most people if not all people I know in colleges don't know what theyre doing.

&#x200B;

I think the main thing is about life is to learn and understand what you like and what you want out of it. I've been trying for several years trying to figure myself out and trust me it isn't easy. By realizing what you are and what you can do it opens up tons of possibilities, all you gotta do is trust your gut and follow your heart. As cheesy as it sounds."
3313,"I’ve also come to the realization over the past few years that no one knows what they are doing. Even “successful” people are figuring out life as they go. 
Our parents and generations before them finished school, got married, bought a house, and had kids. So now we are expected to do the same. That’s just not realistic anymore. 
But aren’t we a little lucky to have the freedom to explore and figure out what we really want? 
It’s hard when everyone around you seems to have it together but I just keep reminding myself that no one knows what they are doing. How can they?"
3314,Don’t let anyone force you into anything you don’t want to do. I’m turning 40 next year. I still don’t know what I want to do when I grow up. But I’m picking up car racing this year just in case I have a hidden talent 😂
3315,"Thanks for the encouragement! I’m applying for a grad program that would really help break me into the field, but one of my recommendations is stalling and it’s due today and it doesn’t look like they’ll finish it today so I’m about to write that off as a loss. I’ve already started taking online classes like mitx and such but now without guidance and feedback I just feel like I’m floundering through the muck of available resources trying to figure out what i need to know to be employable."
3316,"Thanks, best of luck to you as well"
3317,"Lol that's literally what I went through when I first started. You're scared you're spending your time learning something that you won't even be using (which is actually an easy thing to do, because you hear someone use some term and think, ""Should I know that?"" and fall down a rabbit hole googling this topic and any topics related to it). That's why I offered the help -- finding the direction is the hardest part in my opinion."
3318,"I love being in the city. Lots of young people, lots of career opportunity, ability to walk most places I go. 

The trade off is you have to pay more for less space, but I don’t need much space; only thing I do at home is sleep and cook. As far as money goes, I work in tech and I’m paid market value."
3319,"I cannot stress this enough. Job prospects are astoundingly different, by several orders of magnitude, comparing “cities” versus actual “big cities”."
3320,I lived in cities from 2001 to 2016. I loved it. Now I’m in a suburb and my manfriend lives 17 miles away in the city and I’ll move back when we get married. He’s a city guy so we are looking at our next 5 years and at buying a second home in another city. To each their own.
3321,"I really don’t like living here. It’s insanely expensive and you don’t get much. There’s no sense of a ‘Main Street’ in the city and the activity is split into multiple small neighborhoods so it kinda feels like a town more than a city. Transit is not great, lots of homeless people, it’s dirty and the wealth gap is nauseating. That being said the natural beauty is insane, best sunsets I’ve ever seen in my life. Also the career growth is worth it but I feel burnt out already. For what I am paying I could live in Manhattan which might be what I do next. Portland is wonderful and chill, it’s a low key gem! For me while I’m in my 20s my primary goal is to see the world and live in different cities and countries so while sf kinda sucks I can just go somewhere else."
3322,I am in SF and will hop to other cities until I find something reasonable.
3323,the burbs and surrounding areas are the prime spots for yuppies who become muppies (middle-aged urban professionals). although some make enough money to afford a large apartment/townhouse in the city still so they don't go anywhere.
3324,"Buying a second house?

Must be tough...

Edit: In case you took that the wrong way, I jest of course. I’m happy for you!"
3325,How is living in SF? I’ve heard it has become increasingly more expensive the past 10 or so years and I used to want to live there when I was younger. I live in Portland now so a more affordable city (comparatively). Do you feel like SF is crazy expensive?
3326,"SF is insanely expensive, one of the most expensive in the world iirc. It’s only going to get more expensive as more engineers and tech companies come in and more Asians buy up property for appreciation"
3327,Everyone I know who lives in these places works 70+ hours a week and maybe gets to enjoy the city once a week.
3328,Live in a small city and then move to a big city?
3329,"Depends on your career and lifestyle.

For me, I’m more comfortable with staying in a large city and my career is thankful for it. A lot of stuff to do and interesting people as opposed to being in a rural area. I am single atm but even with a partner I would stay in a city. I guess I’ll have a DINK lifestyle. Maybe I’d move further from the city if I want to buy a house in the future because I do value exterior space over interior."
3330,"I work in a suburban metro area in the Midwest and travel to Chicago a few times a year for work. I always enjoy visiting, and they always show us a good time while we’re there, but I wouldn’t want to live there. It’s constantly loud, there’s SO many people, everything is expensive, and I feel kind of out of place as a homebody. But if you’re young and love to stay out late and hang out with people often, the city is probably is good as it sounds."
3331,Yep.
3332,"Being in a city is great for me. Though, I've always lived in large cities. I love to be able to walk to work, the grocery store, restaurants and bars. Also, there are much more young progressive people in cities which is something I value a lot. 

Yes, you do pay more than if you lived in a suburb or in a rural area, however, that trade off is absolutely worth it for me and many others."
3333,The greater LA area is wide. There's places that are slightly more affordable although kinds dingy.
3334,"I currently go to school in the Twin Cities and while it’s not as big as the other cities you’ve mentioned, it’s drastically bigger than where I grew up in central Wisconsin. Wherever you decide to live comes with tradeoffs. 

From what I’ve noticed and what you’ve perceived it can be easier for a college grad to live here because of an increase in the density of job opportunities. There are simply more businesses in a city. There’s also a higher density of specialized labor opportunities which some careers require. While there are exceptions, chemistry labs and top tier hospitals are an example of this.

Another factor is the pace of life in the city. From my experience, things definitely move faster in the cities! It sort of promotes youthfulness in that way. There’s always something to do and it’s fairly quick to get wherever that is. But there’s also the trend that after a few years when people get settled into their careers they want to slow down a bit. Which is why they move away. Some people find the pace of city life to be a bit draining. They want to slow down and enjoy life a little more once they’ve figured out the direction they’re going. 

I’ve been trying to find that balance and I think it’s certainly possible in the cities, but I think the pace of life here can more easily consume you than the pace of country or suburban living.

Some people love city life and I would definitely recommend trying it for a bit. If only to see that it’s not for you. It’ll give you a better understanding of yourself and what makes you happy, which is what life after school is really about."
3335,"Everyone I know who has moved to the Bay area moves to San Francisco, find out it's way too expensive, then move to Oakland.  To say it costs a fortune to live there is an understatement."
3336,This is what the smart people tend to do...
3337,It will be modest! It’s my dream to own MY OWN HOME so I’m selling him on it as a spot we can go for R&R!
3338,Portland is wonderful but I think it stopped being a “low key gem” 10 years ago haha
3339,I find the pay does not go up for the cost of living. Sure more jobs in the mega cities but income after costs are more in smaller places.
3340,"Most big companies have offices in the city and top performers have no comparable choices else where, alot of these big companies, despite the name and the talented workforce, don't pay that much, it's a future investment on the training and name value."
3341,"Hell ya, there’s zero reason for me to live in the burbs in my 20’s. My career is in the city, there more stuff to do on the weekends, you meet people your age. I got college friends here. My time living in Manhattan was amazing. Now I’m in SF. 

Idk what you mean by getting out of your system since I grew up in a big city. I just feel more alive and excited with that life style. Maybe I’ll consider the burbs in my 30s and buy property, but tbh I rather own an apartment in Manhattan than a huge house in the burbs."
3342,"Pretty much right. I live in the suburbs of a major city. I was DYING to love there ASAP but the thing is the city is always there but saving at home living with your parents or in a suburb is much more ideal. 

For reference I’m about 18 months out of school and have paid off a car, paid off half my loans and saved about 20k.

Edit: meanwhile I have friends who post about their city life and I know their rent is 4500 a month between 3 kids right out of college. They post the good things, like videos and pictures of their 32nd  floor corner apartment, but they are in the process of  being evicted because they can pay rent. Social media is a mask you only see the highlights."
3343,"hahaha portland is quite wonderful, but I don’t think that’s been a “low key” fact since pre-2010 unfortunately"
3344,"It absolutely depends on the city. Sometimes they're great, with fast transport links, relatively affordable housing and lots of stuff to do. But others are expensive and force you to commute long distances and work long hours to eat crap food and have no free time to do anything. 

And of course a lot of it comes down to what kind of job you have. More money means more to spend if you like. Also means you can live in a nicer place."
3345,"Big cities have lots of jobs, and tend to be hubs for certain sectors especially,"
3346,"Basically yeah. Cities are fun to visit and good places to build a resume but I pretty quickly got tired of the crowds and like living in more spacious and quiet places. It’s a give and take, your friends are probably having fun (though spending a ton of $) but they’re jealous of what you pay for rent and how available parking is where you live."
3347,"I was born and raised in La, and I wanna move out tbh. Move somewhere affordable and vacation to these cities whenever I have the time"
3348,"Tbh those dreams are always majestic and beautiful, glad that I'm not the only one experiencing these"
3349,I dream about deadlines at a job I had 15 years ago. 😂 completely normal.
3350,"So, your brain is a marvelous thing, but you can’t think of unique faces that you have never seen, that’s why you see familiar people in your dreams sometimes"
3351,"I’m 28 and I sometimes dream about grade 8. I think that it’s because enough time has finally passed between now and 15 or so years ago, that this experience is firmly “in the past” and is something of a historical record in my mind, rather than a recent period of time that is currently influencing my present. Even when I think about 10 years ago, these things seem a lot more “set in stone” and I look at them through a totally different lens than even things that happened 5 years ago. I think it’s a way of processing past parts of one’s life and seeing things for what they really were."
3352,I got bullied quite badly in school and for years following it I had dreams about people in my class. Did you have a bad time at school?
3353,"Yes. I keep dreaming about being my age (late 20’s), being established in my current career, but having to come back to finish my last year of high school because I dropped out and never graduated. I keep seeing a few people from my year and feeling relief that I’m not the only one still in high school. 

It’s always the last day of school, and I skipped basically the entire year to the point where I don’t even remember where my seat is, and I have zero fucks given about the end of the year grade results because I have a high paying job anyway, what do I care about high school lmao."
3354,"Glad I’m not the only one, I’ve had a couple but just brush them off. Thank god I haven’t seen them in public when I visit my home town"
3355,"I too kinda feel I miss them but that's maybe because I spent so much time with them every day that my mind can't let go. Btw I love talking about dreams with Mom. She and her mom worked on a Ukrainian dream book back in the days of USSR, but I don't remember any interpretations, but when I see a bad dream, Mom told me to say this: ""where goes the night, there goes the dream""."
3356,I see still my high school mates in my dreams sometimes... I haven’t really seen any of them in the last five years and always feel very strange when I wake up and it can day half a day to shake the feeling. The past lives we live invading our current ones is a stupid and weird trick the human brain plays - 2/10 would unsubscribe if possible.
3357,"Yes! I have a recurring nightmare where it’s the last day of classes and also move out day and I don’t have time to do everything I need (pack, go to class, say goodbye, move out etc) so I’m frantically running around and it’s so anxiety-inducing that I wake up. Been happening about once a week since I graduated. I see my roommates and various friends in the dream all of whom ignore me. So weird."
3358,"I HAVE THIS SAME DREAM! Usually I forget my locker combination and have to go to the office to retrieve it.... or forget my entire course schedule and don’t know where to go. Or like I’ve forgotten to go to one of my classes in college all year so I flunk the class and have to retake it. These dreams are so stressful. 

I graduated high school 10 years ago!"
3359,"My recurring nightmare is me and some of my classmates on a mission in an unidentified Ukrainian apt. building neighborhood to deliver a huge load of weed somewhere but some evil organisation with superior future technologies always gets others except me. The only place for me to hide is a huge cremation chamber behind a tiny hole between two corner walls where they find me with the weed, lock me up and turn up the heat. It's usually lucid and every time I ask ""haven't we done this mission before?"" and the same guy every time says ""no, no we didn't"". It's some brain candy for sure."
3360,"It seems like I dream about almost everyone in my life, past and present: classmates, teachers/professors, co-workers, family, friends. I think it's totally normal."
3361,My mother said that seeing your old friends in your dreams means that you miss them. I don’t know if its true but I sure do feel like it the next day.
3362,"I have dreams that I’m back in school and have assignments due or some big project due and wake up in a panic, and I graduated 5 years ago"
3363,"It has been 9 years since I graduated and I still have anxiety dreams/nightmares about high school. For example most of them involve me not know which locker is mine, or not remembering the combo and needing to go to the office. Plus I always have some unfinished assignment or test I didn’t study for."
3364,"I’m 18 graduated a year ago and it happens to me as well, about 3-4 or times I think. Idk maybe it means we just miss school."
3365,I hate running into class mates. We all still live in the same city
3366,"First i got bullied, then everyone stopped talking to me. I have like 1 true friend from school, he the MVP, we are still good buddies"
3367,"Oh I remember that one time the class rejected my poster for a holiday I spent quite some time on, also gave me the task of making snowflakes to put on the wall but they decided to do it themselves and blame me for not doing it. It comes up from time to time. Yours sounds more horrifying, like waking up in cold sweat"
3368,"I wish we had lockers in schools man, my stuff was always getting yoinked, one time two guys just straight up disappeared with my bag and my coat. I was a rich boyo so I had stuff like a tablet, my wallet and keeping it safe would have been nice. I tracked them down to a shopping mall near the school, they instantly sticked to a glass door so I couldn't beat the living shit out of them. We had a meeting with a counselor at school, I don't remember what I said but I definitely remember my dad being proud of me solving the conflict, it's like one of the only few good things I remember from school"
3369,"My dreams come/came from unresolved trauma, so maybe you've got some unfinished business in the back of your mind"
3370,"Definitely have this problem.   
If it's bothering you in a way that makes life hard once you get up it might help to talk to a counselor. Otherwise it's just a funky part of dream life I'm afraid."
3371,Oh my gosh! I have been out of high school for 11 years and I have dreams about high school now more than ever
3372,"Sometimes, i even had dreams about being back in middle school, or even at high school again."
3373,Dude random ass I’ve met in life pop into my head while I dream all the time don’t trip
3374,"Fun fact, that’s also why, if you see some random person you don’t recognize in a dream, their face is that of someone you passed on the street once, or saw in a checkout line etc"
3375,"Unsubscribing costs way more than the subscription, 1/10 would not recommend"
3376,"Yeah, spending most of your life there and it's suddenly gone, it's sure to get burned into your brain"
3377,"Well, i hope you are getting used to it"
3378,Hi fellow psychology major :^)
3379,"The worst part is that when we were unsure about college, we were told not to worry about it and just get a degree.  Then once we got a degree, we were told ""I never said that, you should have studied to become a neurosurgeon or lawyer."""
3380,"My regret is not staying in CS and going into math instead. Even then, I might still regret college. 

We were oversold on the value of a college degree. The conspiracy theorist in me figures that was intentional: flood the market with highly skilled labor so that the value of that labor goes down. Employing firms get a good deal, and the rest of us get fucked. That's how it feels to me. Maybe I've been watching too much Mr. Robot lol"
3381,"Coming from another psychology major, I believe it's actually an incredibly versatile degree, but not as straightforward as CS or biology. You build great analytics chops and are perceived to have strong ""soft skills"" and writing from all of the essay work. I loved the subject and the major wasn't too intensive so I used some of my free credits to take other classes across other majors.

Two years out from college I make $180k, so I think it worked out"
3382,"What exactly do you do? 

Not trying to be rude but you seem to be in the overwhelming minority. Most of my friends with Psych/Soc degrees have ended up doing social work for $20ish an hour."
3383,"Fully agree. Went to school and got a worthless business degree, have now moved around a few times for my wife’s doctorate degree and it’s made it extremely challenging to start a career for myself. Currently working at a credit union for $15.50 an hour with no incentive opportunities and there aren’t many other options given where we have to live for another 2 years for her. Also tough to go back to school as we have bills and it would set us even further back in the $120k hole we are already in for her schooling. I legitimately do not know what to do at the moment."
3384,"Yes, because going to medical or law school is sooooooo affordable and totally not a major gamble. They are so out of touch with reality. Soft, spoiled, selfish idiots. [Carlin had them pegged long ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTZ-CpINiqg)"
3385,"No, this is actually how it works. 

Schools get to milk you, employers get to pay you less, and you’re straddled with debt. 

Then when you’re in debt, you’re easier to control. 

Survival of the fittest seems to be the philosophy embraced."
3386,"I don't regret going to college. I regret going to a college that costs $60,000 a year, when I could've gotten the same degree for a third of the price somewhere else. At the time I was a naive 18 year old, now I'm a naive 25 year old with a shit ton of debt. I would go back to school for another degree or masters if it wasn't so expensive."
3387,"Business degrees are somewhat hit or miss from what I've seen. If you go to a good school and get a good internship, they're actually pretty lucrative, particularly if you take your CFAs or get an MBA from a well regarded school later on. Like my gf is in finance and many people in our social circle have business degree and jobs that pay absurd salaries (a mixture of hedge fund folks, bankers, and analysts). I'm always biting my tongue about criticizing any of their jobs or how much they make, but on a few occasions I have had been called a ""communist"" as a pejorative when I just couldn't hold it in"
3388,[deleted]
3389,"A lot do regret it. There's very little emphasis on actually planning a pragmatic career path, and for millennials too much focus on the ""experience"" and ""culture"" of the school, as well as following what you're interested (""passionate"" about) versus what you could do day in and day out for the rest of your life and pay the bills.

It's always a ""best of times, worst of times"" type scenario though. You always hear about people miserable and drowning in debt, or people who absolutely loved college and immediately after went to med school or got some high powered finance job and are living large. Nobody really talks about the bulk of people in the middle who went in expecting some degree of loan debt ultimately to get a job they're neutral-positive about. It's not some great existential crisis to have $18k in loan debt and a modest entry level job you're content with.

 Yes, there are problems with higher education that require policy change. But most issues can be navigated with long term vision and careful planning. A cultural shift in how youth view college and their careers is as important as altering the structure of our university system."
3390,This is why I chose not to major in psych despite it being by far the most interesting subject to me. I just couldn’t handle the fact that I’d have to do a PhD program just to get any decent position in the field.
3391,"Part of me really regrets not going in for philosophy, but it's the same problem as in psych but worse. 

Even if you get into a good graduate program, it's not guaranteed that you'll graduate as graduate school can be extremely stressful and heavy. 

Even if you graduate, it's not guaranteed that you'll get a decent position within academia. 

And if you don't get into academia... well, where does a philosopher get employed outside academia? 

Even if you stay in academia, it seems like funding for the humanities is always the first to get threatened when the budget is ""tight"". Though, it's interesting how the budget is never too tight to pay for the ever-bloated university administration..."
3392,"I'm kinda glad that I didn't go to collage. 
I mean sure I'm unemployed but at least I don't have student loans to pay"
3393,"Understandable, even without considering the psychology degree I've been incredibly lucky and fortunate with my career path, but happy to provide perspective of an alternative path. I started off a career in consulting, most of my interviewers loved the psychology background because the dataset and analytical skillset is very applicable for identifying business trends, and the presentation and essay work pairs well for client interactions and the political environment. 

I left this year to work as a strategy and operations manager in Tech for a size-able jump in comp."
3394,"Yeah, got 7 semesters in to a CS degree while working for a tech company, realized I only ever went into CS because everyone told me to and I was kinda good at it in high school.

I just wanna garden and fix old tools, man"
3395,">There's very little emphasis on actually planning a pragmatic career path, and for millennials too much focus on the ""experience"" and ""culture"" of the school, as well as following what you're interested (""passionate"" about) versus what you could do day in and day out for the rest of your life and pay the bills.

THANK YOU. My biggest regret is not being specific and careful about planning."
3396,"Even for CS, everyone has a CS degree nowadays.  Colleges are graduating more people with CS degrees than ever before.  





There are so many unemployed CS grads nowadays.  I feel fortunate I was able to start out as a developer without a CS degree."
3397,Biology isn’t straightforward. Job market is trash for bio.
3398,My old field requires going back for a PhD or going back for something healthcare related in order to do anything with the degree (biology).
3399,"I was lucky enough to finish undergrad without any debt. I was unlucky (dumb) enough to have majored in something that wouldn't lead to a well paying career unless I went to grad school. So I went to grad school, got in debt, realized I would be miserable in that line of work after a few internships, and dropped out. So now I'm turning 30 this year, with a college degree + debt, making $11.50/hour at a job that works me 10 hours/day 7 days a week.

I know it isn't, but sometimes it feels really irreparable/hopeless. Oh well, back to applying for more jobs."
3400,My regret is not taking time off when I mentally needed it. I thought the schedule was important.  My school could have been so useful...I just wasn't in a headspace to use it and it really wasn't worth the money.
3401,"It doesn't exactly help that every teacher I ever had in high school kept telling us we have to go to college or else we are going to be poor electricians and plumbers the rest of our lives.




Little did we know back then that electricians and plumbers make a lot more than teachers!"
3402,"I don't necessarily regret going to uni, I just regret focusing more on passing my courses instead of getting internships/experience before it was too late. My uni experience was pretty much going to lectures then going home afterwards to study..."
3403,"I feel like a lot of the people that regret going to university are the ones that didn't think about their long-term goals. If you get a degree that is either hard to get a job with or low paying then don't take a bunch of student loans that you won't be able to afford because you are setting yourself up for struggle after graduation.  Reevaluate what you want and change your major to go into a career that can afford the type of lifestyle that you want to have.

Realistically, having a degree gives you opportunities for access to higher-paying jobs and faster career advancement in most fields."
3404,"A remarkable amount of the people in my graduating class were not competent, many are just in it for the money and think that somehow it will be easy enough (even after barely passing/literally depending on their team to squeeze by every class). If it’s something you put effort into I don’t think it’s particularly hard to find a job for it. It’s entirely for this reason that I think competent self-taught developers even stand a chance in a market flooded with CS majors."
3405,"As a Millennial, I am so glad that I did not go to college.  


Of course, at the time, I felt that it was the best decision for me as I saw everyone around me getting into college and surpassing me only to work shit jobs. I told my family about not going to college because of the debt. I've learned that my cousin and my aunt learned that they only wanted me to save their 11 kids. (yes, 11 kids).   


I've learned that I will never have a good relationship with either of my immediate family members (even as I was warning them about the pandemic before it happen and they still look down on me).  


Honestly, never going to college has been the best decision that I ever did and honestly, everyone thought I was nuts at the time but honestly, after avoiding that debt-bomb, I can move my life and go anywhere I want.  


The more I write this, the more I realize that I am not special. Quantum computing will destroy distributed environments but that's about 15-20 years from now. I also realized that I dodged more bullets than anyone else in my generation and I also focused my time on building marketable skills so I can live remotely and still have an income. Having a goal and understanding the gravity of going to college and standing up to my family shows me that I am capable of continuing moving forward."
3406,"At the end of the day, I take responsibility for graduating with a worthless undergrad degree.  But it's so tough when you are applying to college and starting freshman year not knowing what to do and having every adult or person you look up to tell you not to worry about planning, ""just get a degree."""
3407,"Looking back on it, I really would have liked to be a plumber or electrician."
3408,"Ouch, the truth hurts."
3409,"The real question is why do schools not prepare you for this stark difference?

The answer lies in a combination of what makes the most sense from the schools standpoint and how much effort companies and schools want to invest in people. 

Schools and businesses are the same in the fact that at the end of the day they are geared to make money/ perform research. In my experience, if they have everything to do those things well now, they won’t invest their success back into their employees/students which would involve actually preparing them for the real world and having a smooth transition between work and school.

I’m a recent grad (BS in Physics) and have been working for close to a year now as a data analyst. I’ve learned more about what it takes to be successful and think creatively in the year I’ve been working than I ever did in school. 

My advice, be flexible and learn how to apply the skills you acquired through school. Less focus on the specifics make you a more attractive candidate for employers and may also guide you into the right work. 

TL:DR businesses are made to make money. be flexible and try to apply your skills from school to a wide range of practices instead of one specific thing to help with feeling lost."

3411,"I doubt it; I’m in public accounting, which is about as close to school as you can get in the work world. Everybody comes in on the same day at the same level, it’s really hard from September-April, you screw around and don’t do any work all summer, then in July you either get promoted or fired and they bring in a new group of first years the next year. I still feel lost, fwiw"

I am not super familiar with this sub but I didn’t know if this is like a support group for people who can’t adjust to real world or just fresh graduates discussing their business plans, job search, what to focus on while in school etc. 

I’ve lurked here some but seriously can’t tell. Sometimes it’s closer to a business sub offering advice and sometimes it’s closer to r/antiwork"
3414,"I mean, automation is replacing a lot of meaningless jobs, but the result is just less jobs/hours for people who are unable to find other work."

3417,"Unfortunately I don’t know how much this would actually help. I had a financial literacy class in high school, for example. We learned about loans, stocks, interest rates, compound interest, etc, and I absorbed almost none of it. The problem with learning any subjects in an abstract classroom setting is it seems about as applicable to life as algebra questions about two trains leaving a station. 

Because I didn’t have a checking account or really make money at the time the lessons seemed like more homework and nothing more. Now sure there will be some kids who retain a great deal out of it and I’m not saying it’s a bad idea, but we have to remember that the standardized education system model tends to abstract subjects into irrelevance. 

Until we change the factory-style model of schooling we’ll just learn about the “real world” in an assembly line fashion."

3425,Capitalism gave you that automation you love
3426,"Actually this is pretty common in what I'll dub ""apprenticeship-style"" career paths - especially professional services types of careers or traditional high finance roles.

Careers like investment banking, private equity, corporate law, venture capital, accounting or consulting have designated time periods at each ""level"" until you reach the top of the pack (i.e. Managing Director, Partner etc). For example, in banking you'll start as an Analyst then 2-3 years later Associate (at which point you can go to business school or move to private equity or stay), then another intermediate level, then a intermediate/senior step then finally you're at the top.

It's nice in that it gives high achievers a dedicated path to the top with very set progression timelines but oftentimes people on this ""path"" (especially the investment banking to private equity path) can feel like their lives are on auto-pilot and coupled with the long hours they think about leaving the path for greener pastures. Which is when the idea of ""exit opps"" comes into play: starting a startup, moving to a stable corporate job with better work/life balance etc.

Medicine is the same. Lots of hoops to jump through, apprenticeship-style progression after med-school to become an attending physician (or consultant doctor in the commonwealth). While it's nice to know exactly where you can be in 10-15 years from the outset of your career it does also take the excitement away of serendipity."

The [Broken Glass Fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/63/Broken-Window-Fallacy) is a belief of ideologies like socialism, communism, and fascism.  
  
Capitalism says that eats into profit stop doing it.  
Capitalism is responsible for any automation existing at all.  
It was never widespread until the rise of mercantilism (a precursor to capitalism).  
Capitalism is responsible for uplifting 2,000,000,000 people out of abject poverty in the last two decades alone.  
  
How a system behaves when everything is hunky-dory does not matter.  
What matters is how it reacts to stress.  
When under stress communism and especially socialism (which is worse not better) encourage shortages.  
Right now the French medical system is stressed and notably has a shortage of ambulance service (which is worse than my most pessimistic predictions for *well managed* socialized medicine.)  
The entire Venezuelan economy is stressed and they are short on bread.

3438,"I felt the same way. I saw an ad online for a local D&D group that was starting at a nerd store and decided that it couldn’t hurt to go. I have friends now. 

I wouldn’t typically be the kind to just do something like that but I realized I wanted friends so I made myself and I’m glad I did!"

3441,"Finding any kind of gaming group, whether D&D like the other guy said, or board games or even just Smash bros can be great. We started inviting specific coworkers over to watch Game of Thrones while it was coming out and made a lot of friends that way. After switching jobs a few times they became just regular friends instead of coworker friends. We also do a martial art that has allowed us to meet some awesome people. Just find hobbies and go out of your way to do something in the community for your hobby in your area."

As i say it's better to have 5-20 good friends than 100 fake phony friends. Quality of friends are better than quanity friends."
3444,"The biggest change from college is that you don't have friend of proximity anymore. In college you were almost forced together, but with the freedom of working, people tend to settle into routines and habits, making distance harder on old friendships. Outside of just developing consistent habits with friends--I try to make time and call good friends about once a month--you could also volunteer or join social groups as others suggested. You're much more likely to find people you mesh with and want to hang out more once you've established a common interest."
3445,"Very true! The time after graduating college is so weird, ahaha."
3446,"Keep moving forward, and don’t take it personally. You’re married and work full time, to me it sounds like you’ve made it. They might be assuming that you’re constantly busy even when you’re not so they’ll end up deciding for you instead. Just as much as you hate to be rejected they do as well, and others just don’t have to courage to initiate plans so they might be waiting for you instead. Life is weird, accept it and just keep chugging along because if you don’t then you’ll never find that golden clique."
3447,"I know everyone on here talks about that's the way life is and its true. But I'll also say, to the friends that do reply to you even if you have to contact them first, let them know. Obviously not in an entitled ""You should contact me first as a friend"" but in a convo about how life has changed and friends seem distance, mention how you wish people contacted you first. 

I'm actually horrible at contacting people, but I told all my friends that I am, and that I'm glad they contact me. I've also had friends who say they wish people contacted them more so those are the friends I focus on remembering to contact."

3451,"Are there any welcoming programs in your community for those new to your area? Have you started exploring what your new town has to offer in terms of places to go work out, community sports teams or other activities that get you to socialize? It takes more effort now than when everyone was on top of each other in the dorms and spending time eating and taking classes every day with the same people. Get out there and do the things you enjoy doing. But by bit the friends will appear in your life. Don’t expect to have friends available to share pizza at midnight with however. You and they are at a different stage in your lives. If you are religious consider finding a congregation of your faith to actively join,"
3452,"You need to find a community as an adult, I’ve begun to realize. 


Work is sort of a community, but it’s a community of necessity rather than a community of volunteers. 

You **need** to go to work and interact with coworkers, so it’s already setting up a weird dynamic with your coworkers. 

You don’t need to go, say, to a Jiu Jitsu class 4 times a week because you *have* to, you go because you *want* to. 


What are your interests? Politics? Gaming? Anime? Sports? Board games? Craft beer? Art? 

Anything fun has a dedicated community around it in the vast majority of first world cities, you just gotta take the next step."

3459,"I’ll have to search more for some community programs. We moved from a small town to a bigger city. It has been an adjustment, but we need to put more effort into looking at more community activities!"
3460,"Just curious, but did you go to a really small college or something, because I have a really hard time believing that you knew EVERYONE on campus. At a smaller school, that would still be nearly 1-2k people, and at a bigger one, would mean upwards of 20-30k. 

Regardless though, like everyone else says, you're pretty much at a different stage in your life. People grow apart, and if you want to have that ""large"" group of friends that you had, then you have to go out to find them. Go out on the weekends with your wife, go to community events, etc. Not everything has to revolve around your old school or people that you met from there."

3466,"Something I want to add about applying to jobs: If there’s a company you really want to work for apply to a bazillion jobs there. Only ones that you’d seriously take. But if you get rejected or ghosted the first 5 times it’s fine. Because eventually the HR Partner will see your name come up for the 16th time and say to themselves “alright. What’s up with this weirdo? What makes them so special that they want to work here?” And then they’ll finally open your awesome cover letter (which is literally perfect since it’s gone through 12 different editions) and get their socks blown off by how committed you sound to their brand or business. And boom you got an interview because you wouldn’t stop heckling HR for a shot to prove yourself. 

Step 2: Don’t blow the interview. 

Knowing people makes getting a job much easier. But barring a great network in your field of choice or an insider who can pull you in, literally harassment (not literally. Figuratively.) is the next best option."

Im still on college for 7 years because I've shift from engineering to medical laboratory science. Some time this pandemic I stumbled upon the old journal and I began reading it from the late years of my hs days up to when I decided to quit engg because I cant do it plus I cant handle the environment Im in. To my entering new college and hoping for the better days to come. Say what. It made me tear up for what I have felt during those years. I pitied myself for what I have been through. But as the same time im happy because i clearly made progress throughout those years, up to this day.

She has a lower paying job now but we’ve rationed our food budget to about $40/person per week (with snacks). Lots of really good (for you) and tasty food can be made for less than a few bucks per meal. Lentil soup, a favorite of ours, is around .30¢ a bowl to make and we get two days worth of food from a pot of soup. 

Learning to cook is a power move that can save you hundreds of dollars a month."
3486,"Totally this, but I'd even add in to say, most of your life, even beyond career is very heavily influenced by your network and connections. I switched careers 2 times within 2 years after college, most of the time with barely any experience, and a subpar GPA, it very heavily gratefully thanks to simply going out to events and trying to share experiences and meet people. Sometimes it can even expand to stuff outside work, like your regular social life, relationships, entertainment experiences. I'd imagine it very different doing it today, given how there's almost nothing happening in person, but during regular times, it really was the biggest game changer I've seen between people that found jobs, and those still stalling around quietly in their bedrooms on the internet."

3496,"I know how it feels and I almost got rid of that feeling 2-3 years after graduation. It is easy to say, and hard to do (mostly comes through self-learning and life experience, but the best way is to stop caring what other people say or think about you and what you should be/do, etc. It is not for everyone apparently and I still see ppl around me struggling to make that work, but I believe that is a key.

You could try concentrating on your hobbies/interests and devote yourself into that. You will get distracted and, what is more, know yourself better. I would also recommend to diversify your activities so your life doesn’t get too routine. You will see how things will change after like a year and you would care less and less because your perception of things will shape in accordance with your needs (or vice versa lol). Things like: “ ooh you gotta be that by that age” or “you have to be able to afford a big house”, or” you gotta get married soon” will not really grab your attention because you will know that it is not what you want from this life. You don’t live to please others not even to please your mother and father. Moreover, I think we should be paying less attention to what our parents say to us. They are wrong in many occasions.

Also remember that there is always gonna be someone who is better than you at anything you do even if you are the best.

Hope this post is clear and helpful.

TL;DR - Not giving a sh*t about somebody elses’s opinion about yourself is a key. The way to hone that art is to be devoted to your hobbies and interests and focus on self development. You should live for yourself, not for others."

3499,"I have been dealing with these feelings lately as well. I remember back when I was a child, everything was just so simple and I didn't have to worry about where I was in life. Now that I'm an adult, I'm always worried that I'm not successful enough. I just graduated from college seven months ago and still can't find a job. Thus, I'm left wondering what exactly my true purpose is, or if I even have one at all. I constantly feel like a disappointment to my family, friends, support system, and mostly to myself because I have not launched yet."
3500,"Being mindful of that is the first step toward getting it back.  If you spend every present moment worrying about making sure your future moments are great, you will quite literally never arrive at one of those great future moments.  Because when you get there, the future will become your new present, where you'll just be worrying your even later future.  

Where does it end?  

The answer is right now.  Right now, you're living in one of those ""future moments"" you once worried about in the past.  Enjoy the now.  Enjoy what you have, the people you know.  Make time to enjoy and appreciate something every day.  That time you make for yourself is your time.  The world can't interfere with it.  Worrying and judging isn't allowed during that time. Give yourself that time every single day."

3502,"I feel you. I understand.It’s a part of growing up, but yet again you cannot be stuck in the past because then you’ll never succeed. Focus on what’s in front of you and win in your mind because once you start winning in your mind, you win at life. Don’t linger on what was, keep moving up."
3503,Everyone grows up physically and age. But you don’t have to grow up mentally. You can still be a kid in your heart if you choose to do so.
3504,"This is exactly what mindfulness is all about. Actively enjoying the present because it’s here and now.

Inner childlike wonder is a combination of quieting the urges to conform, making games out of everything mundane, and living with the knowledge that tomorrow will be filled with more fun than today. It helps to have an inner circle like this, since you become the people closest to you. Going skiing or camping is good for this too without cell reception and with lots of time to play, even if our play is different from child’s play."

When it comes to your job, you need money now. I get that. I empathize with that. And there are ways you can find a job quickly. 

You have a car. Awesome. People need people who can drive. If you're in a major city or near one, you can always turn to services like [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [Lyft](https://lyft.com), or [GrubHub](https://grubhub.com). These are ways to make some money relatively quickly if you're really strapped for cash.

If you have a skill like writing or graphic design, places like [Upwork](https://upwork.com) or [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc-brand&utm_campaign=G_US_Brand_BrandingDeskTop_Exact&utm_term=one-fiverr_(exact)&utm_content=AdID%5e323657221191%5eKeyword%5efiverr%5ePlacement%5e%5eDevice%5ec&caid=731898203&agid=43879774452&ad_id=323657221191&kw=fiverr&lpcat=br_general&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6cHoBRDdARIsADiTTzZBkFqKLm0Tn9KJh9xytDYB7vEymtbdUE7jYfVtTLKxr1Smz3pNTmUaAj-wEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) are good places you can pick up some freelance work. There's a learning curve to freelancing though. But with a little determination and work, you'll be able to find plenty of clients willing to pay money for your skills. 

HOWEVER, I wouldn't rely on the above in the long term. They're just ways to help round out your income or get some cash relatively quickly. From there, you can continue searching for temporary jobs at places like Subway or PetCo. Notice how I said ""temporary"" job. You don't want these jobs forever. 

They're not careers. For one of those, you'll have to do a bit more work. And that all starts with answer one big question: **What do you want to do?**

One great way I went about answering this when I was starting out was asking myself, ""What do I want my job title to be?"" For me it was simple: Staff writer. Luckily, there are a ton of great job boards specific to media jobs like [MediaBistro](https://mediabistro.com). I also turned to places like [Craigslist](https://craigslist.com) to pick up the off writing gig here or there -- but many of these job boards weren't just for writing gigs.

You say you majored in Theatre all four years of college. So did I! Contrary to popular belief, you can find awesome jobs with a theatre degree. A few job boards I suggest:

*  [http://offstagejobs.com/](http://offstagejobs.com/) 
*  [https://theatrejobboard.setc.org/](https://theatrejobboard.setc.org/) 
*  [http://www.artsjobs.org.uk/](http://www.artsjobs.org.uk/) (UK specific)

OR you can even turn to Craigslist (yes, seriously). You'd be surprised at how many quality organizations turn to there looking for talent. 

Some more good resources I love to help you find a career you love:

That's your career. Now let's talk about something very important -- probably the most important thing here actually ...

# Mental health

Now this is something I have a lot of experience in in terms of going through it myself. Addressing your issues surrounding your mental health is absolutely vital for success of any kind. It's like working out or building good relationships: A continual process. You're not going to solve it right off the bat, but you can do things to help you understand yourself better and therefore prime yourself for success in the future. 

If you're not in therapy yet, I highly suggest it. Yes, therapy can be expensive. But that doesn't mean there aren't resources out there for a destitute twentysomething to find professional help. 

You can find free or low income mental health services through awesome non-profits like [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/NAMI-HelpLine).

You can find sliding scale therapists who charge according to your income level in directories from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) or [Good Therapy](https://www.goodtherapy.org/). 

Or you can use a host of therapy apps out there to help. Here's a place with some links to good ones:  [https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#1](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#1) 

For me, I've used probably all of the above in one time or another since leaving college. I've since found a good therapist who I see twice a month. It does absolute wonders for me to have someone to talk to. 

Aside from that, it's helpful to remember that you are not alone in this. What you're going through is not unusual. And with the right motivation and systems, you can and will get through this. It's hard now to hear this coming from some bozo stranger online, but you can and will get through this. It's going to take time. And you're going to have low points -- maybe even lower than you are at now. But you will get through this bud.

Oh also, if you haven't yet buy this book:  [https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Second/dp/1523505745/ref=pd\_lpo\_sbs\_14\_t\_0?\_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B4X2N2Y000P4HKEF2YMT](https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Second/dp/1523505745/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B4X2N2Y000P4HKEF2YMT) 

If you can get past the scammy name, you'll find invaluable resources on how to get your life on track both financially and personally after college. It'll teach you everything from the best savings accounts for beginners, how to handle debt, to how to spend extravagantly on the things you love without losing your shirt. It's essential reading for any post grad imo. 

Keep me updated. If you have any questions or just want to talk some stuff through, slip into my DMs. I'd love to help out someone who is in the same place I was all those years ago. 

# Bonus: Food

You mention food is an issue, but this is an area that you can handle without breaking the bank. Some good resources from Reddit:

* /r/EatCheapAndHealthy
* /r/budgetfood
* /r/Cheap_Meals

As a former vegetarian and having been raised in a Vietnamese household, I can personally attest to the fact that you can eat cheap and healthy AND keep your vegetarian diet. It helps that rice is like the cheapest food in the world -- not to mention fucking delicious if you can cook it right."
3512,"It’s hard to broadly explain how the payment works because it’s per project. You get to see how much a project will pay before you choose to work on it. On average, a 30min audio file will earn you about $15. Although the audio file itself is 30mins, the time it takes to finish a project of that length is typically at least an hour. 

It can definitely get tedious, but there are some ways to make it less so. For example, I find it’s better to pick fewer long projects (30+ mins) than a higher quantity of shorter projects. If you space out your work enough by taking breaks, it won’t be too aggravating. I always keep at it even after I might be absent for a few weeks, because at the end of the day it’s still quite convenient."
3513,"Take a look at any temp placement agencies in your area for work as well. If you go in person for an interview with the agency, they will keep you in mind when searching for people to fill positions brought to them by their clients (your potential future employers). This can be a great way to get your foot in the door and test the waters of a potential employer."
3514,"What you make depends on what projects you pick. There’s no set salary. I think they also have translation services that people can apply to help with, being bilingual might make you a good fit for that."
3515,"Vegetables are way cheaper than meat. This person needs to tell their parents, “please pick me up a few pounds of lentils, I have no food or money” if the parents say I won’t buy you vegetables say “lentils are literally the cheapest food there is, if you don’t want to but it please give me ten bucks it will feed me for several days and you don’t have to be involved” if they say no, you should consider ending contact With them cause that’s fucked up"
3516,[deleted]
3517,"If someone has a religious or moral objection to eating meat, that's a commendable thing and not one they should be expected to give up to make ends meet. If it's a health reason, then it may not even be an option."
3518,Is Rev competitive or is it pretty easy for me to start working for them?
3519,"Friend was an English major (we grew up together and still live in New York City) - got a job at a temp agency, 4 years later she just left that original company after moving into event planning (they promoted her). She now makes a FAT 6 figures. Temp agencies can be extremely, extremely useful even for non college degree holding individuals."
3520,"Sorry, but morals are not just fantasy. They define how you see yourself as a person and are not to be taken lightly, in my opinion."
3521,How is the pay for transcribing audio? Is it easy/hard? Tedious? I’m really curious
3522,"I can vouch for a temp experience. I was struggling to connect my degree (which isn’t STEM) and experience to jobs in my city (which is a STEM-focused area). Not only did I end up with a job I genuinely enjoy, in the interim they placed me in a number of temporary positions that paid well above minimum wage (since those positions have to attract people quickly, they can often pay more)."
3523,Idk how competitive it is but you do have to take a grammar test when you apply
3524,Well; sometimes you gotta throw your beliefs about not eating animals away for awhile. Because being vegetarian in this life is a luxury. Not a right. Sorry to break it to you. Eat.
3525,"If have a clean record, talk to your local CPS (Child Protective Services) or your area's equivalent. They are usually in need of people to supervise visits. It's generally flexible which makes it a great college job.

I've been broke. I've done homework at the baseball field because my power was shut off. I've eaten ramen for so many days in a row that my kidneys started hurting. I've lived in my car. Not for long, but I did. Life is a real son of a bitch but it ebbs and flows. There will be better times. Always keep your eyes open for opportunities, and always be willing to work harder and put up with more bullshit than the next person. That sounds awful but it works. You will get through this."
3526,"You could do a trade, like electrician. For me, I graduated hs last year as well, got into an electrical apprenticeship, very consistent hours and plenty of overtime. Minimum 40hrs/wk. You also get paid to learn 1 day of the week. 

However cons are you have to be physically well built, it’s very demanding. Travel, depending on your company, you could be at a different job site everyday. 

Idk if it’s worth doing an apprenticeship for money unless you like it, but maybe try working in a warehouse or package boxes, something like those of your after money"
3527,You can always do doordash depending on where you live you could make some decent money.
3528,They shouldn’t be taken lightly but at the same time you gotta be realistic about your money situation. Wtf should this person do if they can’t afford to eat the way they want to? Starve?
3529,I’m 5’1 and underweight lol

Can't upvote this enough."
3531,I did it in high school. I’m in college. Getting an actual degree. Thanks for being a bitch <3
3532,"Don't worry about that commenter. Misery loves company, that's why they tried to put you down."
3533,Are you in the states?  Have you looked into job corps?  My nephew was lost for a few years not known what to do.  They trained him in work and he loves it!
3534,I am but I’m in college right now. I need in between kind of jobs.
3535,This comment just makes you sound ignorant.
3536,"On the site, there's two signups, one for doing video captions, and the other for just transcribing. Can you say which one typically pays more per hour of work done? The rate per minute is higher for video captioning, but if it takes much longer to do, it might not make up the extra time"
3537,"Idk, I’ve never done the video captions, only the transcription."
3538,"I agree with you. But sometimes you just gotta eat some food man. We’re all animals in the end. If he wants to suffer for the sake of remaining vegetarian then fine, I can respect that. But if he’s hungry all the time it’s going to affect his mood, attitude, health, productivity, etc. sometimes it’s better to take care of yourself when you don’t have the luxury of choice. Like they say, beggars can’t be choosers"
3539,"They’re genuinely useful. I’m making well over what typical positions I can hold using my degree make, less than half a year out of school. I would 10/10 recommend it. It’s (usually) a FREE service that wants to put you in a good position. Companies seem to like hiring through temp agencies because the agency already did the vetting and background check and all that other stuff."
3540,Walk around and look for now hiring signs and walk in with your resumé and say hey I saw you guys were hiring. Ive gotten all my jobs the same day I applied that way.
3541,"At first it stunk because it took me six months after graduating to get a job working at Panera. But then I lucked out, got called by a temp agency that set me up doing paperwork for a food manufacturing plant, who then offered me a job in their QA department. Shortly after I started, about another six months, they decided the whole department was being underpaid and moved us up the chain to the next pay grade. I started out being upset because my classmates were managing hotels and restaurants while I was bussing tables, and ended up in just as good a position if not better a year and a half after graduating. It just shows that where you start is not where you end."

3544,"I've had so much time to start lifting again and focus on making/eating enough calories to gain weight, because I don't have a job *or* school to attend to! (I actually weigh the most I've ever weighed and consistently gaining every week!!)

;_; but slightly serious"
3545,Because I am not currently making that much.
3546,I bought a camera and got into photography as a hobby!
3547,"About to start earning $50,000 or more per year."
3548,"I turn 18 tomorrow and plan on getting a loan for a decent car so I can get to and from college and I plan to pay for my first year of college out of pocket(roughly 5k, community college for the win!) my relationship with my girlfriend has never been better and I’m trying to patch things up with my parents as well"
3549,I’ve gotten promoted twice in the two years I’ve been out of university. And my gf just got a baller job as well so as soon as we both accrue enough vacation we will start checking locations off our travel list. Also my cat’s instagram is still going strong.

3552,"It’s hard to describe it, but I feel different. I fee light. I don’t feel stressed anymore. I was constantly worrying about what was due and when. Now I enjoy my weekends"
3553,What’s the 50k threshold? What does that mean
3554,[deleted]
3555,Nowhere nice lol.
3556,Started a business and now i can make money whilst being absent. 😂
3557,Why is that a threshold?
3558,"Mixed bag. But certainly mostly positive! 

Had a job before I graduated, paid pretty well for where I live and what I do. Still living with my parents 3 years on. Sitting on about 15K ish in savings but still have 65K ish in debt for school over the next 7 years and about 4-6K in a car loan over the next 3. Both I’m paying well over the minimum with the highest interest rate ones first

Financially aside, I’ve dated a few times after breaking up with my “high school sweatheart” in 2015. They’ll all been very positive and sucked pretty bad when they ended. Positive experiences overall however.

I’ve dealt with and continue to deal with demons, both mental and physical, self inflicted and out of my control. I’d like to think I have them under control then they rear their ugly head and I can push people away. On the plus side I’m good at hiding it. It’s a sin wave that’s at least rending upward I’d like to think. 

For the most part I’ve been in the best physical shape of my life, and people seem to respect me a hell of a lot more than in high school and early college.

My confidence on the whole is higher than ever even if it’s in a rut right now. I have solid friends and a solid family around me.

I need to figure out my next step because living at home has me losing my mind and doubting everything in it. Hard to keep focus and perspective that way

We’ll see where the next 3 years take me"
3559,"I have a normal ""big girl"" job that has actual benefits! I'm not being paid great, but I'm not being paid pennies either. Which is a big step up from all the minimum wage jobs I held on the side while going to university.

I'm just glad I can afford a roof over my head, food to eat, and internet. Maybe next year I can afford a vacation if I keep saving up."
3560,"I graduated back in 2014, and just finished a weekend trip with some of my old college buddies who all love in different states now. We all reflected a bit on our post college journeys, switching careers, moving about, relationships that come and go. 

And one thing that stuck out to me is how some of our lowest points post college are the times we look back on with a strange kind of nostalgia. Like they were our proudest moments, when we took the shit sandwich we found ourself in and put some mustard on it and asked for more. We can even laugh at how silly some of it all was. 

5 years ago I could not imagine the horrors I’d face and victories I’d attain."
3561,"Landed a decent job straight out of uni working for a really great company in the heart of central London. This time last summer I had retakes for my 2nd year uni exams, feeling like a bit of a failure. A year later and after actually putting effort into my studies I have ended up with a good degree and solid job to start my career. Just goes to show that a bit of hard work and focus can get you where you want to go!"
3562,"I graduated in 2018. Since then I've had two jobs, first one left by my own choice for a much better job. Got my first raise, visited Switzerland, got my first houseplants, started pursuing outdoor activities like bike riding and tennis, started drinking more water than ever. Overall it's been good, but a lot more lonely and a bit more monotonous than college."
3563,"Hell yeah dude me too! It's something I knew I wanted to do as a kid, but now I finally have the money for it. Do you have an instagram?

edit: [gonna plug mine so I can actually use reddit for something other than meaningless internet points](https://www.instagram.com/rainisaacs/)"
3564,Hospitality Management actually. It’s a weird path to end up on though lol
3565,It's enough to have a good life in most of the U.S.
3566,"After getting an 8-8:30ish to 4:30-5ish comfy office job 6 months after graduating, I LOVE that I don’t have to study anymore. All those all nighters studying how to derive relationships in operational amps, GONE. I love that once I get off work I don’t have to pay one second of thought until the next day for work. I love not having to stress about what I’m gonna eat for dinner because I only worked 16 hours last week. I’ve become healthier in every way since I’ve finish school. Started flossing like I should, working out after work, the next step is to develop a social life. Bottom line: the school part of college was rough, social life was cool but I’m ready for a new chapter of my life."
3567,"Shortly after graduating I went on an amazing 2 week vacation to Japan with my wife that I married a year before graduating.

Now my first job out of school pays 55k, I moved into a better apartment, and I'm just about to pay cash for a newer car! Life after college has been the best, most stable couple months of my life so far. My new company has an amazing culture, I love my team, and I love working in the tech industry. Honestly, it all pays off for all the late nights and tuition expenses!"
3568,Food science?
3569,I see. Congrats on making that much! 🙂
3570,"Just got started at my first real job. Tech sales is the broad description, but that will change as time goes on.

Just moved into my first apartment.

Out of credit card debt, for the first time since I started my Junior year of college (took me 3 years to graduate, so that debt has been over my head the whole time). 

Life just feels good, college had me in a pit of depression and uncertainty, but now I’m realizing it was worth it. Especially at my young age. (23).

For anyone reading this, if you’re struggling, it gets better I PROMISE."
3571,"i havent wanted kids since i was 15 or 16. im 22, engaged and in college. i plan to get my tubes tied in 2-3 years."
3572,"I'm so glad I'm gay. No accidents, no birth control, no nothing. I hate kids and I wouldn't want them even if I was straight."
3573,yes they have
3574,"find a new one! get multiple opinions from multiple dr's. check your local planned parenthood or
womens wellness center"
3575,i asked my GYN and she told me she wouldn't do it unless I was 35 and had kids already :(
3576,I feel the same exact way and I heavily recommend r/childfree might give you some perspective
3577,"Also a senior in college... as a part time job throughout school i have always nannied. And while i adored those kids, it pretty much made me realize i could never do this everyday with kids of my own. At least not in my 20’s... maybe when I’m 30 I’ll change my mind but no shot right now lol"
3578,"Raising a kid is super expensive. Not only does it tax your wallet, it also taxes your energy and free time. In my early 20s I thought maybe I did want kids, but certainly not at that point in my life. Now I'm 31 and getting myself into a career-type job has taken more time and effort than I thought it would. I'm already in all kinds of debt. My fiancee is a teacher and she gets paid very little, it's like the school district is trying to see just how little they can get away with paying their workers. 

The planet is heating up and climate change is here sooner and faster than expected. There are fewer resources available and everything else is more expensive too, not just child-related costs."
3579,IMO r/truechildfree is a much better sub for that kind of discussion
3580,23 and definitely do not want children probably ever. I don’t understand the kid craze among our generation right now
3581,Lmao having kids is not on my radar. I’m well too young for that anyways
3582,Built in birth control. Lol
3583,You are 22 bro I’m not surprised that you don’t want kids. You also have no idea what you will want when you are 32 or even 38.
3584,i'm actually going to a new one soon who is more specialized due to another issue im having. hopefull they are more accepting.
3585,"i don’t know your situation fully but you might wanna check your local laws, what she said might not be true"
3586,"I don’t want kids either, and a lot of the time I get “What? You don’t! You’d be such a great parent!” It’s nice of them to say, but it’s just not something I want. After getting some weird looks and some snide remarks I just decided to keep the information to myself. It’s really not anyone’s business I guess :)"
3587,Highly recommended. It’s not toxic like childfree and respects others peoples choices TO have kids. Sometimes you need a good rant but after a while it’s nice to have a levelheaded discussion.
3588,Definitely felt the same way. Last Christmas my grandma asked when I was going to marry my boyfriend and commented that when she was 22 she was already pregnant with her second kid. I didn't have the heart to tell her that we don't plan on kids...
3589,"This has kinda already been said but to second it, your perspectives and desires are certainly going to change. Your desire to have kids might change, or it might not. No way of knowing really but most people eventually want to. That being said, don't feel pressured by your peers. There are downsides to every outcome."
3590,I thinks its because family values has come back in style and everyone wants that leave it beaver life again and those of us who reject it are viewed as weird
3591,Dang really
3592,Check out r/childfree ! They have a list of doctors that will sterilise you in the sidebar!
3593,"I’m a 29 year old Army Vet, I made it through eight years in the military without and marriage or children. I am graduating this December, and kids still aren’t on my radar. 

Do not let any family member pressure you into wanting or having one, you don’t have to feel guilty for not providing a child/grandchild to anyone."
3594,[deleted]
3595,My grandma is the same
3596,"Huh didn't know that was a subreddit, maybe I'll check it out so thanks man"
3597,"No, i plan on getting sterilised as soon as I can. As a classical singer, and teacher, I can’t risk getting pregnant as it’ll have me not practicing vocal techniques for months. Also, I don’t like being around infants, they annoy me, personally, and I’d rather just completely avoid them."
3598,r/childfree
3599,"It’s unfortunate that a lot of people are pressured by society to think they need to have children to life a full life. 
M"
3600,"Yes I don’t want kids either and yes, my friends look at me like I’m crazy when I say that it will never happen. But this won’t change anything, I’m not ruining my life just because everyone thinks I should have a kid. Also, people of my age  (22) who already had a kid genuinely look sad and tired all of the time. I know that some people want to be “young parents” but really, you are just wasting your best years of your life if you have a kid so young."
3601,"Dude, I graduated high school in 2014 and I miss it a lot more than usual lately. I’ve finished college and I’m working a job, and I wish I didn’t take my high school days for granted. They were relatively uncomplicated. I miss seeing friends every day. I miss my teachers. I miss learning something every day and working on stuff I enjoyed. The real world sucks in a lot of ways but it’s cool in many others. Calling the shots is pretty cool. Drinking with friends when you get the chance is great. Making your own money is awesome. 

Being an adult is lonely, my guy/ girl. It’s so lonely. College is cool because you make friends who have your interests and stuff, but a lot of them aren’t from where you’re from, and some of your favorite people go back home, thousands of miles away. When you graduate, if all goes well, you all become blessed with a job. But jobs can be exhausting and you don’t have the energy to go hang out with your friends who want to hang out. And it’s SO HARD to make new friends. It’s not like in school where you could join a club or work on a project together and you gravitate towards a billion people. 

It sucks, but that’s what it is. I took up piano and I’m starting to get good at it. I’m trying to rediscover my passion for movies. I can’t sit down and watch a movie at home because I lose interest lately, but it’s getting better. 

If you’re lucky, you find a special someone to share your days with and you start a family. If you’re unlucky, that special someone lives 2000 miles across the country and forgets to text you on Valentine’s Day. 

I know it’s not gonna suck like this forever. It’s disappointing after having so many things to look forward to in my youth. I hope to go back to school just to feel like I have goals again. Fuck. I may be depressed."
3602,"> that’s just delaying myself actually growing up

There’s life to be lived at some point too... keep that in mind. We all know what’s at the end of life. Death. Savor what’s in between, there’s no rush."
3603,"Most people do not like their jobs, merely tolerate it. 

If you like traveling and skiing, figure out a job that accommodates that. I met a few people who work at ski resorts to simply be able to use the resort. The job doesn't pay well, but it accommodates ski/resort passes and accommodations. Travel is a plus for certain jobs, if you're okay with living out of hotel rooms and only having <1/5 working days a week to visit the town. 

Basically, define as best as you can what you want out of life. Then, define what bad aspects of work you are tolerant of. Try to find jobs that require what you believe you can tolerate and offer benefits that help you get what you want. 

There's also the strategy of getting a high paying job you hate for a relatively short time (few years) to get the capital so you have more agency, but this is not a strategy available to everyone.   


Good luck."
3604,"You say that you don't want to be in debt so early in life from college  but you also don't want to work a miserable job for the next 45 years. Pick your poison dude, college isn't just a place where you binge drink all day. At least give yourself the opportunity to explore your interests and open up doors for yourself in the future."
3605,Go to a resort town and become a ski teacher. They’re always looking and it’s a great little community.
3606,And you can always choose to go back. I spent maybe 4 years working and then knew a lot better what I wanted to study and was able to approach it in a much more focused way.
3607,Don't get stuck in high school memories.
3608,You said it: goals. Make them out of thin air.
3609,Yes this is a common feeling I suggest you start reading about communist theory so you can learn how to change this fact and make life more than just a 9-5 job until death.
3610,"personally, i feel im both like op and the commenter you answered to... its fucking hard man... it feels like shit but all of us have to go through this and realize this is life until you die and theres no going back to childhood

the way i see it: your and op's feelings are valid af but literally theres just nothing else to say (or do)... only thing you can do is get used to this reality

maybe im wrong.. i wish there was another answer but ... :/"
3611,"Life is lived at all points at all times - ""delay"" or ""pause"" or even the concept of ""later"" are all just ideas that we toss around in our own head when we have too much free time. 

Everyone is headed to the same finish line. Don't play the game as if it isn't going to end."
3612,"Finding the right job helps a lot with this. My first job out of college was at a company that hired 50 kids out of college each year. I made sure I went somewhere that was a culture fit. As a result, My first years in the real world were way more fun that college. More partying, less financial stress."

My job probably shouldn’t exist and I have next to zero ambition, I just happened to pull the lever on the right slot machine by knowing someone who knew someone who could hook me up with a salary and benefits out of the gate. I got lucky and a lot of people don’t."
3616,"Maybe you could work a job with more younger people in it. Congrats for not going to university if you don't know what to do though, big mistake on my part and now I have a lot of debt. Honestly, you'll get used to it more as time goes on."

3621,"You should consider enrolling into a community college. Education is how we grow. It also statistically improves your chances financially. And you may find passions you never realized.

I found passions in college that I never would’ve fully comprehended in high school."
3622,I have been looking into the issues of capitalism so I completely agree. I think more people are starting to think the way we are thinking which is a good thing. Depression rates are skyrocketing this system just isn’t feasible anymore.
3623,"Well, you have to work to make money, so there isn’t a whole lot you can do about that tbh. You’re smart to not go to college and get into debt. However, there are A LOT of ways that you can go to college for free (or at least close to it).

I also recommend checking out Dave Ramsey and his “Baby Steps” to financial success. I say this because you mentioned avoiding debt and maintaining that avoidance is a primary key to financial wealth.

What are you doing currently? What do you enjoy doing?

As far as friends go, I’m nearly 30 and I have *maybe* a handful of friends that my wife and I hangout with once a month or so. I’d really prefer to just stay home or do something with my wife and daughter.

I know you’re still young, but once you begin to realize what is and isn’t actually important to you in life you’ll become happier."
3624,"I also graduated in 2018 and decided not to go to college for the same reason as you. I wish I could offer better advice but all I can say is that there's a lot of people like us, and than life isn't a race."

3627,"I can blame my depression/anxiety for that I get stuck in a involuntary loop of obsessively thinking about my high school years or 10 years in the future. I used to be able to live in the “now” in high school because I didn’t have any worries, only worry I had is what am I going to do this weekend. After high school that all changed unfortunately.

Edit: now I have been put on leave from work and been stuck in my house for 2 months to try to find it slightest bit of relief from doctors. I’m on my 3rd anti depressant, nothing is working and it’s really frustrating."

3630,I finally got sober from weed after smoking everyday since I got my license. It was not helping my depression/anxiety it was just making it worse in the long run. I don’t drink either. So being sober at 19 is kinda a minority and everyone I know my age either drinks or smokes. I’m a introvert so the party scene isn’t really my thing.
3631,"I do still have friends outside of university but it's just so different. I see them like once or twice a week. Whereas my eng friends, I saw almost everyday and sat with in lectures and stuff. I definitely need to do more work cultivating interests and getting out there. Although I am involved in politics in my area which has helped a lot."
3632,"> explore the world for a bit.

Yeah, I was discussing this with a friend a little while back. He still needs to graduate before we can do this but I think you're right. I'm still relatively young and have so little responsibility."
3633,"Nah man, he just graduated. Go somewhere cheaper than Italy or Switzerland. I recommend working until after covid and saving money, then hit up Latin America or Southeast Asia! There's a real young people backpacking culture at hostels. You can survive on $1000/month."
3634,"We plan really big trips every other year and smaller, (cheaper) three day weekend, road-trip type trips on the off year. We have prioritized this financially, over buying a home, new cars, furniture, etc. I think it gives us something to look forward to and maintains a sense of adventure/exploration/wanderlust I see a lot of people lose in the everyday grind. 

Another tip, try new ways to move your body. Check out Classpass or something similar in your area. Try rock climbing, beer yoga, trail biking, anything new to get yourself out of your routine. 

Final advice, check out the Meetup app in your area. Lots of virtual and in person gatherings, book clubs, networking circles, board game nights are out there and may help make friends and expand your social circle. 

I hope this helps, it’s what dragged me out of the house and got me more involved in my new community. Best of luck!"
3635,"I graduated in 2018 and I still feel the same way, and it's even worse because I did have the traditional university experience.  After joining the work force, it just feels like life will never be as fun or enjoyable as my time in college again. Work for days, try to enjoy your weekends as much as you can before the thoughts of work creep back in again, be burdened by things like rent and mortgage, etc etc.  Like you said, in college I was surrounded by people my age, I had my own schedule most of the time, and I saw my friends everyday. I don't know how any point in my life after college can even come close to how much I enjoyed my time in college.  Maybe once I have a kid or something I'll be living for someone other than myself and I'll feel some sense of duty and fulfillment, idk.  Good luck to you, OP."
3636,"I graduated in May, so I can relate. It's tough out there. I moved to a new city, and with work from home, I don't even get much social interaction from work colleagues.

I wish I could speak from a position of having figured it all out, but that's not the case. It's a daily struggle, but I have learned a few things and feel I can offer some advice.

The big thing is that I get the sense a lot of what you're feeling is likely because you don't know what your purpose is now. You just completed an incredibly admirable and difficult phase of your life, and without that purpose you feel sensibly lost. I would recommend learning something you've been meaning to for a long time, setting a new goal, or trying something entirely new. You need something to keep yourself busy and focused, outside of work. I personally have projects I do outside of work that keep me energized and looking forward to the future. I think this would help with the malaise you're feeling and start making you feel like you're entering a new phase of life.

The second is to do something physically challenging. Wearing yourself out improves your mental health and will actually increase long term energy levels, helping with the post-work tiredness. If you can do something personally fulfilling in the process, even better.

Lastly, I'll just say that it's okay to feel what you're feeling. I know that's not much of a solution, but for me, just getting empathy for my situation has been invaluable and allowed me to move forward. Take it all day by day, and before you know it, you'll be in a better place. 

I hope this was useful. Feel free to DM me if you ever wanna talk or just have someone to relate to. We're all in this together."

IMO the best course of action is to keep improving (reading, studying, certifications, etc) in the down time, figure out how to transition to a company/position that's a better match, and then when it's possible, to take that break."
3639,"I really dislike how college sells this lie that once you get your degree, the world is going to open up to you, and the possibilities are endless! You’re going to get that amazing job you’ve always wanted; you’re going to do great things; the world is your oyster! Unfortunately, reality is much more mundane than that. 

Now, don’t get me wrong. A college degree opens up tons of job opportunities you wouldn’t have without it; however, that’s ALL it opens it. It can’t guarantee you’ll find your job fulfilling, and few people find fulfillment from their jobs alone.

Colleges are really good at making you feel important and empowered because they get a shit ton of money from you. The experience is great but fleeting. Grad school can extend the experience and open more job opportunities if you’re looking for that.

Everyone else is right, though. The first year out of school is the hardest. Your rose-colored glasses come off, and it can be discouraging. You just have to find fulfillment in other ways, whether through hobbies or relationships."
3640,"The first year out of college is the hardest, you go from being in a cool enviornment, being away from your parents having your own freedom, happiness, surrounded by people your age. Right now because of covid, we can't really do much, but trust me, it gets better, after a couple of months or two, you will be over the college life and entering the adult life. Hopefully you will have enough money. You can still have fun and do stuff, but just not as often and thats completely fine, you don't need to go out and party every weekend, you can stay at home. Like i always say, you have evenings and weekends for fun and all that. Trust me life is far from over for us, i used to think my life was over at 23, but now at 24, i feel like life has just really began for me."
3641,"If you plan to live the standard 9-5 life you have to get used to it. If you think you'd like to do something different then you need to explore those options whether that happen now or later when you have more money and with everything going on currently.

I used to be tired after work until I started working from home. I exercise more now. I sometimes take a 30 minute nap during the day if I'm really feeling tired.

The only social light for me is work since I was an essential business so we never stopped work. I have dreams about a school/military, specifically about the people and just hanging out with the people I enjoyed being around. I wouldn’t really call any of them my actual friends though, so I just feel clingy and awkward and bail out before I actually text anyone. 

But fuck I miss seeing people. And the depression of 50+ applications, only a handful of interviews, and no offers is the muddy, salty, crappy icing on the cake."

3661,"What an utterly depressing take that reduces people to purely transactional beings and then condescends to OP for not recognizing the inherent truth that nothing but what you offer others matters. It’s a good way to think about the world to improve yourself or see why people might behave some ways, but not arrogantly and to the exclusion of putting value on family, friendship for its own sake, self actualization, etc."
3662,"Pretty sure this is a universal experience. Human beings are creatures driven by status. We care A LOT about where we stand in relation to others. Your friends and your potential/former romantic partners, in asking/telling you these things, are trying to look out for your best interest, I imagine. Or at least they see it that way. They may also be trying to justify their own decisions. That could be where the condescension is coming from. 

Looking at your post history, it looks like you’re pretty highly educated (considering you’re looking at applying to PhD programs), so presumably your friends/exes/those you interact with daily are as well. Pursuing higher education is a form of status seeking, so presumably your friends care about status more than the average person. 

In college, my guess is that all you had to do was be yourself because you were high status. You were involved in different activities, had a bright future ahead of you, are good looking/in good shape, etc. Now however, the game has changed and so have the markers of success. It’s not about where you could go, it’s about where you are. 

Moreover, on how your female friends and exes are all dating guys older than them: older guys are generally more established in their career and financially secure. They’re higher status than those women you’re friends with, largely by virtue of being older. When women choose romantic partners, they generally tend to go for higher status mates because of the financial security they provide, because let’s face it, having kids is expensive.

Here are your options: change your priorities to be more in line with your friends (I.e. find a way to pursue higher status), find new friends who care about status less, or learn to deal with it. None of those are easy. Good luck."

It's just that my field (research) itself does not pay as much as investment banks/consulting/corporate law etc. That's what annoys me. But fair enough, I'm not going to change my career to placate others. If they choose to judge me negatively based on how much I make, it's their problem.

Yes, because that's what they are thinking when their psycho-sexual urges get instinctively flicked on by something impressive a male has or can do. They like tall men over such instincts, money isn't why they have that instinct. It's also why they tend to stay with violent males, they're impressively violent. Money is controlling, aggression is controlling, being larger lets a man be controlling over people too, they like men that are in control in general. It's why women generally hate men for not asking them out rather than the female have to ask them out. The sad thing is how it messes with people's minds when they're not aware of what is happening. It gets to the point where on the Internet being called a nice guy is an insult and modesty means being not a fun guy. Our society hates mediocrity to the point it expect people to constantly upgrade their job status rather than just live frugally and with actual personality. 

It's not an economic thing but an instinct thing.

2) I am happy with my job. It's literally the best in my country for my field, the only issue is that this field itself (research work) does not pay as much as my friends' jobs in IT/consulting/etc. 

3) I do have a smaller subset of close friends who do not judge me. But okay, I'll admit that I might have some personal problems in dealing with the 'prestige' crowd - I'll try and figure it out."

Funnily enough, I think I’m about to be dealing with a similar situation with an ex of mine. She just landed a job with a very prestigious company, while my job isn’t very prestigious (despite paying well and being among the best in the field like where you work). We’ll get through this together!"
3686,"I agree. Most people in their 20s don't—nor should—have it all figured out. Unfortunately, the playbook Americans are taught to follow is outdated and not having at least a career path figured out has massive, decades-long repercussions if you just jump straight into college.

College used to be the place to figure it out. That was an alright plan when it didn't cost an average of $80k to go to a public, in-state college (4-year degree). But that's the new reality. Unless you're getting a STEM or medicine degree, the ROI and transferability of a college education into a good job often isn't there.

So what are your options?

1. Figure it out sooner so that you get a degree that is related to what you want to be.
2. Don't go straight to college and have the social stigma that you're a slacker or a failure.
3. Go to college, rack up massive debt, and graduate *without* the skills companies are actually looking for.

Option number three is the default. It shouldn't be this way. Society needs a shift in mindset.

There needs to be more emphasis not on HAVING it all figured out but going forth and having a variety of experiences TO figure it out in your 20s.

Particularly before paying $80k-$150k to go to college and HOPE to figure it out there—which, unfortunately, doesn't seem to work well for the majority of non-STEM grads."

Many famous people don’t have it all together."
3688,"Currently I’m a technical writer. It’s not my forever job. I switched to it after developing, then tried marketing for a while, and wandered back to technical writing. 

I’ve found it a struggle because I’m highly skilled technically but at heart I am a creative. I love writing and visual/performing arts. I tried technical writing because it joined the two. I left because it wasn’t my passion, and the product I write about... was not something I cared about in my time off. 

I tried marketing (same company, different division) because I thought it might be faster paced, more exciting, and more creative. The product was in an industry I REALLY care about, and I felt motivated to improve it and think about it in my spare time. I fit in when it came to the industry, but not quite the field. The office dynamic didn’t really click with my working style  and after collaborating with external teams, I drew the conclusion that those were not my people— and that that matters to me a great deal. I also didn’t feel satisfied without centering my technical knowledge more. 

So I went back to my old team, which was welcoming, kind, understanding, friendly, awkward, and supportive of my wish to be there while I explore more. I was seriously considering pursuing UX, even told my boss that I was planning to take the GRE and pursue my masters so he would know all the facts when he hired me back on. But then the coronavirus hit, and my plans have since been delayed. 

I’m so thankful I tried and quit marketing though, or I’d be stuck in a job I truly despised right now. Instead I have time to practice art and watch random lectures and keep thinking about what I’m interested in. Extra time to figure out if UX is something I’m interested in or if something else seems better. I know more about my working style, collaboration style, interest in industries, desires in terms of work-life balance and work friendships, things that make me feel fulfilled CS unfulfilled etc. I know I don’t care about chasing promos, but I care about having influence if I’m invested. I’m able to make more informed decisions about where I go from here. And I’ll just keep skipping along. 

But again, I’m just figuring it out. Maybe in 5 years I’ll realize I could have been doing it better all along. If so, nbd, I’ll just adjust and go from there."

The crazy thing is that, nowadays you have 20-30 year olds who still live at home with their parents, live with roommates in apartments or renting out apartments for themselves. I only know 4 people who have bought houses. People act like if you don't have everything by 25-30 your life is over, it's false."
3691,"I don't wanna delve into a circular rant from my personal experience from today alone, but just know that I sympathize greatly. I think it's fucked that some of our peers and older people are still chained to this ideal that you start a full career based on your 4-year degree, get married, and shoot out offspring in your 20s. Along with looking down on others who have to go to school at a later age, work different types of jobs, or have difficulty finding one. The world now is costly and cutthroat, even compared to only 10-20 years ago, but some people easily discount that as if nothing's changed about educational and job expectations.

He has a good job, a beautiful girlfriend, works on his hobbies, and is always kind and personable. Lots of admirable qualities and accomplishments in my book. 

One day he had a breakdown at work, because something went wrong and it was his fault (I'm being vague but it was a BIG problem with a complex cause, and on the surface it would be easy to say it was his fault). I basically had to talk him down from quitting on the spot. My perspective of him completely shifted, from an ideal person to someone fighting the same internal battles that I was.

I love my parents don’t get me wrong, but a lot of their faults outweigh their pros, and I would rather just live on my own. Like, only reason I graduated high school was because of this pressure coming from my mother about how getting my GED would be the worst idea in my life when that is in fact the complete opposite.

Like I get it mom, you want to see me succeed in life, you want to see me at my graduation ceremony next year, but I’m not going to because I know literally no one from college, and have no reason to. Like, I feel that a lot of people my age (19) just knew that, if you just set what you want to do in life that makes you happy, get a job, and not have to be stuck in another 4+ years of college (3 years for me because of my college), they would have understood that college isn’t going to get you anywhere but just about 10 years worth of debt to owe to your college. Don’t even get me started with colleges up north, and how you have to pay over $100k+ in debt, going to colleges where all you have to pay is maybe $10k+ but never anything over $100k+ is much more worth you time. Again, the world is your oyster, you want to get your GED like my brother, go on ahead, you want to graduate high school, go ahead, you want to continue another 4 years, and get into college? Good luck man."

The only people my age who have moved out permanently either don't have a good relationship with their family, or they got financial help from their parents to buy or rent an apartment."
3705,I used to think adults had it all together to but they were just faking it . They were still learning to as we grew up.
3706,Not to take anything away from anyone  but people put on a good front. Also they feel just as anxious as everyone else about where they stand in life.
3707,"Nah, they just make posts on Facebook giving everyone the impression they have. I'm sure a lot of them hate things about their jobs, have money troubles or are struggling with their mental health.

What people share on social media is the best version of them, generally. Everyone has problems, no one has this whole thing figured out and they probably never will.

I know that sounds cynical, my point is more that we should try and not compare our circumstances to what people decide to share with us on social media."
3708,"That’s true, usually adults fake it to make them look better than what they actually are. Taking my examples with my parents, I used to think the same way, now I say that faking it is fucking retarded, and it’s better to be real with your own children."
3709,"Yeah. Taylor Swift recently said, “I see my 20s as walking into a costume shop, trying on all these different costumes, and then eventually walking out in my regular clothes and realizing I’m cool with who I am”

Most of them are doing the same thing as we are, but publicly."
3710,I stopped caring when I realized how much money people throw away towards rent. Please criticize me all you want.
3711,Glad I'm not the only one!
3712,"I mean, while my parents weren’t necessarily toxic, there are some things that most parents can be at fault for, but as soon as you do they either cry, or they go “I’m your Dad, you need to respect me!”, which that’s not how that works. Like, my mom isn’t perfect, one fault I remember her having that I can’t live down was how she used to (And possibly does to this day) is to eat food on top of her bed, leave the dirty plates underneath her bed, and also chew gum, stick it onto her bed frame, and if she felt like it, throw the already chewed gum back into her mouth (Which both are absolutely fucking disgusting, fuck that.), while my dad is just mildly annoying at times, and can be stubborn at times.

Like sure, he farts like a dad should (he’s completely against burping so he’s only half a dad.), he laughs like a dad should, he’s kind of a boomer, which most dads are for the most part, but sometimes from experience, the guy can can get mad at some of the most inconspicuous times where I ask him for help. That’s my parents, and while they have their own differences, a lot of the time I just question my existence in this world, and why the fuck they’ve even decided to procreate me and my brother, let alone me."
3713,"I admit, I was one of those people who had this mindset. I went to college and got a degree in accounting because people told me it’s a field with a lot of career opportunities. My grades were pretty good and I got a job at an accounting firm as soon as I got out of college and everything seemed nice on the surface for the first year. I thought I had everything going for me, but then that first year honeymoon period was over. I hated the work that I was doing, I struggled to pass the CPA exam, and I just fell into a rut. I thought, okay, it’s cuz I don’t like public accounting. Then I get a job in a private industry. After a couple months, I was just really going through the motions, not particularly passionate about what I do. I liked the people I worked for (despite on of my bosses being a dick), I tried to be a team player when things were tense around the office but I didn’t really try to do much to enhance my accounting knowledge or try to prove to my boss that I knew what I was doing in accounting. It was one of those scenarios where I got stuck in a rut again but with COVID, I wasn’t sure what to do. So, I got laid off and have been doing some soul searching and trying to figure out what I do like. I found out after this most recent job that I don’t like accounting. Maybe law school? Maybe something else entirely? I’m not sure. I feel almost like a boat without a paddle. I’m just treading along, not sure what to do and can’t seem to move forward. I feel all this pressure from my family and friends that I need to have it figured out or, because some of my friends knew what they wanted to do with their life and got these great jobs and bought a house and got married that I need to follow in those footsteps. It’s frustrating!"
3714,"The honest answer is because these things compound over time. When you start a career after college you come in at entry level pay and ideally get raises every year. Raises are percentage based, not flat increases, so the biggest raises tend to come later into careers. Graduating 10 years later than everyone else in your career path puts you behind in terms of pay and you are unlikely to ever catch up.

On top of that, retirement savings also compound. Starting 10 years earlier could literally mean millions of extra dollars in retirement, as well as better health in retirement as you can retire earlier. 

Nobody is perfect, and this isn't a reason to hate yourself. But as someone who took 7 years to complete undergrad, I can tell you definitively that you're lying to yourself if you don't think you have ground to make up. Just get to work, feeling too good or bad about yourself does nothing to help you."
3715,I feel ya. I'm floating around aimlessly  and I'm not sure if that's a bad or good thing.
3716,"Burnout is a healthy learning experience that I think can positively shape everybody. But burnout is not all there is. Through burnout you can shift what your real priorities are and take it as a learning experience. It sounds like your work experience was textbook bad culture that enforces burnout. Trust me, there are jobs that make you feel energized and refreshed"
3717,"I work in payroll and will say that taking an unpaid lunch and working through it is illegal — well, the company will get in trouble, not you.

What state are you in, California? It sounds like it based on how you describe the overtime. I can give some advice on the wage and hour laws also so that you can have some expectation of what is proper, etc. I work payroll in California so I have that knowledge but to get certified you have to know federal laws and I’ve done payroll in every US state. :)"
3718,Naw quit.
3719,"Haha I don’t know what you do in automotive that is low stress but color me jealous! Even with long design cycles it’s one of the most complex industries in the world, and with the automotive market currently being in a downturn it seems like everybody is more stressed these days."
3720,time for a new job
3721,Sounds like you went from a 1/10 job to a 2/10 job and that it appears to you that this is how it is. Definitely is not this way. Forcing overtime and working on weekends I'd absolute ass and they clearly have nothing in their own guidelines to account for making their employees happy. Find a company that does.
3722,Sounds like your coworkers are those that'll sue the company when they go to quit because they'll say we never got a lunch break but we worked through it
3723,Your mental health is more important. Start applying for new jobs ASAP. Working through your lunch as well as unpaid overtime is not normal.
3724,Wow that sounds absolutely awful. What do you do?
3725,"It's an experience that can be beneficial just like someone pointed out. You will learn what are your limits and your priorities. 

Please quit if your body is telling you so! I quit when my mental health went downhill."
3726,"It sounds as if this job is not worth your sanity and well being. You should not have to work through break- I had jobs like this as well idk why people seem so surprised and yes it was in America. Some places know you need the work and take advantage. 
Unrelated- your display name had me cracking up"
3727,"Hmmm no? My cousin is a firefighter and he enjoys his job a lot, he even said he would do it for free if he had to,"
3728,Have you heard of Investment Banking?
3729,Maybe switch industries?
3730,[deleted]
3731,"Yeah I heard something similar too. I think it was that when you do the same thing every day your brain stops “making memories” so the days just all run together. If someone wants to slow down time, they should try to do something different everyday to make new memories."
3732,"Totally the routine. A day where I go to work, make dinner, go for a run, play games is just like every other one and I tune it out. A night where I meet up with friends or do something new is memorable. Also, meditation and reflection on your days can help."
3733,"My theory on this is that a lot of your younger life is punctuated by extreme feelings and moments. Things are more raw, you have sex for the first time, you get high or drunk for the first time. 

High school felt like 10 years... it was 4. College felt like 10 years... it was 5 (what up super seniors). I graduated 10 years ago. It’s felt like 3 or 4. 

I think you find a routine. Wake up, go to work, go to the gym, play video games, jerk off, have sex with your girlfriend or wife, go to bed and repeat. How often do you challenge yourself, how often do you experience new things?  You were forced to when you were younger but after a while it takes more to surprise you, more to make you fee l the same clarity and presence when you were younger. 

That’s how I see it anyway, which is why my personal philosophy is to try to experience as many new things as I can and to travel every chance I get."
3734,"Please tell me your joking. My college is almost over and it feels like the 4 years went by in about 2 months. I was looking forward to having time slow down once I got out of college.

Does anyone have any advice for how to make the most of it and not wake up 10 years later feeling like you just started?"
3735,"Second to the last paragraph, really well said!!"
3736,"Someone told me before I went to college, every year you get older it goes faster. It’s been nothing but true; I’m now 3 years out of graduate school."
3737,This guy knows his math ;)
3738,It’s the routine man.
3739,"It’s also crazy how much happens in your 20s. Ten years. But wow does life change. For me at 20. I was finishing community college getting ready to move into a 4 year school to finish my bachelors. At 29 I’ve been married for almost 5 years, I have a 3 year old daughter, and I’ve found my forever career job. If you asked me if any of that would happen when I was 20 I would have looked at you and said “KIDS? OH HECK NO”"
3740,Yes! I feel the same way since graduating college 3 years ago. Idk what it is but time never seemed to go this quickly growing up.
3741,I turned around and 25 years have gone by.  It’s fucking terrifying.  My brain thinks I’m 22 but my body disagrees.
3742,"I am constantly realizing this. Time goes by faster and faster. In my school time, time never went fast enough. (The fact that I was a bully magnet didn't help.) But the older I get (48 years now), I find that time literally flies. The way I see it, it happens to us all."
3743,You’ll find that the days feel longer and the years feel shorter as you get older.
3744,"Yes, absolutely.  It has been 8 years since I graduated and it has gone by in the blink of an eye. 

If you want some advice, intentionally plan to hang out with people, old friends and new, and do weekend trips/vacations or whatever you and your friends are into.   Plan for a hobby if you have one or find one if you don’t.   Friends will just fade away over time without you even noticing if you are not paying attention.    The routine of a job sometimes sucks out the fun of life if you focus only on it, and once people start families all bets are off."
3745,"I’m 16 and I’m already feeling like this. I try to live in the moment, notice the little things like a bird collecting twigs in my garden or something sappy like that. My biggest fear is regret and I already have plenty of those. I’m scared accumulating more but (I hope this doesn’t sound trivial let alone ignorant) life’s pretty hard atm for a number of reasons. Any advice from you folks would be welcome."
3746,"Are you me? Spent three years going to CC down in Santa Monica, and by the end of it just wanted to transfer since it felt like a lifetime while my friends were enjoying the ""true college experience.""

Get into a good school in the Bay Area for a 2 year program, and though it went by rather quickly, also felt like I wanted to just graduate when I was approaching the last semester.

Now almost a year into my first career-type job, can't believe it's been a year already lol.

As others have mentioned, the routine of ""clocking in"" during the week, has been the same. Wake up, gym, hit the desk, leave, dinner, and bed early. Weekends come and go, as I try to fit some fun activities in while catching up on the chores I couldn't do during the week. Been trying to slow things down a bit, especially now that I live in such a ""fast paced city"" (NYC), such as enjoying a quiet afternoon at a cafe, morning walks, and now that the weather is getting better, planning small trips as well."
3747,"High schooler here, yes. one minute I’m in first next minute it’s lunch haha

One day it’s Sunday then next thing I know it’s already friday"
3748,What did you go to graduate school for out of curiosity? I graduated  with my bachelors last May and have been thinking about going back
3749,You sound like me when I was younger. You'll be surprised how well things can turn out. Just the right amount of suffering makes a better off. :)
3750,"Opposite for me, high school feels like it’s going extremely slow, like everyday is a challenge to get through. Same repetitive actions over and over again"
3751,"Each consecutive year is a smaller percentage of your life than the year before it. When you’re 20 a year is 5% of your life, when you’re 50 a year is 2%."
3752,"For me, K-12 crawled by, college went by fast, and time now flies.  It's crazy!"
3753,Absolutely. Time is flying ever since I graduated.
3754,"Yeah, and I hate it. I don’t like that I’m getting older, although I definitely think being in college/working is way better than me just enjoying my hobbies all day.  Sounds weird now that I write it."
3755,Thermometers have lots of degrees and you know where they shove them!
3756,Absolutely!
3757,Moved from Cali to NY huh? Must be nice
3758,I got my doctorate in physical therapy. Definitely do the x’s and o’s if more debt is worth the degree. Some grad degrees are not.
3759,"That’s how it used to be in jr high for me, I think as time went on I just got used to it haha"
3760,apparently for my school it does lol
3761,They deactivated mine an hour after graduation.
3762,[deleted]
3763,"My undergrad email (class of ‘13) still works and always will. My dad is also an alum and retroactively gained a .edu email which is his primary email now, since it’s guaranteed for life by the university. 

My grad school email (class of ‘15) warned me after graduation that it would be deleted after 6 months. IIRC it lasted almost a year but I never used it as my primary so I wasn’t logging in frequently."
3764,"My school SAID it did. But I don’t have access and graduated 2016. The key might be to keep it active - I was forwarding all emails to my personal one, so didn’t login for a while."
3765,15 years and counting. Fair warning they told me it wouldn’t last a semester after I graduated. No idea what’s going on there but I still use it.
3766,I graduated in 2016 and mine still works
3767,I don't see why they would deactivate it. Don't see any reason to and that would be messed up.
3768,"Graduated in 2015 and mine is still going strong. Pretty sure they said we get to keep them for life, at my uni, anyways."
3769,at my school as long as you log in at least once every 30 days you get to keep the email and the unlimited google drive access forever
3770,Utterly depends on the college.
3771,For my school it was 6 months
3772,Mine was deactivated after a merger that happened this last year.
3773,"Graduated in 2016, still have my school email (though til this day i forget the password lol).

The real treasure is in your student ID if you still have it. I can get into bars for no cover charge and even got a student discount when I bought my new laptop recently."
3774,for the purpose of discounts only?
3775,Been almost 2 years for me lol!
3776,"2017

Though, mind you they sent out emails saying that it would be deactivated 6 months after graduation but that obviously didn’t happen."
3777,When did you graduate?
3778,"LMAO it’s a real shit show because ours is deleted two months after graduation. However, the other colleges in the area get to keep theirs."
3779,My ended 12 months after graduation. Was pissed and lost some important account access. Be sure and not link anything to important !
3780,Graduated back in 1969 and still working
3781,"I have a pretty common name though (think John Smith) and our emails are just F.Lastname@university......   f being first name  initial 

So it is probably that someone else was coming in the following months in the new class that would have been given my email. 

I knew someone else with the same initial-lastname combo but their email was f.lastname7@university..... 

Assuming the university had emails since the early 90’s and close to 10,000 new students a year I am not surprised they recycled them quickly otherwise my email would have been f.lastname4289@university....."
3782,"I graduated  in ‘15 and mines still active, I use it A LOT, so I hope it never expires."
3783,i transferred schools and my original school's email was active for about 2 maybe 3 years after I left. My partner's was deactivated within months though but she went to a different School. I'm guessing it entirely depends on how well the individual institution's server is maintained.
3784,Same here
3785,6 years later still active. I get an email every year to keep it active.
3786,I got an email about a week after graduation saying I could keep it active by setting up a reoccurring donation to the alumni whatever.. made a gmail that day.
3787,Mine deactivated the Monday following graduation. Sucks cause I used it for everything
3788,"For mine it depends on if you’ve set up forwarding. I’d always had it active so I neeeever checked the email address. I think I can no longer log in, access was shut down 9 months after graduation, but I do still receive some emails that are sent to that address. It’s not consistent tho, so I just stopped using it."
3789,The worst was like two weeks after I graduated wanting to read academic articles while paying thousands in student loans and not able to go back to read any articles because all of that stuff goes😳
3790,"Have you ever considered returning to school to become a teacher? You’d get similar times off, many teachers form meaningful relationships with each other since it’s often such a collaborative environment, and while you wouldn’t be looking up to teachers anymore, you’d have students who’d look up to you."
3791,"Hey, I feel the same way. I graduated last year, I'm not where I need to be right now in life, and between college and high school, oddly enough I'm starting to miss high school more. 

But I do miss college for sure. The freedom, stupidity, all of it. 

I don't really have any advice to offer, but I'm in the same position. I think if we pick up more hobbies to occupy our time it will vanish. 

But y eah,  you're not alone at all."
3792,"Forming meaningful relationships in the workplace or talking to old friends isn't necessarily difficult or impossible- it really just depends on how much effort you put in. All these things are there if you want them in adult life, you just need to find the right environments for them and make a conscious effort. Like I've personally always gravitated towards small offices, which I've liked since it's easy to develop camaraderie with people. With friends, I've had a handful of close friends from childhood, high school, college that I continually make the effort to call periodically and see when I'm back in my hometown.Even though we're all in different places and moved away, you just need to dedicate yourself to maintaining and building connections and it happens. A lot of them actually appreciate my taking the time and say I'm one of the few people from school they're still regularly in touch with.

Everyone gets out of school thinking, ""oh, I'll be working and have no time and everyone will lose touch,"" and then that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. My mindset on finishing my masters (went straight from undergrad) was, ""6 years of school and I'm finally in control of my own destiny! No being forced to constantly follow someone else's schedule! I'll finally be able to do what I please with my time!"" Granted, architecture school doesn't give you much time and is suicide, so for me it felt like liberation getting into the workforce, but the mindset point stands- when you get out, how will you think of things? There are two possible mindsets- ""ok, time to see my world fall apart and wait until I die"" or ""I've got my entire life ahead of me and no one to tell me what to do! This is awesome!"""
3793,[deleted]
3794,I thought about it but it's not my personally because I'm more introverted. I just don't have that authoritative personality. No problem being a student but I'd get burnt out from the kids. Becoming a teacher just to relive it sounds like the wrong reason to get into it  but I get what you're saying.
3795,Going back to school just because you miss the lifestyle of being a student isn't a good move.
3796,I have one year left of college and I already know I'm gonna miss it so much. I really hope my last term is in person so I can live with my friends one last time
3797,Agree. It's for the wrong reasons.
3798,Oh god I just graduated college. This is going to be me. Fuck I’m scared.
3799,No advice to give but empathy - I'm in the same boat. I'm 4 years out and I still miss it.
3800,"""I guess this is growing up"" - Blink 182. Damnit"
3801,"I feel you! Sometimes I see something like a throwback pic/video or catch up with an old college friend that makes me nostalgic and reminisce about my college days. However though it’s been 3 years since I graduated from undergrad, I don’t think I necessarily “miss” college. Sure, I miss the carefree days compared to now where being an adult in almost every way is stressful lol but I think a lot of what you’ve mentioned can still be possible, just in a different way. 

You can still wear clothes you want to wear, just on the weekends or if you go out at night. It’s harder to stay in touch with friends bc we all have our own lives but if you and your friends make it a point to meet up at least a couple of times a month no matter what, you’ll have something to look forward to!! If you don’t have people in higher positions at your place of work that you can look up to, why not twist it and try to find a mentorship program in your area where you can be a mentor to someone else!? Hobbies are also a great thing to have to, especially if they’re hobbies that allows you to meet new people. 

I know these things will never replace college days and things will always be different, but it definitely doesn’t have to be unpleasant. I’m at a place now where I thoroughly enjoy this new life. Working five days a week is a drag sometimes, it definitely feels monotonous at times lol and not having summers off is a drag but planning how I spend every weekend is exciting and gives me something to look forward to every single week. Also planning a new city or country to vacation and having the money and freedom to do that is amazing!"
3802,"> You can still wear clothes you want to wear, just on the weekends      

&#x200B;

That's what bothers me so much. It's a minor issue but I really have to wait till it's 5PM or Sat/Sun to wear the clothes I want to wear? It just doesn't sit right with me for some reason."
3803,"I haven't been able to read through all the comments (I see someone suggested being a teacher), but have you thought about trying to work at a University? It could at least provide you the environment that you like. I think the setting is a big factor in how you feel. Nothing in life is going to get simpler though, it is still a job.

I miss not having responsibility and I've only graduated a year ago! So I feel your pain"
3804,Being an adult ain’t easy.
3805,"This is a rather unhealthy mindset, college was fun, I think fondly of it all the time, but it's done. It's time to move on when you graduated. 

The friends I made from college are still my close friends now. If we're in the city, we hang out during the weekends. If they're not, we see each other by going on trips or visiting each other's cities. It's not as convenient as being on campus 24/7 but its just as fun when we see each other. You get to go through a new stage of life with people your trust. The things that you can do together also opens up because now everyone has a job. 

No one is preventing you from wearing whatever you want to wear. That's just at (some) jobs. Weekends are all yours. 

You can seek mentorship at work or take online classes if you want to continue your growth. 

The lack of structure in adult life doesn't mean you can't make the most out if. You have more freedom to pursue what you want. Focus on improving the present because you can't rewind time. 

You can also do grad school which will give you some of that satisfaction, but it won't be like undergrad."
3806,Nice
3807,"I graduated 11 years ago and can totally relate. Don't get me wrong — having a job is great — but there are so many things I miss about school:

* It's generally much harder to make friends when you're out of school. Even though I spend many hours working with others, there's often a stigma associated with making friends with co-workers.
* You could find so many things to do on campus. Back when I was in college, there was no shortage of events. One thing I really enjoyed as a teen was going to school dances. I rarely see many such ""fun"" events at the office. Sure, you can find public events on sites like Meetup, but they're not the same.
* I've never heard of a job (outside the education sector) that gives you a spring break or several weeks off during summer. Although some companies do offer ""unlimited"" PTO, that usually comes with strings attached.
* Students don't have to worry about ""job security"" as much. Due to at-will employment laws, companies can let you go for any reason. I was laid off out of the blue at a previous job even both my boss and his boss seemed to like me. At least in school, you can't get expelled unless you do badly academically or commit a serious rule violation."
3808,Just volunteer for a campaign or local non profit lmao
3809,"hey, whats ur job bro?"
3810,Go back to school!
3811,"Most stories I’ve heard of OP’s description include master degrees or grad students who do not want to do low-ladder work because they see themselves as better than that. 

What sucks is that, even if you bypass all the obstacles seen in the job market like filling pointless online applications or HR being stringent on who they accept, most low level/entry jobs are just grunt work. Most higher positions are only given to candidates with actual work experience (a degree can only prove so much to an employer). And in today’s job market if you want a promotion you are more than likely are just going to be jumping from company to company.

But just getting your foot in the door requires people having to do some of the worst jobs that no one else wants to, even the more experienced, higher position personal. As someone who does not see themselves getting into a masters program, I’m truly proud of what other people can do and wish them the best."

3813,Examples of limited fields?
3814,"I got a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Studies and had all my experience geared towards education and social work. Two years out of college, I am now working in finance. Totally different path than I ever saw myself on, but I think it’s working out pretty well."
3815,I have a question: do you have any tips for note taking?
3816,"I make above 44k ? For a entry level that’s good
For me"
3817,Gee its almost like school had nothing to do with preparing you for a career and they were just happy to take your money anyway.  Hmmmmm.
3818,I’m a history major doing pretty well in software sales. I wish I had more opportunities to showcase my knowledge of 20th century geopolitics but the pay is good.
3819,"Out of college, I was working with refugees at an inner city public school district. I was financially independent but not making very much money ($32k), so I became more interested in managing my money and investing smartly. I had a couple friends in finance (financial advising, real estate, etc.) who seemed to be enjoying their lives and their work. Talking with them, I became more engaged in finance and inclined towards the industry. As much as I loved the mission of my job and the families I worked with, I did not enjoy the colleagues and other public service bullshit that surrounded it. I wanted more professional growth, financial security, and a healthier working environment. 

I saw an opportunity to work in securities trading and decided to at least just apply and see what would happen. I wasn’t sure if I would actually take it or not. But boom! I got the job, and I decided the benefits and opportunity for personal and professional growth were more than I could pass up."
3820,"Meh, degrees don’t really matter for most jobs is just a box filler, I have some friends that majored in criminal justice and they are now working for big IT companies"
3821,How do you get into finance? Do you work as an advisor??
3822,Do what you’re happy doing.
3823,"I work in securities trading (the stock market). You can read my comment below for more details, but really I just fell into it by chance after gaining interest in taking control of my own finances. 

As long as you have some sort of degree, I believe the rest is all about selling yourself.  Where I work, many of the people came from completely different industries before building a career in finance. You have to be able to take what may seem unrelated and make it apply and make sense to the new job. You have to have the right attitude, the hunger to succeed, and a strong dedication and willingness to learn and adapt."
3824,"Not question asker but thanks for this in depth explanation that’s also nicely written. 

Good job man. I bet this took a little bit of time too. So awesome you put in that effort. 🌠"
3825,I work for the fire department making good money and it’s no where related to my business bachelors degree
3826,"A lot of the companies I’ve worked for have people doing very well professionally who didn’t major in something directly related to the actual job they are doing, you really aren’t as tethered to your major as you think"
3827,"I had a lot of difficulty deciding what to study in undergrad and wound up falling into historic preservation. I loved art and history, so I thought I could find a job in a museum or archive and be able to enjoy it. It was a nice program with nice people and interesting subject matter, and seemed like something I’d enjoy since I was convinced at the time I couldn’t get a job with a design degree (mostly by my overbearing, image-conscious mother).

Unfortunately, the job market for something like that tends to be very limited, so by the time senior year rolled around, I was nervous. It was then that I bit the bullet and applied for a master’s program in graphic design. Two years later, I earned my diploma and got a great job in the field three months after graduation. 

I sometimes feel down on myself because I didn’t take a clearer path, but looking back, I really enjoyed my time in that program. I was in a great place with great people, took some great classes, and the friends I made at that school wound up being like my second family. I also like to write, so through my studies, I got very good at doing thorough research and being able to back up my ideas with facts, something which definitely helps in my current job.

I often wonder if sometime in the future, I’ll find myself working at a museum if my main field dries up. But right now, I’m doing just fine :)"
3828,TIL it’s not spelled “segway”...
3829,I respect that
3830,"That sounds awesome!  I have an engineering degree and have been out of work for a year.  Engineering is so stressful and draining, what you're doing sounds like something that might really be up my alley.  Are you working at just a public university doing this?"
3831,"This is very dependent on the degree, but it doesn’t seem like it matters for the most part. I studied Economics and I don’t ever use that knowledge. It’s more the things that went into getting a degree, like writing and getting assignments done on time, that seems to be what’s important. At least in my limited experience."
3832,Not using your degree and not having a degree are two different things. Having at least some type of degree opens up a lot of opportunities in even unrelated fields.
3833,[deleted]
3834,"That’s amazing! Congrats! Sorry if this question is out of line, but I’m genuinely curious - do you make a lot more now than you did in your initial job?"
3835,"It's complicated, but I'm not using my degree at the moment. I went into college knowing that my bachelor's degree was going to be basically useless without a master's (I have a degree in psychology). I'm working towards getting my master's degree in clinical psychology now. At the moment, though, I work at an amusement park. The pay is 1.5x the current minimum wage and I get some pretty nice benefits. Of course, it would be nice to be paid a living wage, but I am doing alright. I love my current job and do kind of wonder what's going to happen once I need to start an internship to get my master's."
3836,May I ask what was your segue into finance?
3837,"Currently out of work, but yes, it was a public university back in the UK. I was actually employed by an external support worker service, but the lecturers usually knew about this and just let me do my thing."
3838,"> Don’t try to take notes exactly word for word, but if you can preserve the technical language the lecturer is using, try to do so.

This is how I did all my notetaking in high school and college. I never would have had the time to write out full sentences word-for-word. I would always capture the big ideas, write those words down, and leave out all of the ""and"" ""is"" ""that"" etc. Then when I had to take notes for a student, I would clean it up later while I was typing."
3839,"Oh ok, well I'm over in the US, but I imagine there are similar positions here.  I really need to look into it, that sounds like a great gig!  It kinda sucks that the fall semester just started though."
3840,"Read the first comment, ya nutter butter"
3841,What's your degree in?
3842,"Presumably you have statistical training (at undergrad we learnt SPSS). Learn Rstudio and Python in your off time and maybe you could get an analyst/research job.

Might not be for you but just a suggestion :)"
3843,Also I think the majority of jobs (not engineering or med school Obvi) can be done without a degree & just the job training.
3844,While this may be the case now there is a good chance that in a few years you will be the one who gets the promotion or the new job you've applied for because you went to college and the other candidate did not.
3845,[deleted]
3846,Yeah probably
3847,"I did basically the same and feel the same way haha. Spanish and Sociology. But the job I’m doing now only needed a bachelors, so I’m doing bilingual case management. Maybe this is something you could look into? I’m not licensed or anything as a social worker, I just know how to talk to people in 2 languages lol"
3848,Probably an unpopular opinion on this sub but I don't care: be happy you have a job at all and stop feeling bad for yourself
3849,this is true but the system is just so...ugh. frustrating. the idea that my worth as a worker is based on the amount of education i have is just shitty tbh. like i'm just as worthy of a livable wage as i was before my degree. i'm just complaining bc it's cathartic.
3850,"I've been learning RStudio recently and it's a lot better than SPSS, of which I spent three years learning during undergrad. Wish we'd just started with R."
3851,Join the club
3852,Hard agree. Had the best time of my life at college and got to do so many fun things I would have never done otherwise. But it was such a waste of money
3853,"Good luck with learning! I know I was really scared when I first saw all the code, but it ended up being very intuitive once you become more familiar. I even started learning some LaTeX code to make fancy tables in R markdown documents!"
3854,That’s so true! In the future it will pay off. People without degrees will always be capped at a certain level and it’s a stupid system
3855,"Yeah, its absolutely ridiculous, like you have loads of boomers who retire from jobs they did very well for decades and now they wouldn't be qualified for them because they didn't go to college...  
Nowadays companies just expect you to have gone to college even if it has no merit for the job, apparently they hope to get more ""rounded"" characters by only taking more educated people..."
3856,Thanks for the suggestions!
3857,"Not trying to be a dick, but non-STEM degrees (and even some stem) are pretty garbage. I wouldnt discount all college because a degree was picked without a career goal."
3858,"So the way I have it right now is a white board that’s divided into four sections. One is a running grocery list. One is a to do list I have to today- designated chores for that day (the mopping, sweeping, grocery shopping if it’s grocery day, etc). Third section is the long time frame to do list and I have to do at least one each weekend. Right now it’s reupholstering the chairs, setting up the basement for the bar, fixing up the backyard for the fall, etc. Last section is a daily check list that has to happen before I unwind for the night- clean the litter box, clean off the table, wipe down kitchen counters."
3859,Make a physical planner or list. something that just isn’t tucked in the corner of your mind
3860,"Try giving your brain and body some breaks. For me, I meditate or read science fiction and listen to Satie. It energizes my spirit and my body feels a whole lot better for the next week. The reading also encourages me to read other material outside of my comfort zone. Also, stretch when you can or feel like it, and drink twice the amount of water you are already consuming."
3861,"Lists are helpful to me like everyone said. Also during the week, try to plan a few activities and events for the weekend. Also make sure you plan some free time for yourself. In the beginning of post grad, I would work all week & feel up my weekends.. I had no real time to myself & that became exhausting. 

Explore some hobbies too! The positive to this free time is you can explore & learn what else you like. You’ll learn more about yourself as a person."
3862,Everyone already gave good advice but I would suggest trying to knock out one or two items on your list during the week as well. I’ve found that eases the pressure of getting things done on the weekend and helps the avoidance/procrastination associated with it.
3863,"I tracked my time in 15min intervals for a few days. The amount of time i wasted looking at my phone was a huge wake up. I picked up a few extra hobbies and am determined to keep trying new things. 

Try it, it’ll shock you what you spend you time doing. 

Ie, 
7.30am - wake up brush teeth. 

7.45a- get dressed, let dog out. 

8am drive to work 

5pm home from work. Let dog out 
5.15pm- on phone
5.30pm prep dinner

Etc. you become hyper aware of what you do."
3864,"I agree with the comments above. I struggled with the same thing when I started working full time in May. I made a to-do list of things I eventually needed done. I made a goal to get one thing done during the week or on my lunch break and another to get done during the weekend. Also planning ahead really helps- even scheduling times when I want to get together with friends or going back home to see family  helps me balance out things when I want to get my to-do list done. 

Also I’ve noticed that sometimes the energy to get those things done doesn’t always come. So just push through... you’ll feel a lot better once you get stuff checked off. 

Good luck!"
3865,I try to make big chores (like furniture shopping) a fun outing with friends or a date. It’s not as stressful as it seems (unless you go to a furniture store where people work on commission lol)
3866,Does that not drive you insane being aware of how you spend every bit of time?
3867,It makes me more aware so I am more conscious of how much time I spend doing frivolous things.
3868,"Depending on how crazy you want to be with it, budget your time like you budget your money. Calculate the number of hours outside of sleep that you have each month. Then calculate how much of your time is spent getting ready for work and bed, at work and commuting. That net time is what you have left over to you to divide between things like grocery shopping, showering, and free time. You can even start logging your times to see where you’re spending the most of your time and assess whether you like that. To borrow advice from personal finance, no matter how much money you make, 10% of it should be yours for whatever you want. No matter how much time you work, 10% of your time should be yours to use as you please. Minimum. So think about where you’re allocating that 10%

I will say that as time goes on and you get more money, you may prioritize time over money if it means convenience. Time is a limited commodity. You can’t get more of it. So for me, paying a $10 fee for grocery delivery makes sense because the hour spent doing the pickup can be spent on something else. Likewise paying $50/mo to park at the train station means I don’t have to eat into my sleep any more than I have to"
3869,"This. I bought a physical planner a few weeks ago. I write a lot down. Both personal and professional tasks. It's definitely helped keep me organized and aware of what I need to get done. Writing it down somehow means you should never forget because you'll always be reminded when you check (whether that's through keeping a physical planner, using Google calendar, or using some kind of digital list or productivity app - you have options for how you manage your time)."
3870,"I agree with the poster who says you are being taken advantage of.  I have been in the work force 35yrs and will tell you a couple FACTS I have learned along the way:

* Not all companies treat their workers this way
* If you don't stand up for yourself when it comes to ""fair treatment"", there is probably no one else who is going to do it for you.  In other words, if you let them 4hit on you, they will...

Stand up for yourself and go find a better employer/situation.  Life is too short....

&#x200B;

Good luck!"
3871,"Like the other two said OP, find something new... OR before you do that, speak up and say how you feel to your supervisor or boss. Don't come off rude or condescending, but tell them what you were promised and what's going on right now. If that doesn't work, then put in your two weeks and leave."
3872,Ya I would just leave. Don't get caught up in staying just because of the money and the need to survive. It's not worth it.
3873,[deleted]
3874,"If you're feeling burned out after one month, that's a bad sign.  If you're dealing with so much beyond that, like you are, then that's even worse.  You need to prioritize your physical and mental health.  This job isn't worth it, and it sounds like you already know this.  Start looking for something new ASAP.  

If dealing with small town politics isn't something you want either, is there any reason you can't also move?  I don't know your circumstances, but maybe a change of scenery would be a good thing for you.  That's also something to think about, because if you're willing to relocate, your job options also increase significantly."
3875,"This specific job that OP is talking about sounds like absolute BS, but going from school into the full time workforce is just an exhausting change all together. 

It's like starting a brand new, intensive workout routine of a bunch of stuff that you probably haven't really done. It's going to kick your ass for a while until you adapt, get stronger, and learn how to make it work a little more in your favor. 

Soon enough a month won't feel so bad - you'll be more productive, able to handle the stress and workload more easily, and hopefully learn how to maximize your relaxation and time away from work. This doesn't have to mean you're becoming part of ""the system"" or getting owned by The Man though.

Right now work is making you its bitch because you're new and inexperienced, but eventually you'll be able to make work *your* bitch and use it to fund the cool life that you want to live."
3876,"a dollar less a day is 1500 a year, to me thats a new monitor , gpu and then some etc etc so idk id want what im was  told id get"
3877,"this is just slave labor, no vacation days? and it's def not right to break promises on BOTH salary and benefits. and tbh unless your getting paid 70k+/year or getting paid 1.5 OT working weekends is not worth it, I would start looking for another job asap, but try to hold out on this one until then, or you can quit if you got a couple months of rent/expenses saved up"
3878,"> jump ship as many times as possible

Doesn't it look bad if you're changing jobs every few months?"
3879,"Agreed. With one addendum - unions, unions are maybe the one not you person who will help with “fair treatment”."
3880,"Or food/investments. A big mistake people make is taking unexpected income and blowing it instead of turning it into more money/necessities. Not trying to accuse you, just wanted to state it for the thread"
3881,"Is this a journalism job? Sounds like a journalism job. I worked in the field for a year before I got too burnt out and realized I couldn’t keep up with demands of wearing so many hats and being “on call” practically all the time. If you’re a writer, sadly it seems most of the jobs in the industry are fairly low-pay and expect too much from workers (mandatory overtime, no vacation, guilting you for not working weekends, etc). But there are definitely better jobs than what you’re dealing with right now. Keep your options open and research other companies in your area who may be able to treat you better. I wish you luck!"
3882,"I get it my point was the same, I didn't want to type out paragraphs of text"
3883,"I was going to say this, too. OP is going through some specific bullshit at work, but I think everyone needs to prepare - your first year of full time work is going to be fucking exhausting.

You’re learning so much every day, not just about your job, but about how people work together, or often, how they don’t. Even if you have a fun job, going in and doing it every single day gets old fast. 

I’m almost 30 and been at a new job just over 6 months. I’ve never seen my boss eat. We’re a small team, and she will get in the office in the morning and not move until it’s home time.

In my first few jobs I would have followed her lead. Now I walk out, go for a walk, have some lunch and a coffee and come back.  I’m entitled to a lunch break. If she wants to not take care of herself, that’s on her, but I don’t bother asking her.

Eventually, you’ll get there, too."
3884,"It’s really hard to say since all jobs are so different but buying large it’s grind time for you. You’re new and you need to prove yourself and build your skills. College does not skip the grind, it merely delays it"
3885,"Edit: Also, not sure if you have, speak to your company about the issues you've been having. Give them some ideas how solutions you'd like to see the company follow through on. If they refuse to budge or help you on these things then they are no longer worth your time.

Please please pleeeease look into market. Whether it's a job that uses your degree or not. Take a breath and look at what you've accomplished or the skills you have been using at this job. Go back to your resume and edit it. Find jobs that might pay better or offer benefits that enable you to live the life you want. 

Wanna be freelance? Awesome you can definitely do it! But what steps does it take to get there? Maybe, an online presence needs to be curated. Make good connections at the job you're at now. Start finding little ways to save money and put into a separate savings account so that you have some cushion. When you have enough saved, and have some willing clients then quit.

Talk with family or friends and bounce ideas on what to do next. Since they personally know you they will give more tailored advice or have insight to some connect near you.

Lastly, take a minute to constructively review your time since graduation. What have you done that you liked, didnt like, you feel you missed out on, stuff you're glad you didnt do. And start to get a better sense of what you truly value in your life. (I say that cause I need to do it too).

Good luck with it, and I know change will happen for you. Great YouTube channel I got most of that stuff from is TheFinancialDiet. They taught me a lot about reflecting and changing to make a life I would want."
3886,Dude go talk to someone at HR and see what you can do to change some of this. Cause it’s absolute BS. They are just taking advantage of the fact that you’re a new grad and will work for them and do anything.
3887,Clearly your job sucks. Quit.
3888,How did you come up with this number?
3889,"It is a journalism job, but at least I didn’t get my degree in it so it makes it easier to switch fields. Thanks for your kind words. What do you do now?"
3890,Hours * days * weeks * months * year - tax
3891,"I also thankfully didn’t get a journalism degree, instead I majored in communications so I could switch to PR/publishing if I needed to. Those places typically are a little less chaotic and have better schedules... and you actually have off on holidays!

Now I work as a digital marketing director for a small local publishing company, so I get to run social media accounts/write blog posts. I definitely still have to wear a lot of hats (gotta do some sales, which I dislike, but I also write for our publications and copyedit which I enjoy). Even though I get frustrated with the amount of tasks I have sometimes, it’s worth it for a guaranteed close-to-home, 9-5 job that lets me exercise my creativity once in awhile and still makes my degree worthwhile."
3892,Coworkers and politics is just real life stuff no one prepares you for
3893,"Yeah, no my friend. This isn’t right, I know it’s probably not what you want but you should resign. What they’re doing is pure exploitation, more than the usual. Fuck those guys. You deserve way better!"
3894,"What is your degree in?  
This is the sort of job you end up with a poly sci.  
  
Capitalism cuts both ways. Always be marking yourself to market.  
Everyone hates redtape and hassle. Getting you anything more than 3%/yr requires a lot of hassle on your bosses part. Even if he makes a really good pitch for 10% his boss will probably still say ""no"" ... unless your boss is also on top of his game, also knows what it will cost to hire a replacement, because he is always interviewing, and can go to his boss and say ""X is going to quit if we don't match Y and their replacement cost is Z"" | Z>Y. Head-hunters (recruiters) take a cut so there's that cost as well.  
  
The more you interview the better you will get at it and when you finally are ready to make a move having multiple interviews going forward will instill a sense of urgency in the hiring parties and make them move faster and offer you more. Schedule multiple interviews on the same day so that you can honest say ""I have a hard-stop at X o'clock."" Don't offer why. If they ask then say you had another interview scheduled but squeezed them in. Getting hired is lot about making HR feel really important even though they are net-negatives.  
  
My current record for landing a new job after being laid-off is *two hours*. (It is also my last move, within a year, not something that happened in the 70's.)"
3895,"Don't think that a different job will feel the same. I finally found a job that I actually don't mind going to every day and I've been here for 10 months so far. I know I'm very fortunate and still enjoy browsing this sub, but try not to assume that all jobs will feel like this one. It sounds pretty rough."
3896,"Hey, late comment here but I'm in the same position except that I rarely work overtime. I guess there's something about doing uninspired, mundane things that make you feel burnt out. 

Start looking for ways out, and don't work during lunch break! I ignore any phone calls during my break. Unless there's an extremely urgent deadline, which luckily has rarely happened.

The next job might or might not be better, but at least you get a change of environment. The change itself is worth it. At least you won't be stuck in the same place where you're 100% miserable"
3897,"Changing jobs for the sake of changing jobs is not what i was going after. Some people think that the best opportunity to move up is internal, but much more often the case is that there are better opportunities outside your current company. People tend to not move because they are comfortable where they are. Ultimately, ""as many times as possible"" is a poor choice of words, its more like experience as much as possible, and you are not getting anything new out of your current situation, it might be a sign to move on."
3898,I think you’re missing a 0 at the end there
3899,"Indeed, I was, I'm preparing for an interview, and I am writing on my other monitor, thanks for pointing it out"
3900,"Given I have a fiancée so I’m not really alone 24/7, but as far as time with the boys that pretty much ended after college. Everybody has work and other responsibilities and my buddies all moved back to my hometown so some weekend or week night gaming is really all I get. Sadly just a part of growing up. I also am a 2018 grad so I have a few years of this.

If you game or have friends that are into it maybe that’s a good option?"
3901,"Yeah I am pretty much the same. I have literally no one, if I were to celebrate my birthday or some other event I wouldn't have anyone to be with me. Maybe I could convince some family member but that just out of obligation.

At this point I think that's just being an adult, sure some people have friends but more often that not they've been friends for years and years, probably since childhood or high school. If you didn't cultivate this type of long-lasting connection with a few people then once you reach a certain age it becomes nearly impossible to have it. It may seem that college is the perfect place for this but I found that most relations formed there don't last, people don't stay in touch.

Even when you do meet someone when you are an adult, the bond can be so limited to one activity that I wouldn't even call that person a friend friend, they are just a friend in that environment, like a gym friend or a work friend. It's not a deep connection and probably won't last much. Which is why adults revolve their social circles around their families, the family of your SO or something, otherwise there wouldn't be anyone.

Maybe watching shows like Friends/How I met your Mother/etc growing up skewed my expectations on what I think friends are supposed to be. I will never find relationships like those."
3902,"But be warned, once you start rock climbing / bouldering, that shit takes over your life!"
3903,"Telling you, there is great opportunity for socialising in the corporate world. Get in on the right team, you'll have a blast."
3904,"I think this is normal and a lot of people are experiencing this and it’s really hard right now because of the pandemic stuff but don’t lose hope. You will settle into post-school life eventually. 

What do you mean by “people similar to you”?"
3905,"A lot of truth here, but I don't think you or anyone else should give up any hope of finding deeper friendships later in life. I feel like that just puts you in a mindset where you don't even try. Besides, fictional friendships on shows are just that: fictional."
3906,[deleted]
3907,Exact same boat. Graduated May 2020. Trying to find a job still. No friends except my ride or die from first grade.
3908,Literally holding you from falling and breaking bones as you climb a 60 or so foot climbing wall. They’re holding the rope and giving you slack/ holding tight as you climb or take breaks.
3909,Yeah it’s more than just not having friends after college. There is this whole pandemic thing going on which is dealing far more long term damage to psychological states than just the on the surface losses we’ve endured.
3910,"I’m a 2018 grad too and jeez, to think we’re already like past that phase in life is sad. ):"
3911,Welcome to your twenties bucko
3912,"Thats a great attitude to have, don't listen to all of the doomers who say that it sucks after college."
3913,Yeah that’s the point
3914,"Pretty much same situation. Graduated in May 2020, unemployed since. I made some friends in college, but I'm really bad at staying in touch with people (anxiety). Every once in a while I do something interesting or something happens in my life and I realize I have no one to tell. I do have a boyfriend, which is great, but not really the same. It's still very lonely.
My birthday was last month and the only text I got from a non-family member was one friend from high school. I was just thinking about that the other day and it hit me kind of hard. I remember when the happy birthday messages would pour in at midnight, and now nothing. Definitely lonely."
3915,What’s belaying mean?
3916,sad but underrated comment
3917,"I’m from a rural area and it’s not an American exclusive thing to leave a rural area and work in a city. I didn’t say anything about working myself to death and neglecting family or friends either but alright lol. Sometimes you gotta chase the money, so be it if you gotta live a little farther away to provide for yourself."
3918,"Bro - I wish I could tell you that it gets better. But I think it’s just how some of us are. We make friends kinda slowly. Best just to accept and just look for ways to speak to others and start working on your mission/vision in life. work towards something and people will find you and you’ll find them. 

Can I recommend Clubhouse? It’s an amazing place to speak with people daily. helpful to make friends."
3919,"Yea I will graduate with no friends too. I was stung by the ones I loved dearly , became depressed n socially anxious   n turned towards seclusion from everyone n everything."
3920,Thank you!!! I interned in corporate and started making friends already so I’m very excited for what the future has to bring!!!!!
3921,Ehh America is just big and their is generally more opportunities outside of one’s hometown.
3922,"I’m in a similar position where I finished school in 2019, moved to a new city and didn’t make friends before the pandemic hit, then moved back to my parents to a hometown where all my old friends moved away from. I have maybe 6 friends I text but fell out of touch with/grew apart from my college group of friends. I’ve learned if you have 1 or 2 close friends, people you really trust, they are enough"
3923,Fuck this hit me on a spiritual level. Same
3924,Yes! I graduated in November and all my friends moved to different places. I hope the rest of adult life won't be this lonely.
3925,"Yes and no, i still talk to about 10-20 of my college friends sometimes, but we are all dispersed throughout the area, and i've been unemployed, living back home with parents, and i don't really care for the majority of my hometown friends, except 2, and it doesn't feel the same, because we are all on different paths in life. I've lost a couple of hometown friends due to disputes and stuff. I've honestly been enjoying my alone time, but i've made friends on discord, twitch, yt, and reddit surprisingly, and im getting in touch with my grad school cohort. I feel like im drifting away from my hometown friends and can't relate to them as much anymore.

Friends come and go they say, not everyone stays in your life forever. Like i say, All you ever need are 1-25 people that are friends in your life.

If you can find a discord, meetup community based on hobbies and interests and you will be good!"
3926,"I think this is often a regional thing too. Small towns tend to beget tight knit communities whereas cities are more transient and fleeting. Ever since moving to the southwest, any friends I've made (1-2) have all been from small town mid-atlantic states (where I'm from). My brother moved to Las Vegas and nearly all his friends are from small towns in PA/NY. I think there's some sort of cultural mindset people have growing up in a small town to form close bonds with people around you.

Many of us after college move to a larger city (including myself) and find themselves in this sort of lonely anonymity. Everyone to too busy and there's so many choices of people to meet that they don't seem to tie themselves down to a few close friends.

I recently worked in a small town/city in AZ briefly and had that sort of ""hey let's all hang out, here's my number"" experience frequently. Maybe I would suggest to get involved in some kind of niche activity like rock climbing, cycling, running, or anything you find interesting. Find that tight knit group of people bound by some activity or location and I'm sure you'll eventually transcend that friendship beyond the activity or location itself.

If all else fails, if it applies maybe explore changing your location to one more....intimate for lack of a better word."
3927,Second this
3928,"Nah man, I live alone in the woods with my wife, but other than that we rarely see other humans let alone have any friends"
3929,Do you have a job? What kind of hobbies/interests do you have?
3930,Congrats. Took me a little while to find a job related to my degree too. Definitely one of the best feelings in the world. Really puts into place all that planning and hard work for your degree.
3931,Thank you very much!!! It feels great!!!
3932,"That’s awesome, congrats!!! Feels so good to finally get there!"
3933,[deleted]
3934,"Thank you very much!!! To be honest, I was this close to give up on finding any job at all, much less one in my field. I never expected them to want me to come back. Just when I started to think that college wasn’t worth it, getting this job made me realize that it definitely was."
3935,Great job!!! That is wonderful.
3936,[deleted]
3937,Thank you!!!
3938,"Thank you!!! It feels great. I mean, I feel better about myself than I have felt in a really long time."
3939,Thank you!!!
3940,How are the work hours as a paralegal? Going through a divorce made me so interested in this career.
3941,"Thank you!!! Though I am not a paralegal yet, I am currently working as a legal assistant. I definitely do plan to stick with this path and possibly go to law school."
3942,Thanks for the insight. Sounds like something I could do!
3943,"This 100%. My dad recently went through a long job search process, and at one point a company was repeatedly being really inconsistent in what they were saying vs doing, and he basically decided he wouldn’t take a job there before they even offered him one for that reason."
3944,"They could be ghosting you or they could have forgot. Hell, it is Friday after all. 

You did the right thing by following up, if you don’t hear from them within a week just forget about them entirely."
3945,"I think my problem is that they were on the later end of the appointment time, asked if I was available, I said yes, then didn’t hear from them. They just emailed me saying sorry and that they emailed confirming by 11:30 availability. So she must’ve missed my confirmation response. It’s in my “sent” folder and I’ve checked on my phone& laptop, so it definitely went through. I’m definitely not getting my hopes up for anything though."
3946,"businesses can be surprisingly unprofessional. Similar thing happened to me... instead of honoring an interview time, they called an entire 24 hours early, catching me off guard without having finished prepping, so I feel like I ruined my chances with them. Extremely frustrating. Maybe something unexpected happened on their end in your case. If not then really it's up to you to decide if you want to continue showing interest... surely there are more opportunities to be had"
3947,"The company I work for now kinda did the same thing.  I was scheduled by the secretary to speak to the department head in a final interview to follow up and negotiate starting salary.  I showed up and wasn’t on the boss’ calendar but was walked into the office anyways.  He asked why I was there and I told him the date/time/duration of the call, who I spoke to (his secretary) and when the follow up interview was scheduled.  I was offered the position, and the boss apologized for the mix up.

Don’t get me wrong, the company I currently work for is shit and apparently organizational efforts here suck ass.  But it pays very well, I deal w/it.  

I would take you experience as a foreshadowing of how the company operates?"
3948,"Do you live in Europe? Cause that will get you fired here.  
Feel free to stack Friday with meetings for a laid back day but that doesn't mean you fuck-off in such an inconsiderate way."
3949,"frankly /u/masterbumblebee it shouldn't be acceptable. Something similar also happened to me: I saw a job I really wanted and I had a good phone interview. I had a good in-person interview, but one team member was out that day so I was asked to come back another day for a second face-to-face. I agreed and said ""Yeah, just let me know when!""

A few days went by and I had not heard anything. I emailed to check in and heard nothing back from that either. A few days later I emailed again and heard nothing for days. At that point I had given up, but then I got a reply from the hiring manager: ""We decided to hire internally and the decision was made not to bring you back in.""

I took another job offer soon afterward for $5k more than what that other job was offering, but it still stings. Incredibly unprofessional IMO."
3950,If they can’t even hire people professionally they could be a little disorganized
3951,"Yep, I’ve had an HR rep ghost me after practically giving me a verbal offer. Unfortunate and disrespectful, but it happens. Good luck with the job search!!"
3952,"This. 

My first job I had, I had to wait in the front office for 30-45 minutes. Their unpreparedness was reflected in my job experience. 

It’s great you got the job but they could of used a cellphone or something to update you. They didn’t value your time"
3953,"No, I don’t live in Europe.  Wasn’t aware that not following up via email would get you terminated. 

Maybe it’s just my “American” worldview but a missed opportunity to follow up isn’t a big deal. Even if they are ghosting OP; nobody owes you a response, even if it’s to reject you. 

Is it shitty? Of course it is. It’s important to experience though, your interactions with people in the private sector are not always going to be nice."
3954,It’s not normal and it’s not acceptable. You probably don’t want to work for a company that will disrespect you like that before they even hire you.
3955,"The team member that was out was the one they promoted.  
They used you to mark them to market.  
Feel free to use them the same way. Capitalism cuts both ways."
3956,"I know by this point you've already gotten the call and the ""good news"", but as some general advice, no, this isn't acceptable.  As someone who will schedule and execute phone interviews for new candidates in my department, I absolutely attempt to respect the schedules of the candidates and promptly adhere to the schedule I provide them.  

Interviews are 2 way streets.  The company is looking for an employee who will be a good fit and can contribute to the growth and success of the company.  The employee should look for a company who will also be a good fit and contribute to the employee's personal growth and success in the field and, ideally, in life.  In any interview, if you see any overt red flags, don't be too desperate to turn the other way and say ""no thanks."""
3957,"It screams unprofessionalism. My most recent interview canceled twice. Both times they emailed me an hour after the appointed time. I agree with you 100 percent, but hey at least they offered me the job."
3958,"Sometimes this can be how the company operates. If they are extremely disorganized then they will do things like that. Just take it into account if you get a job offer and your consideration of the offer.

I had a similar thing happen, I did a phone interview and Skype video interview with my current company. I then did not hear from them for a month, I thought nothing of it and continued on with my job search, they called me to tell me that the person who interviewed me was going to quit to move closer to family and they were trying to rearrange their hiring priorities and job descriptions as that suddenly happened. That is understandable to me. I ended up interviewing for HIS position (higher up position) in person and really liked the culture and work place.

Now here I am and couldn't be happier with this company its a fantastic place to work. So just goes to show that its not always a negative reflection on the company, sometimes shit happens..."
3959,"Its just a shitty way of doing business, regardless of their excuse. 


A few months ago I interviewed for a job with a decent salary listed on the job posting. I get a call back from the recruiter saying they really liked me and wanted to hire me, but the salary was only 66% of what was posted in the listing. I respectfully and in a professional manner told them to go fuck themselves."
3960,"My friend just went through the process of finding a job over the past few months, and I was honestly shocked at how many companies just.. ghosted her. I think it’s insanely unprofessional."
3961,"I’ve definitely been through a number of interviews where I’ve been ghosted. It was the fact that it was an actual set up appointment sort of thing that confused me. Although I do wish in general they wouldn’t ghost after an interview like they do. One job I made it to the second interview phase for. They ended up only calling in one other person and myself for that. They didn’t hire either of us, they hired from within. Only found out after 3 weeks of no contact. 🙄"
3962,"I actually did think about this (specifically the sick kid thing. Idk why that came to mind lol). I was definitely anxious, which I need to work on. I was so worried they’d call when I was working and that would reflect poorly on me. This type of experience is so new, so I’m constantly learning and adjusting as it goes. But I do appreciate the perspective!!"
3963,"Not typical. Do not back down either if they try to contact you again and somehow make it your fault.  
Either they capitulate and apologize or you don't want to work there anyway."
3964,"I was telling a friend I keep getting ghosted by recruiters. He kept asking me what I was doing wrong. I told him that usually it’s just some LinkedIn dude who reaches out and probably wasn’t expecting me to even reply. He sets up a phone call and then never calls. 

One time I even had the guy call me to tell me this was a bad time for him, and that he’d call me back. At 5 pm I messaged him and then the next day I followed up. I was completely ghosted."
3965,"It’s not cool, but I wouldn’t let one unorganized hiring persons scare you away from what might be a good job. I deal with tons of different companies/contractors at my job and sometimes people forget to follow up, mistakes happen. Some of my most reliable clients make mistakes like this, and it’s not the end of the world."
3966,"I recently had the head of HR for a company I was applying for email me on a Friday, saying that they loved me and that they would call me ""early next week"" to organise a coffee meet with the team.

Never heard a thing that entire week. I thought they ghosted me, and then the week after they slid in with an offer. No thanks."
3967,"I had something similar. Towards the end of university I had applied for this one job and had received a phone interview. It went well and a couple days later I was told they wanted me in for a face to face interview, gave me a date and said they’d be in touch to give more information as I had to prepare some things to bring. As I was still at uni I had to buy a train ticket back home (which wasn’t cheap for a broke student) to get to the interview, something that they knew. 

Then they didn’t get in touch at all regarding the F2F interview. I emailed them a few days before the scheduled date and they said they’re putting recruitment on hold.

I wasn’t annoyed that I was rejected, as a graduate I was expecting large amounts of unsuccessful applications, but I just thought that this was quite unprofessional considering they had told me a date to come in and that they knew I had paid to travel back home so I was available for the interview. As they were a relatively small company I felt that this may be a reflection on how they operate as a whole, so may have missed a bullet working with them...I’ll never know🤷🏼‍♂️"
3968,Good for you to get the job. gl
3969,"Yes! I have had interviews set up and they aren’t there or my call goes right to voice mail. It’s so rude! I am never late for anything but this has happened 4 times this year. 

The other day I called to check the status of an application I sent ina month ago. I got an email saying they received it but no offer or rejection. I called and left a vm asking for the status so I know if I should extend my lease for
Another year where I am now. I hate this world sometimes. I work my ass off and I get ghosted for better paying jobs that aren’t dead ends. I’m so frustrated"
3970,"Chill out, you didn't get ghosted (yet), someone just missed an appointment. Maybe their kid is sick, maybe they got pulled into a meeting with an exec, maybe the person who was supposed to call you is a just one of the few bad employees at the company.

Send a follow up email, be polite, and ask to reschedule. You'll be fine."
3971,"This is what real life outside social media and working-from-home is all about. The day u start working on the schedules made by others, that is the day u start becoming successful. Till then u r a naive and stupid child"
3972,"You lived. You learned. Now you keep living. Everything up to this point has just been a learning lesson for you it seems, and while that may suck and you may feel like you lost time, you really haven't. All that matters now is how you spend the rest of your time, which is much longer and has much more freedom! Best not to dwell on the past and missed opportunities, just focus on the future and what new experiences you can have."
3973,"Hey I'm proud of you for working on yourself ! It seems like you've done well financially too so pat yourself on the back !! 

I (22F) had a somewhat similar life. I had very strict and negligent parents so I wasn't allowed to have friends, go outside, sing, dance, or do sports. So from birth to age 13 my life was really dull and isolating. Then in highschool I made some friends and it was ok but we never really did anything that ""cool"" highschoolers do....no parties or boys or anything. I fortunately was able to do well in university and just got my degree (yay!) But covid ruined alot of my friendships (people moved away, didn't speak to acquaintances etc) 

So now I'm 22 and living with my mom. I also just got my license about 6 months ago! Because of my rotten childhood I didn't learn things most people did like how to swim, ride a bike, play an instrument... and I'm now learning I'm cooler for learning these things as an adult ! This month I learned how to ride a bike ! And when I'm biking along I now notice how many adults are also learning a new skill, like roller blading or skateboarding. And the neat thing is they're also doing it alone. And when I see them wobbling on their roller skates I think to myself ""that's so cool!"". When you finally make the connection that other people are cool for doing new things, alone, as an adult, you can begin to appreciate your own growth. 

There is nothing wrong with you. You will become the person you want to be. :)"
3974,Exactly. Just hit 30 myself. I’m hype about it. 20s are learning how this world works and who the heck you are
3975,Bro you are still so young. Learn from your past mistakes. It’s not too late. You got this
3976,"My current situation feels very similar to what you’re describing — there’s a lot of regret, shame, frustration and some indignation. Now, on the cusp of my mid-twenties, I find myself scrambling for lost time, trying to capture some semblance of “youth” that I feel I never got to truly have.
A good thing that you mentioned, I think, is that you’re making changes — even more so, feeling motivated to do so. A lot of people in similar situations can’t say the same. That’s something not only to feel proud of, but to maybe feel glad about. At the very least, know it is undoubtedly a good thing.
The past will hang you up and doting on it too much (although sometimes unavoidable) will negatively impede upon your present. I hope that in time the regret you feel for lost youth shrinks, and you can continue on rebuilding yourself."
3977,I'm 22 and just graduated and I already feel old and like it's over.
3978,Not sure why you’re being downvoted.  I’m genuinely curious as well.  I’m late 20s and all my friends are getting engaged/married and I don’t see how my 3s could be better.
3979,"Making changes now is **great** and you should forgive yourself for not doing certain things in the past and thank yourself for what you are doing now.

One thing I have regretted in my life is not participating in more extra-curricular activities growing up. I think I missed out on team skills, leadership, and other things you learn by doing sport and similar classes/groups. I was a grade A slacker.

I realised early in my twenties, much like you are now, that there is always time to change. I have since picked up surfing, djing, hiking, bird watching, sailing, photography and soon plan to join a speech club. All while many of the 'busy' people in school no longer do any of the things they did back then.

I recommend looking at your future as a clean slate. You've already laid excellent ground work and you have plenty of time to make new experiences and meet new people."
3980,"I relate to this post so much. I don't know what to say, because you're further along your path than I am on mine, but it's nice to know I'm not the only one who feels this way."
3981,Except it’s not
3982,Are you single?
3983,No u
3984,"Negative. With a long term girlfriend, so honestly that could be a piece of the puzzle here too"
3985,"Hey man in the same boat due to childhood trauma it probably fucked me up. Oh well guess we gotta get used to meetup where we meet 40 year olds who talk about miracle grow and lawn mower parts.

(don't have to like it but we GOTTA live with it :( (hey man ain't gonna sugar-coat it like other users sorry :(

For the ""ladies"" situation I am sorry but you are kinda SOL there (I HOPE you find a woman but just being real)

Basically the demographics are shitty due to a baby bust in the late 90's meaning their are more middle aged people than people our age

(does not help that more men were born so their are less women to go around :(Plus at 24 a good amount of women are soon to be engaged :(

In college it APPEARS their are a lot of people your age because all the young people in america are grouped together but it is an ARTIFICIAL environment.

You can always go to the legal counties in Nevada and meet some ""ladies of the night"" to solve your ""situation""

&#x200B;

\-also not to be corny but maybe try Roman Catholicism. I know society says you should be dating/having sex (which is contradictory, you can't date women who were never born due to the baby bust)

Roman Catholics believe a man's life has a LEGITIMATE VOCATION and VALUE as a single man and is defended by the Catechism. Many great men in history were single and many were Catholic Monks like Mendel.

&#x200B;

\-(this is NOT to say give up on dating/relationships/friends but just to inform you what you are up against I WISH teachers/parents told us this before. I had to learn the hard way since I am dumb as a sack of hammers)"
3986,That's obviously a lie.
3987,"The only thing that is over is that “stage/chapter” of your life. It feels like your whole life is over because it’s the only life you’ve ever known. But now you’ve graduated college, you build your own life. You build a new one. The kind of life you want to build and see."
3988,What do you mean by “can still have the college experience”?
3989,yeah if he means the college experience is meeting 40 year olds on meetup and talking about miracle grow and lawnmower parts
3990,"I'm the same. My family moved around the world throughout my childhood/teenage years, so I never got to settle down. Most of my childhood were with them, I was never a properly socialised kid, so I carried that through to my adult life. I hardly ever left my room as a teenager and nowadays I don't feel like I have anyone I'm particularly close with. So you're not alone."
3991,"I feel you, I feel like there are a lot of things I could have done last year when I was in high school, yet my social anxiety back then was terrible. In college, even though I have lost most of my social anxiety, all of my classes were completely online the first year, so I got no social interaction. Next year I will have a little in person stuff, but still be mostly online, so yeah, for me, my teen years were either spent worrying about what people think and isolating myself out of SA or staring at a screen for class and isolating myself due to COVID. But I do assure you that life will get better. Now things are reopening (at least in my country) so you should take advantage of that to join a social event, like what I've done. It will make you feel part of a group. There is no reason for you to not feel part of a group!"
3992,"I'm not far away from you in age, so I dealt with these exact feelings for the past 5 or so years. And I've committed my road to 30, or 26, as my year to recoup all of that early 20s and adolescence shit, and acknowledge it as the past.

Believe me when I say it's not the easiest path. There's still so much forgiveness, self-esteem issues, and remnants from an overly-sheltered childhood that I still have to work on. I too wish I could've taken advantage of the time as a much younger person, both as a teen and an actually out of my parents' home, to do many more worthwhile things than just hole up in my room, afraid. I didn't feel encouraged to do so because I felt like I was breaking rules and disappointing people. Yessir, even as mundane as going on weekend outings with the few friends I was able to make. I made excuses not to stay on-campus because I ""had"" to meet my parents at home every weekend, I ""had"" to take my boyfriend to his home, or I ""had"" to study (which I hardly ended up doing anyway - took naps instead). And all variations of these situations thereof. I didn't even have a job to suck my time off on purpose!

Somewhere along after college, I just convinced myself to look beyond this decade of life and know these boundaries I'm ""stuck"" in will be broken with the organic passage of time. 26 really was the year I solidified how tired I was of other's bullshit placed on me, as well as my own bullshit that I internalized. Things like expectations and outdated forms of criticism, which weren't conducive to shaping who I wanted to become as an adult. No, I want to make my adult self my own, despite how my early 20s went, and despite my childhood influencing my shyness and unwillingness to do new things.

You don't have to figure it out all at once. Maybe something clears up when you're 23, or maybe it'll take longer. I guess, just trust the process. Keep up on yourself and your interests/hobbies without succumbing to burnout. We tend to be late bloomers, but I'm trusting that growth will happen, and that's really all you can do while in the present moment. There's many years of adulthood ahead of us, and our 20s will be just a blip. It was not wasted, no matter what media and society says."
3993,Exactly. OP can still have the college experience and has a full life to look forward to.
3994,"men aren't on the same time schedule lol , more like 30s is"
3995,"eehh the only parties OP will be going to are low-key dinner parties where 40 year olds from meetup talk about miracle grow and what they ate for lunch last week :(

&#x200B;

(i am in the same boat too)"
3996,Onward and upward buddy. Don’t compare yourself to others.
3997,"Others here say it better than I, but you are still young and the other 21+ years thus far have made you who you are today.  The most important thing is the introspection you learned which can be more valuable than the overrated “college experience”. 

Keep growing, learning, improving you my man.  You got this, and many many years ahead. Good thing you aren’t writing this at 50. Trust me. You have so much time. Much love and good vibes your way."
3998,"Now, the question isn’t what was, but what are you gonna do about it?"
3999,"Besides, your experience is not uncommon. What you wanted to happen only happens for a select few, it only seems common because of how often it is promoted and admired. Of course this does not mean that you can't regret some aspects of it. Feelings are feelings and don't come voluntarily. What you can do is change what you tell yourself and how you think about it. That is where therapy comes in. They can teach you how to coach yourself [that's the way I see it]. Learn how to talk to yourself so that you will get the maximum benefits. Just think if a coach always told an athlete the same kinds of things you tell yourself. Besides all that, you are catching yourself early in life rather than so late it would be unlikely to make a difference in your life."
4000,"Aw OP I relate to this, especially the college portion of it. I understand the frustration of not realizing certain things sooner, and it’s also important to recognize how much progress you’ve made already! I would say to not carry this mindset that “it’s too late”—that will only prevent you from recognizing opportunities you have right now. You don’t want to look back when you’re in your late 20s and realize you could have done more at this moment"
4001,"Hey  dude. I worry about missing out on being social as well and I'm 29. I went to college and had the typical ""college experience"" that you described. It was great and all but what happened after was / is definitely different but it can also be fantastic. My last year of college I had such bad anxiety that I felt nauseous every single time I went out. After therapy and just putting myself out there, that feeling has pretty much disappeared completely. I feel so much better as a person in my late 20's than I did early on (19-21 was kind of a disaster tbh...) To echo what other people have been saying, I hear a lot of people saying that your 30's are the best and some will even say that it keeps getting better after your 30's! It really is what you make of it, age is just a number... I found a group of people that share some of my more niche interests and there's people from 20 years old all the way to 60+ and when we all hang out and have a drink it's super fun! You're on such a good path now, don't beat yourself up about the past, it always gets better :)"
4002,"I'm in southern california with a history degree.  I couldn't get anybody to hire me even before the collapse of society.  I think you're absolutely right, but I can't bear to leave my town and start over somewhere else even if I know that I would actually make decent money."
4003,"Yep I did and drove Uber for a while which if you do it smart can make you money. I was a psych major and it was really a good fit for Uber and Lyft 

Also Walgreens pharmacy tech for a minute"
4004,Graphic design major. 10 years later I’m currently working at a gas station full time during a pandemic and I don’t even own a car.
4005,"Hi, I am asking this from a completely serious and not malicious way at all, I have been very lucky and unable to relate to a situation like this so I am very curious. 

What about your home town is so important/meaningful that you would rather be unemployed or in poverty (I’m assuming that’s what you are if you have no job unless you are having family assist?) over moving somewhere marketable so that you can build a career/life?"
4006,"yes I do and it does if you want to continue with it. I am now finishing my doctorate and 2nd masters degree in clinical psychopharmacology. I will be able to prescribe medications and give therapeautic interventions. However, the undergrad alone was not worth a tone..."
4007,"Majored in English, and I'm now teaching. It's more of a straight progression, so I'm not sure if that helps. 

Any advice I can offer with my limited perspective is to try and find something, anything, that you can stick to for a while, even if it's awful. You want your resume to show that you can be reliable and dependable, and not someone who disappears, even if that is your ultimate goal. 

I'm not sure if you're comfortable with this, but many churches (or even other religious organizations) are sometimes willing to offer some kind of work to people who really need it. If not that, I would bother retailers and lower level food service industry businesses in the meantime. 

That's a tough situation, I'm so sorry. On a side note, if you're genuinely thinking of turning to sex work, please seek out help from a local church. I think they'd be sympathetic to your situation if they're a real church, and see if they can help."
4008,"Comm design major. I graduated in 2019 and had a pretty cool internship at a brewery, but that’s about all. I’m now working at a grocery store and feel like this is what my life will be. I’ve applied to countless jobs and even other internships just to be ghosted or turned down. 
Maybe consider going back to school for your teaching credentials? With liberal arts I feel like teaching may be a good option. I want to say it gets better, but with job searching and all the let downs I’ve become a pessimist. The job industry is honestly garbage right now. I do hope you find your purpose, truly."
4009,"English grad who's making a career in marketing. I enjoy it a lot.

Curiosity question; when you were in school did you do any extracurricular activities, like write for the school paper or maybe edit for your school's journal (if you had one)? I think my selling point was having that experience and marketing my skills accordingly. IMO, a large part of landing a job has to do with how you sell yourself, and with clear examples of how your expertise (ex: English major, writing and research) makes you the best choice."
4010,"I just came here to say sex work is not equal to failure, and honestly I graduated with a Liberal Arts degree and now work in a good corporate job, but if I could make the same money as a sex worker, I’d definitely be doing that instead."
4011,"Well... you want to talk about an under-served demographic. Being a northeastern liberal, and having lived out in the Midwest and high plains for most of my adulthood now, I can say matter-of-fact that there is a need out here. The older folks might not get it, but what they do get is that a lack of services, especially in the field of mental health, is taking its toll."

Most people frankly couldn't care, or at the very least keep it to themselves if they don't support certain LGBT issues or gay marriage. Granted, I'm not as familiar with the Deep South, but my mom's family is from the Rust Belt and I've spent enough time up there over the years to say yes, most people there genuinely do not care one iota what you are, so long as you can do whatever job you're signed up for.

I mean look, I've been told people in the midwest would be super nasty to me since we're Jews. Honestly, most people I've dealt with there, even evangelical Christians, were actually pretty nice about it if it somehow came up like with dietary restrictions. More often then not they were curious about the culture if anything. Ironically, most anti-semitism I've personally dealt with has been from progressives or super religious racial minorities in the city's I've lived in.

Yes, LGBT issues are somewhat different than Judaism, but honestly, the treatment of both groups over the years isn't *that* different. Generally speaking, people across the country are mellow and just care that everyone minds their own business."

I have a couple other friends up here, but they’re all in a similar boat- unhappy, etc... 

My friends and I recently read through Uncle Vanya by Anton Chekhov, and it sort of helped. I still feel helpless and suicidal, but getting to commune and empathize with people (both real and fictional) felt nice. It reminded me of why I sometimes enjoy living.

I received no offers from any labs, even though I have 3 yr lab experiences, but I was able to land a job in a blood bank making $16/hr. I recommend a blood bank not attached to a hospital, but like a blood bank that sells product to hospitals. I don’t have to deal with any customers and it feels like I’m doing meaningful work. It beats retail/food service for sure, compared to the restaurant I worked at in high school. My specific role didn’t require a degree, I work in distribution but depending on the location there may be a processing lab attached that also doesn’t require a degree for their positions. I am not squeamish with blood but I also dont work with open blood. For me this a fulfilling job even if it’s not the path I thought I’d end up on.

However, there’s lots of cases where science, engineering, and other “practical” majors end up in a similar situation to you, so that’s a small comfort. It’s a tough market for everyone; even more motivation to learn, build, and hone your skills to make your next career move a great one."

There is next to no demand for someone with only a bachelor's in psychology. Anything actually in the field is going to require higher training and education than that.

Your other problem. You need to be willing to move somewhere with a robust psych field, either in research or actual healthcare, to find a job. That's even if you had higher than a bachelor's.

Additionally, and I don't mean for this to come off as dismissive, but if you weren't doing internships or making connections with professors or people in the field during undergrad, you're already incredibly behind the power curve. You have to be extremely lucky to just blindly send out your resume and get a serious call back."

Who knows, you might make one hell of an HR supervisor or critical thinker (analysis positions). Get some IT certs, take some finance exams, do something. Learn SQL or an HR management suite. There’s ways you can get skills to get you into departments. But most importantly, try and schedule some coffee or lunch time with people on LinkedIn who can help get your resume in front of the right person at a local company.

A high GPA is good, but from what I’ve heard, you may want to pair this with something. Example - if you’re good with kids, you might be able to work as a counselor, but that might require courses in child development. If you’re computer savvy, this may help you with getting research assistant roles (more on this below)

>In a small town in the US. I have about 10k usd in student loans that are going to come due sooner rather than later. 

Good on you for being cognizant of this. 10k is a lot, but it’s definitely not insurmountable if you keep it in mind.

>I was planning to go to grad school but depression decided to kick my ass in my last semester and I didn't apply by the deadline now I'm fucked for almost an entire year until i can apply. 

Have you looked into any research assistant roles that don’t require a masters/PhD? As a stepping stone, you may be able to do some work under a researcher/lab (I’ve met a few people who do this, generally in larger cities though). You won’t make a ton, but it’s livable and a really good opportunity to try out research and see if it’s the fit you’re looking for. 

>I'd prefer not to work minimum wage because I would like to move out of my parents house before I die of old age

I think everyone would prefer not to work minimum wage lol. But having some income is better than no income at all, and if you’re confidant about grad school, it would give you 1.) money to save towards applications (anecdotally, I applied to 4 or 5 grad programs iirc - it cost $500ish just to apply, and that’s not even considering the cost of flights to different campuses, only some of which were subsidized) and 2.) money to start putting towards paying off your student loans (and 3.) any certification courses if any seem helpful to you)

I’m doing a phd program now in computer science, so if you have any questions about preparing to apply in general or living off a grad student stipend in an expensive city, please feel free to pm me or ask here

Edit to add: if you didn’t do research as an undergrad, I’d posit that taking on a research assistant role would help you out with applications. With masters programs, it may not matter as much, but that means potentially more debt. A PhD may offer you a stipend, but they really tend to value prior research experience. Food for thought

One last edit sorry lol: I know someone working for army research with a BS in psych. It’s definitely possible, but you may need to move. If you don’t already, look into understanding the software commonly used with psych experiments (SPSS comes to mind, but think about matlab too, and/or maybe python just to have an understanding of the language)"
4054,You do realize that you can apply for jobs in other cities and many companies will help you relocate...? Then find a roommate (craigslist) and split rent.
4055,"Absolutely! I’m completing my MSc in childhood disorders and I’m already planning the move to London because there are far more jobs available to me there (as someone applying for work in mental health or assistant psychologist roles in research).
And even once I get a job as soon as I have a year of experience I’m going to start the applications for doctorate courses to become properly qualified. 

It takes forever and in this industry you need to go to the bigger places unfortunately. Bigger hospitals and universities are in cities and have the jobs. And you have to display the skills that an undergraduate has and stand out from the others with the same skills. 

OP did you do a dissertation? Did you do any research that makes you more special in the area? 
For example I did particular research on interventions for children in my undergrad thesis and now in my MSc am part of a research group that is leading a new investigation in autism and new supportive interventions. It all links up. 

You all did the same degree so you need to know what your particular areas are and how to highlight them. You need to work your way up as well and as MossyHarmless said you need to spend time on building connections in the field. You have to fight for those references. Even now try to reach out to your old lecturers for a big reference; one specified for a mental health support worker role and one more generalised if they will. 
I have 10 references from psychologists and researchers around the UK from work, research and university. A good reference from someone respected in the field is a big boost and it absolutely supported my Masters application and the job applications I’m sending out now.


Edit: Just to add, I have taken every job I can while studying and between degrees. Every bit of experience builds your CV. I did some research for a journalist and PA work for them and that really bolstered my CV. Work, low pay still, will boost you!"
4056,yeah i agree with you I've heard that only about a quarter of the workforce actually has jobs related to their degree
4057,"Still need more info. How many applications are you sending out? Over what time period? What kind of positions? What’s your experience like? Are you tailoring your resume to positions? Have you posted your resume to r/resumes and gone to your school’s career center for feedback? What’s your applicant to interview ratio? Are you open to relocating? Are you applying to jobs outside of your town? Do you have a network of people / connections (family, friends, professors, advisors, internship supervisors, etc.) you could inquire about jobs?"

Don`t listen to all this you-must-go-to-college-bullshit. You need marketable skills and then maybe a paper to prove it. But if you have a paper that proves you can do X and nobody pays for X, then it is just that, a piece of paper.

Deal with your psychological health, **but don't tell your employers that you are or were depressed in the past. Never do this unless you want to paint a bullseye on your back and be the first one to get rejected.**

I became really, really tight with of those 12 people, all of whom are still some of my best friends 6 years later (despite the fact that half moved away and all but two of us work elsewhere now).

After graduating, I intentionally moved to a big city (where there's a lot of young people) and accepted a job that hired a lot of young people. It made the transition to the 'real world' a lot easier. My social life after school was more vibrant than when I was at college. I made friends through work, and met their friends and acquaintances from college through them. There were a ton of kickball leagues, tennis leagues, and softball leagues that I played in and made more friends through. My friends who moved to rural or suburban areas had the toughest time making friends (didn't have a lot of coworkers their age, way less rec sports, bars, and places to meet people). Even friends who didn't work for a 'young' company but lived in a city eventually found a great group of friends.

**TL;DR** \- if you're younger, it's a lot easier to make new friends in a city than in rural areas, and (for most people, not all) the quality of your social network can improve your overall happiness."
4063,I’ll definitely keep this in mind. Moving to a new city right after graduation for work. I don’t know anyone there. Hoping to make new friends ASAP.
4064,"Not sure if I understand your question, but it sounds like you're asking how to get a good paying job in a city like? If so, this is what I'd do:

1. Travel to cities before moving there. Take a weekend trip and make sure you like the vibe. Do you like driving during the day or would you rather walk everywhere? Do you like warm weather or cooler weather? What do you like to do (if you're moving to Denver, it's going to be a lot more fun if you like to ski. If you like playing outdoor sports, a warmer weather city might be better).
2. Once you find a city you like, figure out what industries are popular there - LA is hollywood, the arts, etc, The Bay Area is Tech, New York is Finance and Fashion, Atlanta is Logistics and FinTech, etc. - and then find roles in those industries that match your current skill set.
3. Finally, start developing those skills in your current job, so you can make a transition to a new role/job/company."
4065,"Go to bars with your computer alone the first few months and you will meet people.

4066,"*can* is different from *can easily*. If you love skiing and craft breweries, you'll have a lot more fun in Denver than you would in Miami. If you like hiking and the outdoors, Seattle is probably a better fit than LA. I'd recommend to find a city/town that has an abundance of things you enjoy doing. More people who enjoy those things will move there, and it will be much easier to make friends and do things you enjoy."
4067,"I mean this is true to an extent. If you are in bumfuck Alabama for example, and you are someone who just thrives off of things happening and the big city life its fair to say you would be happier in a place like NYC. 

I’m currently in WI. Trying really hard to move to NYC but I don’t think it will make sense til after I get my degree"
4068,"Be prepared to start from ground zero when it comes to socializing and making friends. I'm extremely introverted and like to stay home in general, which has made making friends in a new city much more difficult. I force myself to go to social events and what not though, even ones I don't really want to go to (like for work). I've even tried going to meetups but those are always weird and full of weirdos or people I have no interest in being friends with.

Also, someone mentioned that your problems won't go away just cause you moved. You will carry them with you. I thought moving across the country and getting a new job might kick me out of depression and make me more social but I'm still exactly the same, if not, worse because I don't even have my friends or family to rely on here."

2. Like others said, go to all social events. I’m still trying to improve on this myself. Join a kickball league. Do trivia. Take that guy/girl up on a drink after work.
3. Immerse yourself in the city culture. Learn about the sports teams. Learn why city nicknames are what they are. Read about people who streets are named after.

I basically had to learn a bunch of new recipes.  Additionally, making new friends can be kind of hard. Be open to doing basically everything. Meet up is amazing so don’t sit at home all weekend. Find the confidence to boldly go out and meet new people. 

Some things you might no think to do before moving:

1. Get grocery membership cards to all the local chains. 

2. Check your morning commute with local traffic. 

3. Bring some favorite snacks from home. 

4. Scope out local hair salons. (My first cut away from home was a nightmare!) 

5. Find replacement doctors, dentists, pharmacies, etc. (Know the fax number for the offices back home so the new docs can get your records.) 

6. Make sure you have clothes for the local weather. 

7. Learn to go with the flow because relocating comes with tons of new and challenging experiences.

OP, don’t think that everything will stay good. It won’t."
4097,Don’t do this intentionally. Your friends and acquaintances are your support network. In times like these you need them now more than ever.
4098,"People tell me not everyone is fully happy with their lives and have some problems. So I don’t think u should cut contact with friends because you are not happy with your life. Keep in touch with them unless they don’t want to be in touch with which is a different thing. But everyone has some problems, and if everyone starts to cut contact, the world would be a very very lonely place..... 

My friend and my ex cut contact with me maybe cus of this same reason. But I want to be there for them during their good and bad times. But I can’t do that if they don’t want to talk to me...So please don’t be like them. Value every relationship u come across no matter how big or small. Who knows tomorrow they might not be in this world....Sorry for the long post. Got teary while writing this."
4099,"I cut contact with my friends from junior high,moving to highschool,going on college i cut contact with highschool friends as well,it becomes a pattern,idk whats wrong cant figure it out but mostly my ego of thingking i could do better than them and not gonna contacted them before i getting succes or feel good about myself or something.Biggest regret ever,now i makes promise to myself not gonna cut out with my college friends after i graduate."
4100,"I used to do this a lot when I was applying to college, internships and jobs. But it ended up making my condition worse as I alienated people. 

When I was unemployed for the first time (quit my first job out of frustration), I didn't repeat the same behaviour. I went out talking to people. It opens your eyes to how many opportunities there are outside. If you share your burdens, your friends likely would reciprocate. At least you'd get comfort from knowing that everyone else looks put together but they're struggling in different ways. You're not different. 

I also talked to friends who revealed that they had contacts who could refer me to job openings. I didn't ask them to help, they volunteered the info after knowing that I left my job. Although I didn't get my current job through those leads, it shows that socializing does help. (I hate the term networking lol)"
4101,"Yeah. After I graduated, I moved somewhere new and started a new job that I ended up hating. I was so miserable I didn’t really talk to any of my friends for like 10 months. I didn’t want them to know how unhappy I was. I felt like a failure. I moved away again, have a new job and am doing a lot better now. But I don’t think you should be like me. Cutting off contact with people who know and love you and could be there for you when you need advice will leave you feeling super alone. I honestly think all of us are struggling with something. So better to be there for each other than isolate yourself"
4102,"This is a great answer

Just wanted to add that surrounding yourself with people doing well can inspire you to do great. Versus being friends with people who aren’t doing anything with your life, can make you content to keep your current path"
4103,"you're projecting your negative attitude onto others, a normal person has the capacity to work on themselves and maintain friendly relationships, its all in your head and your friends are there to support you, i would do the same for mine"
4104,"Never do this, and try to not fall into deep and dark negativity, I have experienced this and it's not great, still talk to your friends and family, whenever I talk to friends and family, even if its once in a while, it makes me happy, and start doing things to improve yourself, such as getting hobbies , going to gym, watching funny good videos, and staying away from negativity, cause negativity will eat you alive"
4105,"Eh, if you need to then do it. It helped me in the past. I’m not sure if there’s really a right way to go about it but try not to burn any bridges. When I did it, I started blaming certain people for my problems and nothing was ever the same with that friend group afterwards. If you decide to go it alone for a while, I would either make something up (terrible idea) or just be kind of honest and say you need some isolation but it isn’t personal? I’m not sure really but my 2 cents is to tread very lightly. However, it’ll all settle out no matter what you do. Just try to think without conflict yknow? Like it’s a video game. 

On a side note, for staying better after you manage to deal with things, I recommend you look into Stoicism or some kind of remediation process. Good luck"
4106,"Currently in a similar position of unease, uncertainty, crippling insecurity and anxiety. The cutting off happened a short while ago. It was painful at first and has grown only more painful and isolating as time has gone by. I’ll let you know how it turns out but it seems bleak."
4107,The situation you described is why people need friends.
4108,I did that during college when I was in a really rough place in life and I lost all of my friends. You might be in a rough spot but trust me if you’ve had your friends for a long time they want to support you and help you (and sometimes even friends that you haven’t had for a long time). Humans are inherently social and being social will help you feel better. Your friends may even have some ideas or be able to help you. It’s really lonely on the other side when all your friends have stopped calling because you never call them back.
4109,It sounds like you may have depression.
4110,If your friends are causing you anxiety maybe they weren't your friends to begin with?
4111,"I cut out my high school friends because all they did was smoke and drink and were more than a little bit toxic. It may sound silly but they said they were voting for trump and that was kind of the last straw. I havent made any new friends since and I'd be lying if I said I didnt regret it at least a little. Maybe its nostalgia but even toxic friends are better than no friends. If you're confident you can meet new people and wont be completely alone for a long period of time, go for it. But I've been alone for quite some time and its slowly killing me, so I cant really reccomend it."
4112,"That is a common depression symptom, maybe worth speaking to a doctor about?"
4113,"Normal? As in, common? I sure hope not.

Is it a good idea? No. Your friends are your social support system, and you need them just as much as they need you and other people need each other."
4114,I agree that it's easier to keep your friends than make new ones but in your case its better to distance yourself from friends that share the same interest (or have unhealthy ones) and values as you (voting Trump). You're the average of your five friends. I'd suggest you to find new hobbies and work in friends that way.
4115,"No, but I’ve done it for sure. I find it hard to tell them my problems because I don’t want to upset them and it doesn’t seem like they care. It makes me wonder if they are really my friends which furthers the cycle."
4116,"I cut contact with my best friend from high school when we were both in our second year of college. I was having it rough and she's was two states away and in my immaturity I was like ""if she can't handle my mental issues the right way maybe she shouldn't be in my life"". Obviously I was an idiot and two years later we got back in contact and life for both of us is better now. You shouldn't cut contact just because you think people can't help or understand. Your true friends always love you and want to be there for you."
4117,"Yeah, I do it all the time. Sometimes it gets a bit lonely, but that is totally worth the reduced anxiety."
4118,"I wouldn't make a big deal about it, but just slowly start ghosting/spacing out contact with them. Moving away from friends is natural. I did drop about 3-4 friends at once around 6 years ago after a bit of drama. Now I've only got a couple friends I text with, but mostly just talk with my girlfriend, coworkers, and family."
4119,"I'm loving this resurgence we're seeing for trade jobs. We've finally saturated this country with so many college grads looking for cushy, high-paid office jobs, there aren't enough skilled workers. It's like we've gone full circle. 

I hear good plumbers make a killing. Good for you."
4120,"thanks for sharing your experience and I wish you the best life is fucking silly like that

ngl Im pretty salty that there are people who get amazing loving relationships out of fucking rehab but yeah whatever were all on different paths"
4121,"Oh, my bad. Yeah I actually met her because my best friend actually forced me to go out after I was refusing to for a long time. Then working up the courage to ask her out fully sober bc I was abstaining from drinking.

Both things were hard to do my man but everything good in my life has come from effort/facing my fears.

Don't be salty - focus on improving yourself rather than comparing yourself to others. You'll get absolutely nowhere being salty.

Good luck bro."

4124,"Man, I relate to so much of this. It's hard to figure out where to turn when life throws a wrench in your plans, but it sounds like you've been using your time to make some really positive changes in your life and that in itself is an accomplishment. Thanks for sharing this, it makes me feel less alone in my struggle with finding a job / direction post college. I hope things continue to look up for you"
4125,"This is something I'm going through right now...actually your story is eerily similar to mine except for the industry. I'm feeling extremely lost and this post brought me some much needed solace. Wishing the best for you mate, thank you for sharing."
4126,">ngl Im pretty salty that there are people who get amazing loving relationships out of fucking rehab but yeah whatever were all on different paths

lmao on one hand yeah I didn't find any soulmates but on the other hand I took one look at the junkies that were on their 11th trip to rehab and I'm staying sober because that's a relationship I DONT want to have"
4127,"Thank you so much for sharing your journey. I’m happy you’re feeling good today and taking care of yourself, keep it up!"
4128,I'm in that dark place now and I really needed to hear this
4129,"Well, I did not see that ending coming."
4130,Thank you. I needed this. Tbh I don't mind working blue collar jobs. Some even pay more and provide essential training. We were brainwashed to think that only office jobs are good enough for college grads :( :(
4131,Glad to hear it helped! Best of luck out there.
4132,It gets better.
4133,uh no dude I meant you getting your gf.. like not literally in rehab I guess but still on a pretty low point eh whatever sorry my english sucks I guess
4134,"thanks dude, you too"
4135,"Yeah, that's pretty much a perfect summation of that feeling. Though I do wish that she had more advice than just ""talk to other people""."
4136,"It sounds like her advice is to build your own goals while keeping in mind where you will be when you feel like you've accomplished something. Don't just accept what other people tell you success is (but that is a very gimmicky feel-good phrase, which is why I initially leaned away from it). Don't stand still, petrified of the what if your effort amounts to nothing, or what if it doesn't go the way you wanted it to.

I would advise watching it again, and truly listening to what she is saying without searching for anything in particular. What is she saying, not what is she advising."
4137,"I’ve lived the post grad life since May 2019. For me, the hardest part of life is letting myself dream.  You know, envisioning my future short term or long term. It’s daunting and intimidating. I pick out the flaws of my dream before I can even set it as a goal and make it a reality. I wonder if you guys struggle with this. Do you shoot yourself down with thoughts of “I’m not qualified for that”, “I can’t move away,” or “there’s no way I could do this..” etc.? I find that letting yourself DREAM without judgement is so vital in moving forward to some type of future"
4138,Keep in mind that success is relative.
4139,A lot of this! And then for me personally it just sucks that a lot of jobs I think are really cool require grad school and experience in fields without many entry level positions and I’m not ready financially/emotionally to go back to school
4140,"As an introvert, this has been the same for me. I feel free to ask people to hang out and pursue my own interests without the pressure to be hanging out ALL the time or joining groups I’m not really interested in."
4141,Are you all just experiencing nostalgia for your youth rather than missing actual college? Maybe it would help to think of all the things you can do now that you couldn’t then. You have disposable income. Can travel anywhere whenever you want. Your own nice apartment rather than a dorm. Privacy. Be able to buy stuff? It’s very human to get nostalgia but also project things were better in the past than they really were. “Grass is greener”.
4142,"Honestly, I felt like I did lose myself for about a year. It wasn't mainly because of the life I started to develop after school, but that was a portion to add to the pie chart. It took some time to figure things and myself out. I'm still not fully all there, but everyday I am becoming much better.
Going out about once a month and hanging out with my close friends really helped big time. I found a career that I love, and the next step is for me to get back into my old hobbies that I haven't touched since high-school. I don't know if that'll help you too much, but it's been helping me for the past few months."
4143,"I feel like most adults are dusty lightbulbs. We all are born shining brightly and full of love, we are authentic. Over time we are bombarded by others opinions,  hurtful words and actions, slowly we start to build dust.. we don’t shine so brightly anymore... we are stuck following a path someone else set out for us, and now we are dimly lit lightbulbs, covered with a thick coating of dust. We are still in there.. we just need to clean off the dust so we can become authentic and bright again. This takes years of Self development and Therapeutic work, and a ton of inner exploration. Go explore the world, try many different things, go off the beaten path, if that means making some sacrifices but in turn you clean that dust off, fucking do it. Love you!"
4144,"I might not count because I’m an unconventional grad, but college was a miserable place for me when I started in my mid-20’s. What “made me” during those years was struggling balancing full time school with a full time job to barely be able to pay my bills, *trying* to make friends but not succeeding, donating time to a few volunteer programs for the sake of my resume, and battling mental health issues. I won’t lie, I “wandered” for a few months, didn’t use my degree and worked a shitty bartending job after I graduated, but once I got out of that I felt a little better. I can imagine the sense of displacement for a conventional graduate would be a little different, but personally I feel like I’m finally able to be myself."
4145,"In some ways yes. I did a 180 career change after graduating and I didn’t realize how much of myself I was staking on the work I wanted to do. I feel a little freer to explore (especially now that I have money to spend) but a little more socially isolated. 

I’m glad i’m distancing myself from school, though, because I realize how much Stockholm Syndrome I was fighting when it came to academics. 

I’m also excited for the future! But nervous about what risks it holds too."
4146,Yes.  I'm on month 4 of trying to find a job (with my degree) in a new state.  I miss school
4147,"I went through this when I became disabled. Too much of my identity was wrapped up in what I was doing instead of who I was. It was a part of a tough road but I learned a ton about who I really am.  Take some time assessing who you are,the type of life you want, your outside of work interests, your values, etc. Then go teying to build that life."
4148,[deleted]
4149,"I work with kids and do scientific demonstrations at a STEM museum. My degree was anthropology, I use it quite a bit where I work honestly."
4150,"In a sense, I feel like I gained sort of a new one by becoming a software dev, but I don't want to serve capitalist interests, and I naturally want to be much more than a software developer. 

All in good time, though. I'm in no extreme rush"
4151,"It really depends on the individual, what you do for work, where you live, how you derive meaning and find it in your own life. I stand with most of the introverts here in saying working actually has been nice for me. I have down time to sit and think if I want it. I can always go home and have a separate sphere and identity from the workplace, whereas university you're always in this communal environment (high school is different in that regard). Plus I work for a small office and have a professional degree, so people where I work know my name and I've felt value me for what I bring to the table. Similarly I can go out in my city and connect with people in my profession but also have a distinct identity since we're all highly trained and leave our personal marks in our work.

Really you just have to go out there and make a name for yourself if you want it, and find a larger community to be part of. Yes, life after school is less structured in who you meet, what you learn, what you say about yourself. But there's also a lot that you can define about yourself afterwards, and better yet you're in a wide world where your beliefs and identity wouldn't be held under a magnifying glass and constantly scrutinized. This is the time when you can truly do you without the feeling that everyone in your dorm/major/friend group will judge."
4152,"You don't have to lose your friends after college. My friends and I made a pact before school ended that we would still be friends, and hang out, even after college ended. 

I just got off a game of league of legends with two of them actually."
4153,"Naw, you'll get used to it. Get in a relationship, talk with coworkers, keep up with a few friends and your family and you'll be fine"
4154,"Obviously omit. You’ve jobhopped before, you don’t want them to think you’ll do it again.. plus if they do end up calling one of the places you only stick around for a week at they probably won’t have very good things to say about u lmao"
4155,Couldn't it also look bad that OP left two jobs in such a short period of time? Might be a red flag for some places if they think he'll just up and leave them too.
4156,But he was just working at a new place for 2 years and that for sure is gonna be on his resume
4157,"I quit three jobs in 2 months. If I show up everyday and you hve no work for me to do I’m not gonna stick around. (Fortunately I just landed one I like and am gonna keep).

I said that I traveled the country and collected unemployment"
4158,"What background check do you think people use? How can they find out? Your employment is not a public record. Unless they check your tax returns, (which would be illegal) or have the FBI do a security clearance check, they only know what you tell them."
4159,Depends on how you interview. You can talk through job hoping based on your career stage. Fresh out of college? Job hopping is common and extremely relatable for most people who didn’t know what they wanted to do as a young adult. Mid to late career it’s more of an issue.
4160,It will show up on the background check if you omit. Not sure if it’s the same in Australia but in the states they’ll find out eventually
4161,"I would say omit them from your resume. You can tell them you worked there for a short time in the interview, but I wouldn’t go into details.

If the bulk of your apprenticeship is at one location just focus on that."
4162,"I omit them. I have a similar history to you op I’m a female in the restaurant industry but some with management experience. If I was looking at your resume and saw a huge gap I would probably ask, like a couple years ago only because I would wonder if your skills are still sharp etc. 6 months however is fine I wouldn’t think anything about it. If I worked for places under 6 months of employment I don’t even include it on my resumes anymore unless it’s for a well known restaurant/chef. If they do end up asking just tell them you left a hostile work environment or you were between jobs if you don’t want to get into explaining."
4163,I thought background checks were literally just for finding out if someone had any history with the law?
4164,"Technically it’s the employment verification which is part of the background check. Everything you put on your resume gets verified by a third party company. But some background check companies will have information on the report that wasn’t included on the resume. 
You run a risk both ways. If you include the jobs, you could be seen as a job hopper. If you don’t include it, the employment gap will be questioned. I’d leave em off and come up with a good excuse for the gap if I were you"
4165,"I think you should include them on your resume. If you don’t, they will most likely find out about them another way and it’s much better for you to bring those jobs to their attention than if they were to find out on their own. 

You could also include a brief explanation on your resume under each job to explain why you didn’t stay employed at those places for long. You weren’t being trained properly at the first place and you were physically assaulted at the second place. Both are very valid reasons to leave an employer and find a new one. 

With you including them and being up front as to why you left, your next employer will appreciate it a lot more and, imo, will be more likely to hire you than if you left the jobs out and tried to explain your gaps in employment. Hiring staff don’t really like to see gaps in employment unfortunately so including them and being able to explain why you left is way more beneficial imo."
4166,"I would only include those that you could get a reference for. If those 3 are the only ones in your current field then maybe include them. But if you’ve got better references from something outside of those then put that instead. A good employee in an office or a school or anything really is going to be a good employee anywhere. If you show up on time, work hard, and are coachable then you’ll be good at most jobs you put yourself in for. If you’ve got 1 good reference in your field then you’ll be fine with the rest being outside of your field. Nail the interview. If the gaps get brought up, know what you want to say."
4167,"No, they also verify you aren’t lying about previous employment, education, or credentials"
4168,Even my dad jokes that he still isn’t sure what he wants to do. He’s 60.
4169,"It always terrifies me when I think I have it figured out

I know something will kick my ass and upend everything"
4170,"What light are you looking for? There will always be complications, problems, challenges ... new information will constantly be revealed and life is not static, it is fluid. Circumstances are forever changing simply due to the fact that humanity is not as predictable as we might imagine or wish for. Most people are propelled by emotion and that dictates their actions to a great degree. 
The notion that “this is who I am” goes out the window. 
It’s infinitely fascinating and simultaneously terrifying. You never “arrive”, as much as there is a prevailing social/cultural expectation that a state of arrival exists,. If you are a critically thinking, self-possessed and self-aware person that’s capable of internal reflection, the concept of “having it all figured out “ is really a naive and immature expectation."
4171,"This is terrifying. Even when everything’s great, we’re all one bad phone call away from it all crashing down"
4172,"The light is whatever you make it, but yeah it’s a journey"
4173,"I say this all the time to first time parents and I’ll repeat it here: the big secret of adulthood/parenthood is that nobody knows what they are doing, and everyone is winging it. 

I’m a couple years older than you, and I have to say that I DO feel much, much more confident and competent and generally adult than I ever did in my 20s. I know how to handle most problems now when they come up — it usually involves contacting the right expert or mechanic. I can do my taxes. I feel like a good parent. But there are DEFINITELY still days when I feel like I have no idea what’s going on and I want to retreat to my bedroom and hide. 

It’s not just you! I think this is universal. But don’t worry; you’re doing great."
4174,"Like the old adage goes, it’s not that you get knocked down, it’s how quick you get up

4175,"I’m a trash man...
Imagine being knee deep in shit daily... smelling like shit daily... you figure life out pretty fast."
4176,"The personal progression side of things is already pretty well covered in other comments, I’ll just add that focusing on building meaningful relationships, and doing things that give you an sense of fulfillment is a much more flexible and meaningful plan than the classic “acquire A, B, then C”.  Things have changed and that layout/plan isn’t really the best idea for most people any more.  I read this article the other day about how even just on the financial side of the classic plan of go to college get a good job save up for a down payment is not a good idea for a lot of people. https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-parents-financial-advice-is-kind-of-wrong-11568367000?mod=e2fb&fbclid=IwAR0X2tpVzj3htM9Cy-gI8X_z-Sf8N9B293GYfv0NCDG10uPlcqsDWUrJU5k"
4177,"Thanks for this. I haven’t really heard other people say it but I still don’t feel like I’m that different now than I was at 18. You’d think that there’s a big difference between 18 and 22 but to me, I still feel like that little kid"
4178,Nope. Some people are better at faking it than others.
4179,Thank you for your comment - I completely agree. I feel like being at peace with that uncertainty is the difference between permanent and temporary setbacks.
4180,"Nobody figures out life, and if somebody says it they are wrong. Life is a life-long journey and you will always learn new things every single day."
4181,"At 30 I was diagnosed with kidney disease. Big curve in the road for me! It’s more about learning how to live through the uncertainty of life, not figuring out all the problems in life"
4182,"Yes.  
Most people take stock of their lives around 30, curse how they wasted their 20's, and finally get serious making actual changes to suck at life less. The notion that a ""mid-life crisis"" happens at 40 is an aspect of delayed adolescences and is not normal. In astrology (yes ... I said astrology) there is a 30-year cycle called your 'Saturn Return'. At 30 you are finally an adult. The next gateway is at 60 when you are mature then again at 90 you are wise, if you make it."
4183,Omg I’m dying 😂
4184,thanks for doing what you do man. I know it must go unappreciated virtually all the time but I know I at least think of people who do the not so glamorous work that’s just as essential.
4185,I thought i had it figured out until yesterday now I’m lost again. Life ain’t linear.
4186,"Never. No one ever really “figures it out”. I mean, what is “It” and what does “It”.  Mean to you?"
4187,Agreed! As long as we keep desiring TO learn!
4188,"It took time, but I had to let go of all the extraneous bs and rebuild myself into a more genuine human being. That mean giving up my identity as what I did for a living. (Diagnosed with kidney disease the same day I accepted a job out of law school) This allowed me to focus on a more core identity than defining myself by a title such as lawyer. Of course, I went through a period when I thought I was both dying and going blind from a different complication of juvenile diabetes. Once I realized I was going to live I thought I ought to go about figuring out how to make the most of the hand I was dealt. It started with each morning asking myself how I could make this day the best day possible. While I had long term goals (transplant, etc) I focused only on what I needed to do on those goals today. The rest was for another day to be concerned about. If I was going to have to run a marathon I knew I was only going to run one marathon, not a marathon every damn day (worrying about my next 5-10+ years each day). I couldn’t handle the enormity of it all at one time so I chose to break it up into day size pieces. Next, I spent time with others. If I was really down physically and bed ridden I burnt up my phone. This also meant helping others. The best way to take the focus of my problems is to help another person. Finally, I got closer to God. I identify as Unitarian Universalist and am in 12 step recovery. Our 11th step prayer and meditation was first developed by first century Christians. It was brought back by members of the Oxford Group and then taken up by AA and other 12 step programs. To learn about it including how to do it go to 
Www. Twowayprayer.org they can reach you all about it better than I can on reddit"
4189,Thank you. Thats an incredible journey and story. Quite Powerful. I guess I just need to keep grinding it out and clarifying my goals each day all the same. It was all what I needed to hear so thank you very much again. I have been trying to build a new relationship with god again these last few years but always felt so angry and like betrayed. Its just something I need to work out too as it could be a large asset in my life. All the best mate
4190,Not at all.
4191,are you me?
4192,r/LSD
4193,Nope.
4194,Exactly I feel like I feel exactly the same but perhaps a bit wiser and more mature and bit more pragmatic than idealist than I used to be. But shit is hard and it sucks when you fall behind your expected timelines but you either make the best of it still and try or give up and die basically. I'm not ready to do the latter yet nor are you.
4195,"It’s possible, it just harder than now than in the past. Also depends on what state and city you live in. Depends on how much you make a year. Lot of factors for buying a house."
4196,How did you handle that? I've been destabilized by medical and health issues I can't seem to figure out or manage and tried pushing through and committing to my long-term goals.. but it really sent my 20's awry so far and upended my life plans and left me at square one. Worse is still nowhere any closer to a resolution or a successful coping strategy or having any semblance of control or order or hope of it getting any easier. I just wanted to go to law school and be me and matter. It's like I'm spiritually and emotionally dead most days
4197,"Just after you graduate you're best able to cope with these disruptions though.  
Once you have a family et. al. you can't still be one-phone-call-away from disaster because they stress will eviscerate your marriage and shred your veins and make you die young."
4198,You don’t in the US. Higher pay comes with higher degrees but only by like $2500 a year. It’s not hard to get one through a non traditional program. If you have a good BA GPA you can get it.
4199,"how do u become a teacher after just a BA degree, dont you need more education?"
4200,"It also doesn’t have to be a degree in education. As long as you can pass the relevant exams and get certification, plenty of schools are desperate enough to hire ya. Few people are willing to be teachers in the US."
4201,2020 will pass...
4202,"Hang in there. This isn't normal times, don't try and make any comparisons to what we've always known as ""normal"" right now. Life pretty well sucks for everyone right now (minus the idiots who are ignoring the reality that we are in the middle of a pandemic). I'm going to call March 1st, 2020 - March 1st, 2021 a lost year, and expect we will at least be able to see the light at the end of the covid tunnel by then. Just keep your chin up, and keep looking forward. We're almost through this."
4203,"It’s not that there’s a lack of teachers in the US, it’s that there’s a shortage qualified math and science teachers and bilingual educators. English and social studies are very competitive. 

This shortage is also a bigger issue in rural areas, not as much or even at all in big metros like LA or New York. 

Last, states determine whether an advanced degree is needed to teach and in what field. In my state you cannot possibly get a full time teaching job without having a master’s degree and state certification. So all of these things are state by state but that’s my experienced understanding."
4204,"I was just in this situation. I graduated college with a media/tech degree and went back to my tiny hometown of 3,000 people to build websites for a company (pretty ironic to get a tech job in Twin Peaks sized logging town).   


Anyway, it was great for a while. I moved back in with my parents to save money, I worked just down the road from where I grew up, I made good money (for my location) and it was great! I got to go to work, come home, see my family and play video games, and just generally enjoy myself.   


And then the social aspect got to me. I didn't see anyone. My girlfriend was the only person outside of my family who I saw because I REALLY didn't like the kids who never left my hometown, so the chances of me going to the bars and chatting it up with them were close to zero. And then COVID hit, and now it's December. I have developed more anxiety and stress symptoms than I ever have in my entire life. Depression is very high, I'm overweight again, and generally just kinda hate everything.  


And then I moved. I moved to a bigger city for a job opportunity for my girlfriend, and then I started working remotely for a HUGE company. We make more than our parents ever did now. However, I still feel the same. Lonely. Sad. She does too. Then it clicked that it's not because of our location or situation. It's the situation of the world.  


You're not alone, and I think a lot of us don't realize the effect that COVID has had on our lives. I really think most of the way you are probably feeling is due to being locked down and hidden from every opportunity to relieve stress and have fun. It will get better, my friend. Trust me."
4205,"Just go drinkin' with the townsfolk, universal hobby"
4206,"I think this might be a perspective/expectations thing. In the US (judging by your post/comments) it is super normal for people to meet and marry their SO after 25. You might be judging yourself by expectations you had as a kid. I remember being in HS and thinking if I'm not married by 25 my life is over and I'll die alone. We were so extreme about it me and one of my best friends said we'd marry each other if nothing else worked out. She's happily in another random relationship and I'm so glad to be single and living life solo with my dog. (26 y/o currently)

I teach in Dallas and honestly the number of teachers that get married after 25 has been huge (many around 27-33) many then get pregnant and either fall in love with teaching more or move on to something else to spend more time raising their kids. I left a small town 10 years ago and never plan to move back but I get the paranoia of kids, parents, teachers,  and admin gossiping to the point of ruining a career cause they have nothing better to do with their time.

All that is to say you are not alone and many people are experiencing similar things. Change is difficult and often uncomfortable. Your feelings about the move, the suckyness of Corona, and feeling alone are completely valid.

One helpful suggestion I actually have would be starting a Discord server with your friends if you don't already have one. I often play Codies, Skribble, and Among Us with some of my best friends that I haven't physically seen in years and it feels like we're all in the same room hanging out having a good time."
4207,"It’s state by state. If you don’t have a master’s degree in Connecticut you will not become a teacher. Can’t say the same for all states.

Edit: I should say that’s in public schools. Private schools set their own rules, but Connecticut’s public schools are generally much better than their private ones except say, Choate or Hopkins. There is also a big gulf between attainment in urban and suburban schools but that’s a different story..."
4208,"Hi! Sorry to hear you’re not feeling so great, if you need a friend I’m here!☺️"
4209,"Hi. I am a teacher as well, I agree with the top comment - you will have to be more cautious on apps than some other folks, but that's not to say they're not an option. Have you tried any meetup groups relatively nearby? I've had good luck with some local ones that are virtual."
4210,Bachelor's is the entry requirement for teachers in the US and they are paid shit anyway so requiring a masters would mean no more teachers
4211,I'm a bit late but this. It's looking like jobs are going to be heading towards being at least kinda better by summer of this year. Just a little longer.
4212,"I think you hit the nail on the head. I haven’t really even processed having to leave everything behind that I’d built for myself in a big city and abruptly losing literally all of it. I definitely haven’t considered the impact covid has had on my life. I even had it before we really knew what it was and am still having complications from it. Man, you just figured it out for me. Thank you. Also happy for ya bud. I’m glad things started to work out. We’ll get through this mess!"
4213,"So glad I could help. I'm still struggling, but I'm glad I could help you try to make sense of it as well. We will prosper soon."
4214,Have you considered moving? I know not everyone has the money/time but if you feel like your environment is really that toxic then it may be time to consider leaving.
4215,"Is everyone in your town amish and stuck in the 1700s? Why would it be bad for you to date...? Honest question, that seems very strange to me. 

Most people don’t even get married till their late twenties anyways, it’s not a big deal that you don’t have a SO atm."
4216,What town are you in? I’m 29 and going to turn 30 in March and have no problem finding women to date. Since the pandemic started I have gone out with 4 women
4217,Thank you. I do appreciate your kind words and that you understand the small town paranoia. I lived in a larger city for the better part of the last decade and really enjoyed the anonymity of it. Covid sucks and it’s hit me harder than I thought it would.
4218,I live in a dry county haha otherwise I so would!
4219,It’s a small town and people are just mean here. They make up anything and it could cost me my job is bad gossip gets around. Love small town idiocy. Nothing stays private.
4220,Move then?
4221,CONGRATULATIONS BUDDY! 🥳
4222,I’m so happy for you OP. Congrats.
4223,I love this. Congratulations!!
4224,luv 2 c it
4225,Congratulations!!!!
4226,"Congratulations!! I may not know you, but I am proud of you. Sending you love and well wishes for your next steps!!"
4227,<3 Well done!
4228,Congrats!
4229,"Congratulations! Good luck with any graduate degree you choose to complete. 

First one is always the hardest."
4230,"I think the feeling of being done and knowing that you accomplished so much was enough to push me through. It sounds kind of lame but you've come so far, it will all be worth it when you finish. You can do it!"
4231,"It's pretty f'ed up right? You're finally starting to figure out who you really are and then you suddenly have to make big decisions. Know that you're not alone in this. Many people around your age struggle with this. So do I (23 graduating next year). Currently I'm trying to define some long term goals in the form of a bucketlist and breaking them down into short term actions and habbits that will help me achieve them. You can try this too! It's totally worth the effort to sit down and figure out what you really want from the future if you have the opportunity to do so. Do you have any friends outside college? Maybe some close family members you could talk about this with? Heck, even people right here in the comments.

I was writing ""Goodluck with your search"", but I actually hope you enjoy the journey more than finding what you're looking for. Either way, goodluck."
4232,You could simply not do that thing. I studied history and I’m working in IT. I love it. The degree helped me even if it’s not directly related. I actually love it so much I’m going to go back for an Associates in Networking.
4233,Thanks guys. Was feeling pretty depressed last night but reading these kind of gives me hope that I’m not totally on the wrong path.
4234,"Like everyone else here, it’s good that you have no debt. I’m graduating in the spring with a Masters in Biotech with ~40-50 thousand, so no debt is definitely a positive. I know the feeling, but I’m also so knee deep in school work that I can’t think about after graduation now."
4235,"What was your path for getting into IT? I'm somewhat interested in it, but I also have a degree that is unrelated to that field."
4236,"My background was all hobby. I’ve been building computers for over a decade. I applied at a recruiter who connected me with this job. I actually work for their IT company and we have hundreds of customers. It’s great varied work experience. 

In the interview they asked if I had networking experience, etc and I was just honest, I didn’t. I barely knew anything about routing, firewalls, switches.  I told them what I knew and didn’t and they seemed to like that. I got hired at level 1 help desk. I felt a little in over my head at first but I gotta say, in a year and a half, I have become SO much more knowledgeable than when I started. I have more confidence and familiarity. 

I would say If you don’t have an IT background, try looking for a level 1 help desk position. You might find the right company that will take you on. Some companies like when you have little experience. They can shape and mold you then. If you’re willing to learn you can do it."
4237,"I’m in the same boat buddy. 2 semesters away from obtaining a business degree, but have no idea what kind of job I want after I graduate. I try not to stress about it and try to take things day by day... Finish school, make some money doing a side hustle or find yourself an internship, and find something that can work for you! Your long term job does not have to be finance related.. I also wouldn’t be too worried about “college being the best years of your life”, for me college kind of blows.. Just keep a positive mindset!"
4238,"Hey man. Your situation is eerily similar to mine, even to the major and lack of debt. I recently figured out my passion but it’s too late to change majors and get on that track. What I’m trying to do is to get a job that will give me the skills to reach my goals. If that doesn’t work out (which it’s looking so), I’m thinking of going back to school for an MBA.

Even though recruiting has been an absolute bust, I know that it’s not over yet. Difficult? Of course, but not completely hopeless. I’d recommend that you network with potential companies as much as you can. Don’t stop until you land a job. Then, whatever else is up to you. That’s the freedom of being out of college debt free. You can devote effort to work and rise up quickly to change jobs or even industries. Or you can go back to school for a career pivot. Or you can focus on what makes you happy outside of work.

Ultimately, the choice is yours. You’re not alone in this. Feel free to PM me if you want."
4239,"Hey man, I’m in a pretty similar boat as you. I have an accounting degree and I fucking hate accounting, but not all is lost! Not having debt gives you a lot of options. For one, you could simply not do finance and find something else, but I don’t have a lot of advice to offer there because I actually took a job in my major. So I’ll tell you my experience

The nice part about choosing a boring but employable major is that you’ll have plenty of job offers that will probably pay pretty well. I came out of college with offers from 6 different companies and because of that was able to negotiate an October start date even though I graduated in May, so I could spend 5 months traveling before the “real world” starts. Then I started my job in my field, which, I’ll be honest with you, really fucking sucks. The work is soul crushing, I get no non-financial reward, and continuously feel unfulfilled. But with that (admittedly big) negative out of the way, let’s focus on the positive. I’m paid very well; I make more than the average American family as a fresh college grad. I also started with 25 vacation days a year, which is pretty high compared to other entry level jobs, that I use to pursue my passions (namely, climbing and long distance backpacking). Next summer, after having done a year and a half at the firm and proven my worth, I’ve convinced them to grant me a 6 month (unpaid) sabbatical so I can travel more. Even if they hadn’t granted this to me, I had complete confidence that I could quit and find an equally beneficial job when I’m back, because I (and you) chose a career that’s in high demand. I get contacted by recruiters every day, and have already received other job offers from former work associates who left the firm. 

I say this to give you some comfort; if you stay in your field, you will probably have a job that you hate. But you will have a job, and it will pay well, and you’ll have lots of vacation and mobility and the ability to do whatever you want with your life outside of work. Sometimes I wish I’d chosen a career that I’d have more passion for, one where I could find fulfillment through my work. But then I think about how nice it is to never worry about money, have plenty of free time, and be able to pursue my passions outside of my 9-5. Personally, I’m fairly content with the choice I made. At least content enough that I don’t plan on going back to school for something else. So even if you get a job you’re not stoked on, there are plenty of other benefits to having a practical, if boring, career. Hope this helps!"
4240,">The fact that you don’t have any debt is amazing and not something to be overlooked.   

Yup, that's solid room for a reset button. He could go to trade school or whatever if he wanted to."
4241,You have a bright future if you play your cards right!
4242,"I work in a similar industry. I admire your desire to go back and upskill into something you want. However, be warned that in my personal, anecdotal experience, a lot of employers will shy away from someone with an MBA and no relevant work experience. It's more a qualification you do after a few years experience and ideally get your employer to pay for. Obviously it's better than not having it, but it isn't the godsend and straight path to a good job a lot of people think it is. I say this as I see so many young people on here talking about going straight into an MBA post bachelor's graduation and I cringe - it is a wasted qualification at that point in individuals careers"
4243,"I work in finance. Did a related Bachelor's. The work you do in the real world Vs what you do in University are almost polar opposites. Yes, some of the words and phrases will be recognisable, you don't actually reaaaally know what to do or if youll like it until you start to work in it. 

I got on okay in my degree, I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. I was indifferent. Decided to give it a lash and try it out, what did I have to lose? I've since found my calling and really enjoy it. I also graduated with no debt (European life baby), being able to dip in and try it without too many financial worries has been a godsend. There was no pressure to stick with the job if I didn't like it - I assume you'll be in the same situation too. 

My advice, try to work in finance and go into it with an open mind. It's nothing like what University teaches you"
4244,"If you’re in the US, then I suggest working for Americorps, Peace Corps, or a state-run conservation corps. You can get hands on experience in fields vastly different from your major and make lasting relationships with the people you’d work with."
4245,"I did a lot of floundering around in what I wanted to do in college. Ultimately landed on Finance and graduated a little more than a year ago. Not super passionate about it, but I’m halfway decent at excel so it’s worked out so far.

FP&A is a pretty chill field to go into. I’ve been in my position since April and has been fulfilling and pays decently. As a few others have mentioned, finance work in the real world is a lot different from college. I’ve found that the biggest thing I took away from college is being able to think using a financial mindset along with a few projects that let me explore some excel formulas/techniques. 

The biggest advice I can give is what ultimately got me out of my rut. Whatever is standing between you and graduating/getting a job/whatever, just do it. It sounds stupid and it’ll suck for a little bit, but after you land the gig and paychecks start rolling in it will be worth it.

Other advice would be: keep a spreadsheet of jobs you apply for and just start applying for everything. I searched “financial analyst” in a couple of neighboring cities and just applied for every one I saw. After 3-4 months of this one called back for a phone interview and ended up going with them. They wanted 2-4 years of experience but I only had 1 at an internship.

Also just because you’re graduating with a finance degree doesn’t mean you are forced to do it forever."
4246,"I would focus on building up your social and work life- do some temp jobs and get a feel for what you like and want to do. Know that even the very best students who have their lives together on paper feel the same way you do- have been in your shoes before. I was fortunate enough to make a lot of friends in college but 4 years later we have dispersed across the united states and talk on occasion. People grow up and change at all phases of life and you will always have to make friends unless you are very fortunate.

You had the exact degree I have so I will tell you the blunt truth of the matter. Your degree is solid but unfortunately our economy is oversaturated with graduates and regardless of major it will be HARD for at least 5 years out. The advice that me and you got of just graduating with a decent GPA and work experience in certain majors may have worked in 1985 but is outsized today. Unless your parents are uberly connected and can strong arm you into a job-it will be tough for everyone. I advise you to take a few extra courses on what interests you and can be an useful skill set and not go back to grad school. My fiancé did this and while it worked out for her you don't want to be 80k in the hole for something you don't use. I temped and went to night school and leveraged a few full time jobs. I moved to MI with my fiancé when her job moved- only for the company I signed on for to go under a month in.

I start my new role as a temp to hire at 26 starting at 50k on Wednesday and I am excited to learn and get back in the saddle. As you age- you will realize that no one really has it together regardless of job title and to appreciate what you have. A lot of careers these days are simply knowing the right people (ex Trump) and work ethic. You aren't divorced with two kids at a young age (my friend)- your spouse didn't die (happened to another)- you don't have health issues. Everyone has problems.

As someone below me stated- if you work hard and stay positive- you have a bright future.

&#x200B;

Chin up"
4247,"Lol you’re debt free. Don’t let your job title define you, you’ll be absolutely fine. You’re debt free lmao

I’d trade my degree to be debt free in a heartbeat lmao"
4248,passion comes with success. try it for a few years and see what happens. don’t get hung up in your short term emotions.
4249,"I’m in public accounting, audit specifically"
4250,Hey thank you. I’m curious now. What career did you choose?
4251,"volunteering is great if you dont have the finance to travel. I volunteered at this place in the bay area and I really enjoyed the work. Plus, it gave me something to talk about in job interviews :)

&#x200B;

Edit: I also met people to network with, if that means much to you"
4252,[deleted]
4253,I also did a gap year. Best decision ever. I went abroad and volunteered. I strongly recommend it BUT it's really important to look for volunteer work that's not part of a voluntourism scheme.
4254,"I took a year off from college to join AmeriCorps NCCC. It’s a team-based national service program for 18-24 y/o’s. You’ll be placed in one of 5 regions across the the country, trained in various hard and soft skills, and work in a team of 8-12 on various projects including trail building, construction, environmental restoration, tutoring kids, and helping low-income individuals with taxes, scattered around your region. 

You’ll stuff your resume more than you could doing anything else for a year and you’ll get a grant of $5700 for additional education of your choosing afterwards. 

It’ll be tough, but you’ll do so much good, meet some of the most incredible people in your life, and leave with a network of people all over the country. 

Seriously, I loved it and came back to school more focused than ever. Check it out!"
4255,Omg this! It would have changed so much if I would have tried working in my preferred field first...
4256,"Came here to suggest this. Countries pay $$$ for people to teach English. I was backpacking in Vietnam a year and a half ago and met someone making $18/hour doing just that. Doesn’t sound terribly high, but the cost of living in Vietnam is extremely low. Think $10/night at a nice hostel, $1-2/meal, $2-10 for transportation depending on where you are going and what method you’re using. Living costs would be lower if you had an apartment. Transport costs would be lower if you get an international drivers license and buy a moped, those are popular there and you can sell it when you leave to recover some costs. Plus you would have international experience and many of the skills associated with teaching translate well into other fields."
4257,"Don’t know if you are aware of this website or not but it was pretty helpful for my gap. 
https://www.gapyear.com"
4258,"Not a specific place, but if you have the finances for it, travel as much as you can. I regret not doing so. Now I have a FT job it’s tough finding a free two weeks to do an Asia trip or something"
4259,">if that means much to you

And if it doesn’t, it really should. I heard a great quote that was a little twist on the old adage: it’s not who you know, and it’s not what you know; it’s who knows what you know."
4260,"if it's a job you want to move up in, sure. But I bet you could work a few years and save then travel the shit outta where ever you want, then come back, maybe ask for a position at your previous company (if they'll let you). If not, then you at least have experience. Bunch of Australians do it apparently."
4261,"I also did a gap year a few years ago. I went to Australia/NZ/Fiji for 3 months and it was amazing. I went through a program that had 12 other people my age, and even though it was awesome I kind of wish I spent time traveling by myself. 

I think someone already mentioned it but gapyear.com has a lot of programs you could get into. Also workaway.info has a lot of neat opportunities such as working in hostels and on farms if that’s your thing. Definitely a cheaper way to travel.    

I would figure out what your plan is or what you want to do, see, accomplish, etc. I would highly recommend going overseas as you get to see different cultures but it’s all up to you. 

Push your boundaries, get out of your comfort zone, and see the world! Good luck 👍🏻"
4262,"If you don’t have the money to travel you could try wwoofing (link below). You basically can volunteer at a farm anywhere in the world and they will house and feed you. It’s a great way to see the world, while getting to appreciate culture outside of tourism. 

[wwoof](https://wwoof.net/)"
4263,"I’m just finishing my gap year. 

I spent a lot of time getting my mental and physical health together and a lot of time catching up on sleep. 

I also spent the time to learn more about my hobbies (learning a new language and writing). 

But I’d really recommend figuring it what you want to do with yourself in the future and maybe even taking a few steps towards that.

But most importantly, have fun! Enjoy yourself! You earned it."
4264,"I joined AmeriCorps NCCC FEMA Corps (if youre in the USA that’s an option)

Or just any other service program. 

Got paid to travel the US, and got $6000 for school/school loans"
4265,"You can do a trade if your not sure of what job to take on, for me it’s 6am and 2pm. Never in a million year did I expect working to be this crap,  but it taught me the value of a dollar. I’m in same situation as you am figuring whether to follow my passion or get a career"
4266,"Gap year = bad idea
Now trust me on this, I just graduated, I’m a freshmen in college and gap years are almost always a bad idea.

When you get out of high school, you feel ready for college somehow, after finishing 12 years of school, but magically, you feel ready to do it again. It sucks. Going to school after high school sucks, but if you don’t do it now you won’t do it ever, and if you wait a year, you’ll lose motivation, you’ll lose your drive, you’ll find a nook and you’ll get comfortable, and in college, comfort is a bad thing. See if you get comfortable you’ll see no reason to go to college and then you just won’t. I’ve seen it happen over and over again, all of my parents friends and even my dad.

Don’t do a gap year dude. Turn it back. Change it."
4267,Wish I would have known about this program! It sounds great.
4268,Can you suggest some programs like this? I’ve thought about doing this but don’t know where to look or how to begin.
4269,"If you don't mind me asking, how intense was the labor? What did you do on a given day?"
4270,this is an awesome idea i'm currently looking into myself -- a friend of mine teaches english in chile and apparently there are a good amount of places you can get good jobs with a pretty cost effective TEFL or TESOL certification class under your belt
4271,I went with AFS but it depends on where you live what type of program you can do. I'm not from the US though so I probably can't advise useful stuff.
4272,Travel or work in a foreign country.
4273,"Do you mean high school?
If so, if there are any nearby work at a factory for a few months, great pay and great hours, and depending on the place, you can get really built while working there. You can make great money while you figure out what to do afterwards."
4274,Make a list of the top 10 skills you want to learn in life & find something that would help you learn as many of them as possible. Enjoy your gap year! 💙
4275,Work at a summer camp in US. Eastern shore is your best bet. That's the best way to spend the summer months IMO. Good networking with US people your age and other internationals.
4276,"I just want to say that when people say things like ""find an internship"" this doesn't have to mean find a place that's looking for interns, apply, and hope you get selected. Small businesses are your friend. If you're looking to network and explore different paths, find individuals or small groups of individuals who run businesses or projects you're interested in, contact them, and make yourself vulnerable. You'll more than likely end up with an informal ""unpaid internship"" but you'll be learning, and it'll be something interesting to do on your days off from your day job. I can elaborate if anyone things my thoughts on this would be helpful for them."
4277,[deleted]
4278,"So FEMA Corps is different than the NCCC Traditionals you’re thinking of. “Trads” do the physical work, building homes, clearing out homes, making trails in parks or forests. I was working with/for FEMA. So I spent one of my 3 deployments working in the FEMA HQ in Washington DC. I sat in an office on a laptop from 8-4 on M to F. 

When the Hurricanes hit FL and TX that fall (Irma&Harvey) I got sent out to Tampa/Clearwater FL and just walked around neighborhoods handing out flyers and signing people up for FEMA assistance on the iPad I was given. 

So honestly the most physical work I ever did was the mandatory hour of workout we had to do 3 times a week. Which was whatever I wanted, yoga, walking, weightlifting, going to a local gym. 

If you’re super interested in it/ want to know more about it/ my experience feel free to message me and I can go more in-depth!"
4279,No way is OP talking about College. Every year after College is a gap year.
4280,"I was talking about after college, I really should’ve specified but didn’t think about it. I think of this as a gap year because I’m not trying to have a career, I’m not saying no to graduate school, I’m just taking a year to find an identity."
4281,"I don’t think you should ever feel bad for staying in. Not everybody likes going out and drinking, we’re all different in what we enjoy doing. I’m very similar, I’d much rather stay in than spend money and getting shit faced. With that being said, finding a balance in trying to maintain friendships might mean to go out every now and then."
4282,And trust me you aren't missing much. Getting drunk gets old after a while. Your waste line and bank account will thank you.
4283,"I’m 27 and same. I’m also on call for work. 

But honestly I don’t really feel good about gaming."
4284,"Been out tonight, would much rather be at home chilling and have an early night to be awake early the next day. But it something important is planned occasionally then im not opposed to it"
4285,Never feel bad for spending your time doing something you enjoy and are comfortable with.
4286,"Damn,sorry to hear you’re on call for work."
4287,"No. You are completely normal and have nothing to feel bad about. It doesn’t hurt to get out there once in a while, especially if you’re trying to meet new folks or find a significant other. But a quiet Friday night sounds just as good to me!"
4288,"Lol no, I'm almost 27 and I either work or play BoTW..."
4289,"if you feel okay and comfy at home, I don't think you should feel bad.

it's my 25th birthday. I felt a lot of pressure to have a plan, look nice, go out etc. but none of that happened this year. it's almost midnight, my friend cancelled on me, I felt sad for a bit but i'm playing super mario and chilling instead of being out somewhere wishing I was home. sometimes it just doesn't work out. and sometimes it's just nice to chill at home."
4290,"I just stay home and dont feel bad. Being comfortable is the most important thing to me on a night off where i don’t have to worry about the next morning. You’re body and bank account will thank you in the near future too. I know people who over do it with the constant need to be out and keeping up with others but for what reason really? The same people i know who do this are constantly out of money, destroying their livers and bodies with alcohol, and still have constant conflicts with the people they go out with. Sounds like unnecessary stress. With the constant pressure to go go go in our society i value just chillin more than anything. Sometimes i get the chance to text/call/facetime with a friend who lives far and i have more fun talking and laughing with them from my couch/bed than i do when im out in an awkward social setting."
4291,"Idk but I’m in the same boat. Only time I really go out now is if there’s a concert I really want to see. 

Then again I’m only 19. For better for for worse I don’t really know how I feel about it."
4292,Only your bank account? What about your liver? She’ll be grateful to not have to work 200% to clean the toxins out of your body lol
4293,"Everything in due measure. It's one thing if you like hanging in by choice, quite another if you have some social anxiety issue keeping you from going out. I personally like staying in, reading a good book or playing some video games. And I've had this discussion with my girlfriend before, as she likes clubbing. I tell her, ""the $30 I'd spend going to a noisy place listening to crappy music and being touched by sweaty strangers I likely would avoid on the street could go to buying myself a 6 pack and a new video game that'll keep me occupied for the next few months. I'll go if you really want me to go with you but without you thrown in the mix, this is a no-brainer."" At the end of the day, it's really personal choice and what gets you going. Some of us like chilling at home most of the time, others need to constantly be going out. In America unfortunately, it's viewed as some disorder to prefer the former for many people. So long as you get new experiences and have some friends you keep in touch with it's perfectly fine. If it's the result of having no options for people to hang out with or being worried about going out in public, then we have a problem."
4294,Lmfao I’m almost 20 and do the same (work and/or school + botw)
4295,I’m playing horizon zero dawn with my dog in my lap right now (Friday night) and loving it
4296,"Not at all. I love staying in on Fridays. Since I got home from work today I went grocery shopping (second run even, forgot the half and half), did a load of laundry, baked some bacon, got my gear fully prepped and car ready to roll out in the morning for snowboarding, filled my car's tank, cleaned out my vaporizer, unloaded the dishwasher, AND had a couple drinks, smoked some flowers (with said vape), and got in a couple games of Catan Universe. Feels great! Sometimes there are cool events going down on Fridays that I attend, or I get the urge to go have a drink, but it's rare. My weekend always goes super smooth if I'm productive Friday after work."
4297,24M my girlfriend is out drinking tonight and I’m in playing video games. I feel the same way as you. I feel like other people get excited and energized from bars and clubs but I find it exhausting.
4298,I do feel bad for not going out on a Friday night. Seeing my friends having fun makes me wonder the memories I’m missing. I force myself to go out but I never regret it. It’s the initial part of getting ready and driving that makes me not want to go.
4299,"I wonder if someone's actually gonna comment ""yes you should feel bad"""
4300,"I have the same opinion as a lot of users here. There is nothing wrong with staying in so long as you are maintaining healthy relationships and friendships and you are in a good mental state. Happiness is not the same for everyone, and neither is relaxation. Do what brings you happiness and restoration as long as you are healthy and maintaining some social connections."
4301,"28 M, I’ve had both extremes and through it all I’ve found it’s about balance. Being too much of a home body and not socialising isn’t healthy just like being a drunk mess 3+ nights a week, every week isn’t. 

You’re old enough to think about this shit in a mature, critical manner so do that; find whatever medium works for you and roll with whatever the fuck you feel like and live your life."
4302,Nope...I personally blacked out more than enough between the ages of 18-22...I value my rest more than anything now and if I do anything i rather meet up with friends and actually do something meaningful
4303,A lot of people our age don’t party anymore.. like ALOT
4304," You’re probably just an introvert. No shame in that, do what makes you comfortable and happy. I personally hate parties as an introvert, though depending on the crowd and the environment there can be certain social aspects that I enjoy"
4305,Not at ALLLLL
4306,"No, party life is overrated, I enjoy going to pubs, lounges, movies, museums, arcades, golfing, bowling, the park, painting, hookah bar and every once in a while,  gentleman's club and getting food. I enjoy doing simple stuff, I hate large crowds with people and loud noises. I also stay inside too sometimes."
4307,\#BoTWGang
4308,Getting drunk also gets harder on the body the older you get lol
4309,"Of course you shouldn’t, society pushes the idea that you should be going out spending money at weekend but you don’t have too if you don’t want to"
4310,"I'm 22 and prefer staying in most nights to be honest . I partied a lot when I was 18-20, and I feel as if I've grown out of that phase quite quickly. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the odd party now and then and I actually enjoy them even more, but I just prefer spending time on other hobbies too now that aren't as expensive. The difference is, I don't have to pretend now just to fit in (clubbing at 18 in the UK is a big deal!) - if somebody doesn't like me because I don't party or go clubbing, that's their loss."
4311,"Note: many workers start their day before their manager, and wake up at 4am. You can’t call in that scenario so a text is really the only option"
4312,"Never send a text either. I'm pretty sure some companies allow text communications, but it's never professional. Just keep it easy and professional, and just call in. Never text unless you're promoted to do so."
4313,I don’t understand why theres still a held belief that texting is unprofessional. it’s 2020. Everyone texts and the majority prefer it.
4314,Well then you're giving them permission to say no. I rather beg for forgiveness than ask permission
4315,"I think that one is more for an office job where you’d be able to log on and fix something if there were a real fire, not retail where short staffing might make the manager want to call you in"
4316,All great thoughts! Everyone’s work and manager relationships are different so stick with what works for you. Thanks for the insights 👍
4317,"At my job we have 5 work from home days we can use throughout the year.

One day I wasn't feeling 100% but not super sick and had some things I wanted to take care of and decided to text my manager something along the lines of OPs examples but instead of sick day I said WFH day.

He said no you can't use a WFH day and made me use a sick day.

Anyone have experience with these situations and working from home? I was a bit put off by the situation with my manager."
4318,"I tried to work remote when I was sick, since I was supposed to be physically there, I requested remote due to not feeling great. My boss said “you’re feeling sick, it’s a sick day. Get better.”"
4319,I just email my boss saying that I’m using sick time. No questions asked. It’s my time. I can use it however and whenever I want.
4320,Totally depends on the job. I get to work before my boss pretty early in the morning and she always prefers if we text her. I wouldn’t say it’s completely unprofessional as you can still be professional via text.
4321,Right. I guess I just have a really good manager. Didn’t think about that.
4322,This.  A lot of my job can be done remotely so if I need to stay home from the office I usually feel well enough to work a bit on the computer.
4323,lol I just spam the team email channel with - “OOO Not Feeling Well”
4324,"Nope, they are your sick days. Don’t ask to take what’s yours"
4325,It’s professional to say you need to take the day off rather thrn ask. Any company will be fine with “ hey I’m not feeling well today I won’t be in etc”
4326,"I'll stick to ""Morning boss, guts are fucked, see you tomorrow""."
4327,My manager would send a laugh emoji and tell me to come into work or I’ll be replaced lol
4328,"It could be a liability thing, your toe work is like mine and will use your sick days first so they don’t have to pay you for them at the end of the year... regardless if you want them to or not."
4329,My place of work doesn't have a phone for us to call into. We just message our manager on FB to tell him we're not coming in
4330,"Lmao what? My last three companies used Slack and Whatsapp for communications. People have meetings and work to attend to, calling in sick is not urgent enough to warrant a phone call."
4331,Not every work place has a phone to call in sick on. My place we just FB message
4332,lol
4333,"Texting is often not considered as a “call-in”.  Physically pick up the phone and call, or suck it up and work"
4334,My policy is that you must ring your manager. Text / email is insufficient as there’s a chance they may miss it
4335,"I would probably ASK if I could stay home rather than telling, but that’s me. If I’m feeling that bad that I know I can’t make it, I’d definitely be sincere and call."
4336,"If you have self control, then yes get one because it will build your credit. Even if you don't plan on buying a house or a car, even trying to get an apartment requires a credit check. 

Get a card with no annual fee, and then treat it like a debit card, meaning that you ONLY buy stuff that you CURRENTLY have the money to pay for.  I use mine to make small purchase like gas, meals, etc, because I know I can easily pay it off on time.  Never buy something that you don't have the money for in your account at the time of purchase. Credit card companies count on people buying things they can't afford to pay off, so that they can make money off them in the form of interest."
4337,"Credit is pretty much for buying houses and renting apartments and buying houses and taking out loans right? Like stuff you pay for over time? I’m just trying to get an idea of what I might actually need credit for in the next few years. Like I said I’m 22, about to graduate, and (ideally) I’d like to move to nyc"
4338,"I've had a credit card for a few years now. Knowing what I know now and how I use it, I wish I got one sooner. 

I use my credit card sparingly for small, regular purchases (groceries, gas), and limit myself to using it only about one or two times every month (and there have been some months where I haven't used it at all). 

I pay it off online every month. It takes only a few minutes for me to do so. I have a good credit score as a result of my use. Although my limit has increased over the years, I would never use my credit card for anything I couldn't afford, unless it was an emergency and I had no other options. It's not free money or unlimited money. You still need to pay it off and debt is not something you want to mess with. In that regard I personally consider my credit card like my debit card, except I have to transfer the money over after the fact. 

I use my card for smaller purchases to ensure I pay it off. I've heard of people who have used theirs for bigger purchases, but then something happens and they're unable to pay it off, so that's why I always use mine for small amounts only. 

At this time I also strictly use my card for certain regular purchases (as I mentioned, groceries and gas) and nothing else, because I have come to associate these activities with using my card and it helps remind me to check my balance and pay it off. I would encourage you to set regular reminders, at least initially, if you're worried about forgetting. 

I recently got approved for a loan that I'm not sure I would have gotten if I didn't already establish good credit. You will need good credit if you want a car or housing. I would recommend getting one as soon as possible to start building credit. As long as you are responsible with using it and managing your money, there's nothing to fear."
4339,"Thanks I’m gonna check that reddit out. Very helpful, I appreciate it👌🏻"
4340,"It’s mainly for big purchases that require payments (car, house, apartment, etc) but it takes time to build. Even a good credit score won’t get approved if it’s too new. If you move to nyc you’ll need it for whatever place you apply to move into. Regardless of if you’ll need it immediately, you don’t want to just start right when you’ll need it, by that time it’ll be too late cuz no credit will have been built over time. If you’re still in college, I know a lot of banks offer college credit cards at good rates"
4341,"I would also consider checking out r/CRedit, r/CreditCards, r/FinancialPlanning and maybe r/povertyfinance. For more financial subs and others you can check out our [full list of subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/wiki/related_subreddits)."
4342,"I just got a credit card not too long ago during my senior year of college, I honestly wish I would've gotten it sooner because credit age is a factor for your credit score. Reason why I never got it is because of the scary negative stigma that surrounds a credit card. However, (just as previous comments have said) your credit basically tells if you are worthy of borrowing money, buying a house, a car, renting an apartment and etc. 



With my experience, I have a credit card with no annual fee & 2-3% cash back on some purchases. I pay it off every month, on time, sometimes early. I spend no more than $200 on it. I keep up with the balance every time I spend money, I have alerts for when I need to pay and if I use too much. I've always been very serious about paying bills on time so I am forever on top of it.



My friend just recently got a credit card but his money spending habits are trash. I told him it wasn't a good idea to sign up for one, he ended up getting one, and now he's caught himself in revolving credit.





If you are much better with money management, I think it'd be a good idea to get one. Give yourself a limit of how much you'd spend and don't go over it. Maybe use it for just monthly subscriptions like Spotify, Netflix, etc. and pay it off every month."
4343,"So I use my credit cards for everything, and I have five or six (I’m 32). The trick is to never spend what you can’t pay back in a month, and to pay off the entire balance each month so you don’t pay interest on the card. 

In addition to having pretty much perfect credit I’ve also gotten a ton of free things for using credit card. 1-5% cash back on purchases, free nights at hotels, and gift cards with rewards points that I use to buy Christmas gifts, flowers for my mom for Mother’s Day, etc. a lot of cards have a “spend x amount and get 600 dollars back”. If I’m going to spend the money anyway (groceries gas bills) I may as well get the free stuff.

The companies are banking on you spending too much and being unable to pay it back, charging interest. However if you’re frugal (like me) and don’t spend what you don’t have you can reap a lot of benefits from having a credit card. I usually have enough for a free flight once a year for example since I have a travel credit card.

Edit: I got my first card as a college senior"
4344,"Even basic credit cards have a 1% cash back. Good credit cards have 2%. I pretty much consider any purchase made without a credit card to have a 2% tax added on. 

Mine goes to amazon credit. It’s pretty nice. I’m sure the travel rewards and whatever else is nice but yeah."
4345,"Credit is borrowing any money that you then have to pay back later. If you keep a close watch on what you spend already then it would be simple to just make those purchases with a credit card and then pay the balance off. Where people get into trouble is when they don’t pay the balance off on time. Once the balance is overdue you get hit with huge amounts of interest on what you spent of their money.

Credit is often necessary for buying things that most people can’t pay for all at once like a car or a house. It’s easier to pay those off over time even if it means paying more than you would in cash. In order for a bank to trust you with a loan big enough to buy a house, they want to see evidence that you’re trustworthy with other people’s money. That what your credit score is for. Credit cards are one tool you can use to build trust so that when you may need a loan in the future, the bank will trust you to make good on repayment."
4346,"One thing I heard was that you have to keep in mind your credit limit vs. what you spend. For example: if your card has a $500 limit and you have a $250 balance that's considered bad because you're at the halfway mark. A $250 balance on a $1500 card is better because you have more available credit and credit monitoring places like to see that. 

I've dug myself into a hole regarding credit card debt (went through some bad times and dealt with it by doing retail therapy. I am stupid) but my new rule for myself is not to use the credit card. And if I HAVE to use the card, I try to pay double what I spend. Had a vet visit for the cat and it was $500, so when I got my next paycheck $1000 went to the credit card balance."
4347,"The best time to borrow money is when you don’t need to borrow money. I use credit cards for convenience and always pay them off completely. My credit rating is very high, and that means renting apartments is easier and car insurance is cheaper. In the USA, credit rating can make a huge difference."
4348,"I don’t understand those advising against having a credit card. How do you actually make purchases and payments??? 

I use credit card for almost everything - and earn a nice cash back bonus of around 2-3% of what I spend. You’re leaving that on the table. It’s easy to avoid paying interest if you pay your balance in full monthly. 

Additionally, credit card is generally safer than using cash or debit card."
4349,"Get one but have it pay itself off every month, treat it like a debit card. If you don’t have the money for something than you can’t afford it, if you start spending more on credit than you have in your account it becomes sketchy very quickly."
4350,I prefer the comfort of one-time payments.
4351,Also r/churning for rewards cards/sign up bonuses and how to maximize any rewards you earn
4352,"Ya I started building credit a little late, which made it sketchy when it came to buying my first car. Definitely recommend starting sooner that later"
4353,Yes. Use it for all your day to day purchases. NEVER miss a payment and always pay your balance IN FULL. Your credit history will grow
4354,"I say get one, put everything you can on it, and pay it off as soon as you can (as in before you even get your statement). If you don’t think you have the income/credit score to get a credit card, get a secured card. With those, your limit is however much money you put down, so they approve pretty much anybody. I started out with a Discover It Secured card when I was 18 with a $200 limit since that was the minimum."
4355,"It is worth it for a few reason, but the main one in my opinion (I used to work in a credit union) is security. Credit cards are much safer for shopping online or getting gas, because they can’t just drain your account if the card number is stolen, and most credit cards these days will refund you for fraudulent charges. It’s also worth it for some perks- mine gives me a percentage cash back on every transaction. That’s not a lot but it’s some money every year for free just for buying groceries. 
But you need to be responsible for it to be a benefit instead of hurting you. Always pay the whole balance every month to avoid interest, get one with a relatively small balance and never have more on it than 50% of the total balance it could if you want to build your credit. It’s not free money to spend, treat it like your debit card and pay it off immediately. Don’t just increase the balance whenever it’s offered- the temptation to spend more and the hit to your credit each time is generally not worth it. Don’t get multiple cards or things like retail credit cards- those hurt you. Get just one through a bank or credit union that gives you perks and use it judiciously. 
Also credit is important for lots of things- getting cars, houses, apartments, even medical expenses and even some jobs look at your credit as part of a background check when hiring. Good credit helps you bad credit makes it very hard to get things when you need them as an older adult. 
If you want more tips on how to build credit and get good credit feel free to DM me."
4356,Do you have student loans? If you do then you will be creating credit once you graduate and start paying them off!
4357,Echoing the safe part. Most credit card companies will help if your card is stolen or fraudulently charged.
4358,"How often do you use it? Do you ever catch yourself abusing it, using it more and more often? That’s what I’m trying to guard against bc I’ve done that in the past with money."
4359,You need credit to have an apt to rent.
4360,They will def. do a credit check for a place in NYC so beware
4361,"I got one for the benefits. Don’t think “I have unlimited money.” I use my credit card for absolutely every purchase because I get points.. I go to LA every year and I get a free flight because of my points. 

If you can handle managing your money then by all means get it. If you don’t trust yourself then don’t."
4362,"I got a credit card when I was 19 and my mom was a co-signer. I’m now 22 and had it not been for her perfect credit score I’d be fucked. I swore up and down that I wouldn’t use it or go over my limit but I did. If your money management has gotten better then I’d say go for it. I’m lucky that I had someone to bail me out if I messed up. I have now learned better management skills. I currently only use it for gas, food, subscriptions, video games, and clothes. Occasionally I’ll make bigger purchase but only if I have money to pay it off when the bill is due."
4363,"you will need credit to buy a house, a car, maybe fund a hobby if you have an expensive one (don’t get too deep). 

don’t max it out... that hurts your credit. when my cards were maxed i got a limit increase and even though my actual note was the same my “credit utilization percent” went down because the limit was higher; this increased my credit scores by about 40 points across the board. 

my advice is this: don’t use it to buy something expensive that you can’t afford for a while, at least not just yet. for a year at least, just use it to buy something that you normally would week to week, and then save the cash you didn’t use and pay the card bill with it. i seem to remember that keeping a small balance on the card revolving and not paying it down to zero helps your score as well, do your own research on that but what it would mean is keeping a 50$ or so balance on the card at all times and letting it sit, and paying a little interest on it (it should be very little interest, a dollar or something a month). like i said, do your research on that last part."
4364,If you don’t have an income don’t get a credit card
4365,"YES, read this post https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ooc52/seriously_get_and_use_a_credit_card/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
4366,"That's an insanely long amount of time to ""figure out"" a company. They are lying to you."
4367,"Hey, I forgot to mention—I've definitely been trying to take that advice! I'm trying to learn another language & take up recreational sports. I've just noticed it's been really hard for me to concentrate on other things once work is over. I think it's hard for me to grasp that this job is temporary because most of my coworkers have been there 3-15 years, with most working there at least 6-8 years with no plans to leave. I'll try to keep that in mind though."
4368,"You remind me of my life a few years back when I first started working full time! First and foremost, it gets better, it's really cliche but I need you to stop everything and let this sink in. In 6 months time, you'll be in a different place emotionally and in life. Everytime I felt hopeless, I remind myself that this will not last forever. Doesn't take the pain of everyday away ngl, but at least there was a way out.

In terms of actual things you could do now to change your situation: is trying to move teams within your company a viable option? What about joining a network at work that will allow you to meet new colleagues? Understand in a toxic environment the last thing you want to do is socialise with them, but your colleagues can't be all thinking the same way, maybe you'll be able to find your little corner of allies, or just nice people that might one day lead you to a new opportunity.. you never know. 

I can't tell you what you should because we are different people, but try and think about what you're trying to achieve out of this: personal growth? gaining work experience in a field you love/hate? or are you trying to use this as a stepping stone for something better? or is it about money? or about living away from where you're used to? 

It also depends on how confident you are with finding a job. If you are confident and you can back yourself up when questioned 'why did you only work at Company ABC for 1 month?', then take the plunge and perhaps you can be funemployed :)"
4369,"I don't have a lot to contribute here, but I just started my first ""real"" job too and feel much the same way. Some days I can see myself being long-term happy at my job, some days I wonder if I made a terrible mistake moving so far from home for it. I've decided I'm going to give it my best for 6 months, then reevaluate. 

Anyway, you're not alone! I think this full time thing is much different and harder than it sounded during college. Best of luck to you."
4370,"Yeah I agree, you should start getting job apps out there, or setting up networking coffee dates, especially while your workload is light! 

Sure some places will turn you down for lack of experience or could think it’s weird you’re leaving so soon. But many employers also understand that job responsibilities and company culture don’t always live up to expectations! 

There will be other places that value your skills and enthusiasm. It tends to be easier to get a job while you have a job, so hopefully things don’t get so bad that you want to quit asap. Hit up 1-3 old supervisors, professors, or colleagues about potentially serving as references. 

If you wind up getting an offer from somewhere else but you feel like things are really improving at your current place, then great, you can consider staying! 

But if you get an offer you’re excited about, go for it and don’t let guilt or fear hold you back. 

That said, you should also really consider an honest chat with your manager, if you haven’t had one already. They may have good advice or feel motivated to improve your experience. Probably shouldn’t mention that you’re considering leaving though. 

I hope things improve!! Keep your chin up and don’t let this diminish your self esteem. You will find the right place."
4371,"That's a good point. Should I give it more time? I'm at a large corporation and I've heard from management often takes up to six months to get a feel for the processes, and a year and a half to really know what's going on."
4372,"Hey, I'm so sorry to hear about your experience and I sympathize with you. First full-time jobs are really hit or miss. Mine was awful as well...there were days I'd just wanna get up and leave and not come back. So you're not alone in this regard. 

I'm actually an immigrant working in an office with mainly caucasian co-workers in the Midwest as well. And it seems like the office dynamic at my place is quite similar to yours. Office politics, gossiping, co-workers being in a complete different life stage (white soccer moms in their 40's, married with kids and I'm the only 20 yr old male in my department lol). But I'd say I get along with all of them quite well! I go out to happy hours with them all the time (yes, moms do drink) and I'm able to form a solid friend group with other young people in different departments. 

I shared this only because I want to give you hope and be supportive. To show you that yes, some jobs out there can be a great match to you! This is only temporary and in a year or two, you'd be in a complete different place. So keep your head up!"
4373,No. Start looking if you're unhappy. Otherwise 6 months becomes a year. A year becomes two. Then you're that guy who's been at the company for a decade half assing it because you hate your life.
4374,Definitely don’t share your thoughts about the job/environment with gossipers (or any of your co’s...they all seem consumed by the negativity they’ve created). They’ll twist your words and tell the wrong person who’ll then tell someone more important.
4375,"I hear you. I think what's hard is my manager keeps talking about my development in terms of 1-1.5 years, & when I think of 6 months out all I can think about is how I'll still be here, and things won't be any better. My coworkers hate their jobs; they're always gossiping about their frustrations. Conversely, management won't allow for any negativity, so it creates for a really weird environment. I'm trying to test the waters with my colleagues; it's hard because I don't know how honest I can be without knowing how it will be received. I was honest with a colleague about how I'd heard from a former intern that the drivers here had certain bad habits, and she was pretty offended. I'm hoping I'll pick up the cadence after a little while (if I stay that long). 

&#x200B;

That's the thing: I don't know anymore. For the first few weeks it was work experience, office experience, life experience, but I don't feel like I'm making headways on any of these things. I'm not getting much work, and the work I'm trying to create seems like a bad idea politically (I stopped pursuing my idea after I talked to several coworkers—I wanted to bridge my team with the one above us, since my team always complains about how their briefs don't make sense). I keep asking for things to do; I'm not sure what more I can do if I can't create my own projects. I'm going to try again though—I understand it's the only way out of my unhappiness. On top of that, my function is extremely siloed, which means I don't wear many hats; only a very narrow one. So while I had anticipated I would gain experience, I'm not gaining the conceptual experience I'd need to move into an agency. I just feel really stuck."
4376,"Those gut feelings/physical symptoms you’re feeling are important! While some of what you’ve described sounds relatively normal, some of it sends up red flags - especially the fact that you and other people of color have had such similar experiences as each other that are so distinct from the rest of the office. 

I learned from a previous job to pay attention to who’s *not* there rather than who is, if you notice issues - who left the company in recent years? Who was fired? Who gets promoted and who doesn’t? Who are the important clients, and who are not? 

I want to let you know it is totally fine to job-hop. It is more common than ever. In my experience, it actually helped me because it was harder to explain in interviews why I was still working in a job/place that was a bad fit. I began job-searching two months in and left when I had been there seven months. I left my next job after three months to take the best job of my life so far. Many of my friends (we are all in our 20’s) have similar stories. Two of my friends left a job after three days after realizing their bosses were racist. It’s not your fault to not know what a job will be like going in, even if you interned there before - the dynamic is totally different as a full-time worker. If what you’re looking for is permission, you need to give it to yourself. 

Best of luck - whatever happens, I hope you’re able to find a situation where you feel well-treated and that you belong. You’ll do better work in that environment anyway."
4377,"That was my plan, too. I wish you the best of luck! I hope things work out; if they don't, I hope you can find something better to move onto. :)"
4378,"Hey Mate,

I want share my own personal experience just to let you know you’re not alone with the stresses of transitions. I’m sure you’ll do amazing things in your career regardless of whether you stay or leave this place.

My first job out of uni was at an accounting firm in the north-west of my city, 50 people or so. I was excited to finally land a grad program job after uni and do work in my field and live down in the city.

When I started work though after a one week and bit training session, things didn’t pan out as had been expected. When I asked questions, I was told to refer to my notes from training and figure it out on my own. There was also barely any supervision or catch-ups to make sure I was going on the right path. I got grilled 1 month into working there for making mistakes and my work on big client projects was criticised, with the manager calling my work “shit” and my supervisor sending me daily emails asking about vague learnings and reflections with no measurable, quantitative goals and being scolded when I had an honest answer about what I had learned, because according to her it wasn’t good enough. The supervisor who I worked with also refused to give feedback when I asked her, claiming “it wasn’t her job” and to ask my manager who barely had any involvement with my work, despite the fact that she would give me feedback when she noticed a mistake or error. My job was also threatened in these feedback meetings.

After the three month point, where my review said I was improving well, I was never brought into one on ones and never had any major complaints so I assumed I was doing well. Around the six month point, I was pulled into an impromptu meeting with my manager and the general manager and told that I was being let go at the end of the financial year as I was “still asking questions” and they were “concerned about how I would cope with the influx of work in the new year”. It was such a shock, and I went through a range of emotions ranging from confusion, disbelief and anger. These concerns hadn’t been raised at our three month point, and I had felt compared to starting I had actually made improvements and was getting better with processing the work. My manager said in a private meeting with him that I should consider another career such as working in a bank, that I was failing to “see the big picture”, and that my learning style (I have Aspergers which does make learning a bit tricky at some points and did disclose later on) was a “cost for the business” which is why I couldn’t stay on.

I left the firm and spent a good month or two struggling to maintain my mental health and sanity, and was questioning my abilities to do accounting work. Thankfully though in the time from being let go to now, I’ve been working in a voluntary capacity at the head office of a state charity on the business projects team and have been commended and praised for my work, and have done a training program that will hopefully lead to a job, with another interview at a government agency in the city as well which went really well. I’ve also sorted out medication and exercise which has boosted my confidence and productivity alongside my mental health. And looking back now, I’m in a much better spot than I was.

Sorry for the long post, I just want to tell you that whatever happens, you’ll be okay. You’ll be valued by someone and do great things in your life."
4379,"I had similar experience with yours cos I ended up working full time at my first place of internship. I interned as a Content writer and everyone on the team loved me during the short time and I made lots of friends. 

Fast forward to the real job, everything changed, I noticed all the bad operations in the company and I felt bad for myself. Luckily, I had mentors then so I opened up to few of them and I was advised to start working on my personal development (new language and more recognised certification courses) which I did. I left the job in less than a year and got another with one of the ex-managers from the company as well.

Simply put, it's just a toxic workplace and as an Intern you can only know little of this until you join full time. In your free time, try to learn non verbal so you can better understand how others feel about you as a POC and not having lots to do on your desk."
4380,"In the meetings with Co-workers you hadn’t met before, what did you talk about? Did you ask for advice on how to navigate the environment? Typically people who don’t know you or your position in the social hierarchy of the place will give you honest answers."
4381,"I left my first job after 3 months for similar reasons. My new job is much better and while I still haven’t quite connected with my coworkers as they’ve become a friendship group and a little cliquey. I just go to work, do my bit & go home to my life. It’s much easier now that I actually enjoy the work. 

Start looking for a new job and leave when you can. In the meantime, you’ll have to stick with it. Can you maybe listen to music while you work?"
4382,"> I've just noticed it's been really hard for me to concentrate on other things once work is over. 

This is very common and makes time away from work almost as bad as work itself -- Traumatic things tend to imprint themselves on the brain and even though some people would not see your work as ""traumatic""[because they are used to it I guess], but for you, since this the first time in *your* life *you've* had to deal with this on an extended basis, especially, it is difficult for you and the body does not care if other people ""had it worse"" --it responds how it responds. It takes time and knowledge to retrain your body to not be as stressed, and this is different for each person, and for some people they will never get used to it enough to not have it adversely affect their mind and body. 

So, having someone to talk to might help and CBT, DBT and ""radical acceptance"" techniques may be in order here. /r/CBT /r/DBT have info and you can look each one up for yourself to find one that fits you. Never let others tell you how you ""should"" respond internally, figure that out custom-made for yourself. 

Sometimes that requires a coach of sorts that trains you like they would an athlete. Once the athlete has had that coaching they can then go on to do their own ""work outs"", training, and after-care.  Someone that has had training in coaching others might be necessary to become an expert yourself and for yourself individually. This means a therapist whether in person or online.


Not everyone can afford that whether money-wise or time-wise. In that case, especially, have compassion on yourself and talk to yourself as if you were talking to a beloved friend[not harshly because that is abusive]. Either way, look over the two subreddits and techniques and see **if** you can find something helpful. Dont let others force it on you or condemn you."
4383,"Sounds like a nightmare, get out while you can..."
4384,I'm happy to hear that it's a great fit for you! Maybe I can try to make it work. Thanks! :)
4385,"If it makes you feel any better, my first full time job has bad politics too. I love my co workers but my administrators clique and do not have our backs. I’m looking for a new job but For now I’m stuck with it. My therapist is trying to empower me on my rights as a worker. She’s currently encouraging me to have HR sit in on our meetings since my manager is extremely critical"
4386,"Dude....you clearly don't know or understand how midwesterners operate....that is how they are....very polite and friendly BUT IT'S ALL AN ACT.....You keep saying that they are friendly but they're also doing everything to indirectly show that they are not really as friendly as you think....I live in the midwest and I am also a P.O.C and what you are experiencing is the NORM here in the midwest for P.O.C......THAT IS EXACTLY HOW THEY ARE.....they are very tactical and calculated ppl and they use ""friendliness"" as a cover up for their alterior motives........so I encourage to either move back to where you came from....or if you're going to stay in the midwest then you have to develop the toughest skin possible to deal with these MONGRELS.....I personally don't know why a P.O.C would choose to stay here after an internship.....I made that mistake and 10 years later I regret it.....You're a young person.....Don't waste your time dealing with these heathens.....AMERICA is big...MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE...but the last place you want to step foot in as a P.O.C is the midwest.....I've travelled for work throughout all the regions of America and the absolute worst ppl I'd rather not deal with are ppl from the midwest....Yes...very friendly...very polite...but it's 90% of the time an act...they are very good actors and actresses here in the midwest....All of them could win an oscar...but yeah, that's how they are....Never fall for those wide smiles and fake excited....it's just their acting skills you are falling for....AND DO YOUR JOB and DO IT WELL...because those midwesterners will not hesitate to fire you.....seems like their already finding a way to get rid of you and they will if you give them an inch....

And yes, it's not in your head...YOU ARE BEING WATCHED.....

4389,But what if you’re lying?
4390,"Congrats on being the first in your family to go to college! I hope it directly leads you to a lot of good things in the future. 

I have only respect for you! :)"
4391,Not really. A lot of people I know are struggling to come to terms with the new reality and some might even subconsciously blame themselves. You can see it all over this sub. My apologies for trying to offer some words of encouragement.
4392,"I was with you until you said to write this year off. That is a terrible idea. There are lots of things we can do during the time: taking classes and learning new skills, getting more fit, reading, cleaning, home improvement, volunteer work, entrepreneurship, etc. Personally, I'm taking an online course, learning bartending, running, and stretching. Let's make this a year of self improvement.

*For the people downvoting me, OP edited his post after I commented"
4393,My plans fell through years ago before this administration and corona virus lol
4394,People in grad school tend to take things very personally. I don’t think this is bad at all and I’m sorry people are being so bitter.
4395,"i made a nice thread that got some good responses about this same subject. don't beat yourself up over not getting a job, or spend the entirety of the summer draining yourself on shouldawouldacoulda's, or if you're like me and live at home with high-risk family and don't want to even try an in-person job for fear of killin them, but even so you can still do a whole lot

for me while I feel like shit being a 21y/o with no internship or job, I'm trying to remember i'm also a caretaker for my grandparents, and both they + my mom have a shit ton of projects for me to do, extensive gardenin, online course, and I have a side woodworking business that could use some love. 

/u/quadrilateraltriangl, thanks for the positivity overall- I think there's a balance between relentless self-improvement and takin' it easy"
4396,"Nope don't apologize. I'm feeling negativity and discouragement, even when I'm ""relatively"" safe as far as living goes. I'm thankful to still be living in a house rent-free and with a parent who still has their job. But I'm anxious about my school plans and if they might not work out; and frustrated that opportunities to find new jobs have dropped down several rungs (for literally everybody), and for that reason the other parent has to remind me of what a shit adult I am. I wish I could stop being a ""disappointment"" to myself and my parents. I could have it worse, but I also don't know what's coming next, and I feel for everybody who is just lost right now. The least I could be doing is picking up my own pieces. So *thank you.*"

4403,"Don't over invest, even though you're amped for your new job- make a very strict distinction between your work and personal time. As a newcomer your expected to grind harder, take on more and pickup others'slack... Fuck that shit. The way you behave in these initial days will define how others in the office will treat you as. Don't be too disposable. That being said- kick some serious ass while you're in office and make sure to walk out before a set time.

4405,Thanks so much! 😄 Doesn’t feel real.
4406,"Don’t expect to know  everything  right off the bat! Take your time to learn, you’re not expected to be perfect by the end of the training period. Just make sure to keep a good work life balance. Your job is what gives you the resources to do what you actually want to do with your life."

Do not be cocky; some one who does not know themselves , this leads to them trying to project something else out. 

Be assertive; assertiveness is not aggressiveness. An assertive person is first assertive to them selves. This means knowing your emotions, listening to your self. So that when someone wants to treat you the way you wouldn’t treat your self, you can easily say, this isn’t how I will treat my self, this give you the power to stand your ground.

Bring an easy lunch that you can eat wherever until you establish a routine. Turn up 15 minutes early if possible."

4422,"So, how did your first day go?"
4423,"Did you major in Journalism? I'm an English Literature/French double in May 2017  and I want to be newspaper writer or an editorialist at a publishing house. How'd you get your foot in door? I'm looking to be an editorial assistant or town newspaper writer, but where would I start? I'm lacking a bit in work experience."
4424,Is it an internship or full time job writing for the paper?
4425,It went so much better than I thought! I followed everyone’s advice and asked a lot of questions and wrote down as many notes as I could. My coworkers were very welcoming and one even bought me lunch. There was a lot of information that came at me but I think I did pretty well at retaining a lot of it. I definitely feel much more confident now and a lot of my anxieties are eased.
4426,"I got my degree in English Publishing Studies, but did journalism all throughout high school and majored in it for a year in college. Then during my senior year I was a copy editor for my school newspaper and interned at my school’s publications unit. So both of those internships helped a lot. When I graduated I was looking for editorial assistant jobs at book publishing companies and interviewed for a few, but nothing came out of them. I think it’s because I’m located in the midwest and not on the east coast of the U.S. where there’s more publishing opportunities. Honestly the job I got was the first journalism job I’ve ever interviewed for. I think I managed to get the job because I applied right away and was engaged and demonstrated my passion in the interview. The editor just kind took a chance on me. But in terms of book publishing, definitely grab any internship you can. I know a couple of people who did the summer Princeton internships and landed some good jobs. I’ve heard University of Denver has a good program too. But those are bigger ones and kinda require money to relocate and live. I’d say also look for copy editing internships at local newspapers and websites. You learn a lot about journalism and sharpen your editing skills that way. Best of luck!"
4427,"Time to cut the blathering shit. There are three questions worth asking in this situation. What is your end goal? What will it take/cost to get there? Would it be worth it? If the answer is no, then it’s time to make a new end goal or be satisfied with your current path. Good luck with your decision."
4428,listen to this guy.
4429,"First and foremost, learn to manage your stress before it wrecks you. Does your school have a counseling center? Extracurricular meditation classes? A gym? If so, take advantage of them. If you think you don’t have time, find the time. Once you start managing your stress/learning how to avoid it, things may seem less bleak and then you can make a decision based on logic rather than stress or anxiety. You can do this! Good luck to you :)"
4430,Ya like the average time someone is in college
4431,"A lot of college feels like busywork, there's really no way around it. What exactly is your major, and how far are you into it? Its good that you have internships under your belt, and i'd suggest you stay the course, get the degree, and do/continue doing your computer stuff during your downtime. College is stressful, and that seems to be regardless of major. (I recently graduated with a degree in Cell and Molecular Biology, and I'm currently working on my Masters' in Biotechnology)"
4432,"Hi!!! Preaching to the choir here. I’m a sophomore in a weird half-engineering, half-business major Frankenstein of a degree as many university Cybersecurity/Information Security courses are so new and underdeveloped still. I’m currently interning as a penetration tester and security researcher and am having a blast so the passion is still there (and I can see you still love it yourself!) 
Have you looked into any certifications? A degree is nice to have but not always needed. Depending on what route you specifically want to do, there are all sorts of certs you can get to potentially supplement (or complement) a degree. I’m studying for my GPEN right now on-top of school. 
You’re going to a great field filled with awesome people and something fun to learn and do every single day. Keep finding the things that keep you are passionate in, find a mentor to help guide you to the best decisions, and you’ll do just fine! 
Good luck!!!!"
4433,"Mentorship- Do you have any contacts from your previous internships? Ask them first! Connect on LinkedIn, email them, meet up for lunch, video chat! There is a bunch of different ways you can keep the relationship going. if you don’t have any contacts from your previous internships, check out Twitter! The #MentoringMonday tag is always flooded with people trying to find mentors and mentees, you can probably find a match. 

Job - I’m unaware of your location, but look at infosec-jobs.com. They have everything from internships to full-time and everything in between. 

Certs - They are weird, a lot of the time they’ll help you get in the door, but in our field, experience trumps all. I’ve worked with people with degrees in Art and Education, and people that have GEDs and nothing else to their name. Try to push out that degree if you can, but if it’s absolutely unbearable, a good resume with experience and a cert or two should land you a decent entry-level position."
4434,[deleted]
4435,Four years?
4436,"Keep going in your program! Even if you graduate with a cybersecurity degree and decide you don’t want to be in the field, you can just go and do something else."
4437,"What’s your major? 

Biggest regret I had in college was no interning or degree related experience, so you’re already way ahead of me."
4438,listen to this guy but see if you can take a minor that will help you move up faster. Internet law for example or HR as minors or certificates. Give yourself the major in the field you want and a demonstration that you can be more than a one trick pony
4439,"How do you find a mentor? How did you get than penetration testing gig? That’s what I’m going for. Thank you! 

And I thought certs were to compliment a degree. Didn’t know they were that highly looked at"
4440,"I think if you really wanted, you would give out the greatest advice ever. Not in spite of your age but because of it."
4441,"Yes. College is not so much learning the material, but *learning how to learn* while you are on the job. This is especially true for such a fast moving major like cybersecurity. You also start networking with fellow cybersecurity experts and with people learning majors that are related to your field [even majors that *seem* very unrelated like philosophy, English literature, and psychology/sociology stuff].  Every science/technology field there is *today* does immeasurably better if it incorporates what seems to not relate to it *to the beginner*.  Don't get caught up in the attitudes and practices of the past-- that is looking backwards rather than forward or at least to the present."
4442,"I think what you are in desperate need of is a retreat. Go somewhere for the day, somewhere where you can find peace and clear your mind. Take a step back, look at where you are at and decide what you need to do. It seems like your quite successful so far, CS majors are not super easy to get usually (or at least where I’m from where it’s super competitive)."
4443,"Pretty much no degree actually prepares you for the job. If you still like the core themes, stick with it and get working in a relevant job as soon as possible. You will only learn through experience"
4444,I don’t know how far along you are in school but classes tend to become more relevant to the working world the closer you get to graduation. Perhaps seek out a mentor in your field about what may help you be successful in your career. Maybe an alum of your college who has been out of school for 5+ years. That also helps you network btw.  Treat it as an information interview not a job interview
4445,Cybersecurity. I have experience. In high school I just couldn't study I hated it so I told myself I could  remove some pressure from school as long as I get experience so that's what I did. Now i wish I put more pressure on grades and understanding my classes
4446,"What school do you attend? Have you looked into information systems? School doesn’t teach you shit besides “you can function in a corporate environment with small teams and meet deadlines”. This is what school proves to employers. Most people who excel post-college are the students who’s hobbies included their major, and they actively were doing anything to enhance their skills/teach others."
4447,"Leave, college is just as much about learning what youbdont want to do and what you dont have the heart to do as anything else. Just leave or switch. Get an associate's and a job if thats what you feel would be best. Youve done the internships so you know what those jobs are like, they should help you decide if its for you or not."
4448,"The easiest way I have made friends post college is just being game for anything. I’ll go to my acquantence’s New Years party that I was invited to on facebook even though I probably won’t know anyone besides a couple people, and then just talk to people. Invite a couple people over and encourage them to bring their new friend from work - now they’re your friend too."
4449,"Yeah, it's normal. 

The people I know who don't feel that way either moved home or happened to land in the same city as a bunch of friends.

The fact of the matter is that most people graduate and move to a new city chasing a job, which rarely is the city they are from, went to school in, or the same city their friends moved to. 

You'll make new friends. But don't expect the same number of close friends as in school. As life gets more complex, social circles shrink. For each major life milestone you hit, expect to lose one friend because a lack of time.

Full time career job? Lose a friend.
Live in SO/spouse? Lose a friend.
Move to the suburbs? Lose a friend.
Have a kid? Lose a friend, and a half a friend for every kid after that.

It sounds sad, but it's not. If you look back on your childhood, you'll realize that your parents had two, maybe three close friends. Maybe even just one close friend. Lots of friendly acquaintances, lots of work friends, and still lots of old friends that come to visit now and again. But not very many close friends that they spent time with. The days fill up with work, family, self improvement, and other good things."
4450,"I’ll look out for that, thanks. Any recs on how to make friends outside of school?"
4451,"You’re not alone in this feeling.  Lately I’ve been thinking about how much social interaction I’m lacking in general, compared to spending all my time from class to class, to part time job.  Now basically my only interaction is at my part time job and with my family.

So yea, it sucks right now, this whole in between phase sucks.  Just try to stay positive, easier said than done!"
4452,[deleted]
4453,"It’s totally normal! Make sure to go out and be social, go to bars and restaurants and events where people your age hang out, try to keep in touch with old and new friends, but after awhile, you’ll settle in and find friends again. I felt the exact same way, but I’ve been out of school for about 3 years now and moved to a brand new city and have a really nice group of friends now. Unfortunately it just takes time! A lot of my friends from college all moved to different cities, but keeping in touch with them and going to visit them in all of their new cities has been really fun too!"
4454,Thank you for sharing this! And for keeping my hopes up. I’m glad you’re in the place you are!
4455,"I am keeping my group together as much as possible. I had a core group that did everything together in college(both on and off campus) and now that we've graduated, we always keep in touch via text and discord. We also still hang out, albeit not the huge outings we did regularly while in school unless it's someone's birthday or it's planned weeks in advance. It's much easier to hang onto what you have, even if you have to put in some effort."
4456,"Friendships are easiest to maintain when there’s a shared interest and a natural reason to see each other regularly: school, work, your kid’s school, etc. 

The difficulty and value of maintaining friendships once this ‘natural contact’ is no longer there depends on various things, namely:

- Location - do you still live near each other? Maintaining old friendships from a distance is nice but it’s not really going to give you that face to face interaction or someone to go out with in person 
- Lifestyle - if one person is still single/big into partying and someone else is in a relationship/has
- How easy it is - when you catch up does it feel like you were never apart or is it weird without the shared interest that brought you together? If a friendship is arduous to maintain then maybe don’t 

The easiest thing if you’d like more friends or to get out more, is to look for those shared interests/regular contact which naturally facilitate easy friendships. For example, reaching out to people at work, or joining a club or local group."
4457,"Man I’ve been feeling the same, recently all the friends I used to have while at school seem to be gone and some others have moved outside my country. Right now I’d recommend you to seek friends in any way you can and maybe try to go to the gym, I did so to clear out my and have got a couple workout buddies."
4458,"After school I lost my contacts with all my close friends. I'm in college now, a 3rd year student, an introvert. I find it hard to connect with people. Cuz I don't wanna just start a new friendship with new people. I do have friends here but I don't socialize with them often. And I feel like after college I'll hardly be in contact with them. I like my personal space more than anything but still sometimes it kinda kills me and I feel like I'm doing this wrong. You wouldn't believe how good I am in making new friends and everyone seem to like my company but still, I didn't feel like doing it now."
4459,Does that even work after college?
4460,"Assuming you arent like living in the same city post-graduation with a lot of friends from college, then yeah that's sorta how it goes. Most friendships are going to wane if you are physically apart for a long stretch of time. There are very few people in your life that you knew for like 4 years and are going to actually going to mange to stay in each other's lives purely through texts and calls. It's a new era in your life, you make new friends. totally normal, dont stress about it."
4461,How exactly did you make new friends?
4462,"Thank you! Friendships take time, so don't feel pressured to make them happen. As long as you're open to new ideas and make an effort to socialize, you'll do fine."
4463,"Do both. Grow new friendships, nurture old ones. I've been actively reconnecting with people and organizing gatherings. Everyone is busy getting their life together (esp those who move to new places, get married etc) so I don't expect frequent hang-outs like in school. There will be friends whom you meet once a year or once a month. 

My theory is that everyone secretly hopes that their friends check up on them but they are usually unwilling to initiate it. So go ahead and talk to old friends. It doesn't actually require that much effort considering how much time we waste on social media or the internet in general. I let people know that I am willing to host/ have a meal with them if they ever visit my city."
4464,"I had a good amount of friends in college but as soon as I graduated I lost communication with everyone. Not a single college friend. I don't really care but that's because I'm a little bit antisocial and I don't feel the need reconnect. Besides, I moved to a different country after I graduated so It's not like I could call them to go hangout anyways."
4465,"I'm still in school, but I used bumble bff for a couple days and everybody was so freaking nice on there. I ended up getting drinks with this one girl and we clicked so well that talked and laughed for 3 hours straight and surprisingly had a shit ton in common.
Obviously you have to be super careful, but if you're meeting them in public for the first time I don't see how it's different from meeting people in any other way once you've done a vibe check irl."
4466,I didn't have too many friends in the first place.
4467,"I starting hanging out with a guy I worked with. I wasn't too sure about him at first. He seemed like a bit of a stickler. But he and his then-girlfriend (now wife) ended up introducing me to their network of friends, many members of which became my friend group, through whom I met more people. A lot of them turned out to be so great. Some of the best friends I've ever had, including the two of them. I had tried to bar scene for a couple months at first, and became a regular at one. That was fun, but it didn't directly lead me to any friends. The take away is to give people a try. If they end up being not your cup of tea, no skin off your back. But they may end up being awesome."
4468,Nothing man you get paid while you learn. And then you go straight to work field and make banks.
4469,"A masters is great, but only if you've truly discovered you'd love to work in that specific field professionally.  I would *not* advise anyone to go back to school just to go back to school, or to hope that whatever they choose just suddenly ""clicks.""  You've gotta figure that out first."
4470,"The idea that you need to be “passionate” about your job is wrong. Work is work. Once you start doing it, even if it’s something you love, it won’t be fun. I’ve heard musicians and artists complaining that they don’t enjoy music or art anymore because it’s work to them.

TheBEST work advice I’ve ever heard was don’t think about what you want to BE, think about what you like doing day to day. If you want to be a big music star, do you want to practice 8h/day? If you want to be a journalist, do you want to talk to strangers that often? 

So in your case it seems like you’re making it in the industry that you majored in. First of all, this is a major achievement for most people. You should be happy about that. 

Second, it seems like you weren’t prepared to do day to day administrative work. I think the day to day admin stuff is an essential part of any job, ESPECIALLY in the beginning. In my field, the new employees always do the grunt work, data entry, emailing, organizing meetings etc along with research and analysis but the managers are the ones coming up with the ideas and doing the fun stuff. I think that’s pretty normal. 

So I have to be honest....if you don’t hate t but you don’t love it, i think you’re thinking about it all wrong. You won’t love any job. You’ll like some more than others, but that’s more likely to be influenced by your coworkers than by your job. If you HATED it I would say get out of there but you don’t. I think your expectations are too high. Would you love any job? Probably not."

4472,Let's do it. I'm 18 rn I will get my associates in community college and hop on trading. My parents are disappointed by me but I wont let them ruin my life. 😄
4473,I've thought about trying it. What amount of commitment is required to try it?
4474,"I've been trying college for years. I didn't take classes this semester. I should just do a trade and stop when I have a better plan

Thanks for the help!"
4475,"My parent were disappointed that my brother went AA > electrical but now he makes 80k at 23... more than my other brother who majored in the ever-illustrious Computer Science. 

I think it’s a good idea fam."
4476,"I have a film degree and an office job. I started out pretty low on the totem poll but moved my way up to managing a studio team and a handful of editors for educational content. 95% of my job is administrative tasks which I definitely hated when I first got out of school. I wanted to be doing creative work. 

I’ve been here for about 7 years now and honestly love the work I do and love the people I work with and a bonus only work 40 hours a week. Maybe you can find an office job that’s in line with your degree somehow?"
4477,"I did an electrical apprenticeship for awhile, it’s not for everyone but give it a try, you learn a lot of life skills"
4478,Just to try out college. I'm getting Pell Grant so I won't get any loans. I gotta make some friends and build a good connection if life goes downhill ya know?
4479,"Masters degrees also tend to be expensive, not really a good idea unless you have scholarships, a job that’ll pay for it or it’s something you REALLY want to get into  and need a masters for"
4480,"That was my mistake. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I got a master’s in my undergraduate field to bide my time and hope I was good enough/passionate enough to keep going with it. It was grueling and by the time I had finished, pretty damn unrewarding considering all the work I had put in. I think I had just a bad case or academic burnout.

I’m not sure it was the program for me in retrospect even though the support system was pretty great and I had incredibly smart and talented professors. Needless to say I do not use it lol."
4481,"Your brother is an extreme outlier. The average electrician makes 51k a year.

Not saying it’s a bad idea to get into that but it’s also misleading to act like it’s common. Most electricians don’t make that much throughout their career."
4482,biggest issue here is you don't know what you want to do so you've stagnated and gotten stuck with what you have. What was your intent in getting a film degree? Did you wanna work in movies? Be a director? be an actor? I just graduated with an animation degree and a majority of people who I saw were doing unwell artistically while in school were immediately able to get production jobs/internships in television cartoons and they're thriving now. You need a set goal and you need to re-evaluate how you're going to get there. Do a lot of research after you figure out what you want.
4483,"Also, tradesmen will typically cap at $80k/year (higher amount based off of urban areas). There’s little room for growth. And, depending on where you live, that’s not enough money to raise a family.

If you’re living in rural Iowa making that kind of money, you’ll be living like a king. But if you’re living in the coasts, you’re going to have a much harder time.

Not to mention the toll that being a tradesman takes on your body. An accident could put you out of work for good.

Pursuing a trade definitely isn’t for everyone, but can be viable depending on where you live and whether you have health issues. And if you’re willing to obtain health issues after pushing your body hard for several years."
4484,"Yep, I come from a suburban conservative area in Ohio so a lot of people go into trades. People who have been doing it for 20-30 years barely even make that much. Most experienced tradesmen I come across make around 60k. The only exceptions really are the business owners or the people working 80+ hour weeks. 

They all have had a bunch of surgeries and some were even on disability before they reached retirement age due to how hard that work is on your body. people on reddit act like you’ll be making 100k a year in no time and it’s just misleading."
4485,"I’m 25 and don’t know what I want to do either. I got a Bachelors in management and work for an insurance company like I said. An insurance company that handles like home/auto/work comp stuff like that. I don’t care for it but I make a living wage and sit at a desk all day. It ain’t much but it pays the bills and I’m at zero risk of injury pretty much lol.

I will say insurance jobs are everywhere and you don’t need a degree to get into it. Customer service experience helps and as long as you have some social skills you can get a job making a living wage in this industry. If you have good social skills then you could do great. 

If you want a job you’re passionate about then don’t bother because nothing about insurance is interesting in my opinion. But nothing about trades is interesting either I don’t think."
4486,"You sound like me. I graduated in 2017 with a degree in Electronic Media and Communication (closest thing to Film & TV I could find near me). I’ve worked at a TV station as a video editor and have done some freelance work. I realized I didn’t enjoy it as much as in the past, when editing had been a hobby. While I’m good at it, I realize its workplace application doesn’t fulfill my other life requirements of security, financial comfort, ability to move anywhere and helping others.
I did some research and took many personality assessments. I chose to go back to school to obtain a second BS in Clinical Lab Science. It will fulfill my important life requirements and will allow me time to edit video as a hobby. 
Forget “passion” for a while. Find out what you need out of life, not JUST a JOB: work-life balance, traveling, financial security, family, etc., then find a job that you can do and will provide you with the means to do what you love on the side. 
As for finding interests, what would you do as a child? What would you daydream about? Ask your family for help with this one. A great book that helped me sort my life after coming to the realization that media wasn’t my life’s work was Pathfinder by Nicolas Lore. Best of luck! PM me if you’d like to talk."
4487,"Great route for sure, but not if OP is in Alberta. There are way too many electricians and not enough jobs. Many are laid off and having trouble finding work with decent electrical companies. The good work is in commercial and industrial, not in residential."
4488,I’ve never really thought about it but I will look into it! Interested to see what all there is.
4489,"That’s a bit misleading. People on reddit who have never worked in a trade or who don’t know people who work in a trade will say otherwise but It’s not always easy getting a trade job without connections, experience or going to a trade school, which can cost as much as a degree. People will say “get a union trade job!” But there’s wait lists for those and it’s not uncommon to spend 3-4 years on the list before you get a chance. 

You’re also unlikely to make much starting out in a trade until you get experience, not much more than you would in retail but the average tradeworker in general makes 45k a year... not bad for someone who doesn’t need a degree, but also not great. It’s exhausting work and the odds of getting injured is pretty high. 

I’m not saying don’t go into a trade, I’m just saying don’t believe everything people say on reddit because trades are circlejerked here and a lot of false information is given out."
4490,I'm 22. What's the associates for?
4491,"Hey OP
As someone who also graduated with a television degree in 2017, I fuuuuckin feel you. 
I tried to work in the film / corporate video industry for awhile and also discovered it’s not for me. Underpaid, bullshit hours and lack of appreciation. 

Through a strange twist of fate I work for an events / live production firm now, and it’s infinitely better. Much better pay, consistent work and you don’t get treated as an office lackey.

I’d highly recommend checking out live production work, I love it infinitely more and would never go back to video at this point. Plus! I get to use video skills to shoot events occasionally & get paid at a higher rate than I would normally to shoot :-) 

Just a suggestion! 
I feel your pain my friend, hang in there, there’s worlds upon worlds of production areas that I had no idea about"
4492,"Third day of my print media job. I want out, so badly. I don’t understand how people do this their whole lives."
4493,Fuck off
4494,Omg I'm scared...I live in Texas how's it there? Ohio sounds rough for tradesman
4495,"I feel like that’s how it’s going to be no matter where you go. It’s rough work and a lot of people who try it out don’t last. 

When people on reddit say you make good money because of someone they know, they’re leaving important details out like that the person in reference is a business owner, the person works a lot of overtime or they live in a very high cost of living area. 

Just look up average tradesmen salaries and injury rates etc, the info is there to find.

I will say I work for an insurance company setting up claims which includes workers comp and I feel like 90% of the claims I set up are for tradeworkers. Something to be aware of."
4496,Man now I'm feeling lost. I know I know I shouldn't be moved so easily by other people's ideas but I'm scared. I'm 18 already and don't know my path. Trade or school? Business or something else? I don't know.
4497,"As some one who has just graduated with the dame degree and also in same boat idk what the fuck I’m doing. My advice is this, there are three aspects to film production as you are aware. Pre, production, and post. While in school I did a lot of pre to post work but never focused on anything till my internships. I decided I wanted to round myself out so I took on a pre production gig working for a production company. As well as working as an intern/assistant to the editor which was a postproduction job. I learned through both of those jobs that I hated post production and leaned more towards prepro. I just recently helped shoot my buddies thesis and while on that set I knew immediately that production wasn’t for me and I wanted to work in creative development. While this may or may not be an option for you I would quit the job that’s clearly not making you happy and find some possible internships. Work a smaller side job to afford rent and just try out the different aspects of production. When you try all three in a professional setting and you find one you like. You figured out the first step and can start looking into the jobs of that field. If you don’t like any of the three fields of production then I would suggest looking towards another career. I wouldn’t give up on the film career just yet. There are so many jobs in the field. Some you wouldn’t think you would enjoy and some you have never heard of. It takes time but staying with this current job isn’t the answer. You’ll figure it out. We all eventually do."
4498,"Here’s what’s been bothering me - for some reason I was led to believe that these 4 years would allow me to “find myself” and “become” some kind of fully-fledged young adult with a lively social group, my own sense of a position in a larger society, and a way forward, towards either additional education or a job. Same with law school after. What’s funny is that through hyper focusing on the “job” part, I *did* find that aspect of life, and I’m glad for it at 28, but honesty *very little* of the other stuff - knowing my place, feeling like I’ve got my own distinct personality from my family, being totally comfortable moving around the country, having some great adventures with a group of friends I’m supposed to “never forget”, have like 1 or 2 exes I’m “still in touch with” later on, etc. I did some of this personal growth of course, but I found that in the 7 years I spent in universities, I really could not do it all. Nothing came naturally, and everything was a fucking hard as fuck grind - whether it was looking for a club to join and make friends, trying to figure out how to go on dates with even one person who liked me, studying enough to get a good job, etc., etc. *All of it* left me totally fucking exhausted, and I’m frankly not sure what aspects of it were worth it. I’ve had some good experiences, but at the end of the day life feels very... “meh”, rather than some excited fun time I imagined it could be at 18. The whole last decade I’ve felt I’ve done on “hard mode” in some video game I’m not sure I ever really enjoyed, and I’m not totally convinced there was any kind of worthwhile reward."
4499,ohhhhh shit i didn’t even think of this! thanks man
4500,Because college is 4 years.
4501,You need an eighth of shrooms & a vacation spot
4502,"Well you sound like a compassionate person. Why don't we all just grab ourselves by the bootstraps while we're at it and say ""fuck you I got mine"" to everyone struggling, as tradition dictates?

I'm glad you and the others enjoyed growing up and learning to adapt to adult life. However, there's a whole generation that isn't and it's clear that words like ""adulting"" came about as a symptom of the systemic issues younger people are facing. No, these issues aren't simply ""not accepting responsibility"" or ""not wanting to grow up"", although yes there are people that this always does apply to (but don't just accuse ""young people"" of this)."
4503,/r/wowthanksimcured
4504,"It was common with my peers, but I never stressed out about getting into a dream school. Made it a little easier. Same with my major (didn’t make it easier; now a bit of a regret)."
4505,"Get better genes. Imagine if you were extremely good looking, born with a 160 IQ, born into riches,and had the charisma of a world leader. Your college experience would be something far from “meh” or “exhausting”, I guarantee you. 

Sometimes the dice fucks you."
4506,"You tell people your going to college, hardly any questions. You tell people your not going to college and they freak out."
4507,"It sounds like you're comparing apples to oranges.

Choosing a college is one thing. It's one decision. The others you listed are multiple. They're also all vastly different. 

I think it's important to consider that when you were thinking about college, you probably initially took things one at a time. When you initially chose a college, you probably weren't thinking (yet) about making friends, the difficulty of classes, maybe even choosing a major, your life after college, etc. You probably weren't thinking about finding the person to spend the rest of your life with either. 

So you should take things one at a time after college too. Do not put too much pressure on yourself thinking you need to figure everything out right away. There's no reason why you should stress yourself out to that level. 

Get a job first. Just do that. Then wherever you get a job, that general area is where you're going to live. The money you make from your job should hopefully allow you to figure out and pay bills. Then as you get settled into your job and your new routine, you can start thinking about meeting new people.  

If it is all too stressful for you, consider staying with parents for a bit, if that's an option. That way you can focus less on where to live or paying bills and just focus on getting a job (and eventually doing things and meeting people). You can work your way up to financial contributions and getting your own place one day.

Also... life will probably progressively get a little harder as you get older. That's how it goes. But you should also hopefully become better equipped to deal with the progression as you grow."
4508,"Figuring out is complex, college is just four years and you're done.

Nothing comes easy, especially when it comes to life."
4509,"The problem is that people who have no idea about life have children.  

And then you blame these children/young poeple that they have no idea about life..."
4510,"That’s because our culture and maybe the colleges themselves advertise those four years as a prolonged summer camp where you have spiritual experiences and learn life changing things.

And maybe it is for some people. Very few select people. For most people if you try to live that lifestyle while in college you’d flunk and wreck your liver.

And yeah. To completing undergrad *magna cum laude* and flaming out in graduate school, barely graduating after 3 years with a masters degree, I’m convinced school was a bizarre game they convinced you to play just to see how far you can contort yourself and still stay sane. And to no measurable benefit. Did I impress my employer with a master’s degree in math? Yeah. But they still hired people with bachelor’s for the exact same position."
4511,"It may be, friend. Or if not something hallucinogenic, some new spot at least to broaden my outlook on what’s possible."
4512,Limited options for colleges. Unlimited options in life
4513,I’m in college and I thought choosing one was the hardest thing ever. fuck
4514,You majored in a meme degree
4515,Aw shit I’m about to choose what college to go to and you’ve sent me into an existential crisis lmao
4516,Because defined choices are easy and absolute freedom is absolutely terrfying
4517,Because choosing a school is largely arbitrary. Deciding what to do for the rest of your life is a completely different thing (not even a real thing mind you.)
4518,"For me school was the thing i did when i didn’t know what else to do. To put off leaving the comfortable and structured academic environment I knew, when the next thing I had to do was homework and you get nearly instant feedback if you’re doing something wrong. to a wide world outside where your next step is far from clear and everything is up to you and no one to tell you if you’re doing it right. And I’ve heard enough stories of people just trucking along in their “real lives” and one day realizing they screwed all up. No teacher to give them a D and tell them what they did wrong.

In hindsight I should never have gone for graduate school. It’s abundantly clear that I didn’t need my graduate degree for my current job. To think I could have had my job years ago. And I hated being in graduate school."
4519,He probably did. College us a huge investment with little return atm. At best when he gets out hes gonna have a minimum wage job with a degree that wont actually help him.
4520,I am compassionate when it comes to real issues. getting anxious because you can’t figure out a bill is ridiculous

4524,"Take up an extreme sport. Whitewater kayaking, mountain biking, rock climbing etc. 

I kayaked intense whitewater consistently (class IV, V stuff) for about 5 years before I obliterated my shoulder labrum. Those rapids and rivers can be quite literally live and die by your performance."
4525,There are some ultra competitive basketball courts out there depending on where you live
4526,Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
4527,Ultimate Frisbee gets very competitive at higher levels. Try to find a league near you!
4528,"The fact of the matter is that there's not really much of a demand for ""amazing athletic tools and talents"" in the real world, where ""real world"" is one in which people give you money in exchange for doing something for them. We have machines to do real heavy lifting, and athletic finesse is something that's enjoyed as a human-focused novelty in the world of sport as a thing-in-itself. What makes humans valuable en masse is our intelligence. Our minds, our social skills, our technical skills.

If you personally enjoy being athletic, there are plenty of competitive athletic clubs and/or tournaments that you can join to scratch that itch. If you want to be athletic in your job, consider going into sports coaching, or run a gym. Even relatively active jobs like firefighting or policing only really require a modicum of athleticism to gain a competitive edge, with diminishing returns after that. But those are options too.

If what you really thrive on is the competition, that's much more economically valuable. Find a job that's super high stress: finance, trading, law, etc.

Good luck."
4529,"Yes, OP should do something sales based. I am in a sales position and it’s awesome. Everyday feels like a performance."
4530,"> high risk high reward situation where you live and die by your performance

Invest in bitcoin with your life savings lol"
4531,"I already made a comment for OP but I feel like you might benefit from this suggestion as well. 
 I know paintball isn’t as extreme as the sports you mentioned but if you can’t do them anymore because of your shoulder it might be worth trying out to see if you get a similar rush in a safer environment. I tore my rotator cuff and it doesn’t impact my ability to play at all really"
4532,You could be a rescue swimmer or infantry officer or some shit
4533,"What u could also do, I don’t do this but heard of it, is try out for a professional team if they do open tryouts for a spot on the roster. I know that in lacrosse, you can try out for an MLL team if I am correct.

Or be a firefighter, police officer, etc."
4534,"Yeah OP this is for real. Get your EMT, pick a city you wanna work in and go to the local academy, then apply as a seasonal firefighter, work full time for a bit, then get your paramedic license and then work for Los Angeles City as a FireMedic. $100k easy, and fully trained within 2yrs."
4535,"I was gonna say basketball, may be pick up but thats what Ive done to play competitively since college."
4536,Play competitive sport as an adult. Depends on the sport and location you live in but you should be able to find something.
4537,"Depending on the sport, you could try be a private trainer for younger middle school or high school-aged athletes (like if you played basketball or soccer). Good way to keep your skills up and make some extra money. 

And of course as other people mentioned there are always competitive adult sports leagues.

Edit: Just saw that you said rec sports aren’t doing it for you haha so scratch that second part"
4538,"Bro. Paintball, it’s a little pricey to get into (I played hockey growing up and the cost of that sport didn’t make the cost of paintball really shock me) but once you get in and play it you’ll never look back. I played hockey and snowboarded my whole life and neither of those give me a competitive rush like paintball does. 

Using your skill set though volunteer and coach kids teams, I did it for a few years and loved it. It’s a good way for you to pay back all the time your coaches put into developing you as a person!"
4539,Give Olympic Weightlifting a try
4540,"I feel ya. D1 soccer. 

Honestly, teach kids your sport. Sometimes it’s a side job for a bit of cash. But they love watching a good athlete and learning. You can pass on skills and a love for what you do. Volunteering looks good as hell. Working with kids too."
4541,"Become a nighttime vigilante, like Batman."
4542,You don’t mention what sports you play but powerlifters and strongmen work savagely hard to compete in brutal contests.
4543,These are great ideas. I think these Or races would be great options to pursue.
4544,Main sport was soccer but growing up I played it all
4545,"It's probably not what you're interested in but look into strongman, there's a decently active subreddit and lots of athletes have good instagram pages. I don't compete in the sport but I follow it as a fan. By all accounts, it has really intense competition and a sense of brotherhood between athletes. Plus you get to be strong and jacked AF and honestly what's more important than that. I mean those guys and gals are insane athletes by every measure."
4546,"I'm in the same boat. 

If you're interested, I've found coaching to be a really substantial outlet. You get a chance to really demonstrate everything you know and help someone learning to engage in the same experience you had. 

I've found it very fulfilling."
4547,"What do you mean when you say ""effective""? I think that other Redditors' suggestions of high-impact sports like triathlon, white water rafting, rock climbing, etc are all great ideas, especially if you will be doing them in competition. I also think it's worthwhile to have personal pursuits outside of work in order to maintain a lifestyle that you enjoy, long term. 

So despite everyone saying that sports don't matter in the ""real world"", I think they're forgetting that the ""real world"" should actually be about learning to put together a balanced and fulfilling life. Higher intensity sports may sate your desire for adrenaline and if you compete, any titles you win can be give you a professional edge (e.g. something to mention to employers in an interview if they ask about hobbies or interests -- success in your personal life is always seen positively)."
4548,"Your athletic abilities if always trying to give and use your max potential can also be used in school work.

I’ve only recently realisee this when a friend and I had been eating in 2 restaurants.

1 asian restaurant, and one from another country (where people aren’t recognized for their hard work).

After eating at those 2 places we both said
“Yeah the asian restaurant was amazing but we’ll never return to that other place”

This experience learned me that wherever you are, nonmatter what hard or easy job you do.
People are ALWAYS judging you. Every moment and point in life you could just give that little bit more in order to be a nicer person in general. 

Try to transfer that competitive mentality of yours to real life and give your best in other aspects of life! People will recognize this and only goof things can come from that :)"
4549,Or a park ranger!
4550,"LOL, so true."
4551,"I felt like this after graduating from my MSc. I am an introvert though, and have slowly managed to break out of that and reconnect with meaningful friendships I made during my uni years. It has gotten better with time, but you have to be willing to put the time into relationships too. Selfishly, I usually try to put time into the relationships that matter most to me and that has helped (ie not feeling guilty for catching up with everyone). I don’t live in the same city as any of my friends or family but we text or call regularly, if even just to check in/share a silly photo."
4552,"Well i think the bulk of the impact comes from the fact of unemployment. I was once unemployed for around 6 months right after college in a town where I knew noone and everyone was much older than me. These months were the most grueling and maddening mentally. You feel like you don't belong anywhere.

If I were you, that would be my main concern.

Even after finding employment though, things can get very lonely but that really depends on your job and where you live. You have people who work in cities or live with roommates and have very active social lives and others that work in somewhat remote locations and small towns where it can be difficult to find people to befriend.

I hope you can find a job soon so things can get easier for you. Best advice for now is to keep grinding for a job and to have a hobby and conversations on the side that can keep you sane."
4553,I feel you buddy!
4554,"Yes, welcome to the real world"
4555,"hi there, so I forget what search I did that dropped me into reddit, but I ended up also seeing your post just below whatever my search result was, and after reading your post I had to create an account just so I could reply.....

Yes - how you are feeling is totally normal.  I went through the same thing.  I am now a college professor, and talk about it openly with my students.  I recently wrote about it, and wanted to share what I wrote with you in case it helps explain things, or just makes you feel more normal.

Wishing you the best,

Greg

4556,Covid definately makes it worse! It's almost impossible to find a good job or find friends.
4557,"I’m in the same situation as you, you are not alone in this experience"
4558,Thank you! I think now is a bit similar to the recession in that there aren't so many opportunities. It definately feels like a betrayal of the promises of life after school.
4559,"Hi! Thank you for making a whole account just to reply to me. I read your writing. My degree is in sociology so it was interesting to read about these feelings through social theories! And it's good to know that it's actually common to feel this way.. I wish someone would have told me how difficult it is to get used to life after university before I graduated, so I think it's great that you talk about it with your students!"
4560,"It is a wild violation of the social contract and I resent it deeply, even now. My life, while not without struggle, has turned out better than I ever anticipated and I'm still angry I was ever put in a similar situation to the one you find yourself in now.

If you are still struggling to find work, consider learning a trade skill. The construction industry is always hiring, and that work can be a good temporary way to earn a decent wage."
4561,I think it depends on the work that you do and the company that you work for. Im likely to work in corporate work and really love all the people in my department so don’t feel quite as lonely when doing works.
4562,"To a degree, yeah. I went from living with parents, in a town where I've went to high school and uni, to living on the opposite side of the country.       

But I'm lucky enough to have a job, and specifically a job that frequently hires interstaters. I've found that having that common transplant background is great for bonding.       

 I've also been consistently surprised by the responses I get when I quash my anxiety and message high school or uni friends on social media. Even if I'm just doing relatively low effort things like sharing a meme, I can then follow up w asking about their day and such. I feel like a lot of my friends are super busy now, but even an occasional text and/or responding to their Snapchat/insta stories will made me feel a bit less awkward hitting them up when I'm back in town or scheduling a video call. It's not the same as hanging out in person but it's something. 

The other thing I've started doing is sorta explore hobbies that need a decent chunk of alone time (like gardening and home decor and cooking) and be happy doing those things."
4563,"Same. I'm self employed and it really difficult to make friends after high school. I don't attend to college because I can't afford it, making it harder to get new friends. Worse, I only have a few friends in high school."
4564,My family told me I’ll find lots of friends at work but I’d like to meet people everywhere. I’m not good at selling myself if that makes sense. Either I’ve bumped into the wrong group of people or I have to change my mindset.
4565,"Obviously, there's Covid right now, and that presents a unique circumstance that we wouldn't have normally.  However, I think that university life has aspects to it that make it feel more communal that you don't have in the world of work."
4566,"I 100% feel this. I still live in my university town as my partner is finishing up school, and don’t have a job outside the home, so my contact with society is limited. There’s not much to do in this town either besides go to the bars and party. It does suck. Even the 3 months I spent working at a smoke shop, where I thought I’d meet at least a few like-minded people, I didn’t make any friends. Hang in there. One day we’ll find a community or a place where we can meet other people like us, I just have to believe that. Because I know I have friends, they’re just not here."
4567,"A little bit at times, university was a very interesting time and crazy time for me. It was a strong tight knit community that was there for one another, i made lots of friends/acquantiances of all races, genders, ethnicities, and was very involved on campus. 

My first year out of college was rough, i became unemployed after making a dumb decision that lasted me for almost a year and a half, but luckily by the grace of god, i somehow accidentally stumbled across an internet gaming community, and they have been a great support group since leaving college. I still saw some of my hometown childhood friends, but it doesn't feel the same to me anymore. Im doing part time certification and i've met people through that too."
4568,I don't talk to anyone from high school anymore and all my college friends live far away. But outside of school it seems really difficult to meet people and make friends.
4569,"I would say write the keywords into your resume. Also, what color is your parachute is a great read. Maybe you could apply to a small company that may be more desperate? My biggest strength with a general degree: create training manuals...most companies do not bother and teaching someone else (by offering a training manual) is a great opportunity. Most of all, you will see your strengths. When you apply to a job, you can send the training manual as a lust of skills you’ve done. Make friends with someone in the industry who cN vouch for you. Some, if not all, of this may help.


Just sending online resumes does not work. I typically apply to 2 companies every 10 days. Follow up with the company if they’re hiring.


I have a friend that submitted over 100 💯 online applications and never got a job"
4570,I have a carbon copy of your situation - down to the major. This comment isn’t really helpful other than to let you know that you’re not alone - I hope you find what you’re looking for.
4571,"Hey there! I’m in a similar situation and what was recommended to me was to apply for insurance jobs. Allstate, progressive, geico...They’re always hiring more or less entry level positions, you just need a college degree. And they pay around $50,000 right off, plus benefits. It’s not fun but it could help you get out of the house. 

Good luck!! Stay strong! Be kind to yourself!"
4572,"My best advice is to buy a dart board and print off a stock photo of a 'businessy looking' guy who can represent every recruiter not courteous enough to send even an automated response. 

It's not going to achieve much, but it'll get the emotions out. And if you do get into a position where you're recruiting people to a business eventually, keep hold of those feelings and hopefully you'll be able to be better than those tossers."
4573,"Actually, the one company that I did get an interview with and made it to the final round was with Geico. Specially their headquarters in Maryland. They were very nice and I think I did well during the interview (although I was quite anxious and looking back could've responded better at certain questions). In the end, the HR lady there was quick to my responses but sadly said they were deciding to hire internally."
4574,"Online submissions never worked for me either. I finally got a job because I knew someone who knew someone who worked in my industry. OP I want to remind you to watch out for scams! I’m in your field as well, and there are tons of companies that may look like they’re offering legit marketing jobs that turn out to basically be direct sales jobs. If a marketing/com job doesn’t require any experience, or if they respond to your application right away with a request for an interview, or if people on the company’s Glassdoor page say there’s high turnover, those are all red flags. I have a friend who accidentally got stuck with a job selling blenders in Costco when the job listing was completely framed as a “branding and event management” type job."
4575,Stay strong man — your lucky break will come soon. To echo u/notsofastbroski all it takes is one!
4576,It seems like today so many people are going to college and there are just not enough jobs...our education system is not right nowadays
4577,"Hey there, I also graduated with a degree in Communications in 2017. I really want to have a more in depth conversation with you about this so if you’re up for it feel free to PM me, I’d love to try and help you out/give you advice that helped me land my first professional job!"
4578,"So I also graduated from the communications department, and after working at PetSmart for a year after school to pay bills and trying to find a ""real"" job I got lucky - and landed a communications/social media gig at the local courthouse. I was honest in my interview - that I needed this first real job to prove myself, and honestly I was so stressed and nervous and I drove away crying in my car because I thought I blew it.
Two weeks later I had a job offer after I passed the background checks.
Having been here for a few months, I can tell you, particularly with your skills - government might be good for you. The judiciary specifically is just entering the online/social media realm, and so if you get in you're basically in on the ground level, setting the tone for what judicial social media and communications look like. Government is often slow to adapt and adopt things like email marketing and social media, so your new, fresh perspective could actually give you an edge in this arena if you leverage it correctly 

I wish you the best of luck! You're not alone, and remember, how you pay your bills does NOT define who you are!"
4579,"For writing roles, a cover letter helps a ton. I noticed I received many more responses from smaller agencies when I attached a cover letter."
4580,Apply to Liveramp!
4581," How do I go about that, I’m unsure of anything regarding dental."
4582,[deleted]
4583,"Thank you, I appreciate it"
4584,"Some dental schools will also pay you to be a subject. At my local university, to graduate, dental students need to clean the teeth of someone who hasn’t received regular dental work and many dental students are willing to pay their patients."
4585,"When I was in college and for a bit after, I didn’t have dental insurance. I ended up not going to the dentist for almost 8 years. I still brushed every day and (occasionally) flossed, but I thought that my teeth were fucked. 

When I finally went I had a cavity, but other than that, things were fine! They couldn’t even tell that it had been so long since I had been. Taking care of your teeth is all about maintenance, so you might be freaking out for nothing. Definitely try to get into a dentist soon, but don’t work yourself up about it! There’s a chance you could be fine.

edit: Obviously it would be great if all of us had dental insurance and could go as often as needed. But some of us can't. Some of us have to wait until can we purchase dental insurance. In the meantime, be sure to brush and floss and don't have a panic attack thinking your teeth are damaged beyond repair."
4586,I'd note if that doesn't work out you can also just go sign up for dental insurance on your own. It's not like health insurance where signing up outside of an employer costs a million times more.
4587,Thank you so much!!
4588,[deleted]
4589,Really?? That’s good to know actually... didn’t know that!
4590,"Yep, when I was unemployed a few years back I needed a ton of dental work and found okay insurance for an okay price."
4591,"As long as it is not an advanced procedure you should be fine going to a dentist school, but if you need wisdom teeth removed, please see a specialist (my neighbor learned that one the hard way).

Also: Floss."
4592,"Delta Dental and Liberty dental tend to be the cheapest, but even with insurance it is expensive. If you Health Insurance is through MediCaid then your state may cover Dental( We have Denti-Cal in CA)."
4593,Thank you so much for your kind and encouraging words. It truly makes me feel better!!
4594,"Second this! I pay for dental separately and my plan is $30 per month, which definitely isn’t bad compared to my health insurance breakdown."
4595,"I always brush twice a day but haven’t been to the dentist in 3 years because of moving and insurance chances. I’ve been getting nervous about what they’re going to say when I‘m finally able to go later this summer, and you’ve made me feel very relieved!"
4596,"I have all my teeth, thanks though. I’m sorry you just had to be rude to someone asking for help"
4597,You’re welcome. Good luck!
4598,"Once you get insurance, put your information into ZocDoc. You can schedule an appointment on there with a nearby dentist. It’s my go-to.

The best advice I can give about the anxiety part of it is: the best thing for you to do if you’re worried about your teeth is to go to a dentist. I’d rather get leg surgery than go to the dentist, but after I had issues with a tooth, I realized going was the best decision. He calmed my nerves and actually reassured me that what I thought was an issue and would lead me to lose my tooth was really nothing. It’s likely the dentist has seen worse cases than yours, so don’t worry :)"
4599,"Dentist here. You will probably need to get dental insurance. Ask friends and family where they go for their dental work. Or you can google around and see which office you’d like to go to. Once you have your insurance, call the office and let them know you have a certain insurance and ask if they are in network. Find an office that is in network and then schedule an appointment. Your first appt will be a full set of xrays, comprehensive exam, and possible a cleaning. From there they will give a treatment plan and discuss any questions you may have."
4600,"I’m only 17, so I don’t know much about dental insurance. However, make sure you’re keeping up with your dental hygiene in the meantime before you can get dental insurance. Brushing your teeth and flossing everyday goes a long way. If you can, try to invent in a quality electric toothbrush. They help a lot. Good luck!"
4601,That’s great! Thanks for the info
4602,"Well the enrollment period is comming soon so don't procrastinate and enroll as quick as u can on dental insurance and get it done asap. My dad had his teeth removed cuz dentist couldn't do shit about it, it was too late."
4603,Alot of dental schools do free and in my opinion good cleanings if money is a concern
4604,"I looked up cdphp and it looks like it’s medicaid. You’re still 21, so most likely your dental might be covered. Your insurance card should have a number you can call and ask about the coverage of your insurance."
4605,It’s actually quite important to get the tarter and calculus scraped off your teeth because it eats away at your enamel. Your toothbrush wont do shit to the calculus.
4606,How would her teeth fall out?
4607,Look at this guy who can afford to go to the dentist regularly.
4608,"Of course! 

Also, I just saw another person’s post about checking out local university/colleges/trade schools. It’s a wonderful recommendation! I know dental students at my university are always looking for people to help to get their required hours in. Little to no cost is typically associated with it."
4609,"I skipped the dentist for 5 years. If you have decent teeth and you brush/floss with no pain I wouldn’t stress about it until you’re on a dental plan. 

That said, a dental cleaning can be fairly cheap (i.e <$100) and dental schools will work on you even cheaper. Also look for dental hygienist schools if you aren’t near a university. Most dental offices offer care credit which is low or no interest financing should anything major arise. 

Unless you need major work done, I really wouldn’t sweat the dental part too much right now. Not saying you should never go but don’t let the thought of it weigh you down."
4610,I think you’d get some great help over at r/momforaminute or r/internetparents
4611,"It’s as an emt in a big level 1 trauma center. It’s professional. It’s an opening so that I’m working and making a good amount of money. 

Not the best but it’s where I’m happy while getting more experience and so I can get the next step"
4612,Congratulations!
4613,Congrats dude! I also graduated this May and it’s pretty hard to find the job I’m looking for. I’m not giving up yet
4614,What kind of job did you get that allowed flexible hours? Jealous ! Congrats
4615,Good to hear. I’ve been rejected from 4 jobs this week and I’m pretty down about it so this is encouraging. Good luck!
4616,"Not the OP, but I've worked jobs with flexible hours, and I personally think it comes down more to the office culture and environment than the role itself."
4617,Never give up
4618,What job
4619,"I personally like working the typical 9-5 schedule. I make my own hours as well because I’m salary/work in tech, and I choose to come in at about 9 every day.

What I meant is that I’ve never met anyone in the medical field who makes their own hours, due to the fact that hospitals need people 24/7, and clinics are open during business hours. It seems highly unusual, so I imagine that it’s a dream for people in the medical field."
4620,it really does sound like a dream. boy did i pick the wrong field lol. i’ll probably be stuck working 8-5’s (or later) the rest of my life
4621,"Can I ask how you make your own hours as an EMT? 

That doesn't sound like a position where they could let all staff be ""flexible"""
4622,"When I was hired, I chose my shift. So instead of them saying I’m M-F I’m 3x a week no weekends"
4623,"Congrats, good luck."
4624,Congrats man
4625,Congratulations man.
4626,congrats 💕 doesn't everything feel better once it's over? just got approved on my first apartment and all the stress was worth it for this sweet sweet feeling

4630,What is ur career?
4631,This is NEAT. Thanks!!
4632,"There are definitely maker spaces and tool rental libraries around various cities but that’s someone you would have to google for your own city 😞 

Other than that, if donations start coming in, I plan to make “starter kits” for everyone who does not have tools 😊 

Still, all you really need is a combination square, japanese double edge saw, marking knife, tape measure, and some wood glue to make virtually anything 😊 there’s a list in the community! Check it out 👌"
4633,Thank you 😊
4634,"This is outstanding. Do we just PM for details?

Edit: oops saw the link provided afterwards by other user. Thank you!"
4635,You’re very welcome 😊
4636,You just go to r/woodworkrobinhood and start on assignment 1 😊 read the “informational” posts as well when you get a chance as they will help you more!
4637,"I will be starting a new job in August in a new city (will be graduating in June) and I am constantly thinking about this. I am going to do my best to spend more time doing outdoorsy things but I am going to know literally zero people where I'm moving. Hopefully, bars and social establishments will be an option."
4638,"I know exactly you how feel. I just finished my first semester of college but I’ve been sticking with online classes since I just got a really good full time job and online works so much better for me with the schedule I have. But sometimes I do feel like I’m missing out on a lot of fun I could’ve had if I went to a university. In high school I had so much fun just doing random shit with friends, getting drunk/high, etc. But I’ve lost touch with most of my really good friends and now I’ve been stuck in the same pattern as you: work, eat, watch Netflix, sleep, repeat. 

I started thinking that maybe this was just me being a “grown up” now and I probably won’t have that fun anymore. Especially since my coworkers are much older than me and don’t relate to me for just about anything (all they wanna talk about is politics, how much they hate working this job, and stupid shit no one cares about). I’ve tried connecting with them and having conversations about stuff, but they just don’t have the same humor as me and aren’t interested in anything I am. 

After a few months working at this 9-5 office job, I’ve realized how much I don’t want to work here. I thought it would’ve been a great experience in administrative work, but this has not been fulfilling at all. And yes, a few months isn’t that long but it’s been long enough for me. I’m working on getting a different job where I know it’ll be a bigger variety of people, and I think this way there will be a better chance of me being able to connect and relate with at least a few people. 

So that’s what I would recommend. Your job is where you’re gonna be spending most of your time at, and finding people you can relate to and have fun with off the clock will be worth it. An office job where I’m only working directly with 6 people gives me a slim chance of making a good friend so I’m aiming for a place where I’ll be interacting with many more people. 

And honestly it doesn’t hurt to try to reconnect with your old friends and try to have a night out or a night in where you just drink, smoke, watch movies, and have stupid conversations with lol 

Sorry for the long comment! I just relate to this so much and wanted to share!"
4639,"This was me last year. I've made pretty much all of my friends through playing pickup ultimate frisbee as a park. Not saying you have to find an ultimate league, but if you're into outdoorsy things and sports, it's definitely worth searching Facebook or elsewhere for a group to join."
4640,"just wanted to say i relate to this so hard lol i graduated in 2017 and all my best friends moved away. we still keep in touch but nothing compares to that bond of being in the same city, the same environment (school), sometimes even the same apartment/house lol. 

and yes, i can and have made new friends, but friends aren’t interchangeable. i have a bond with specific people for specific reasons. and a lot of newer relationships made through work or social circles aren’t as intense/deep. i don’t have a solution lol i just want to say i feel you. i talk to my close friends every day or at least week. the remote relationships that this crisis has emphasized has actually made me reconnect with them even more actively. we do game nights on zoom or just facetime and cook dinner. it’s not the same but it helps. good luck out there!!"
4641,"I agree, exactly!!!! It might be harder, but it's worth it"
4642,"After school, life can become dull, monotonous and not exciting, but it doesn't have to be that way. We are still very young, there were fun times back in college, hanging out with friends, doing dumb stuff, but after a while that college life gets very old quickly, in my last semester i was ready to get out of the college bubble. You can still meet people, they don't have to be super close buddies, but you can form relationships out of the people you know and meet and who knows, you may become close friends."
4643,"Wait till you get older. All of a sudden, you’ll realize that all that boring shit is all you want to do. One day, you just become an “old person” and the real kicker is that you’ll totally be okay with it. Happened to me last year."
4644,"I feel you brother.
Life after I graduated school (2 years ago) is pretty boring and pointless.
THank God i have my best friend who is visiting me every day. 
I wish u the best of luck to find some great friends ^^"
4645,"I can relate to this. Don't get me wrong — having a job is great — but there are so many things I miss about school:

* It's generally much harder to make friends when you're out of school. Even though I spend long hours working with other people, there's often a stigma associated with making friends with co-workers.
* You could find so many things to do on campus. Back when I was in college, there was no shortage of events. One thing I really enjoyed as a teen was going to school dances. I rarely see many such ""fun"" events at the office. Sure, you can find public events on sites like Meetup, but they're not the same.
* I've never heard of a job (outside the education sector) that gives you a spring break or several weeks off during summer. Although some companies do offer ""unlimited"" PTO, that usually comes with strings attached.
* Students don't have to worry about ""job security"" as much. Due to at-will employment laws, companies can let you go for any reason. I was laid off out of the blue at a previous job even both my boss and his boss seemed to like me. At least in school, you can't get expelled unless you do badly academically or commit a serious rule violation."
4646,"It's a phase, you'll figure it out but ya it sucks in the beginning."
4647,"I feel very similar now that I’m at the end of my college career, but I didn’t even have the positive experiences you did. I’m on track to probably do very well financially, but it just doesn’t seem like I’ll feel satisfied even then. Thinking about joining the military."
4648,"See, while this might be EVENTUALLY true....""waiting for the moment when I feel okay"" won't solve the problems. You'll just become used to the problems enough where you are okay with living with them."
4649,Totally true
4650,"I don't mind people's choices -- my issue is people having issue with mine. That *every* hangout session, it seems, has to involve some kind of alcohol. I don't mind people doing it so much as it being this thing that's expected of me. I don't think I'm not an adult -- I teach homeless youth how to program, councel people on how to get jobs with LinkedIn, mentor, etc. I pay my bills and budget and all that good stuff. My discomfort also comes from typically smelling alcohol and weed while being abused by an ex boyfriend. I don't think there's anything wrong with me not being comfortable around alcohol."
4651,"To me it sounds like you dont have true friends. I dont mean that in a mean way either. I love drinking, it makes boring things fun and theres always a story to tell. But with my actual friends, we're not always drinking. That childhood silliness is still there. We still get together and play video games and board games sober and have a blast. Paintballing, amusement parks, to the gym. More times than not were sober. Obviously we drink together as well, but its not necessary. Outside of them, I'm probably not gonna hang out with anyone just for the heck of it.

If thats not the reason, than the true friends you have are alcoholics."
4652,"If you don't like drinking or doing drugs, there is nothing wrong with avoiding those activities. No one should be giving you a hard time because you're choosing not to do something that is unhealthy. Are you looking for friends who support your opinion but might drink on their own, or people who also absolutely refuse to drink whatsoever? The latter is probably quite a bit less common, but four of my [M23] ten best friends don't drink or do drugs at all. I was never part of the drug crowd in high school or college."
4653,"I’ve noticed that the people who don’t drink really do struggle with becoming a constant member of a social group that prioritizes partying and such. That being said there’s gotta be groups of people you could fall in with, just don’t force it with groups that like to let loose when they get together"
4654,"I'll give you the honest real-world truth and expect my downvotes from redditors who dont live in the real world and stay in their reddit bubble - and people telling me im boring. I'm absolutely not trying to be rude

ill preface this by saying... dont drink then? or just get a buzz. if you can find all these things enjoyable by being stone sober, then do them sober. peer pressure drinking is lame af.

I  tell you this as someone who doesn't like to drink but does occasionally, and absolutely hates smoking weed



>having that looming feeling of ""I'm going to get in trouble for being here"", but more like, ""This is an adult-thing. I'm not ready to do this. 

this is pretty unhealthy IMO and you are setting your social IQ and awareness back a few points. 

probably once a month there is a holiday that involves drinking. if you attend these social gatherings and dont drink, or at least dont pretend to drink, the fact is that you look suspect to everyone around you. the **exact** same situation happens with people who dont smoke when the blunt passes around - im one of them. 

>I really just want to have some innocent fun with people man.

youre 23. a couple drinks is innocent fun. 

>miss that ""innocence"" we had as children when we went to a friend's house. That we're laughing so hard until we're almost crying because of something silly someone said

if you or your friends aren't this funny already, then being drunk or high isnt going to make them funny. it sounds like you or your friends arent very funny people. 

youre also 23. farts and sleepovers just arent very funny anymore

> I was never allowed to go to friend's houses once I hit middle school, or to parties, or even go to the movies with friends.

you're 23. why are you still talking about middle school?



 >I'm just so uncomfortable when I want to invite people over to play video games or boardgames or something

been-there-done-this more times than i can count, with more people than i can count. board games are really really fucking boring without drinking. everyone is stiff, nobody *really* wants to play - its kinda like a ""lets-see-how-this-turns-out"" kinda thing, and you can tell they are afraid to make jokes or laugh at certain ones. if you remotely think they are enjoyable, it is all that more enjoyable when everyone has a buzz.  



>When I go places and everyone is intoxicated, it feels like we're subduing that feeling of living with a substance. but substance doesn't make me feel more alive

this is a really cringe excuse to not partake. just admit you dont want to drink. its not some philosophical conflict. 

Of all the off-the-wall shit i have heard people say when drunk, nobody has even said **""BRO I FEEL SO MUCH MORE ALIVE"".** Lol, the reality is that most people just have a couple drinks to loosen up. 

>When I'm not intoxicated and I'm dancing, or excited about a new video game, or running in the woods or feeling really in the moment, that makes me feel alive.

I think most normal healthy people think this. again, nobody is having an out of body experience when they drink. 

You can  enjoy a stroll through the woods and also enjoy a drink or two. those things arent mutually exclusive. 

> feel like this also comes from being treated like a child who can't take care of myself my entire life and being thrust into adulthood unceremoniously

you're 23. its time for you to get past  this whole childhood reminiscence 


# Most people at bars are there to:

1) get dressed up - literally one of the biggest reasons - probably the biggest reason for most women i know.

2) hang with a group of friends

3 ) and oh yeah, lets have a **couple drinks** and dance a little and listen to music. all of the exact same things you want to do, but they have a couple drinks. i dont see how that changes anything - other than makes my friends nicer and more goofy.

You're making drinking out to be a very very different thing than it actually is. You've built it up to be like tripping on shrooms or something. Most people your age are drinking pretty responsibly. Youre having a crisis about **other** people drinking. 

You also mention you dont like drugs in the title, but don't mention drugs in your post. What drugs do you do?

You seem really immature for 23. You say you want to build friendships, but I can **100%** absolutely promise you that your friends have all had in-depth 3am drunk convos about funny or serious personal experiences and they will never share them with you. I would suggest subjecting yourself to more social situations to learn more about how people work.

I'm not suggesting you drink if you dont like it, but from your post you seem like a  buzzkillington who really needs a drink."

4656,"It's interesting because I have a pretty large subset of friends that don't drink or do drugs, if anything I want *more* friends that parttake in the activities, I often feel like the one left out for wanting to be drunk or something when out (not like all the time when with friends obviously, just when we're clubbing/at nightlife/etc.)"
4657,"This is my bigger issue -- just finding people that are *okay* with me not drinking. I get really annoyed with people telling me, ""You just have to drink more to start liking it"" because it's ""normal"" for 20-somethings to like it. My goal isn't to like it more. Just let me not drink every weekend!"
4658,">if you or your friends aren't this funny already, then being drunk or high isnt going to make them funny. it sounds like you or your friends arent very funny people. 

>youre also 23. farts and sleepovers just arent very funny anymore

This is kinda the same thing I was saying as well. I don't think she has true friends. My real friends dont need to be drunk to hang. We laugh just as much sober as we do drunk. We dont get drunk to make life bearable, as she seems to hint at. We get drunk because getting drunk is fun.

As to the second part, a decent fart is still funny. Im 25 and it still gets a chuckle outta everyone. If not everyone, than at least the person who farted haha. I agree with just about everything else you said tho. She keeps comparing her life to her literal preteen days and wondering why its different. It should be different"
4659,"Ive commented to before, but just to add. If youre looking for non drinking friends, you gotta explore non drinking activities. Going out to parties and to bars and clubs are 100% drinking activities.

Sports are a good place to start. Great place to start really. Basketball has made me more friends than anything else on the planet"
4660,"I have no advice for you. In most things, I march to the beat of my own drum, so I don’t know how to tell you to do that. It’s not what you’re looking for, anyway. I only wanted to comment to say that I am the same way, and you’re not alone."
4661,"I’d recommend getting involved in (mildly) competitive sports. People usually don’t drink if their playing competitive soccer, tennis, etc. 

Also, do you not like being around people who are drunk or drinking at all? I’ll do game night or dinner with my friends, and everyone will have a beer or two, or maybe 3 over a few hours. No one is drunk, and everyone is perfectly capable of driving home."
4662,"I've tried several times, sincerely giving it the old college try. Being drunk is incredibly uncomfortable to me. It's sort of okay when it's just my boyfriend and I, but I really don't like it. Being buzzed is sort of okay, but I really prefer not drinking. I have a drink maybe 4 times a year."
4663,I’m like you - I’m not comfortable with either and I don’t plan on using either for the rest of my life. I think you either need to find people like you or people who don’t need substances to have fun.
4664,I don't drink or do weed or any other drugs. Seems like little more than a waste of money to me. I'm a cheapskate that would rather spend it on other stuff. Plus cirrhosis killed my dad. So there's that too.
4665,"That's the biggest part of it -- I'm cool if people want to drink, but I'm annoyed when that's all some people want to do when they go out as if there isn't another option."
4666,"Totally struggled finding other people. Don't have time to go into lengthy response but when I was in college I was definitely left out of a lot of hangouts from tight knit group in my department and was confined to study jams only. It can be very lonely, I made the best of it though. Youll find other people who are like you or enjoy non alcoholic hangs as some people would hang out with me specifically to take a break from alcohol which I thought was interesting. I'm in my late 20s now and still experience people enjoying hanging out with me for that specific reason."
4667,"I live in Utah and have been part of the mormon church and have since left because of their beliefs but there are many people who are great. The thing is you have to mention to them that you're not interested in joining their church and that you feel uncomfortable talking about religion. Some may never talk to you again and that's fine. However, many are totally okay with that and they make good friends."
4668,"Surround yourself with a community that doesn't revolve around intoxication.  There are subsets of most communities that do and do not drink and/or do drugs.  But some communities do have some mutual exclusions to substance.  For example, rock climbers.  

Ton of rock climbers smoke weed and drink, but in general, most do it separately from rock climbing, as it directly impacts safety.  I do a lot of acro yoga, which is similar.  I have found that it is really easy to make friends as an adult so long as you are passionate about a hobby.  So find a hobby, find your community, and find friends that don't feel compulsion to be intoxicated."
4669,"I guess you need to accept that you’ve grown older now. Have you tried drinking? Or getting drunk? I found it intimidating at first. I didn’t drink until college but did enjoy it once it tried it.

If you really hate that scene you can still find people who are sober. They aren’t as rare as you may think."
4670,"Ha! Mormons can be pretty chill. Depends on the congregation or where they're from, but they can be some nice folks for sure."
4671,"Honestly, just your solidarity means a lot. So I really appreciate that. :)"
4672,"I don't mind people that drunk or being around them -- I don't even mind getting a tiny buzz with friends. It bums me out when people's whole goal of going out or doing literally anything social is to get drunk, or that they can't have an outing without beer. I really like your idea about finding friends who play sports! It makes perfect sense c:"
4673,"Part of why I want to avoid alcohol is because I have clinically diagnosed depression and PTSD. My therapist also suspects bipolar disorder. For a few days or even a week or so after a drink, I'll be craving more alcohol. I just feel like mental illness and alcohol is a fast-track to long-term addiction. And to your point, it's also expensive lmao. I'd rather just buy a few more video games or art supplies than go out several times and buy $9 drinks.


I offer my condolences for your father. That has to be rough."
4674,"I'm the same. I dont think its right people make you feel (indirectly or directly) shit for making sensible and mature and informed choices regarding your own wants and needs. I'd recommend seeking friendships with those who arent always up for drinking, easier said than done. If not  speak to your mates regarding the issue and hopefully they'll honour your request and respect you by reducing the no. Of times they bring drinks etc."
4675,"I feel the same. Everyone around me is going to parties and living their ""perfect teenage life"". I am an extrovert so I would love to go out sometimes but not this way and I had many experiences with panic attacks too when it comes to people drinking or smoking next to me. 

I really don't like the answers that are like ""oh you are 23, so drinking a few drinks is not that bad, just accept it"". It is okay that you are not comfortable with such situations. You don't have to change yourself by trying to fit in the typical ""fun young adult or teen lifestyle"" (unless you truly want it for yourself)"
4676,"I can relate to you but I come from a different background where alcohol and especially weed has been prevalent in my life. Def a casual drinker in college and am even heavier smoker then. 

I stopped blazing 5 months ago because I realized I wasn’t becoming the person I wanted to be while high and it wasn’t great for my mental health. My other friends who were also heavy smokers stopped recently too. Since then we’ve all had to find ways to interact with each other without weed being involved.

When I was the only one not smoking I’d have fun just enjoying my friends company. My advice to you is don’t read into it too much that you’re the only not drinking. Enjoy people’s company when invited out or with them, maybe have 1 drink but don’t force yourself. Get something sweet like a cider if so. If not, don’t let ego get in the way by comparing yourself to “not looking cool” if you’re not drinking, doesn’t matter in the end. Part of life is collecting good memories so don’t take this too seriously, there’s better things to worry about."
4677,"Hey, farts are still funny to me! ;)"
4678,She could be the go to designated driver. Her friends would love her
4679,I was a punk-baby in high school 😂 Maybe I was meant for this!
4680,"This! I honestly couldn't care less about making tons of money. All I want is to stay home and read, or learn new languages, listen to music, practice playing the guitar. Graduated this Jun from a university of California, chemical engineering, but I just want to get a low stress job so I have energy left after working, and do my own things, be with myself. I don't see how it's worth it to spend my best years stressing for money. Plus I always have this idea of death could come anytime, I just want time of my life for myself as much as possible."
4681,"> working for the United Nations someday

This def sounds like a lot of work, right?"
4682,"i did this. i had like 7 internships in college (and also during gap years) that exposed me to different things (ie they were all in different fields), the longest ones lasting a year. i think i'm frankly burned out"
4683,"Have you tried a manual labor job? Those were by far my favorite, office work is so mentally draining."
4684,Same same same - just trying to find the right balance.
4685,Yes but it’s meaningful to me so it wouldn’t really feel like work.
4686,">a corporate slave is just not for me. Investment banking, finance, computer science, and heavy math jobs aren’t for me. I also do a degree in science as a combined degree with business and it’s all like meh.

Out of curiosity, what are you intending to work in after graduating?"
4687,Public policy and then after I settle down then teaching of some sort
4688,"7 internships?!?!

I was more or less where you are mentally, although i was more advanced professionally. My advice: start a low effort, steady return investment business. If you manage to do that, you are free to do whatever you want. You are not a rat anymore. 

Nowadays, i still do corporate (i like some parts of it) but i don't care much about the politics - and no all nighters / ""all weekends"". It may seem odd, but i believe that i never had so good deliverables. Probably because I have more confidence (and more experience, obviously)."
4689,"It's ok, not all of us can be famous, CEOs, or millionaires. We all want to reach our potential but I think society puts too much emphasis on don't be average and settle for less. You can be whatever you want if you put in the work. I put so much pressure on myself listening to this type of inspirational stuff but it makes me feel like a failure if I don't live up to it. It's ok to accept that you're just average."
4690,Nothing wrong with happening to share an opinion with another group of people
4691,"I feel the same way. I left a high stress high pay job that I got out of college. 

Took a pay cut to the job I have now. I have the greatest work life balance, the best management, best coworkers. 

Oddly enough this has led me to strive more for success and accolades. Something I swore off after the stress of the last job. 

Find your spot. Find your happiness. Don’t compromise. We are only here once!"
4692,"Have you considered civil service? I like that I am a part of the cogs of the social safety net for the most vulnerable in our community. It’s a big bureaucratic nightmare at times but you show up, put in your 8, and go home. Networking won’t do you much good. Slow steady pay progress and incredible stability sold it for me. I have a masters but could have started down this career after high school if I had known, though my ambitions/expectations were different then..."
4693,As long as the rents paid... you can do whatever you want.
4694,Have you read Excellent Sheep? I feel like both you and OP would really enjoy it.
4695,"Apologies for the delayed response. For reference I’m in New York, USA but every country has their version just might not be called “civil service”. 

For us it could be anything from janitors at  state run facilities (jails, hospitals, schools) to security guards to direct care professionals to to accountants to lawyers to teachers to “paper pushers” to auditors to commissioners (aka decision makers) of whole state agencies. I am a secretary. I started in juvenile justice (our office’s goal was reducing  recidivism and rehabilitation of court involved youth) and now I’m in the HR department at a psychiatric center. 

The broadest way I like to think of it is anyone employed by the state to run the day to day of the institutions and programs enacted by the government. In my state we are an absolutely massive pool of employees and the unions are fairly strong so the benefits and pay are solid. No one is likely to end up a millionaire but most are earning a comfortable wage with clear paths to advancement and retirement options. 

The work can feel repetitive (lots of mandates procedures and forms that seem nonsensical sometimes) but with that comes comfort, for me anyhow. It’s not a career path for a super ambitious person who wants an exciting job or wants to network their way to a corner office. For someone who just wants to show up, do what’s expected, and leave the work at the office so they can pursue their passions it’s perfect. 

I love that I’m a part of the systems put in place to help people. It’s just a career path that should be highlighted more in my opinion. But I’m biased of course. 

To get in you usually have to take a test and (unless you have specific training or education) take a lower level position than you deserve for a bit before you transfer into your right fit."
4696,"I've quit two office jobs in the past year because of how important I had to be in those offices. I'm attempting to go back to the service industry I worked in college because I actually enjoy being important there and it actually leads to more money, unlike my last two positions."
4697,"Gre up poor still on the lower end of middle class and family is using a government benefit to survive while we try to save up scraps. I, regardless of where I would get accepted, chose a public Uni after going to CC. If all this work and effort gets me a nice 8-6 job with enough benifits and pay to support my family and let my dad not have to worry ill be happy. If I can save and help my siblings go to a bigger and better university and take more chances I couldn't then that's even better. I just want to survive and have a bit of freedom when I'm into the bigger workforce routine. Let's hope when I'm done with school I get exactly what I'm looking for without too much trouble."
4698,I worked multiple jobs and internships during college. Why do you feel you were not “allowed to work a few jobs”? I just got out there and did it. It was really gave me insight into what I didn’t want to do.
4699,"I'm not necessarily talking about OP, I think their point is ""my job isnt going to be my life"". But yeah I see posts here from time to time ""I just want to make the bare minimum and go live life! Full time work is for the birds!"" and can't help but think to myself ""this is someone who has never really faced true financial insecurity in their lives""."
4700,"I've never had financial insecurity in my life dude, and do very well managing my own money. It's not that hard. Tbh learning how to stretch $25 into a week's worth of groceries isnt nearly as valuable in the long run as just having middle class parents who can teach you about saving and investing."
4701,No I haven’t but I’ll check it out
4702,"Yeah but the sort of sad and sort of good truth is that most of the people who haven't felt financial insecurities will never have to face them. I strongly believe kids should be thrown into a situation at a point when they are headed to high school where they need to face financial insecurities and learn how to manage money, especially since in high school they must start thinking about college."
4703,"Yeah some parents don't have the time for that because they are too rich and busy or too poor and busy, middle class parents get busy too but they prioritize life and happiness a lot more which is nice. Being taught taxes, saving, investing time and money pays off a lot."
4704,It's more like poor parents really dont have money of their own so they aren't exactly a fountain of information of how to handle actual wealth if their kid eventually gets like a decent salaried job.
4705,I kept job hopping until I found something that both paid well and is relatively stress-free (I spend half my day on Reddit tbh). It can be hard but there are careers out there where you don’t have to give up competitive pay in order to have a max 40 hour a week salaried position.
4706," Civil service?
This sounds like something I'd like to do. What exactly do you work in?"
4707,[deleted]
4708,I work in construction management and oddly enough my degree is in construction management
4709,7 sounds like a lot but I've heard that some schools require students to have a certain amount (4-6) of internships/co-ops in order to graduate. It definitely is a lot depending on the major and opportunities in the area

4711,"Joined a frat because I met some of the founders at a party my first night of college and became friends with them over the next couple weeks. Super down to earth, just wanted to have a good time type guys. It was some of the guys that joined my pledge class and most of the guys in the classes after mine that destroyed the experience, forced me to distance myself from it all and ruined the “lifelong friends” thing. Lots of douchey, big ego, wannabe frat stars came after the older guys. Even some of the original guys and my freshman year roommate who also joined ended up changing for the worst because of the new guys. Frat itself did end up getting bigger and more popular on campus because of the image the new guys portrayed and the effort they put into it but def not worth it for me. Long story short, joining one CAN be great if you like the guys you originally meet  and form good friendships with em quick as you can because it could all change before you know it."
4712,"How would you know? No basis for comparison. It’d be one thing if you had experience not being in one for a few years, then being in one, but that wasn’t the case."
4713,"I joined a fraternity hoping this would be the case, but it really hasn’t been. I may not be the best example, but I always felt like a strange within both my pledge class and fraternity. I doubt I’ll get invited to any of their weddings or invite them to mine. We still have an albeit inactive group chat and do fantasy football each year but other than that don’t have much of a relationship with them, even the ones I was closer with during school."
4714,"I can second this. I have friends who joined frats and after hearing the horror stories from him I said ""Fuck that."" Not to mention most frats are 1k a semester or year to join.

If you're just looking for a party lifestyle just rent an apartment or house with some friends and throw some small parties. More enjoyable, no drama, more welcoming and safer for females, etc."
4715,"My freshman year I was spending a lot of time in frats. I basically got the feel of the whole experience without joining. I was given a recruitment letter. I lol'd at the offer and never looked back. At that same time I had a buddy who did join. He was part of the chapter for 3 years. After the first year of maniacal partying and testosterone driven drama, he said he hated it. He stayed in the chapter because of the clout attached to the frat and the major alumni connections."
4716,"Despite what you may see on tv and in the media, not all frats are the same and many care just as much if not more about fostering bonds than they do about beer pong and juul pods.

I joined a frat in college, reluctantly, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I agree that it’s not for everyone but you may as well rush and see if it seems to fit you.

I was fortunate to find a group of like-minded individuals who were academically and socially ambitious. While I know friends that enjoyed college just fine without going Greek, I can honestly say if I could go back and do it again I wouldn’t want it any other way. Good luck 👍🏽"
4717,"I'm being pedantic, but you should either write ""1k"" or ""1000"", because 1000k is a million dollars."
4718,"Joining a fraternity was easily the BEST decision I made in college. I made lifelong friends, received job offers and totally benefited from all of the things that they claim. Not to mention all the fun parties, etc. It's not for everyone, but I certainly had a great experience."
4719,"Pretty much mirrored my experience, although I really like a couple guys from my pledge class. The rest of ‘em? Eeeeh... couldn’t care less about them"
4720,My bad. I edited it. Lack of sleep has got me fucked up
4721,"Joining a frat was probably one of the worst decisions I have ever made. I joined it in an attempt to learn more about why I struggled my entire life to develop meaningful male friendships, and the main things that came of it were I developed a drinking problem, over-performed masculinity, and became obsessed with sexual gratification in order to try to fit in. Your situation sounds very different from mine in that you're joining a service organization your final year as opposed to joining a social organization in your first, but I still wouldn't recommend greek organizations in general to anyone. There are plenty of other ways to develop friendships and to explore your own identity that don't cost nearly as much money."
4722,"I still talk to a lot of my fraternity brothers as an alum (we all play fantasy sports together). Some of the best fun I have is our annual alumni weekend when we all come back. Going Greek was one of the best decisions I made in college, I love the guys I was in it with."
4723,"I joined a fraternity without knowing anyone in it previously. My sister went to the same school, and was in a sorority, so some of the guys already knew about me from her mentioning me. I did meet a lot of guys there I still keep in touch, and a few of them I call very close friends. Been out of school for over 7 years now, and we have a group chat group that we use pretty much daily to talk about whatever random shit. There's 7 of us in the group, two I of which I would call very good friends.

While our frat did have some of the sterotypical frat stuff going on, it was still for the vast majority of my time just a chill place to hang out with some cool guys. I had some awesome connections there, even ones that only lasted until graduation, but it was well worth the time, and I would do the exact same way if I could. I don't really miss college at all, because I feel like I got the exact experience I wanted out of it, and those friends I made helped with that."
4724,"I hear ya. I won’t argue that the drugs and alcohol and such are prevalent, but just because some people in the frat do it, doesn’t mean you have to. The main benefit is the connections you make. Not necessarily with the people your age, but the alumni. Like anything else, it’s whatever you make of it."
4725,"I joined the business fraternity. It was co-ed, we had a house and participated in Greek events. We were not the ""coolest"" on campus but we were all mostly happy. It really helped with friends and a little with networking. I do not have lifelong friends from the experience, but that is my own damn fault. I moved to another state after graduation and just didn't stay in touch. I know several couples who met in the fraternity and they are still married today 20+ years later.  Think about what you want to get out of it and then visit with them. You could also join a club like concrete canoe or try one of the many sports ball."
4726,I joined one and though I don’t talk to all of the guys I joined with all the time. I still speak daily to a handful and semi frequently with another ten or so. It’s been a decade since I joined so I’d say yeah
4727," If you just want to party, there are way cheaper ways to do it than going to college. The people who aren't idiots don't want people who are just there to be stupid getting in the way."
4728,I joined a professional engineering fraternity and it was extremely worth it. All the parties and shenanigans of a social frat in addition to a huge alumni network that got me two internships while in school.
4729,The drugs and alcohol are cool but you're right about the immaturity. You can tell it was a lot of people who were finally away from their parents and trying to act big.
4730,"That's the impression I got from a lot of frats. Act big,,get hammered, and fuck bitches. What I noticed is frat guys in a group all act like that but individually they're different people. I think a lot of them feel they need to put on this front in order to fit in."
4731,"I didn't do a frat as it wasn't available where I got my associates. I transferred to Brockport this fall, and maaaay drop out, but still won't join any because I don't think I can.

Anyways, my brother joined one at Clarkson his freshmen year. I was worried he was gonna change his name to Chad, start slipping roofies into drinks, get a barbed wire tattoo, all that sleezy, I'm-too-rich-to-care, stereotypical frat stuff.

Turned out he had joined an academic, engineering frat. They still partied and drank, but they also had dedicated tutors, mandatory study hours, a minimum GPA requirement, and most of their events were engineering themed- so he had a job by his sophomore year and a connection to people across the country.

When our dad passed three years ago, Brockport gave my brother a bit of grief mostly because well, they didn't care. No one cares really, it's up to you, they don't check in on ya. He ended up doing poorly that semester and had to redo it. I was in high school and was forced out of IB math due to that week of absence- it royally pissed off my IB math teacher- which then heavily limited my options for college and I really screwed up, went to Moville, am now in business admin hating every second of it and struggling. Other teachers were very understanding. In college, it's never been brought or symphasized- it actually caused problems as I'd occasionally get in a bad mood when people are bragging about dads or asking about mine and I have to repeatedly mention it then get accused of being a 'drama queen', as well as administration accusing me multiple times every month of faking my dad's death to get financial aid. Again, no one cared, no support network, my roommates were shitheads about it and trashed the dorm to an obliterated level when I went home for the anniversary and were confused why I even left when I got back.  

Meanwhile, my brother Kevin's frat heard about it when it happened, a group of them split off to personally meet with each one of his professors to let them know and understand so his professors cut him a break, the Dean even found out and gave him condolences, all while other brothers were helping him deal with it and then followed him from the North Country to Rochester- roughly, a six hour car ride- to make sure he was doing okay. While they also had party nights,  they connected him to success, gave him a social environment to learn in, a house full of people with 'family dinners' that meant he wasn't just eating dining hall food everyday, and a support network that's helped him in tough times and adjusting to new life scenarios as well as moving to a new city in a new state. Every year after the death until he graduated, they helped him through the week and checked in on him. After graduation, he still tries whenever he can to visit or talk with his fraternity brothers.

Even at graduation, they helped him move as well as came out and meet his family, everyone had cooked a dish for a grad day potluck breakfast and dinner, overall, nice people. I'd recommend meeting the ones in your school and see how they are. Mileage can vary."
4732,"I checked them out as a freshman and while some of the guys were cool, a lot of them you could tell were trying to act cool coming from high school. I hung around with a few people but never joined after seeing the crazy ass dues."
4733,"Joined one in college, wish I didn’t. The parties were fun but didn’t get any lifelong friends out of the experience. In hindsight, should’ve joined a club sport instead."
4734,They do nothing except hang out at college parties and have no real ambition except to work where they’re at and sell drugs at said college parties. And no they didn’t get the college experience... they’re not taking college classes.
4735,"I made a couple of lifelong friends through it. Being realistic here, but your not going to be best friends with everyone in your clubs and organizations, but you will find the few that are cool. But yeah you will make a couple life long friends"
4736,"It depends on the person really. Yeah a lot of frats do crazy amounts of drugs and partying, but fraternities are as varied as people are. I’m sure a lot of folks could find one they’re comfortable in depending on the school. Some of the best memories of my life come from the time I spent with the guys I pledged with. Since graduation it’s remained one of my biggest networks of friends and connections.

There’s also no rule that says they have to be your only friends. Besides just the connections I made within my club, I also made a huge amount of connections through the other fraternities and sororities.

As far as the touchy things like hazing go, it’s up to the individual. I have a feeling you wouldn’t experience any of that in a service organization. A lot of people I know are happy to have gone through it though and not because they have to convince themselves they aren’t idiots for volunteering for it. It’s not for everyone but for some people it’s very much an intense bonding experience to go through something difficult together."
4737,"I joined a Co-Ed business frat first semester freshman year, and honestly I loved it, I came out with great friends and networking, and I still meet with them when possible, since some are within a couple of hours from me. I can't speak to social frats or sororities, but if it's a service frat, there tends to be a nice enough variety of people to not feel outcasted if you don't like a few of them!"
4738,"Agreed. I had lots of friends in Greek life and none of them enjoyed it by the time they were sophomores, and by our last two years I don’t think any of them participated at all. Though Greek life wasn’t a big thing at my school. I think it very much depends on the school but at mine it seemed as though it wasn’t the best unless you were really into that sort of thing."
4739,"> I think a lot of them feel they need to put on this front in order to fit in.

That definitely felt like the case, and I felt alienated by their fronts while simultaneously trying to align with the same archetype out of perceived necessity. It was a really toxic, bizarre environment."
4740,I’d say so. I lost contact with a friend in middle school and turns out we’re attending the same university. The conversations between us were short and nothing like back then.
4741,I have legit forgotten names 2 years out of High School.
4742,"I would acknowledge the awkward. 
Hello! How the heck are you?! Haven’t seen you since HS how you been?! Wish we talked/hung out more back in high school. I always thought you were so interesting... talented... cool... but love to know you now, I’ve been missing school chums. Want to get a coffee tomorrow??"
4743,It’s only human. Just worry less and do you (:
4744,I just give them a smile and then move on.
4745,Why the bullshit?
4746,"I’ve done this before. We both didn’t wanna go through with the awkward greetings and pretending to care stuff so we settled for a smile and a nod. Short, simple and we carried on with our day."
4747,Sometimes people genuinely just lose track of one another. Asking to grab coffee or acknowledging the good times isn’t bullshitting
4748,It depends on the context. If you genuinely barely knew them before it can sound like bullshit to ask them out to coffee. If you had a friendly connection and things faded as your lives went in different paths I don't think it'd be too fake to try to catch up.
4749,Same
4750,"Same. Not anxious, but it’s a boring and pointless event. I have things to do, but seeing someone involves saying hi, asking how’s life, having to ask what they’ve been up to, giving a 5 second summary of X years, then someone has to make an excuse to cut it short.

But it’s also kinda nice sometimes to see someone you knew and had good times with.

Unless it’s an ex gf and you broke her heart so she still hates you and always will lol"
4751,"It is perfectly fine to have a break after school. I did that too for a year. Don't force yourself so you will still enjoy the things you do or love. If you want to get back at it, you can do it slowly—baby steps, at your own time, at your own pace."
4752,"Perhaps I just need to slowly reintroduce myself to coding and graphing projects again. I still have coding dreams so I know its still in my head. I still have all the programs loaded. 

I dont have a job in my field of study right now. I just work basic sales positions but im comfortable when I live simple"
4753,"Interesting. Sad that it kills the things we enjoy. My condolences to your love of TKAM.

I do remember it being a good book when we read it in school though."
4754,"This is a common and less told story that goes with the ‘do what you love, and you’ll never work a day’. Just take some time to do something else, and if you get the urge to use the computer, that’s great. If you find something else you love doing, that’s great too."
4755,"Its very reassuring to hear that im not falling behind slowly now. Thats kinda what I'm afraid of. But I should go at my own pace, its not a race."
4756,"Its an amazing book, but its hard to pick up again, I'm thinking that after the hours of discussion about the largely irrelevant details and the coasting over the bigger details, it killed the zing, because I was told that my perception of the book that I had developed previously was, what I consider to be, the non-textbook belief."
4757,I feel this. I hate sitting in front if a computer all day
4758,"Any straightforward book can be ran into the ground by the school system, or sometimes the teachers. I had a teacher insist we make connections between Lord of the Flies and Watership Down.

The different perceptions (at least in school) tended to focus heavily on Boo Radley moreso than they ever really did the trial and the clear racial divide within the book. Whenever we got to those parts it was often spoken about with the air of ""Yeah, they're racist, its rural Mississippi""."
4759,"I'm experiencing the same thing for the literary books, especially English literature.

I'm a computer guy and currently an undergrad student of English literature. Was going to meddle around for a year on literature and take the exam again for a cs degree (free university yay!) but things didn't go well for past few years and I'm stuck at literature. Now I'm at the 4th year still taking first and second year classes and failing. I used to be into reading but always hated studying literature. Having to study something easy but i don't like and repeteadly failing made me kinda dislike English literature. Now whenever I see a book that we have studied, I want to run without looking back. I even read a few known books of English literature before the university but now I don't even want to see them again."
4760,"I can't remember all the details, but from what I remember, it was a pretty straightforward book. Maybe that's because I didn't appreciate it enough. What different perceptions are there?"
4761,"That's no less cool. My job is automated financial/accounting tasks, so your projects are direct work experience."
4762,"If you can afford a separate one (doesn’t have to be spectacular) for browsing the web and casual use, that could help. Keep the other for work etc"
4763,"the same will probably happen to me, it's great to have a hobbie that's not related to your job"
4764,School assigned reading in middle and hs absolutely killed my love of reading too. I loved reading books as a kid and now I can’t even get myself to do the assigned class readings let alone open a book for fun.
4765,"Absolutely, man. If it's something you wish you could be more motivated to do, then slowly get back into it. Find a project that blows your mind, and try and re-create it. For me, I'm hoping building a ray tracer will re-ignite my ambition."
4766,"Yeah all my hobbies were on my computer, including some games I liked. Im 100% console rn."
4767,"That would be a super cool project. Most of my computer projects involved manipulating financial data (or other data) into graphs, tables, etc, using databases found for free online about random stuff."
4768,"My Chemistry degree ruined chem for me 90%. The department was run by sadists. They ran the undergrad like a grad school or worse. Everyone I knew that went on to grad school or med school talked about how easy it was compared to our undergrad. 

They used to teach graduate-level thermodynamics in the senior PChem class before that teacher got fired (luckily) right before I had to take it.

My biochem teacher would put a page on the test from a Harvard biochem exam so we could laugh at how stupidly easy it was compared to the insane application questions he would put on the test. He did a monkey dance. 

It was a fun four years because I had tons of friends and we all stayed up late all the time working. But yeah hard to want to continue in that direction now. It's just not interesting to me anymore after all that."
4769,I am the same way. I had so much ambition and creativity with side projects. Got a software dev job right after I graduated and can’t pick up a computer anymore. It sucks. All drive I had before graduated went out the window. I’ve honestly lost hope and I’m going to take a hiatus come august once my lease is up.
4770,I thought I was fine with it all through school. But then after school i havent been forced to do computer stuff so I just haven't even a little bit.
4771,I checked out the video and it helps actually. Sometimes you should just act and not worry or try to plan out the next step cuz then you get in your own head
4772,[deleted]
4773,"Yes. Sometimes situations push you because you have no choice and you end up doing it right just because you sort of figured it out mid way. I’m not just saying this. In 2009 The economy had crashed and I was about to lose my job within a week or so. My parents lost their house in a foreclosure so, I had no more time to think. All I had time for was to get a real estate person, get the money together somehow by borrowing or digging into my savings, and buy two houses. 

I sold one of those houses for a profit of about 150k. I am still holding the other one that has profits of 600k 😳 all because I acted rather than thought about it. 

Similarly, when I found warren Buffett and how he does things and he mentioned one single line which was “most of the time, everybody should just buy the S&P 500“ without thinking any further I acted quickly. This was 2015. That account has appreciated almost 400k. 

Action trumps planning."
4774,[deleted]
4775,I love computers but something that blended finance and IT would be my dream
4776,"Survivable pay. I have 2 jobs but this one pays my bills and my other one pays for entertainment. Worse pay than anything I'd get with my degree but id be an embarrassment to my old finance teacher if I couldn't make a simple budget. 

Ive saved a lot of money by buying exclusively used games. Im gonna run my old Xbox 360 into the dirt"
4777,[deleted]
4778,"Strange, but I think I may be able to help. I went through college and did a computer science degree. In my third year I realized that this was going to be a lot of sitting around and coding. I just thought that the workload would be very high and it would turn into a grunt job. So, I immediately started an MBA. I didn’t have to do an MBA but back then that’s all I knew. I got out and got myself a job that is in the tech field but it deals with business. It is completely possible for you to be tech savvy and do something in the business field. 

Now let’s talk about the 6+ months. First of all, you are in the luck... you can just say that coronavirus caused things to slow down and you were taking care of family. I took 6+ months off too and it was a really bad decision from a job perspective. But, I did go ahead and get married in those six months, so, it wasn’t all a waste. When I did get my ass in gear, I realized that I should not have waited all that time.  What you need to do is get super active about searching for a job. Look for any business job that relates to your skills. You will have to use computers of course. But you don’t have to do something very technical. Start hounding people on linked in. Start emailing recruiters. Your first job can be in any field that is even remotely related to anything you studied. Note that once you have done one or two or three similar jobs you are more or less type casted in the market. That means that any new employer will look at your previous experience and assume that you are firmly in the domain.

Your aversion to computers is illogical. So what you need to do is perhaps try exposure therapy. do something fun on your computer. Go watch YouTube videos on the computer. Then go play with some data visualization‘s that are interesting that people have created out there. YouTube has many data visualizations like that. Start to get comfortable with other peoples content on YouTube that visualizes data. Then, maybe try to do something like that to post on social media.  

Basically, slowly, expose yourself to whatever you are afraid of. That’s strange pang you get in your chest area /anxiety will soon dissipate because your body will learn that “you are OK”.

Lastly, I want to listen very closely because this is really important. Your mind creates resistance towards things you don’t like. In fact, it is a signal for you to change. Now you have two choices: get used to it or get away from it. In this case, you might be able to do both at the same time. So, to get used to it, realize a simple truth of how the mind works, “everything your mind says is not factual or anything based on reality”; so, think of negative thoughts as your mind testing out different pathways for you to take. Your mind is doing that work to figure out what your next step should be. This computational power of the mind has nothing to do with you right now. So, you should not feel anything while your mind is trying to go through different permutations. Think of your thoughts as a river and think of yourself as someone sitting next to the river watching the water flow. As you get negative emotions, just let them pass as they should do naturally in the river. Those thoughts are not “you“. They are a very complex set of activity that is happening in your mind to try to figure out what your next step should be. Sleeping well and doing cardio will help your mind get through things faster. 

A while back, I made a [video](https://youtu.be/PxhtcK7dfgo) on this. If interested.  

Good luck"
4779,"Thanks you for your insight. I’m reading this post as someone who is in a similar boat. I graduated June 2020 and haven’t searched for jobs out of feeling unworthy, incapable, unintelligent, and not ready. Best of luck to you @subjectZr0. You’re not alone in this"
4780,"Take breaks constantly. Most companies only bill you for 6 hours a day anyways. If you don’t take breaks, you’ll end up like me and burnt out. I started burning out 1 year in and I’m almost 3 years in now. It’s not the life you want to live."
4781,"I was feeling worried about getting to the feelings you are having, so I signed up for a master's degree rather than graduate. If you don't feel like you chose the right degree that is fine, but don't let it stop you from trying to get jobs. Take some online course work, go volunteer at a shelter. You don't have to have a career in helping people to help people. Even better, make a business that helps people, then you have both bases covered."
4782,"There are many things you can do, which you’ve stated for yourself. However, make sure you don’t get buried in debt so find a job, or find a way to freeze your debt, or look for debt forgiveness. 

Find a job: get a job that your degree (or other certification) can get you in. Work to reduce loans and have enough money to venture into your other goals. 

Freeze your debt: apply for graduate school, or volunteer somewhere (like Red Cross). 

Forgiveness: again, volunteer for something that may give you a different path, or where you are interested (please research!) 

Also, set goals and break them into smaller checkpoints so you can keep working towards them without burning out! You got this!"
4783,"I saw one of my classmates got an amazing internship for the fall, and on one hand I’m jealous because the opportunity is amazing but on the other hand it’s unpaid, so something like that unfortunately isn’t feasible for me. Right now I’m literally only getting by because I’ve been dogsitting (house sitting, dropping in to check on pets, walk them, etc) and it pays surprisingly well but I don’t know how viable it is longer term. I know I shouldn’t, but I do feel in a weird way I’m disappointing my family. They love to preach a degree being the key to “success” but it’s nothing even close. 

I’m sorry to hear about your situation. ☹️ This setup for grads is messed up in so many ways. And while I don’t think things should just be handed to us, it shouldn’t be this freaking impossible to just barely get by."
4784,Step 1: get a job that pays the bills and allows you to be financially stable. At this point you need to support yourself before you start thinking of other career paths.
4785,"I agree with the paying the loans back asap. I also just graduated in May but I'm from Europe and the cost of third level education in my country is far less and I was also lucky enough (or unlucky, depends how you look at it) that I qualified for a grant to pay for my education due to my family's poor-ish financial situation. But I also have that get ""what's next?"" feeling.

You should go back to do the degree you feel is best, if it is time youre worried about then you shouldn't. The time will still pass regardless of whether you choose to do it or not. 

You have time to do those millions of things you want to do, and a few people I know had a business whilst in University so there are no boundaries, only the ones you set up against yourself. Best of luck fellow graduate"
4786,I feel this nobody is hiring right now but honestly I have no place to live because of my psychotic mother so if u have love and support and can figure it out you’re lucky ❤️
4787,I’m in the same exact spot. Decide to do a long thru-hike to sort my mind and goals. Doing the pacific crest trail in March! Wish me luck. And I wish it for you too. Not having direction/purpose in life was a major cause for my depression and it sucks.
4788,"I saw a lot of comments telling you to get a job that matches your degree and get financial stable, etc etc. As nice as that may sound, if you're trying that and its not working then that advice is trash and unhelpful because duh.

So my counter advice is: if you're not excited by the prospect of a job matching your degree, then apply for jobs that don't. Write down what you did in college, think about what those things provided you in experience/skills, then go start looking at jobs in an area you'd like to see yourself living in (within reason of salary v. cost of living). Look at those posts, then go back to your resume and tailor it while being honest to resonate with those posts and apply.

After graduation, everyone shoehorned themselves, and by these comments I'm learning sometimes shoehorn others, into getting jobs that HAVE to match their degree. But you absolutely do not have to. There are no exact mapped out ways to what to do after graduation so take that as freedom to break away from expectations and do something for you or something you may not normally do. 

I'm saying this as someone who didn't have a lot of options growing up due to socioeconomic issues. The expectations to go to school, graduate, get a good job in my field, start saving, start adulting, it's all well intentioned but doesn't make it the best path. Since you've been stuck for a few months, you may be in a routine that is allowing to shift into your new identity post grad. Which means you gotta just do something different, because what you have been doing isn't  working."
4789,"I've had this feeling since leaving high school last year. Right now I'm halfway through a cybersecurity course but I'm barely passing and not enjoying it at all. 

My course ends at the start of next year so I'm primarily thinking about what to do next year. In the meantime when I'm not at school I'm writing (and plan to have a first draft of an original novel done by the end of the year.)

I'd suggest this; since you want a career that helps people, list the career paths you're interested and start researching them. Find out what the job entails, what qualifications and knowledge you need, and start studying relevant topics. Hopefully by doing this you can rule out anything you don't think you're suited for."
4790,It's tough man but it's part of the transition.
4791,"After graduating with a BA in politics and history in May 2014 I took a few months to travel. I had some good savings accumulated, so I took a road trip across the east coast of the US, went on a birthright trip to Israel, took a train trip across Europe, and landed home in San Francisco in July. I got a job in about a month through family connections although it could certainly have taken longer. My advice would definitely be to travel if you can because after getting a job it will be much harder to get time off, but base your plans on a realistic view of your financial situation. If you have only $1,000.00 in the bank, do NOT travel to Thailand for 3 months, but consider a low-cost road trip and budget appropriately. If you have more than $5,000.00, consider a foreign trip as those are much harder to plan and can offer a greater depth of experience."
4792,Is everybody here getting help from their parents or something? I work full time all summer and part time during semesters and I can barely afford to travel to the next city over lmao.
4793,"Graduated about a month ago; taking a year out to travel before starting my career. Everyone I know has said it’s the right thing to do.

I got lucky; had 3 job offers before I was even a senior. Wrote to all of them explaining I wanted to travel after graduation - 2 of them in principle agreed to postponing my start date but only 1 of them came through in the end. So I accepted that one and withdrew from the others. 

This is the best/most secure way to do it. But naturally not everyone is in that position. 

However yes; I thoroughly recommend doing it. So many people I know get to their mid-late 20s and suddenly get the travel bug and end up taking sabbaticals or early career breaks to pursue it and it significantly impacts their career progress."
4794,Fuck sake. Sometimes I think I'm priveleged and then I read things like this.
4795,I was certainly lucky. My dad set me up with a 529 account that covered my college expenses but at the same time I also went to community college for 3 years (which saved me a lot) and worked and saved throughout my college experience. By the time I graduated I could afford to travel a bit.
4796,Weird question I have the same major. What career/job did you go into
4797,Right now I’m in an MBA program for finance and working as a back office clerk for a bank.
4798,"no way i would have any money to travel, i can barely pay my rent. no clue how these people can actually consider traveling with no job lined up."
4799,Yes. You’re on reddit
4800,"Not everyone here is from the USA. My total cost for full degree was €10k, which is actually quite expensive compared to the rest of Europe. I've worked during the summers and part time and now I'm heading off the South America for 6 weeks in August. Its not that our parents are helping us (in my case anyway) but more so that the system is not designed to fuck us."
4801,"I would flirt with the job market before traveling to see if you're getting any interview opportunities. Finding a first job after college is very difficult and takes some graduates up to over a year. It's also important to note that in December, there is going to be a swarm of other graduates, just like you, competing for jobs. Remember, you can still travel after you start working. If traveling is important, ask companies about how many PTO hours you will accrue each year.

&#x200B;

Do you have enough money saved up to where you can pay for travels + spend several months job hunting? If push came to shove, can you depend on your parents?

&#x200B;

22 is still very young and you will be working for the rest of the majority of your life. If you/your family are financially comfortable and you are confident you will find a job within your desired time frame, then do what your heart desires."
4802,I did the Peace Corps. Loved it. One of the best choices of my life. Two years and hard work though.
4803,"After I finished my first degree I went backpacking with my roommates at the time throughout Southeast Asia for a month. Upon returning back home I went back to my part-time job, as I looked into doing some further schooling."
4804,"(M) At 21 after getting my associate’s degree at a local community college, I volunteered in Mexico with IVHQ at an animal shelter. Did it for 7 weeks and even got Zika lol but it was fun and a really good experience. Met amazing people. 
A year or so after I went to Taiwan and Japan, also highly recommend. Honestly travel as much as you can while you still can"
4805,Yeah like wtf I’d like to not be homeless ty vm gotta work till my bones crack
4806,Do it. There’s more to life than rushing into a job in your early 20s. Just go and have the time of your life.
4807,that's a great story but extremely unrealistic. you were definitely privileged
4808,I traveled a few years after I started CC. Then traveled again halfway through uni. Then again after. Saved all my money for years to do so each time. Also paid my school the whole time by myself. Lived with my mom till I was 25.
4809,Worked for a year in China teaching. Saved money and travelled for a year with said money. Do it.
4810,"Travel for as long as you can. You have the rest of your life to work. If you have the time and resources now, don’t even hesitate."
4811,"I started my first job right after graduation 2 years ago. I kinda regret start working without any vacation, road trip now. At the moment, whenever i want to go somewhere, I must check my leaves and plan for it in a long time. So my advice is if you consider a long road trip to foreign countries, you can take a few months off for that. Or If it just time for chilling out after graduating or plan to go somewhere in the country, you might use vacation leaves like me. It depends on your financial status and your desire to start your career."
4812,Worked for a year and a half after graduating to save money and now I’m working/traveling in Australia for about a year. Maybe two if I can afford it.
4813,"There’s nothing wrong with taking time to travel! As long as you don’t get lost in yourself and push off a job for too long, then you’re absolutely fine. I think everyone takes time off between graduating and working, wether it be a weekend away or a month. You achieved something big and deserve a small break!"
4814,"Took a few months off to go on a cross-country road trip. I am grateful for the road trip and everything I saw, but I regret not preparing for my future better. I graduated with a BS in physics and didn’t plan for grad school or a job or anything. Two years later, I’m struggling to find anything in my field and my skills have lapsed."
4815,"I just graduated and I would have loved to travel if I had the money! I think you should go for it if you can. If you just travel for a month or two, you can just start looking for jobs when you get back. If you find a job before, there's no guarantee they'll be willing to wait for you to start when you get back, or will be willing to give you time off to travel."
4816,get a job first dude. i've been unemployed for 7 months and i have no money left
4817,Nothing wrong with taking a few weeks to adjust before jumping in. But travel? How do you afford travel without a steady job with decent pay? Bills start to collect and pile up.

4820,Can't relate lol
4821,"Covid feels like it happened at worse time until you think about it happening at another time.  I thought about it happening at various other times in my life where it would have been *much more* inconvenient, and then im happy it happened now. I didn't lose my senior year of high school, I didn't get trapped in another country, I didn't get trapped in a bad living situation by a pandemic. I've already got a college degree, and the pandemic just slowed down, or rather changed the course of me building my post school life."
4822,I feel this. I also graduated and am now unemployed
4823,I was in that boat but my partner left me right before covid so now I have neither!
4824,"Yup we are gonna be old and ugly when this shit over lmao, prime is all wasted with sitting at home and dealing with grief and dead family and friends"
4825,"So funny cuz I did the opposite. During my college years I prioritized relationship over friend group, now I have a partner I live with throughout quarantine but no friends, sometimes I wonder if the grass is greener on the other side but my old friends were toxic anyway so."
4826,"Getting robbed of the end of my final spring semester sucked a lot of ass and now I feel like my life is just stuck in purgatory. If it weren’t for covid I’d be moved out and having a social life. 

I’ve been trying to make the best of it by getting in shape and enjoying all the free time, but as big as my steam backlog is I kind of miss the things that pulled me away from my desk a year ago."
4827,"Covid boredom made me realize I needed to go back to school. So I enrolled in an online masters program. Sometimes boredom can help us realize where we feel inadequate, how we wish we could evolve, and what we want to do moving forward. You’re thinking about it now, maybe soon you’ll have a revelation? Good luck!"
4828,"Before COVID, I was working a Job that I enjoyed most days, but never thought that I would stay there long term. I had little direction in what I wanted out of life, was living in the same place I went to college, with people who I would share one conversation once a week if I was lucky. 

Once COVID Hit, I spent 10 weeks virtually alone in my room because our work shut down and my roommates didn’t want to see anyone outside of the home. During that time I realized how unhappy I was with the path that I chose for myself and desperately have wanted to change but never admitted it. And to top things off about a week before quarantine I “broke up” with the first person I was in a kinda relationship with for 10 months. I later learned this same person who was only seeing me and wanted to be single for a year to find himself was actually seeing 3 other people at the time. 

Because of the insurmountable loneliness those weeks brought me, I decided to change. I applied for AmeriCorps jobs that more aligned with what I wanted for a career. I asked my best friend to move into an apartment together, and I decided to move to a new state because I could no longer take being utterly alone in a job that I now hated because of COVID (it became a telecommunication job). Without a promise of a job I moved with some savings late august, and literally the day after I moved was offered the job I was most excited about. I cried for an hour straight. 

Three weeks later, I matched with someone on tinder and after messaging and calling, we met in person outside. Long story short, after being single my entire life, I finally found my person. 

I know COVID is awful, no one has to remind people that unless they deny it. But without all of this, I don’t know if any of this would have happened. And there are still struggles but strangely my life is better than it was pre-COVID. It’s important to see the silver lining out of an otherwise shitty situation."
4829,"Hey hey hey, you’re me!"
4830,"Edit: I forgot to meantion the last two years of college were a downward spiral of drug binges and giving up all the sports and hobbies and general discipline I hold dear. COVID has essentially been a forced trip to a monistary in my parents spare bedroom. Stripping it all away, back to basics.


Same. I got hired a week before COVID, which allowed me to work from home. So I moved in with my parents and saved up and buy a house near my parents. Renovating it now with all my freetime. Every year covid drags on I get closer to ""retiring"" from my day job to work for myself. Before this I was always traveling cheaply when I could and partying with friends in college. I don't like having to give up that lifestyle but if you roll with the punches you can find fulfillment, even if its not at immidetly rewarding"
4831,[deleted]
4832,"I'm extremely anxious about this same thing. My life plan, if you will, for 2020 was to travel. I was already in New Zealand when COVID hit, and my time there was shortened by a few months. Now I'm back in my hometown, living with my parents. Yes, I'm saving money but... at what cost? 

I keep thinking that our 20s are the time in our life when we're supposed to take risks, travel, move, find new friends, find lovers, etc... and for the past 8ish months that has been robbed of us. Sure, you can still move and travel (domestically, hopefully), and make new friends, but to me it all feels so different because COVID is always in the back of my mind. I was considering moving across the country but I'm worried that I won't find friends or a job as easily, and it could end up being a huge waste of money.

It's a horrible way to think, but I definitely feel you! I really try not to overthink it and think about the positives instead. For me, those are that when this is over I'm going to have saved a lot of money and can travel wherever I want for an extended time. And that I'm spending a lot of time with family and friends that I won't see often once I move."
4833,"I was in a bad spot mentally on my senior high, was abroad studying in uni living alone there, i was almost in every bad situation you described there and i would never even think about dealing with covid back then. Too high of a risk for me. This is as fine of a timing as it can be for myself."
4834,"You want to talk about years lost? Class of 2020 got fucked the hardest by far in terms of missing out. We lost our prom, basically our closure of highschool, all our extracurricular activities like theater, sports etc. and on top of that, our freshmen year of college. It fucking SUCKS bro."
4835,No no. Don't do drugs alone. It turns into 0art of your lifestyle
4836,Things are never going back so either do this and live with it or fight to change it back. But it’s not going back unless the plan changes

4838,"Also replying to OP


Yes. You all aren’t alone. 

But let me be the first one to warn you - you need to do something urgently and take on lots of uncomfortably to make it. Don’t believe anyone who says to take it easy rn. Let me explain. 

I graduated with 3 degrees in 2006 (math, CS, MBA). I had no idea I was stepping into the fuking mortgage crisis. But yea - I sat around after graduation thinking “people will want me to work for them because I have 3 degrees” - NOPE! no one cares. No one gives a fuck about you or your well being. Others are simply too busy to take a moment to help out a graduate. So, realizing this, in 2007, I kept trying and finally found a consulting company that was willing to take me - but, it was a deal with the devil. 


They said that they would help me get a job but, they could only pay me X...which, I later found out to be 30% of my actual paycheck. That’s right, they took 70% of my pay and basically told me that “this is the way” take it or leave it. They never told us how much they were actually taking, I had to find out much later. They also took $1500 from me for educating me but said would return that to me after 15 months (which was the minimum length of the deal)

This was my moment - I could either be scared and stressed that I was being used or I could dive in and see where this went. Well, I signed up - as did like 40-50 other people. Within weeks, 70-80% of the people dropped. They would say that all of this was a scam and sued the company for their $1500 initiation fee. 

But, I kept going because...well, I had nothing else. And even though it was uncomfortable and difficult and demoralizing to be there where people were just falling off left and right, it would have been worse to go back to just browsing monster.com for any job. So, I had no bridges left. This was it.

Only about 8 people survived the initial phase where they teach you a lot of things. Then we would apply to jobs for 8 hours a day. Month and a half later, almost everyone has gotten a job in the small group except for me. I saw them all get hired one by one as I struggled.

Finally one day, my buddy failed one of his interviews and I failed mine...and we decided to give each other the questions and apply to each other’s companies. He got the job! And...after another week, I got the job!! It fukin payed off. 

But you’d think “finally! Life is gonna be easy now”. Nope! Financial crisis hits, parents started losing their home, family under mounds of debt, creditors keep calling, dad is paying bills with home equity line of credit. But, I knew that temporarily, i needed to get uncomfortable again. And I did. We stopped paying the mortgage. Saved some money. Got evicted. Got together with someone to buy a home (after crash). I bought that house. And, in fact, I had gotten married in the past few years after graduating, so I decided to buy another house, just for us, but had to borrow money from someone / had to let go of my pride to do it. 

Annddddd you’d think - “new houses, job secured...financial crisis gone...so, we good right?”

 NOPE! In 2014, I lost my job and my dog (liquidated my 401k to give him the right medical treatment before he died, so that he could live for an additional 8 months) ...and my dumb ass lost -$360,000+ in stocks - yes there is a plus after the negative 360k because I don’t even wanna know how high the unrealized gains went 🤦🏽‍♂️- yes all that I had worked to invest, gone - just like that. 

Yea. Fml 🤦🏽‍♂️ 


This time, it broke me for a few months. I was numb.

But then, I thought “ok, time to act again, what’s the next move?” Well, I realized that I had been getting the wrong advice in stocks - so I made a 180degree turn and looked to guys like Warren Buffett for guidance through YouTube. 

I sold one of the houses later for a profit of 100+k - but all that I put into the house also returned ($270k total). And I invested that into index funds...I found another job and I worked hard, negotiated hard, invested hard and we arrive to 2020. 

And I just lost my job again lol - can I get a “FML 🤦🏽‍♂️”


But! Life is not so bad because all that shit I did, all the investing is now paying off. my parents still live in the other house that I own, it has equity over 500,000k! My wife and I really tried to invest heavily after my giant loss and we became millionaires. With a total net worth of almost 1.7M

So, yea, I don’t have a job rn but I’ll get one cuz I know that between me and that job is just a bunch of uncomfortable days and that’s it. 


Life won’t go perfectly guys. I’ve had other major issues in life while all this was going on too and, somehow, I made it financially because all that was required of me was to keep trying and listen to people who are millionaires already - don’t listen to your buddy who gives you stock advice (I did and I lost everything). 

So, no YOU aren’t alone. You aren’t unique / this situation is just different but every situation is always different. Result is the same. You guys have to define “what it’s gonna take to survive and thrive”. 

Believe me, I know people who started with me...who didn’t make it as well...they are still struggling with money. Still have no relationships...yea, it can get much worse. But, put your energy into the right stuff, get uncomfortable and you’ll see a change in your life.

4839,"Yeah I was trapped in a cult for a part of uni which affected my dating life as well as problems at home. I tried to date but I kinda never worked out so I just made friends. I told myself I’d date now but it kinda seems like that won’t be happening for a while. Worst part is, I can’t even get drunk by myself. So that sucks."
4840,"Wow. I’m briefly reading this as I’m filling out numerous job applications after being laid off and I can’t imagine going through all that but you give me hope. Even under the worst conditions , if you stay strong and move forward it will work out!"
4841,"Yea, you’ve pretty much summarized it. And I even left out 3 super personal and devastating events. I guess yes personal issues don’t help but they need not completely derail your life either. You’ve just gotta have an optimistic and non-victim mentality. 

What matters is action. Essentially when you’re struggling. Once you got it, it’s smooth sailing ⛵️ and it gets easier to go through the ups and downs.

I’ll tell you this much though, I’d rather go through life’s ups and downs WITH money than WITHOUT. If you have the fire inside you to achieve more, then make sure you push yourself and get uncomfortable to get it done."
4842,"I’m going to listen to your podcast haha. I was just on Facebook, saw someone posted a guide to thawing turkeys for thanksgiving... checked the date. I can’t believe we are here. I sighed. I opened reddit, and yours was the top post. 

You are TOTALLY not alone. I don’t understand the people that are fearless to advance themselves as well. I live where we have a real winter, and for some reason, doing anything (like starting a new job) beginning in the snow does not excite me. I’m wanting to wait til spring to try to find a new job, but it’s going to be a lonely and uneventful few next months.

I’d love to crack down on hobbies but looking at the last 8 months, I just want to stop giving myself false expectations."
4843,"I think things will return to normal by August 2021. It’s just a year lost. To be honest, I am excited to leave my early 20s. Being 22 feels like being an awkward little 14 year old boy in high school."
4844,Do you mind sharing the things you needed to work on? I'm in a similar boat so I'd appreciate any ideas.
4845,Exactly. Fucking sucks.
4846,That’s what my mom says. She’s like ‘don’t drink alone or you’ll become an alcoholic’.
4847,"Idk it beats other eras in history where you could look forward to being drafted and sent to die overseas at 18/after college. That’s how some of my dads childhood friends got to have their lives ended when he was in his 20s. so nah, covid is not some massive deal. 

Anyway covid hasn’t been much of an issue for me, my job is safe, made a ton in the market when it plummeted and then went back up, and even my side business grew since companies cut back on in house staff but still needed to farm work out. No big deal, everything passes."
4848,"It’s pretty much what you’re guessing, yeah. We basically have to keep it secret for and from everyone up until a decision has been made. We can’t even let Jim from accounting know the status because he might tell his brother who is applying for the open position - that sorta thing. Especially in the public sector it’s super slow. For some positions in the public sector we get over 500 applicants we have to go through and for other positions we get like 4 apps TOTAL. Really depends on the position.

Edit: and this is from a relatively small town / suburb."

4851,youre not respected by them because applicants are a dime a dozen. if you werent there theres thousands of guys to take your place.  you need them more than they need you. not trying to be mean thats just the bottom line.
4852,"Please don't beat yourself up over this, it sounds like you already have been. There is no shame at moving back in temporarily with your parents, especially in this time of scary virus stuff. 

It sounds like you're already pretty considerate of not being a burden to your parents, so my advice to you would be to remind yourself of all the positive things you've accomplished so far. 2 bachelor degrees and 5 years of work experience is pretty impressive. Set achievable goals that you want to accomplish during this time, and take this time to figure out what you want to work towards next. 

Take it easy on yourself and wishing you the best during this scary time."
4853,I love your username
4854,"Realized I misread your title a bit, but I think it still applies. The important things are to identify where you want to go, start making active progress toward that, and then enjoy the journey in the meantime! Good luck brother"
4855,Thank you!
4856,I’m a recent college grad with only about a year of relevant experience. I had to turn down two job offers because it would have been logistically impossible to start during the quarantine. It sucks but you are not a failure. These are some weird times we live in so whatever you need to do to make ends meet is a smart decision.
4857,Good plan! Thank you so much. I definitely know how to help them and it’s easy to do it without then having to ask. Hopefully I pass the Praxis and can begin teaching in the fall.
4858,"I’m looking to take the Praxis in May so I can get my teaching certificate this summer and teach in the Fall. Hopefully I can get into a Master’s program with a lot of begging haha but that’s essentially the plan. And to save, and get out of debt from college/hardship. 

I’ll be doing ranch chores. A few days ago I weeded out the gardens without anyone asking. Thankfully I know what needs to be done and how to do it, so that won’t be too much of an issue. It’s just odd being home after 6 years living in a city and not on a ranch. Chore list is a world different haha"
4859,"Well first off, don't think you're a loser. I lived by myself during the darkest part of my life and I'm lucky to still be here. 

Help them out when you can. The smallest gestures mean the most even when they go unnoticed. 

Think about your next move. Are you looking for a new dig or new job? When this mess passes how are you setting up for the post era."
4860,"I don't think you need to feel that bad. Current trend shows that more and more young people are living with their parents, either moving back or delaying moving out (look at this [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&client=ms-android-lge-rev1&sxsrf=ALeKk01bXK9J_E4g3_S46wKOln6t849VNw%3A1585265891261&ei=4zx9Xo3DD-Pfz7sP07SQ0AU&q=young+adults+staying+at+parents+home&oq=young+adults+staying+at+parents+home&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.3..33i22i29i30.681.14125..14401...4.0..0.424.5669.12j24j4j0j1......0....1.........35i39j33i21j33i160j0i22i30j0i30.XkqMNaS67OE), or you can also examine with similar keywords). As such, there is less stigma for young people living with their parents. In some part of the world, such as Asia and South Europe, it is a norm for young people to live with parents until they are married, and some parents even *expect* them to not leave the house. Your culture and family might have different values,  but, what I am trying to say is: the world would not end even if you decided to move back to your parents home.

I should ask this first: what kind of adjustments do you and your parents need to do? Is this a financial one, personal one, emotional one, or else?

Here is my two cents:

First thing first, ask them whether it is okay for you to pay rent and split the bills. A lot of parents tend to not let their children from paying them (they are the ones who had been paying for it all this time, after all), but, if you wish, you can negotiate about it. Or, simply send some money to your parents bank account and tell them that you do it to help your parents with their retirement plans.

Second, do themselves (and yourself) a favor by splitting house chores. You can volunteer by doing routine chores such as laundry, washing dishes, taking out trash, cooking, etc. As you mentioned that your parents own a family business, you can also contribute in performing some roles in that business that suit your background & preferences."
4861,"Yes!! I'm in a similar position to OP - graduate, but I was planning on moving out, had everything lined up (I moved home during my MA), and now everything is at a standstill. I felt SO ashamed and gutted for a bit, but now I'm trying to focus on the fact that I can save money, I'm not having to leave the house, and I can always move out after."
4862,Considering I’m high risk due to underlying respiratory illness I can’t really be out and about right now is the problem.
4863,"Thank you! Wishing the best for you as well. I’m still so mixed on leaving a whole life behind but I’ll be safe at home. Since I’ve had my hours at work so severely reduced, it’s just taken a hit on a lot, ya know? Using this time as a massive reset button and I’m thankful I can. My folks need help with their business so at least I can earn my keep."
4864,I lived in London and moved back to live wih my mum during my MA in a small northern town. It was fine. I am surviving and the benefits massively outweigh the cons
4865,Sure thing! It took me about two weeks to get past the guilt and sadness I felt. But know it will get better :)

Why not just drive Uber or GrubHub until this thing blows over? There are tons of gigs you can go to pay the rent until you can get an actual job."
4875,Try data science or programming. You probably have the knack for it. You can also use it do solve maths or simulate poker games or w/e.
4876,"It doesn't sound like you're lazy, it just sounds like you haven't found your passion yet. Try to get into programming and/or data sicence as /u/jarn_sida said. It's like playing chess against your computer ;)"
4877,"Thank you! That description sounds quite fun, definitely going to give it a go. Should I keep going with a maths degree and teach myself data science and programming on the side or should I consider switching course?"
4878,"I think the phrasing here is a little confusing especially how you define hard working.

Are you looking for a career path where the hours are limited and once you are home you are home and you can do whatever you want (example work 35-40 hrs a week and don’t have to take any paperwork home)? 

Or are you looking for a job where you don’t do much at work (man the cash register in a store that doesn’t get many customers so 90% of what you do is wait around)?

Or something else entirely?"
4879,Maybe not the perfect sub match but I would browse r/aftergifted I think you could find some good advice there
4880,"I think as kids it was so easy to excel and be in a top percentile without much effort. Once we hit college and post-college you start to realize that talent and native intelligence doesn't bring much value to the table unless you're one of the worlds best at what you're doing. At the end of the day, no matter what you're trying to learn or pursue requires a significant amount of hard work and dedication. Even Poker is an incredibly difficult game to learn to play to the point where you can make it an ""employable job"". That's why pro players call it a grind. I'm sure if you dedicate the time to learn poker and is have a bit talent, you can make money in the game. You just have to put in the effort and time"
4881,"If you’re passionate about learning how to write code, you should check out Data Camp. 


I’m a CS grad, and when I wanted to new things besides C#, I’ve used Data Camp. 


It’s a good site to get started since their “assignments “ are easy to understand, and hints during are great to solve problems correctly."
4882,"No that's not what I meant, I just recently realised that my standards of ""hard work"" for most of my life were off by a significant margin."
4883,"I have no idea if you should consider switching courses, that's a radical decision to make and I'm just a stranger on the Internet. If you graduate in maths though, you will find jobs fairly easily, as data science and programming are very hyped right now (and certainly will be in the future).

What I would recommend doing is to find some tutorials on programming statistical languages (R or Python), get the hang of it, and then try to participate in Kaggle competitions. You'll be able to see if that's a field you enjoy participating.

if that's not, no worries ! You'll find something else."
4884,"If you don't want to work hard at something, do the thing that you are naturally more exceptional at.  These are the things that we often assume are easy for others also because they don't' feel like work to us.  

Your math talent might make you an exceptional candidate for becoming a computer programmer.  Programming is a golden ticket right now.  There is a shortage so it pays incredibly well, a lot of companies provide lots of side perks (free meals, transportation, flexible work hours), and if you like math and solving puzzles allows you to be creative while having something to show for your work."
4885,"Not sure if I understand your post. Are you surprised that hard working people are valuable to the society? You need to bring something to the table that other people are willing to pay money for. 20 thousand years ago you'd just be running around the forest trying to kill a deer, so you could eat. If you didn't, you'd die of hunger..."
4886,or at least some fun collective commiserating
4887,To be honest I don't even know what I'm asking anymore. From what other comments pointed out I think my problem is that I haven't looked into a job that I am passionate about. I wrote this post thinking that being hard working is something you are or aren't which I now think is not accurate anymore. I would not pick the latter though.
4888,"That makes absolute sense though. Because we go through stages. When you're a kid, ""hard work"" can mean building a large LEGO castle. When you're 40 years old, it can mean taking care of your children, making money for the family, repairing the car. One has to be flexible. It hurts to break the status quo but it will happen many times during a lifetime. My definition of that term has certainly changed a lot over the past 2-3 years."

4891,"If you need a summer job, work in an environment you'd enjoy. I.e a game shop, or maybe even like a Barnes and Noble or something, based on your interests. You can make some money, build a basic resume, and make your mom happy.  

In general you sound like your spatial awareness and pattern recognition is high, I would look into getting a minor in CS, or just practicing programming on the side. Maybe find an area of programming you think sounds cool (whether it be a game, something heavy algorithm based, data science, etc). Start working on learning the language you need for that type of project, and eventually try and contribute to the project. I can't see a reason why switching out of your math degree would be smart, I say stick with that, you clearly excel in it. 

Continue to research for types of roles that have descriptions that are interesting to you, and read about different areas of study. If you can find your niche now you can start crafting your resume to make yourself a shoo-in hire down the line.  

Bonus: you said you like chess, and you might find this interesting. I had to code a solution to this puzzle in undergrad:   [link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)"
4892,"Learning to work hard is jus part of everyone’s coming of age in the modern era. We have access to so much entertainment these days it’s easy to fall in the groove you are in. 

The key is to push yourself. Understand that things like YouTube and hobbies, while fun, must be done sparingly. Too many games or other hobbies will pull you away from putting in work in the real world and become a major distraction"
4893,"~~Europe.~~  
  
You're not lazy per se, you just have never been challenged.  
You need a stoic mentor. We're out there.  
  
The problem you have is most people are quite lazy and that includes managers. So hiring you and getting useful work from you will be more difficult than a ""normal"" person. They don't care if the normal person is slower, is sloppier, or even if they're late. They want to make *their* work-life pleasant and most people are so tragically shallow that means hiring to the clique.  
  
The PC/HR buzzword bingo that means *hiring to the clique* is ""Good fit for our workplace culture"".  
That is the currently acceptable rationalization for their sloth-driven discrimination."
4894,"That's a fair point I agree. You seem to be a poker player yourself or at least someone that knows the game, do you think there still is a future in online poker to be pursuing?"
4895,"When I was in high school I was really into the game. I bought books and learned to play alot. In the US, Online poker is still banned in many states (new york included) so there weren't many options. Eventually when I got to College I just didn't have time anymore. However I can still beat $1/$2 live very easily but online is much tougher."
4896,Get into IT
4897,Not in America. Work life here is totally fucked due to all sorts of politically incorrect reasons.
4898,"Yes, and possibly minor in CS because its quite easy to do so. Seems that math major + CS minor is more desirable to employers than CS major + math minor"
4899,Damn I have a CS major and math minor and you couldn't be more right..
4900,"Depends on your field to be honest. I'm a therapist and we can be fairly alternative (conch would be fine same with helix or triples, but likely no face piercings or guages). Some places let me have blue hair others don't. Some places don't care about tattoos others do. What field are you going into?"
4901,"Don’t know too much but I know it’s becoming more widely accepted as the times are changing, more and more people in professional fields are allowing it in my area anyway."
4902,"I disagree. As long as you are not getting a peircing that is incredibly obvious like a flesh tunnel, whilst you are in uni you should go for it.


The holes close up. A peircing is small. You shouldn’t live your life afraid to get one based off of what an employee in 8 years is going to think, because by then you have the option to remove it. It’s good to consider things like face and hand tattoos and employability, but I am generally of the opinion that smaller things like piercings are not disfiguring and can easily be hidden."
4903,"You will need to be smart about when you wear it/ know your audience. Can you take it out without it closing up or leaving a large hole? If not, get an earring that matches your skin tone. 

My entire right arm is tattooed. My company doesn’t care if it’s covered. Just because they don’t care doesn’t mean it won’t effect me. If I’m ever going to meet with someone external to the company or even higher up within the company, I make sure to wear long sleeves."
4904,"Can I piggyback on this to be a 30 year old curmudgeon? IMO people should really avoid getting gauges. I gauged my ears when I was 12 years old and it was one of the biggest piercing mistakes I ever made. After graduating college I paid to get them surgically closed up and it cost me 1000 bucks. I know there's no way to really tell a younger person who wants them not to get them, but they are the only piercing I would advise against because they are so difficult to close if you don't want them anymore (unless they are small)."
4905,Just remove the piercing at work lol
4906,"Right calf shouldn’t be an issue because in most offices it’s an unspoken rule to not wear shorts - you’ll be able to hide it easily if you feel a need to. 

Wrist tattoo is like anything - depends on your potential employer, whether or not they care. Advice would be to avoid tattoos on visible areas not easily covered by long sleeves or pants"
4907,"People judge, we all do. Best to avoid piercings until you know what your possible employer is ok with. Just asking about it is usually the best way to go."
4908,Depends on where the tattoos is
4909,Yes. Old supervisor would specifically say she would disqualify people with piercings and tattoos. I waiting to stop covering my tattoo until I was in a few months
4910,"Or even just take them out for the 1 hour job interview, and put them back in once back in your car. Once you’re hired, it’s not a problem."
4911,"Preferably law or politics, aka i have to be more polished than almost every other field"
4912,"Yeah! I have had visible nose (and septum) piercings in interviews for jobs, including teaching and office jobs. It rly depends on your presentation, the nature of the piercing, and the job type. Lots of piercings are becoming more accepted, and will be especially if you're already hired."
4913,"Legally speaking, you *can* and likely *will* be discriminated against because of body modifications as they are not protected, (you cannot be discriminated against based on your sex, race, age, ethnicity, nationality, etc.) everything else, however, is pretty much fair game; Even more so in a legal and/or political setting. 

Personally though, I say go for it. No time like the present, right?"
4914,"This.

I had a nose piercing and took it out when I started interviewing for teaching jobs. They aren't allowed anywhere around me, and I'm okay with it. Not too attached to it anyway."
4915,"I’d say get them early, so they have time to heal. If necessary, you can get tiny studs when interviewing.

I flip my septum up during interviews but my last job (retail lol) was actually cool with all facial piercings"
4916,get them and enjoy them. If you are going an uber professional boring route like a lawyer then dont get a piercing that will permanently and obviously affect your body. you could get a bunch of ear piercings take them out and no one will know. Dont worry about it. its your life live it how you want be happy.
4917,"I have a hoop in my nose and still got a job in the finance/corporate world. They look at your overall appearance so if you’re put together otherwise it shouldn’t matter. Also, you can easily hide a conch piercing with your hair."
4918,Yeah :( a conch won't be too bad. You can take it out and photos of it won't haunt you or anything like an eyebrow piercing or something might. I say go for it :)
4919,"To further on the original question, is it a similar concept to tattoos?"
4920,"I had a tongue, helix, and navel piercing from the time I was 17, my entire back has been covered in a giant tattoo since I was 21, and I’ve worked in finance. 

I just covered them up or took them out while working, most coworkers never knew and the ones who did were like “WHOA we had no idea!”. In my experience they also had tats/piercings that they hid while working too, earring retainers could be useful for you to look into.

A conch is nothing lol get it now and if you change your mind later, just take it out. I took all 3 of mine mine out about 3 years ago, just grew out of them, no “permanent damage” that anyone except me notices. I’m 28 now btw working as a web developer so I don’t have to worry about any of this anymore"
4921,I have a stud in my nose. I might need to take it out anyway soon but I know why I got it done.
4922,"So I have a few thoughts. First, you're just going to college -- and most people end up changing their major, so right now I wouldn't be too worried. Also, a piercing isn't REALLY permanent.   
I just graduated and I'm a high school teacher. I had a nose piercing, and before applying to positions, read on the district's teacher handbooks and they don't allow non-ear piercings for employees. Took my nose piercing out. I have to keep my arm tattoo covered also. I also live in the Deep South.

I would say that reservations for piercings/body modifications depend on your profession, and your location. 

You should also consider the question that many people often ask, or use as justification, ""do i want to work for a firm or business, company, etc., that doesn't hire me because of my piercing (how i look)?"" And most people would also say no -- but if you're going to law school, you're looking at a really tough and overcrowded career in general. You don't have the luxury to be too picky, and limiting your career by a piercing seems a little counter-intuitive to me. 

My 2 cents :)"
4923,"This is the time to get all those piercings. For me I started get piercings around 16 nose and collar bone etc. I loved them to my early 20’s and then they became too much of a hassle. Forgot to put my nose one in for a week and couldn’t put it in after lol. Then showering my collar bone piercings would get caught on my loofa because I’m a dumbass that forgot every time I showered that I had them. Ended up pulling them out one by one. The thing is, I’m so happy I got them then because I got to experience them and now that I have, I don’t really want anymore. If you don’t experience them. You might regret it. Kinda like dying you hair. Idk if I’m making sense."
4924,Conches aren’t going to leave a big hole
4925,ok so my short answer -- get the piercing now because you're young.
4926,"I work in fundraising and I have 4 piercings in each ear (one of which is a conch piercing) and it isn't a problem in my office. One of my colleagues has a huge septum piercing too. My brother, who works in law, has ear piercings and nose piercings (and tattoos). I'm pretty sure he takes his obvious jewelry out when he goes to work and puts them back in when he's at home. I would say it doesn't really affect your job opportunities at most places, but there definitely some offices out there where it would be a big deal."
4927,"I think today it really depends on the tattoo as well. For example, basically nobody would bat an eye at a clover on your wrist, especially if you have an Irish sounding last name. People would likely be more skeptical about a cartoon character or a name


One thing to consider is that during first impressions you won’t have the opportunity to explain your tattoo, so if your beloved Nana liked daisies it will be more relatable out of context than if your dear uncle played with a metal band every day of his life. Both are sentimental to you, but both tattoos would not be interpreted in the same way without any explanation."
4928,"A bit different but my old supervisor went off to law school and became a lawyer with a full tattoo sleeve. I think that during interviews just take out the piercings, thats what I’ve aways done and then pop them back in after. If you have your hair down a conch piercing isn’t even that noticeable"
4929,"They can, but a conch piercing will most likely have little to no affect on your employability. Of all the piercings, ear piercings are the most common and accepted, and unless they're super huge or flashy they often  go unnoticed (esp with long hair). I had one and no one noticed it most of the time.

For your consideration, I had a conch for six mknths and just took it out bc I couldn't handle it. Takes a super long time to heal and is super inconvenient for sleeping / using headphones (which I use often). If you're committed to aftercare and don't get easily irritated, go for it, but if those don't apply, then I'd suggest going for something else like a helix, cartilage, or even faith."
4930,"I never knew what I wanted, still don't. 
I'm just happy I got a STEM degree so most doors can be opened with enough work. 
It was a close call though, almost burned out of college.
Selling four years of your life for a piece of paper that is only conditionally worth something is hard on the soul"
4931,"You have a point. But the thing about becoming a lawyer or doctor is that is allows access and flexibility to other lines of work. For example, some lawyers transition into academia, politics, or non-profit.

Life itself is not stagnant, which is the point I assume you’re also articulating. However, the positive is that if one becomes complacent in their “prestigious” career there’s always a way out or a pivot they can make to achieve a goal that makes then genuinely happy."
4932,"The problem we face after highschool is that we are basically forced to either go to college/trade school in a subject that we may or may not like doing after understanding it and then competing against people that have a ""passion"" for it OR go into a dead end job.

This is what happens when you have globalization, aka cheap slave labor, rapid tech advances, and have businesses that are too cheap to not interview qualified people for higher roles without that magical piece of paper.

Ffs, nursing used to be a trade, now its becoming or has become a college degree.  Competition is fierce."
4933,"And high school is just wayyyyyyyyyyy too early to be making those decisions. I'm 25 and the things I naturally gravitate towards are NOT the same things I was passionate about in high school, with maybe 2 or 3 exceptions. I remember casually picking up a book about architecture about 2 years after graduating from college with a BS in economics, and being blown away, and really feeling like I picked my path too early. Kind of got me down for a while, and even though I've since realized that if I really wanted to pivot into something like that I could, it still sucks to think back to being a senior in high school discussing with my guidance counselor what was I going to \*do\*, as if life is just running full speed into an ever-narrowing alley of ever-decreasing options. There's so much pressure early in life to figure these things out, but the people who put that pressure on you are rarely the same people who actually have the time to guide you through the process of discovering yourself to any meaningful extent."
4934,"Young people have to gamble to make it.

They cant all just go do manual labor jobs because they are becomer scarcer.  Even home depot got rid of most of its cash registers near me for self checkout.  I once tried applying to a job at a liquor store only to be told by the clerk i caught going back and forth to his car to drink alcohol that i needed retail experience.  >_>  companies no longer want to train people because a more competitive economy requires tighter budgets.  Which means young people have to get training on their own, which is even more inefficient.

Its not like a prospective dentist can go into an office and shove their hands in a person's mouth to see if they like it.  Nor could some highschooler just walk into google and poke around their office and their codebase.

People have to be lucky that whatever they study is something they will be passionate so much so that they can out compete others."
4935,"This is true for certain fantasies but remember that a lot of other calculus goes into career decisions. It’s not always as binary as love / hate it. There’s a lot of grey area ambivalence that goes into decisions and the fields we end up working are weighted off a constantly evolving life goals. 

I got into my profession because I can tolerate it for some period of time and I saw it as an accessible route for the minimum life standard I wanted to achieve."
4936,"I completely understand what you mean here, and if your goal is to create more and better options for yourself in the future, perhaps law school isn’t such a terrible idea! I might say going the doctor route is a bit more pigeon-holed but I get your overall point. I’m just saying I wish people would actually be taught to think in this long-term way, where one’s motivations and deep desires are actually considered, instead of signing on to something you only see as a goal post, like “once I graduate law school, then I will have succeeded and can finally take a breath” without actually thinking about what it might feel like to wake up on your 2,546th day of working at a law firm."
4937,"From someone who didn’t take a gap year, what sort of “real world experiences” have I missed out on/could not possibly have gotten while studying? Do you mean work experience or particular life experience? (I’m just curious since I hear this often)"
4938,"I would say life experience, not necessarily work experience because I’ve been working in restaurants for the last four years and don’t plan on remaining in the restaurant industry for life. However, working in restaurants is something that gave me more life experience than if I had gone straight to college. I’ve worked with high schoolers, drug dealers, college students, single parents, divorcees, all sorts of people. I’ve worked with people who want to better themselves, people who don’t, people who hate their position in life, and people who are perfectly content. The most important parts for me have been:

1. Working and therefore socializing with people from all different age groups. In high school I didn’t know how to talk to “adults” but now I can have a conversation with anyone no matter how old they are. If I had gone straight to college and stayed surrounded by people my age my social skills might have developed differently. I also think that because of this when I do go to university (because I really want to go) it will be easier for me to talk to my professors and network with them.

2. Meeting many adults of all different ages who have been in the restaurant industry for many, many years, and never went to college and don’t plan on doing so. Meeting people who are older than me and didn’t go to college but who are perfectly happy being cooks or waitresses (well, as happy as a cook can be lol) and don’t want to go to school. Many of the people I worked with found new jobs that weren’t in the restaurant industry but which still did not require degrees. It was really inspiring and relieving to me. It showed me that what’s really important is having friends and a family, not having a cool job title. I used to stress like a motherfucker every single day about how I was gonna be so behind other people my age, I was wasting my time by not going to college and wasn’t a productive person. But now, I don’t worry about it at all. I’m on my own path and I’ll figure everything out as I go. There’s no rush, because I know people who have been waiters for 35 years and are happy with their lives, and while that path isn’t for me, at least I know it’s not the end of the world and doesn’t make me a loser by any means. 

3. Going straight into the workforce to experience the American working class first hand has been extremely revealing. We grow up being told we have to go to college to be successful. We go to college and get told our degrees will get us our dream job. But I’ve worked with a lottttttt of waiters with college degrees. (That was another thing that was eye opening and relieving for me, that just because someone had a degree didn’t mean they were better or more intelligent than me. You may have a degree, but you’re running around like a maniac trying to serve your tables just like me). I got to see how bosses tend to treat their employees, which is like shit in most cases. I got to see that huge amounts of work and responsibility don’t mean you’re getting paid well. I’ve talked to people in management at the company I worked for who were completely disrespected and taken advantage of by their bosses. I’ve had my bosses disrespect and take advantage of me and my coworkers. This might sound silly to the uninitiated, but being fortunate enough to experience working in the absolute lowest tier of American capitalist society, which is blue-collar, non-degree-requiring service industry job, has shown me how little anyone gives a fuck about me other than myself, my partner and my parents.

This is all really valuable experience and knowledge for me to have. I’ve been able to learn what will make me happy personally. I used to think I wanted to change the world, become a millionaire, all that stuff we all believe we’ll do in high school. But now that I’ve experienced a lot of good and bad in the real world, and met a lot of really happy and really sad people, I know what I really want, and knowing that will allow me to get a degree that I’m much more certain will lead to what will make me happy, and not just a cool job title.

And just as a note for anyone who never went to college, I’ve also discovered that a solid 25% of people in college don’t belong there, because they’re lazy, willfully ignorant, brainwashed and uninformed (that’s what happens when you don’t teach logic classes in America), and some of the most intelligent people I’ve ever met don’t have degrees. Just because you didn’t go to university doesn’t mean you’re stupid, despite what America would have you believe. Thinking for yourself can’t be taught."
4939,"As someone else pointed out, it's not just about the subject matter. It's about what happens when you actually have a job and have to deal with the ins and outs and daily frustrations. To me it sounds like you probably won't have this problem because part of your education has exposed you the career that lies on the other side of your diploma. Medicine is actually pretty cool in that way, so I should clarify I used ""doctor"" and ""lawyer"" because those are the two commonly brought up high value professions that everyone's mom seems to want them to do (not a jab at you, literally thank goodness for doctors).

But your experience isn't universal. You're right--""how can you dedicate thousands of hours towards something without looking into whether you'd actually enjoy it?"" Expectations. Money. Prestige. You might not be able to see it, but tons and tons and tons of people die more every day in career paths they hate because those jobs inevitably remove a portion of what you found interesting in college, and replace them with dull, boring, banal expectations from your boss's boss's boss, who you might never even meet in person."
4940,"Totally feel that. Mentioned it in a couple other comments but I’m just saying I wish we were taught to have some level of awareness about such things. At least for me, my experience in public school was really just all aimed at getting into a good college. And then in college it was all about getting good grades for the next thing. It was all very clearly defined at every stage whether you were on track or not. But who’s track? Not always your own. I mean, heck, I’m glad I landed the job I have now, and I wouldn’t be here without a college degree and decent grades. But when was it ever actually about me? Not being selfish, but its that part, the looking inwards, that I feel I had to discover on my own. And everyone has to discover it on their own, and if you’re too caught up in goal posts that seem to always keep moving further away, it really might never come up until you’re like 35 in a deep depression and you don’t know why. Does that make sense or am I just rambling now lol"
4941,"I think there's another important thing to note that grad/professional school and actually working in said profession are two completely different things. My world isn't any different than those two other professions- I'm an architect. And there are people who go in and love school and find the working life too rigid and mundane, and others who constantly thought of quitting school and ultimately wound up really enjoying the work (I fall in the latter category).

Also, there are just people who are perpetual malcontents. It's important to distinguish whether it's a personality thing where you always want more, versus legitimately hating your work. Isolating which it is is important, because the remedy will differ, and I've seen people who have it all just shoot themselves in the foot by convincing themselves it was their work that made them miserable, only to wind up in a worse situation because of quitting and still having found no meaning in their lives."
4942,"I'm honestly surprised there are a good amount of people who agree with you... I'm sorry, I get it. but how can you dedicate thousands of hours towards something without looking into whether you'd actually enjoy it? I'm a neuroscience student and I'm working on my masters and hopefully I'll get into med school next year. I've spent countless hours in clinic learning and feeling out the vibe and I'm psotive now that I wanna be a doctor. y'all are wild"
4943,"In my opinion I did do a gap year or a jump straight into college, but a real slow working part time in hs then work full time in college and go to school half time.. despite it all, I’ve travelled the world and learned so much from life/work more than my college, but my college has taught me valuable lessons as well.

In summary from work I’ve learned that I don’t want to work shit jobs and be a low worker ant 🐜 I’m a leader with valuable input if they fail to recognize I just quit, this lead me to opening a small business stand a flea market, with success that lead me to controlling 3-5 stands and hiring younger kids to work them while I collect money, with that it lead me to shaking hands and befriending valuable elders, who then taught me life and stock market, which in turn lead me to the death of my parents, a hard time to cope but I ate it, which then lead me to a feeling of I just don’t care about anything that happens to me which led me to shake hands and learn real estate from shady fellows which in turn led me to spend money and see the rich mans life (as a minion not the boss) which in turn inspired me to become
The boss which in turn led me to traveling the world at what ever it cost, which in turn led me to learning so so so much about cultures and life which in turn gave me knowledge and new outlooks back home, which in turn led me to find a distant side of the family I never knew and become closer to them in there country.

Now college has taught me that I want to surround myself with smart peers, people smarter than me who talk clean and have good futures, it’s taught me to hold my tongue more and speak politer, it’s taught me isolation by intelligence, no longer finding people interesting because they’re are too dumb sober, if that sounds condescending I often try to act very dumb as to not offend my peers but yes inside they bug me with there dumb questions and seeking of advice. I don’t mind to help them though, okay moving on college taught me discipline to get the job done at any cost. 

I’m at a fine line between the college life and the business life, both seem promising and I will see what happens. 1 years to BS yeah it’s taking me much longer than someone who should have had it by 22 but it’s fine. I didn’t have a traditional upbringing, there was always walls, some so painful people are appalled all the time when I tell them what I am where I come from and how I got here.

Anyways good luck!"
4944,"You could also absolutely *love* the work itself but hate the work environment. 

I have a degree in translation. I absolutely despise translation companies after working for one for a while. It really sucks because I love translating, so I'm back to doing literary translation and freelancing, which is definitely less stable in terms of income, all the while supplementing it with some teaching on the side (which I love, too!). But day in and day out there is always some sort of frustration involved with my line of work, because people either don't understand it well or clients are so used to shitty companies paying their employees next to nothing for top quality work."
4945,I went a month after I left high school and feel completely lost
4946,"Love this comment, thank you for adding your thoughts. I'm with you 100% that there's just so many factors going on at once, that if you don't really nail down what's making you unhappy/unfulfilled, you're basically putting up four walls of eternal discontent around you. Blindly waiting around for, or even working yourself to the bone towards some external source of fulfillment maybe works for like 5% of people in the long run (yes I've pulled this figure out of my ass)."
4947,So you graduated one month ago?
4948,"It varies. While some positions (such as clerical work) are open to anyone with a high school diploma, others such as mine (patient procedure coordination) is rather competitive. Regardless many doctors are usually more than happy to let students shadow without taking any position within a company. but if you do have a position they are even more inclined to do so. further clinical experience is valuable regardless of direct instruction from a doctor as other professionals such as nurses and PA's are nearly always available to answer question.
I now, however, realize this is not common for many careers as OP pointed out in his response."
4949,"Nope, I graduated in June 2018 and started my first semester in July 2018. I was 16 years old so idk how I was supposed to know anything about how anything works (I still don't)"
4950,"yup! and you make a great point about that first five years vs afterwards. I'm like 3 years into my job and already feeling the pressure to branch out and work on bigger projects/take leadership roles, which really would be exciting if I was more into my career. It's probably super ignorant for me to feel this way, but I'm already fantasizing about dropping everything and going to work at a venue or something, where I at least don't have to act like I care about whether I should be rounding some unnamed dude's quarterly dividend payment to 4 vs 5 decimal places. Trust me when I say I know things could be so much worse, but man... wait til you're a few years into your first job, things get existential."
4951,"So did you graduate early, or is graduating high school at 16 the norm in your country?

They don’t teach kids enough in public school for them to be self-sufficient even if they do graduate at 18. That’s why I’m grateful to have had time off. I had time to figure things out for myself instead of heading straight to university. I had no idea what I was doing either and I was always so stressed and worried all the time about what the hell I was doing with my life and how to do it. But that’s exactly why I’m thankful for my gap period, because I was able to use that time to figure it out (for the most part) and learn not to stress because everybody else is learning just like me. A lot of people won’t learn until years after they graduate college and personally I’m just thankful I got it out of the way early and before I have time to fuck anything up."
4952,"It's the norm pretty much.  My parents offered me six months but for some reason I got a scolarship and would've lost it if I hadnt started right away. Even tho sometimes I wish I would've had some time off, I never would've met my girlfriend, so I wouldn't change a thing."
4953,"Exactly, it is the norm, and it shouldn’t be. It’s terribly unhealthy in many ways. But if we weren’t indoctrinated and pressured into it, colleges wouldn’t be able to take our money from us, and we can’t have that now can we?"
4954,"Lol, exactly. My mom says I gotta either study or get a job or I'm out of the house, I have nowhere else to go so I guess I've got no choice."
4955,">Make sure you actually want to practice the law. Make sure you actually want to *be* a doctor.

That is such a rich person response to life...

>because while it sounds kind of depressing, avoiding it until you're 30 has and will continue to absolutely DESTROY people (yep, I'm talking alcohol/opiods/suicide).

You sound like such a weak spoiled brat. You sound like someone who never actually struggled growing up, and you're just some whiny 21 year old.

You know, i'm going to go ""against the grain"" on this one.... Are you dumb? Are you missing a chromosome? What the hell did you think would happen after you graduated? Did you think after studying law or medicine for 7 years, you'd become an actor? an artist?

Legit, I don't understand this post? Now of course, I actually grew up in a poverty stricken rural environment, where education (or for most the military) was the only hope to escape that dead uneducated dying town, and so I studied 4 years in network ""engineering"". Not because it was FUN but because, guess what!,  It got me a stable job.

Now i'm in a middle class environment at the age of 25, and I can actually pay bills and enjoy Life!!

I don't think you understand how whiny your post comes off as, but man, it really shows who populates this sub, if THIS post, is upvoted this much"
4956,"Damn this is seriously something I’ve just started to realize. Even now I’m aware of this fact but can’t seem to fully wrap my head around it in my day to day life. I’m still all about trying to reach the next goal post even though I’ve made myself see that it’s not the way to live. It’s a very hard mindset to break. 

I’m only about a year out of my undergrad and already questioning the path I’m on. I always used to think I was part of the “lucky ones” who knew what I was passionate about. I’m hoping that I was right and it truly is my passion and something I’ll wanna do day in day out. And hopefully I’m just questioning it cause the starting position I’m currently at isn’t the one I want to actually DO. So maybe once I move up I’ll find out I was right, I did really want this. But right now it feels pretty bleak. (It also doesn’t help that this pandemic has me thinking a little too much and has made my field of work non existant for the time being.) 

I agree with you that younger people need to be told the reality of the field they choose early on before they invest so much time/money/effort into it. I think there would be a lot less depressed people if teens and young adults got to choose their career based upon some lived experience instead of that one club or class you kinda liked in high school.

Edit: spelling"
4957,"How did you get into your clinic, does anyone that is curious about working in a clinic get the chance to do so or do they have to out compete others?  You get hands on training and instruction from professionals?"
4958,"Phew, didn’t mean to get you so riled up there bud. Sorry my post doesn’t match your life and I’m glad to hear you’ve achieved permanent contentment at age 25. Only 60-70 more to go.

Also, the title of my post said I hate this. I’m not whining about MY life. I’m saying there’s a core failure in public schools that isn’t preparing kids mentally for some of the harsher realities of life, instead avoiding these subjects and prioritizing measurable goals over inward thinking and wisdom. It makes for a lot of anxious, unfulfilled grown ups. Whether that’s worse or better than your life story doesn’t matter."
4959,"you know that's completely fair. I didn't think about how I'm genuinely lucky to have gotten the opportunity to directly work under doctors and how rare that actually is in other fields, especially those that require you to already have a degree to get experience. Further, your experience in a field in the first five years is drastically different to the next five years and depending on the expectations of the field this may change your outlook of it completely. thank you for the response"
4960,"Thank you I will call them tomorrow morning, I was just nervous because this is the first interview I ever did straight out of college and hopefully my first job if it works out."
4961,Just call them and say I need to update the phone number on my resume don’t explain anything else and they’ll note it down... no need to stress ~chill~ you got this
4962,"I would call and say you need to *update* your phone number, effective immediately. I have interacted with plenty of HR managers who treat the resume like a codex, and any mistake on it means the entire applicant is flawed based on their draconian rules."
4963,"Send them a thank you email, thank them for their consideration, and make sure your phone number is included in your email signature. Would include something at the end of the email along the lines of “I’ve reattached my resume for easy reference.  Thank you again for your consideration and for the opportunity to interview with your team today.” Reattach your updated resume."
4964,Good luck!
4965,"You could say you got a new phone number, so it doesn’t look as bad? If possible?"
4966,you will do great!
4967,Worst case scenario if you call them and give them the correct number is that you don't get the job. But you definitely won't get the job if they have no way to contact you
4968,"Is this really a question? Just call them and tell them that you have them the wrong number, simple, doesn’t require a genius to figure this one out."
4969,"Email them or call them and give them the right number. Fix it on your resume.

Above all, learn from your mistake and keep applying for other jobs."
4970,Good luck dude! Even if you don't make it you'll still get there eventually. Stay strong.
4971,I’m a recent psych grad (summer 2020) and yea I’m currently looking for a job and just struggling. I’m kinda just lost like I’m feeling like maybe i should try something new but idk what. Going back to school would be cool but i don’t want to get more loans. I mean i have hope that things will get better but rn I’m just down bad. I think everything will work out for you too soon enough.
4972,"I feel the same way. In my case, I didn't even have that much fun in college. Most of my time was spent working and learning stuff. However, I still miss it so much. That feeling of walking on campus on a friday night and seeing everyone go out or goofing around with my dorm roommates and floor; I miss that feeling of community and belonging. I miss that feeling of mystery, excitement and unknown potential.

I can say that over time the impact of these emotions will lessen. While I still miss college and wished I had even more fun, I have come to accept it with the good and the bad.

And so be patient and take your time. You'll feel better. And I highly recommend you find a therapist. It helps immensely."
4973,"I needed to hear this. I graduated undergrad November 2020. 
I’ve definitely been going through post-grad depression since then. This is the most down I’ve felt in a while. It’s funny because I’ve heard about it before I graduated and decided to do some research. I guess I was a little prepared beforehand to what was to come, but that didn’t make the feelings I’ve been having suck any less.

I have mixed feelings about college. 
I didn’t have the typical “college experience”. 
I was a nursing major. Anyone you know who is a registered nurse (RN) will tell you straight up that nursing school was one of the hardest (if not, THE hardest) thing they’ve ever done in their life. 
Absolute hell. 
Before I started nursing school, I’ve heard from former nursing students that once you start nursing school, you can kiss your social life goodbye. 
That was accurate for me. 

I didn’t get to party or go to football games or go to a lot of campus events.
Instead, I was cooped up in the library from 8 am til midnight (no exaggeration) reading chapter after chapter in textbooks, reading slide after slide in PowerPoints, studying for upcoming exams (that’s worth 25% of your grade). Staying up all night til 5 am and the exam is at 8 am. Or I was at the hospital doing 12 hour shifts (7 am to 7 pm, sometimes later) taking care of patients. 
Wanna go out with friends on an epic beach vacation for spring break? Forget that. You got an exam the exact DAY you get back from break. So you’re studying your entire week off.
Wanna celebrate Thanksgiving with family over the break? Good luck with that. Better take your food with you while you study for midterms next week. Start prepping for CUMULATIVE finals while you’re at it. And the finals are back to back, 3-4 days straight at a time. Sometimes you don’t even get a study guide.

That’s just SOME of what I had to deal with while in nursing school, but I’ll spare the details. 
The people that partied throughout nursing school were few and far between. If they did that frequently, they would’ve flunked out no doubt. 
Granted, I’m not necessarily a party person.
But I do get sad sometimes and feelings of FOMO that I didn’t get to experience the “wonderful” college experience that a lot of non-nursing major students did.

I could’ve not study as hard as I did. But I did because my school had extremely high expectations/requirements in order for you to get through the program. Plus, I had a scholarship that paid a lot of my tuition. Had to keep my GPA at least a 3.0 in order to keep my money. 

I also resonate with what you said about priding yourself about school. I’ve been in school practically my whole life. Went straight to college after high school. Was an honors student in high school and undergrad. 
I liked school, and I did well in it. 
Now that’s it’s officially over, I feel lost.

To hear you say that these feelings get better with time and that good times are ahead is really encouraging. I wish you the best. 
Thank you. :)"
4974,"thank you for this. during tough times it just gets so hard to get out of this rut, especially remembering that it wasn’t like this in college. but i’ll only be holding myself back if I keep doing that, I have a new career ahead of me to put my time into that i’m excited for"
4975,"Got my Master's degree in December and still haven't found work. Honestly, it's the first time I've had suicidal thoughts with all the job rejections."
4976,"Unfortunately it's part of the cycle, you will get there eventually. The job market is crazy right now but it'll settle eventually."
4977,"hey, psych student too. I'm in my first year and reading your stories make me a little worried. I hope things work out for you guys!"
4978,Haha don’t be worried. If it’s truly what you wanna do that keep at it! My advice would be to develop relationships with your professors and also try to get a research assistant position for one of them. Or some other position as a student like TA or something. I feel like that would be helping me right about now. I made some connections with some of my professors but did not develop them as much as i should have.
4979,"I have a similar story, except replace your 3.5 yrs as well as the rest of your life before with almost zero social interaction, then one fantastic crazy graduation party, which I ruined by being a socially awkward idiot. Then moving home broke and losing it all. Yeah I’m not feeling great either"
4980,Hello fellow “psych but not in a therapy way” person. I feel you 100%. I’ve worked nothing but seasonal customer service jobs for the last three years since graduating.. with side contract work grading highschool statewide exams which went to all hell with covid. Been unemployed since last March and am literally just applying for other customer service roles because the job market for anything that could possibly relate to psychology just ain’t there. Hang in there pal we’ll breakthrough somewhere eventually and find our path 💪🏼
4981,"I hope you’re doing okay. Our suffering is so temporary, you’re going to get through this. Just please don’t go through it alone. ❤️"
4982,You too?? I'm relieved I'm not the only “psych but not in a therapy way” person because everyone I seem to know went into social work. It's been really hard and I hope we get something good soon
4983,"Wow, finally someone has described how I feel to a tee.."
4984,"I needed to hear this. I just graduated a few months ago, and I was not at all prepared for what adulthood really was like. I wasn’t prepared for how much I’d have to do on my own, and I’m still not fully prepared tbh. It all just feels so bleak right now, and I’ve been feeling a lot of hopelessness, but I’m just trying to jump at any opportunities I can find in the hopes that I can find something that makes me happy (or at least not miserable). Hearing other people talk about their experiences with post-college depression definitely helps me feel like I’m not alone in this, and that it will some day get better."
4985,"Nice to see another nursing major here! I think I had and saw a very different college experience from you. I went to a popular private school in California for nursing. 
I didn’t party very much but I had so much free time and honestly could’ve partied more if I tried. I also saw a ton of kids partying at my school. So I’m kind of curious where you ended up going for school. 
I hear a lot of people have your experience and study a lot. However, it could also be because my highschool was extremely hard and it absolutely tanked my mental health and I’m just doing that much less now."
4986,"Hello fellow nurse! 
I rarely see nursing majors in this sub. 
I know how hard and different nursing is compared to other undergrad majors, so I figured I’ll add my two cents when it comes to talking about college experiences, even if my experience wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. 
That’s really interesting that you had a more relaxed, fun college experience, especially being a nursing major. I’ve never even considered that to be possible, so consider yourself lucky. 😇 
I’m sorry you had a rough high school experience by the way. 
I went to a public university in Tennessee. 
This particular college of nursing is notorious for “breaking people” like bootcamp. 
People joke that if you can make it through this particular nursing program, then you can make it through anything. 
Case in point. When I started nursing school in 2018, my class started off with 140-150 students in orientation.
By 2020, only 60 of us graduated. You read that correctly, 60. That’s how many people dropped out or flunked out within 2 years."
4987,"Thank you! Also, i feel you on the abusive/toxic household thing. It’s draining, but I’ve decided that it’s my new motivation to find a job and save up so i can move out as quickly as i can :)

Also, you mentioned streaming and i think that you should 100% do it. Why not? Just go for it and maybe something can come out of it and if not then at least it can be something that you enjoy doing. I’ll watch lol"
4988,Wow thank you! My first viewer haha that gave me some motivation to go through with it and save up for equipment :)
4989,"Finished my actuarial science degree a few months ago and there is this pressure from my family to get a job.they stopped giving me allowance am even finding it hard to afford basic stuff. I'm not really skilled at doing anything, prided myself for being ""smart"".

Now I can't get a job,can't be in relationship cause I feel so shitty about myself and I just feel like it isn't fair to walk into a relationship with all this burgage.i feel so alone though

Guess this is the first time I'm actually feeling depressed and I'm finding it hard to cope.hope there is light at the end of the tunnel


Forgive my English, it's not my first language."
4990,"hey this is how I feel right now but I'm a bit younger than you are, did it get any better since this was one year ago?"
4991,"I can tell you, now that it’s been about a year since I posted this, it gets better I promise *huge*"
4992,"I’m now 3 years out, I promise it gets better and eventually college becomes a distant memory. you’ll still have shitty days, especially nowadays with inflation and the pandemic, but it’s all about how you handle it at the end of the day!"
4993,"Thank you, I really hope things do work out and soon for all of us. I feel the same way about school and loans. I'm especially hesitant about it bc I don't know what field I'd be willing to invest tens of thousands into, if any... I think healthcare research assistantships and project coordinating positions tend to do well with psych grads if that's interesting to you"
4994,"Hey, I'm sorry this is how you're feeling. It's a really hard time go through. I wish I could say that things are drastically different for me on paper (job, finances, living situation, relationship), but they're not. 

Fortunately, even though those things haven't changed in some miraculous way, the biggest difference I notice when rereading that old comment I wrote (and totally forgot about) is the change in my mental health after starting therapy. I started about 10 months ago and working through my mental health, childhood, coping strategies, and having someone to talk to without judgement every week has made me healthier bit by bit. I still have a long way to go, but I'm getting more okay with everything being a journey instead of being perfect immediately. I'm a little kinder to myself, even though that requires continuous reminders to myself to actually be kind. I'm able to remind and genuinely accept that it's okay I don't have the things I want *yet* because I can keep going and get there. 

Working on my mental health is really hard, but it was a good place to start for me because I didn't realize how it had a ripple effect on everything else I was desperate for (the job, finances, living situation, relationship). I used to be so overwhelmed by the thought of wanting, but not having these things that I would feel too paralyzed with shame to go after them. 

Aside from mental health, I have quit my job that I felt was a dead-end for me. Now I'm in between jobs and spending the free time working on myself internally. I'm looking into UX bootcamps to gain skills and hopefully land a job in that field after. I'm still at home unfortunately, but I've learned how to cope with it in some ways and therapy has helped me grow a bit stronger in knowing abuse is abuse and it's not my fault and it's okay to move out. After I get a job I plan to move out. I did start a relationship recently, but I think it'll end soon because of incompatibility and therapy has helped me recognize my triggers and what works/doesn't work for me and it's okay. 

I feel like I have more control over my life path than a year ago when I felt utterly hopeless and burnt out. I care less about what other people think, including my family, and it's very freeing. I take time to do things that solely make myself feel good for self-care, like buying a concert ticket I don't need but want or gardening, and I think that's all life is about- just creating and enjoying moments that lift you up when you can. 

I'm very sorry to hear that you are feeling how I did before. I wish I could say everything is amazing now, but that's unrealistic and I'd be lying. I still have very low days occasionally and I do still wish for better things in life, but I feel more hope and control for my future now and that's making an important difference. I hope the best for you."

5001,IMO it’s probably only worth it to put it on if it’s over 3.5.
5002,"No one ever asked for my GPA. Also, after getting my first job previous work experience was far more important than anything I did in school."
5003,"I would leave it off completely, and only include honors if you received them. For example, people will generally know your GPA if you just put magna cum laude."
5004,All I heard is “Dean’s List”
5005,"That’s true, my perspective is from someone almost out the door."
5006,"No, in my experience, every job I applied to while I was in college (applying in december-May for start date in May) asked me my GPA since I had only an internship and kitchen experience. Now that I have a job and have been working here for 2 years, I couldn’t even imagine wasting a line of my resume on GPA when I have all this work experience to put down instead. 

This first job is the hardest one to get."
5007,"If youre a senior then you can you still apply for internships within 6 months of graduation so depending on the company it can be an easy way to get experience on your resume or the internship can potentially lead to a fulltime job within the company.

It really depends on your field. I’m a film major in her senior year so I’ve felt a strong need to get as much internship experience as possible and am currently hunting for internships that could lead to a full time job since I’m a bit worried about finding a fulltime job lol 

But I’ve heard that gpa is still not as important as actual experience for grad school, but again, depends on the field. 

Assuming youre from America (like me), we’re definitely a culture that values work experience over school! Like, you have to have a degree but specific majors and universities arent as important on a resume as the experience itself ( unless you need certification, ofc )"
5008,Engineering graduate who started full time work immediately - networking during school is the only thing that matters.
5009,"I got a 3.0 (chemistry screwed my gpa) so I was the minimum for grad school if I chose that route but not one job has asked about my gpa, they asked about my experience in college- what internships/volunteer opportunities I had, applicable job experience, etc."
5010,What if you were up and down? My gpa is middling but I go deans list one year
5011,Strong mood. I had a 2.97 by the end of college. Fuck orgo
5012,I know that Lockheed Martin is reluctant to hire computer science and engineering majors right out of school if their GPA is below 3.5
5013,"It mattered for an internship, but it even then hardly mattered. They just had to check a box for HR. Now that I have real world experience, it matters even less what the GPA/piece of paper says I studied."
5014,"Yes, my GPA did matter when applying to Grad school. I did apply right after my undergrad, so that may have been why it was important to them. But they definitely were interested in my undergrad GPA. 

Once you get in, the actual opportunities you have (GRA,GTA) where less impacted by the GPA."
5015,It was used by my current employer to help determine starting salary.  Higher GPAs got higher salaries.  I had 4 job offers before that and none of them asked for my GPA.
5016,"Meet your professors at their office hours and discuss the coursework. They will see that you care about the material and your understanding of it as they teach it to you. This is the basis of building academic goodwill. These relationships will allow you to connect with other faculty in your program more easily! (""Yeah, I know Dr F, I took his ECON 384 last semester and learned a lot."") 

Next, join a club (or two) related to your major of study to meet other students that are looking to network and make connections within the student body. These people are generally more active and interested in supplemental experience outside of class. They might know better which courses to take and which to avoid. At the very least, you may make some friends who are also looking toward the future of life after school and these goal-oriented folks are the type you want to surround yourself with. :)"
5017,"I suppose there's the benefit of practicing time management and knowledge acquisition.  I was 3.9 in my masters, 3.8 in my undergrad major, but 2.8 overall in undergrad.  Hasn't made a bit of difference, but I still value the parts I committed to."
5018,"You can have a short section that says “honors and awards,” and put Dean’s list in it.

I would only put Latin/degree honors and honors thesis (when applying for academic roles) underneath/next to the degree section of my resume."
5019,"Scholarships. Real life doesn't matter, I had a 3.95 and people would be sarcastic and say ""man it's not a 4.0."" But you know poking fun but still impressed. Yea nobody cares."
5020,"After graduation and you land your first job, your GPA really does not matter. It's literally a few lines on your resume, your experience generally tells a better story of your qualifications than school GPA.

My first semester at school I had a near perfect GPA and when I got my first internship, I realized how little they cared so I just stopped trying in undergrad. Graduated with a 2.39 GPA but had 5 internships throughout my time in school and graduated with a really good job. So no, unless you're going back to school, GPA doesn't really matter."
5021,"Military contractors also seem to have the pick of the litter when it comes to new grads, so I think that has to do with the competitiveness of their positions most of all. 

Most engineers from my university end up at Lockheed, Pratt & Whitney, Electric Boat, etc. But they work damn hard to get there since those places pay good money for their hires."
5022,"I work in education so it matters for my field. But many fields shrug and don’t care, they’d rather see networking, extracurriculars, and experience."
5023,I feel your pain!!
5024,Lol no
5025,"Jobs do ask for GPA. People don’t realize this bc not a lot do it, but the larger companies definitely do if you’re a recent grad."
5026,"I’m an undergrad, can you elaborate on networking?"
5027,"These things are all well and good, but I thought networking was more about getting connections to employers and people working in the field."
5028,"You gpa gets you interviews, it’s just something the employer can go off when everyone has little to no experience, they’re not going to care about once you hit the actual interviews, but they need some standard way to filter out all the applicants. 

High GPA get you more interviews, but then it’s up to you after that."
5029,A few companies ask about my gpa when i interview but i don’t think it’s the biggest concern. It’s mainly about my experience and what i actually know.
5030,"Graduated summa cum laude for my MBA and undergrad. Graduated 3.9 undergrad, 4.0 grad. I got contacted by A LOT of people on linked in and ended up at a job that I didn’t apply for making more money then I’ve ever made? I always think applying yourself gets you further. Why be average? I think that being able to prove yourself and capabilities is important. If you’re capable of showing how great you are on paper and how hireable you are then gooo for it and get C’s."
5031,"This is retarded. If you don’t look and put no effort into something, it’s not going to happen. 

You have to put yourself out there; go to parties, go to the bar, make friends, get on apps. 

If you sit in your room all day, a hot girl isn’t going to knock on your door and fall in love with you."
5032,"I feel like a gym is like the last place you’d go to find someone. At least for me, I don’t want to talk to people much, I just want to work out"
5033,Dont look and it will come focus on leveling up your self up.

5035,"I would hold off on dating even though I’m sure that isn’t what you want to hear. You mentioned not having to go to the bars and clubs, trust me you’re not gonna find someone wanting a serious relationship there lol. They just want everything fast fast fast. You could try online dating, I’ve personally never had any good experience with dating apps, and I literally tried them all. Instead I’d join like hobby groups! Like that way there isn’t a pressure to instantly make a connection with someone and you can make connections that way and meet other people through them. Again if you want to try dating apps go ahead! I know a girl in college who met her first boyfriend on tinder and ended up marrying him lol. But you’re not alone! I’m 26 and just got out of grad school and I’ve never been in a serious relationship, (I also found out that that the only boyfriend I had from high school is a total CREEP) but I’ve found patience is very important during this time and in relationships anyways so when it’s your time you’ll be ready! Good luck!"
5036,"Facts, nobody wants to get hit on at the gym"
5037,"Legit, your post is word for word what I would also say. Even down to not liking online dating.

I've personally decided to work on myself before worrying about relationships since I don't think now's the best time to really be looking due to the pandemic."
5038,"Ironically I found my girlfriend after undergrad- I just had more time for dating after I finished my degree. 

COVID is something completely alien to everyone in all walks of life, so just think of this as a ""pause"" and realize dating is altered for everyone right now. Under ordinary circumstances though, a lot of where you meet people depends on your personality. I personally found apps to be a good crutch (that's where I met my girlfriend), but also met people through mutual friends or just striking up strangers at events like parties, professional functions, even public transit or at museum gallery openings. And I'm not saying this as some super friendly guy- I'm extremely introverted and at a certain point just stopped caring about talking to women I found interesting.

Apps did prove to be a huge help in confidence boosting, however- having a bunch of low stakes options in front of you does allow you the opportunity to figure out what works for you in dating, and it removes a lot of the awkwardness of approaching someone in public. I'd recommend just relying on apps given COVID, and just take a laissez faire attitude towards dating. Nothing terrible happens if most of your 20s (even 30s) is spent single. As cliche as this sounds, when the time is right and you meet someone you want a formal relationship with, it'll happen. Until then, just relax and go for the ride. Being in a relationship is a choice, and few people stay single indefinitely if they don't want to be."
5039,"I second this! The second I stopped thinking/ searching/ (sometimes obsessing) I walked into a great relationship. Be patient, you’ll find them!"
5040,> bad higen
5041,"I agree, you have to put yourself out there. I more so meant it shouldn’t be the only thing you’re thinking of/ focusing your attention on. It can become overwhelming. 

Focusing on other things that make you happy/ self improvement(hobby, work, gym,etc.) is what will in the long run make you a more attractive person overall. At least that’s how I see things!"
5042,"As a married man, having recently gone through this, and analytical, I’d ask you: do you know what you’re looking for? I’d start there, because if you don’t know what you want then you’re never going to find it.
If you know what you want, then you need to figure out where those men are and find a way to interact with them. If you’re interested always be willing to show IOIs and be willing to initiate things as friends which lay the groundwork for something more. 
If you know what you want, and you know where to find it, then it’s about getting it or getting him to come to you.
Most of all though, you need to know who you are before you can be with someone else. This is hard, but I’ve experienced this and believe it. 
Finally, current culture makes it harder for men to feel their pursuits to women are welcome. I think this hurts men and women. I had to navigate around this. Everyone is going to have to figure this out too."
5043,Same
5044,"yeah, now it's not the best time to think about it...

when we're past this pandemic try looking to meet people independent of going into a relationship or not, eventually you might stumble into someone"

5046,did you approach guys or did guys approach you? the general advice i've heard is that guys shouldn't approach girls in the gym
5047,"I wish you the best of luck. I don’t envy you. I searched for seven years for the woman who would be my wife and it was hard... now I’ve found her and she is the most wonderful part of my life. She’s my “person” - the one who gets me. I never want to be without her. If it’s worth fighting for - go get it. I’m glad to have her, but I’m glad my search is over. I never want to have to date again. I’m in it for keeps with this one."
5048,"He means work on yourself, get money, fresh up with the cologne/ Looks, work out, be the best person you can be and that hot ass girl will come to you. I put no effort in looking for no girl for the whole 2018. As you can tell a pretty ass chick came to me and we been together now for 2 years going to 3."
5049,"I'm 23 and in the same boat as well. I admit it can be very very tough. I've been focusing on working on myself for quite a while now but to what end? I always think that this will go on forever. If I can't get into in a relationship now then why and how would that change in the future?

One thing I've noticed though is that over time you become more ""desperate"". This will push you to locate and take advantage of opportunities that you may not have considered before. There are always opportunities. You're just not desperate/comfortable enough to look for them and seize them. That's in my experience. You can always checkout the plethora of dating apps out there or local social clubs and organizations that might start doing physical meetings again soon. You can check and see if any online speed dating is available to help you practice and meet different people. Some bars are still open even during covid. I haven't done any of those yet because I'm incredibly busy these days and don't want any distractions.

Basically, you will self-adjust with time so don't be too harsh on yourself. I know things feel hopeless sometimes but know that you have a lot of time ahead of you. Things can change very quickly so don't despair."
5050,Paid dating apps. The free ones are full of spam and have barely any women. Attended a friend’s wedding last week that started on one.
5051,"nearly impossible I’ve found, easier just to accept loneliness for me"
5052,"I think you should focus on ye self first. Not that I'm qualified to say any advice (I'm 12) but I have observed and realized this around my relatives and the people I know. I know some people that have pretended to be someone or something else because they were ashamed of who they really were. So sort ye self out first, then you can worry about the dating thing. You should also be just who you are, don't be someone you're not, because they are going to find out somehow and someday, and have a whole lot of problems. About the dating thing, I think you should follow the other people's advice here and focus on your interest. You will find someone. You also should not rush. Take yer time, because patience is a good thing to have and will get you great things. That's all I can really say mate. Good luck and don't lose hope!"
5053,"Your name is NordyNed, one of the least feminine sounding things i can think of"

5055,"Happen to know which they used?  I've never looked into sites that didn't give me the impression that they weren't filled with fake profiles to drive subscriptions with sheer numbers.  I did try eHarmony when it was somewhat new, and those were definitely real...  but the closest match it ever gave me was 400 miles away, the rest were all over 1000."
5056,"Honestly right now I don’t mind it as long as it’s not during an exercise or while I’m on a machine, mostly because of the covid stuff. It is hard to meet people in person right now and I happen to go to a gym with a bunch of good looking, really nice guys so why not?  In normal times yes I do get annoyed if someone interrupts my workout to hit on me (like at least wait to catch me when I’m leaving if you’re going to) but right now we’re all just doing what we can to meet people I think. It’s one of the few places that seems to support meeting new people right now and it has the added benefit that we have similar interests if we’re meeting there. Normally I’d say keep the hitting on people away from the gym in most cases but right now I’ve changed my views a bit based on the situation and as long as it’s done respectfully and not during my sets, I don’t mind too much, but that’s just my opinion. If I’m not feeling it on a certain day, I find it’s pretty easy to make myself look like I really don’t want to be bothered. 
 
I do make it fairly obvious I’m open to conversation if I want someone to talk to me. I’ll workout with only one earbud in, make plenty of eye contact if there’s someone I’m interested in, maybe some quick casual quips if we pass each other or are working out on machines near each other. I never initiate, I’m pretty shy, but I do try to show that I’m open to it if I get the feeling someone wants to talk to me but is hesitating. If I don’t want to talk to anyone I wear both earbuds, don’t make any eye contact with anyone, and focus completely on my workout and stay in the zone and don’t really give them a chance to say anything to me.

So yes normally I’d say it’s not too cool to hit on girls at the gym unless they’re giving out vibes that they want you to come talk to them, especially if it’s during their sets. If you feel you must, wait until they’re heading out or something, but I’d say if a girl wants to be talked to, they’ll do something to let you know they want that. As a girl I don’t ever initiate but that’s because I’m shy."
5057,Period. I literally do not have the time or the mental strength haha

They’re both pretty average looking guys, but they do have a sense of humor and good jobs. Part of it is really considering what is holding you back. If it truly is just a lack of venue to meet other single people these sites are great tools."
5061,So no one told you life was gonna be this way :(
5062,"I have a little saying that helps me curb anxiety about the future. It's something like ""things have never gone the way I've planned so any scenario I can stress about won't happen anyway"". Basically, the world is chaos, and there's so many variables you could never see. So just try and roll with it."
5063,Yeah. I’ve learned very recently not to include goals and plans that include other people. They have let me down every single time.
5064,"Most people don't have such linear paths as you would think watching a movie from the 50s. But we still do have that social expectation, yes. The issue is that we can't even fall on that dream as a default, given current economic realities. And for that reason, in many ways I feel we're like the lost generation of the interwar era- carrying immense societal burdens, and all that we've been told to aspire to is difficult to achieve, even for those of us best geared to do so. 

So don't feel disheartened if things aren't working exactly as that default ""plan"" tells you they should- it doesn't for most of us given the times we're living in, and is unrealistic to expect. But also remember that we have a fair degree of control over our own destinies and can change our life circumstances to reasonable degrees. If you really want that lifestyle, where you're living in a ranch home in the suburbs with a wife and two kids, it's doable, even if more difficult to achieve than it was for our parents. Just think long term and pragmatically about the life you want and the life you have. And also leave room for the unexpected- I've found most opportunities I've found in life that have made me what I am today I hadn't planned for. I certainly worked hard to make the planets align so they'd come my way, but nothing was as scripted as a movie."

5067,"I love this reply. That positive outlook is something that's developed over the last year or two... I've finally stopped giving a shit and I'm just looking at life going ""what do I want to do"", and then applying myself absolutely to that direction. It's terrifying, but so rewarding, and liberating. 

I think a big part of it is when you develop this sort of ""I'm in the driving seat"" mentality, where you realise that your life is somewhat in control. And I think what helps that is, paradoxically, accepting that you're not in control of almost everything. This sounds like a contradiction, bit what I mean by this is the following:  the only thing you're in control of is yourself. And I've found by accepting what happens in the world around me and just always focusing on what I do and what I am doing, I feel somewhat in control of my life, whilst avoiding the endless and futile urge to control the world around me.

Shit happens, but it's what you do when stuff goes wrong that really matters.

I'm not sure if this was really on topic but I just started ranting and I hope it'll help someone.  I'm quite passionate about this sub, because I understand what it's like to be in that position where you have no idea where your life is going. And I really don't want this sub to go sour and become a negative circlejerk downwards spiral thing.  The positive replies from people going through or coming out of this 'post college' phase are essential for the wellbeing of this subreddit"

5069,[deleted]
5070,"I recently finished [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/) and it definitely put my work/career in a better perspective. The TL;DR is that you should drop the idea that there is some ""true calling"" out there waiting for you, and just focus on developing skills that are valuable. You can eventually leverage these valuable skills for more interesting work, higher autonomy, etc.

Having said that, it does help to at least have some sort of career trajectory in mind. I'm no lawyer but I'd think that law school gives you a relatively large and diverse skill set. Maybe focus on some of these skills and really work on improving them, either in the context of  law or another related field."
5071,"Jeez sounds rough, I'm only 20 and even though I'm happy with my life right now the idea of living in this state of half-assery, never becoming passionate about something for as long as I live sorta terrifies me.

Maybe it's just that human instinct of wanting to leave your mark on the world, I always thought I was above all this petty shit but I guess I finally got knocked down from my hugh horse"
5072,"A few things to note: there is a possibility you may have ADHD, if you're not sure research some symptoms and consider getting yourself evaluated because it's definitely a possibility. after struggling in college I finally got diagnosed and it's opening up a lot of things for me in terms of treatment that will help me get better. Second thing, don't feel bad about being unproductive. We live in a capitalist world and we are all just worker drones to create value for somebody else. it's depressing, it sucks, but it's the truth and lying yourself will only make things worse. There's nothing wrong with having hobbies that are unproductive or not wanting to be productive. There's nothing wrong with wanting to play video games all day. We are human and we want to enjoy our lives, nothing more. I promise that if we lived in a world where we weren't forced to have a job we don't like in order to survive and we actually had a significant amount of free time to do anything that we wanted, you would find a lot of new hobbies some of which I have no doubt would be productive. In the end, don't feel bad and pretty much everyone else goes through what you are. I have an engineering job now and I got a degree in engineering because I thought I liked science and was good at math but it turns out that's bad way to pick your career. turns out it's also bad to try and make people choose their career and spend tons of money in school when they're young and don't know what they want to do, because more often than not you'll end up realizing it's not what you wanted which is why so many people switch majors part way through school. I didn't have that luxury but don't feel bad if you are realizing that it's not for you. take some time and spend a week or two seriously thinking about your values and what you want most, and then make a decision if being a lawyer is truly what you want. Also keep in mind that your opinion on things will change when you graduate, I had a post on this sub yesterday that got a lot of attention because after graduating I've just become a lot more aware of how bad things are in the world and it also has made me just a lot more aware of how much I don't care about my degree."
5073,"Yeah, I get what you mean, that was always my argument as well ""I don't need to be defined by my job, my happiness will come from what I do outside of it""

5076,"Yes, it's common. Don't be discouraged. My advice would be to volunteer at as many places as possible, in a variety of ways.  I had no idea what I wanted to do for the first few years of University. I just jumped from one course, to another, and changed my major almost every term. I volunteered at the International Student Center at the University. I was tutoring students in English, helping them fill out forms, helping them find the best places to go shopping, helping them with rental forms etc.  Turns out I liked teaching. It put a spark in my head. After that, I focused on a career in education. I don't think I would have found that out with volunteering."
5077,"True. You know what else is shitty? Not having enough money to do what you really want to do in life. People of always had to work to survive. It used to be hunting and gathering, then it was farming, and now we live in societies. I feel your pain because I went through the exact same thing myself, except I wasn’t even in law school. I’m just finishing up my masters degree now.At the age of 31. I’ll see it again: what you are feeling right now is not how you are going to feel 10 years from now. Money and social status might not mean anything to you now, but they will someday. Complaining about the way society is set up is not going to help you."
5078,"Perhaps we are the same way. Am I just lazy? I think I actually have part of the answer to why I am this way. 

**We blind ourselves from what might interest us, because we are overstimulated.**

We live in the time when it's easy to have fun, to forget, to get into beatiful and interesting worlds... basically, if we are fortunate enough to be born into middle-class, or higher, we have access to all this through our computer and videogames.

Playing games I've earned a certain (but most of the time useless) skillset which I use to entertain myself. Using this magic machine (PC or console), I can get into various fun situations and I don't have to learn all that much new things to get fun out of it. On top of it, there is very little fear of failure - especially in games where it's easy to reload a saved game. In large quantity of games, you don't even have to plan your progress - the game will give you options or a linear paths.

You don't get that much variety without any hardships in the real world. While you can actually get more variety in real life, everything requires you to learn something new and is most likely time consuming.

So we choose the easy way to gain a ""joy"" fix. It's the same way with porn.

All this simulated fun ain't better or more productive than achieving something in the real world, but it certainly is easier and enjoyable enough for our short-sighted brain to accept the trade-off. It's kinda easy to understand how it operates, difficult part is to control it.

Therefore jobs become just a fuel for our entertainment and bodies as we leave our parents financial umbrella.

I hate saying all this. Why? Because I realize my problem exactly, but... most of the time I don't want to fight it.

My advice; if you resonate with all this - try an experiment, cut yourself off your daily entertainment for at least... a week. Maybe two. Disconnect your cables, move your screen away from PC, delete apps like youtube and reddit from phone. Soon you will gain more interest in things that you normally wouldn't. Your brain craves stimulation and that's why this works.

But you need to tailor this according to your needs. For example find a good stress relief that works for you - since you will most likely cut yourself off from your usual coping mechanisms.

Week or two won't cure you. But you'll be forced to get interested in things you normally wouldn't."
5079,"He was being helpful...don’t shoot down people who are trying to help. Who cares about paragraph structure on reddit, if someone is seeking help they’ll take whatever they can get. Doubt OP got through half of this and then gave up because it wasn’t broken into little bits."
5080,"I mean if you do something that you won’t enjoy for 40 years just to “earn lots of money” and gain a high social status, that’d be a pretty shitty life.."
5081,"I'm also being helpful. Don't shoot down people who are trying to help.

When you say someone that seeks help will take what they can get and that they won't give up due to unbroken text, I understand. That doesn't invalidate my advice for readable text. 

It would only make it better, and doesn't take much effort."

5083,I just figured it out and I’m 27. Let me walk you through this. What are your main passions/hobbies/interests?
5084,"I took intro computer science on a whim and now I work at a software company. Do I love it? Eh. 

But I have a side passion. I like rock climbing and acrobatics. Didn’t get into this stuff until after college. 

Btw, there are a ton of jobs you can get with a law degree that don’t require more school. You don’t have to be passionate about your work so long as you find something that drives you to roll out of bed."
5085,And are you going to do something about it or is sucking it up the only way?
5086,"Well, I've always liked superheroes and superpowers in general a lot, I kinda have this thing where I'll be constantly thinking of new ideas for stories
I like watching anime and movies as well as videos on YouTube, usually about gaming or anime/cartoons
I like playing videogames, especially Pokemon and I waste a lot of time on twitter
That's it, don't feel pressured to scavenge something good from here lol"
5087,"I just think that in our one life it’s always worth taking a shot at doing what you love. You know maybe that’s getting a job at gamefreak/nintendo/Disney doing something totally different, but still being close to the thing your passionate about. 

And if you try and fail, it’s okay to keep that stuff as a hobby too. But don’t think you have zero shot of achieving your dreams just because everyone tells you to be practical. 

That was kinda rambly, but this is just something I’ve come to realize after working jobs that I’m not passionate about."
5088,[deleted]
5089,"I’m in a similar boat, though with a different major and career goals. My best advice is to volunteer places doing things that relate to your degree. Stack up your resume with volunteer experience and it shows that you want to serve your community and it shows that you have real world experience, minimal as it might be. Take on your own passion project in the fall too - work on something on your own time that you can put on your resume and present to employers that shows your skill development and self discipline. I’m not sure what that would be in marketing but I’m sure there’s something you could do that would boost your resume without a paid position. The bottom line is, if you don’t have any experience, give yourself some through volunteering and working on your own projects."
5090,"Which aspects of marketing are most interesting to you? A Marketing function at most companies contains many different sub-functions, ranging from brand management to campaign activation to consumer insights. PM if you want advice. I have an MBA with a Marketing concentration and have worked in Marketing functions across several different companies of varying sizes."
5091,"Start networking asap. If you're unsure how to go about it, read *The 2-hour Job Search.* It literally tells you how to use the linkedin search feature to find people your interested in talking, has sample emails for you to use, etc."
5092,"I was in a very similar situation. I was incredibly lazy my first 2.5  years of school then was extremely stressed my last year before graduating in December without a Job. 

 Generally, all I can say is try to keep a positive attitude as much as possible. You are going to get rejected ALOT. Don't let that stop you and learn from every rejection. 

More specifically, it seems like you are putting in some extra time via Summer school so thats a great start and having customer service (call this ""client facing"" on your resume) is also awesome. Make sure your resume and LinkedIn pages are pristine with great explanations of your professional experiences. Go to as many career fairs and meet ups as possible. Sign up for every job finding service there is (WayUp, angelList, etc.) Read books that you are interested in and can discuss in interviews. Use whatever connections you have to meeting people and learn from them. Even take some online courses to learn new schools - technology skills pair very well with marketing so if you have the aptitude, I highly recommend finding a tech skill that you think will help with your career and take an online course so you can put something official on your resume and LinkedIn. (SQL is a good place to start - solid background skill for all marketing positions)

If you work hard and build your resume/experiences you will get more interviews at better companies, and get far better/more comfortable interviewing. Myself - I finished school with a 2.9 then found a job I love in MarTech following this advice 4 months later. Maybe I just got super lucky, but in my opinion it's much easier to get lucky when you are doing all the right things behind the scenes.

Good luck I'm pulling for you"
5093,"I wouldn't worry too much about job experience as a lot of entry level or post college grad positions should teach you everything from scratch. Usually they will want to hire you based on soft skills, personality, and willingness to learn. As for finding a job, I would recommend taking that first step with an internship to at least give yourself some projects to put on a resume. But don't let that stop you from looking for full time offers as well. Apply to everything and anything that you are remotely interested in. In my experience, I sent maybe 50 applications per 1 interview back."
5094,"3.29 isn't that good of a GPA for marketing. Those accounting classes must have done a number on you! Now that I'm done being a dick, here is the real advice that you asked for. My sister is a Marketing major and she is graduating next August. She went to her school's career resource center and they basically give you a bunch of links to applications to fill out and get you in contact with recruiters. It looks really bad for a school when kids graduate and don't have a job, so they really do try and help you. The biggest thing that you can do to help yourself get a job is to sell yourself. What I mean by this is to stand out, answer any questions that a recruiter asks you in a smart way. Don't act like a nerd, act like a salesperson."
5095,"Hey Jonathan,

Our advice is to make sure your search strategy is wide enough. A mistake some graduates make is being too picky and unrealistic when it comes to positions they are targeting. Explore ALL of the job search sites: LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, CareerBuilder, Craigslist, ZipRecruiter, Google jobs, and company career pages. 

Be open-minded to starting small in entry-level roles with high growth opportunity. Given your experience is lacking, it may be tough to land more competitive roles. To give yourself an advantage, NETWORK! Use LinkedIn searches to find people working in positions or companies you're interested in and send them a message asking to connect and offer advice/referrals.

If all else fails, you can employ the help of a career advising service. We'd be happy to chat with you more about your situation. Check out [Labtuit.com](https://Labtuit.com) or send us a message at [advisors@labtuit.com](mailto:advisors@labtuit.com). Good luck!"
5096,"Use your schools career center resources! For example my school had a center for students to go to that offered free resume help and most schools have a database of companies that want to hire alumni and they should also have a jobs posting board. Start now looking and applying, don’t want until you graduate! Also look online at jobs that are management trainee positions. This is the best way to get good experience in a company not just in the marketing field but in other areas too! Typically companies that have a management trainee program really take the time to train employees and build them into good leaders by investing in them. Start with your schools resources though and your marketing department. Have your professors write letters of rec for you and honestly once you graduate GPA doesn’t matter as long as you got a Degree. And it all else fails apply at Enterprise. They have a great management trainee program and literally hire everyone 👍🏽"
5097,"GPA doesn’t matter unfortunately. My coworker has many years of customer service experience that hasn’t helped him, also unfortunately. It’s more in how you spin it and highlight your skills it seems. Rather than “this is what I have, this is what x has taught me”. My internship didn’t really teach me anything so I don’t think you’re as behind as you think. I graduated a year ago and haven’t found anything. Also looking in a similar field as well as marketing."
5098,I recruit from marketing roles and usually that 2 years experience is preferred more than it's actually required.  Have you tried getting into some entry level jobs at agencies? What about some freelance work?
5099,Where are you located? I work for a non-profit that helps college students in your situation. Hit me up in a PM if you don’t wanna share location on the post
5100,"I’m a marketing major also and I legitly didn’t do any kind of internship at all so when I got out it was hard to find any jobs towards my degree but I managed to find a job for the fire department and I enjoy what I do but my advice for you is, do digital marketing, companies like that, brush up on picture editing and how to write a blog !"
5101,What do you look for in a candidate for the position? I mean what kind of hard and soft skills?
5102,Disregard everything you’ve done in college. Then join the military and do a job there like aircraft mechanic (just an example) then have the qualification and years of experience none of your peers will have.
5103,"Totally feel like this after graduating uni. It has its perks don’t get me wrong but it’s an absolute waste. Granted I was at an arts campus, I think uni has lost its value. College kids are just getting pumped into uni these days, it’s not even hard. Essays don’t mean jack’ and most of the time it was stressing over shit that won’t even help you towards a career. Heck, lecturers just read from PowerPoints! I’ve learned more after graduating with a media degree on YouTube learning to code, and that’s pretty sad.

Basic life skills like reading a map? Managing money efficiently, heck do I even need life insurance, when does that come into play?

But heck at least I came out of uni knowing how to roll a joint and burn a pizza... 

(To be fair, uni making me broke beyond belief so I guess I know how to handle situations when I can’t afford live)."
5104,"Sounds like you ignored the stuff everybody tells students, that is, enjoy yourself now. Take advantage of the fact that you and your friend all have free time. Join some student orgs, find something you're passionate about and network with others who have similar interests. School didn't screw you over, you screwed yourself over by telling yourself that your education is just a collection of grades."
5105,"I realized what college stood for during my junior year. I think a professor in sociology said it. Academia historically provided a liberal arts education to prepare students to participate in a democratic society. Over time academia was posited as a thing that you do in order to get a job. Outside of a few disciplines this is not what academia is giving you. It gives you tools to find a job and interest but academia doesn’t equal a job. This is one reason people get disappointed in their first job in their field. They realize they aren’t using all the fun stuff they learned. You won’t unless you go back into academia to teach and research. Professors also don’t do a good job preparing students for the labor market because they went straight from undergrad into a PhD program, got a teaching position, and stayed in the ivory tower. So throughout school you get told “Just work hard and make good grades and you’ll get a job.” Then you graduate and get a rude awakening that the labor market doesn’t care about that. Companies care about what you can do for them. Networking isn’t the end all be all. I’ve had plenty of jobs that I didn’t get from networking. I didn’t have the best grades in college because I had undiagnosed ADHD. But I got a job in my discipline without having to go to graduate school. I know people that had perfect 4.0s and they’re teaching English abroad or working in retail because they can’t find a job."
5106,"That's the situation I'm in.  One of my internships wants me to come back to be a video editor, but I can't. Because I can't afford to live in Washington, D.C. AND pay my student loans on the VERY fair salary they offered me."
5107,"Yeah they do, every freshmen orientation is about telling students about campus activities and every brochure you get in the mail talks about how great the campus community is. Show me the school flyer that says ""come here, take tests, go home."""
5108,"> Schools doesn't teach you how to think

Sorry but that was kind of funny.

Dude I'm sorry you had a bad time in college, it sucks and it's super common. Life doesn't push you to get involved either, you have to do it yourself. If you think that being an adult is just ""wage slaving for 30 years"" then it's because you're still in the mindset that things cannot change and it's on the outside world to guide you towards things that interest you. Being an adult is just transitioning away from the grind of being told where to be and what to do, some people use college as a time to figure that out and others don't do it until after they leave. Others never grow out of it and just stay in jobs and relationships that they hate because the stress of going their own way in life is worse than staying in situations that they know make them unhappy."
5109,"So your idea of free time is joining/ participating in a campus activity that benefits a for profit institute?  Even the community service that university offers benefits the profit through tax right offs.  All of that campus community is BS to get you to spend more money which benefit the university not the community.  Schools drive absolutely nothing that doesn't result in there pockets getting fatter.

&#x200B;

The flyer says ""come here, give me your money, take test, go home, and become alumni where I can ask for more money""."
5110,"University isn't supposed to be an exam factory; you pay tuition fees for more than just a piece of paper! The good news though is that it isn't too late to take advantage of what you know now - depending on where you studied, you can still access your university services within a few years of graduating. Things like entrepreneurship help for people looking to start their own business, career counselling for people who are still lost, online resources & more - contact your alumni & make those tuition fees work for you!"
5111,"my dude, quit trying, /u/kingk6969 already _knows_ that the universities are out to get everyone. There's nothing you can do to convince him otherwise, he's set in his ways."
5112,"Oh, absolutely. You're in the field of freelancing, unless you can score a gig being like a digital ad person for a car dealership. Which wouldn't make the best use of your photography skills, but it's there! Lol. School photography companies, too. Product photographer. 

I've had paid photography gigs before but I realized that wasn't going to pay the bills for me. So I learned website design, and how to create logos and such, combined with my videography skills. I learned to offer a package for any company (usually small businesses) to boost their visuals and reach more audiences. Tons and tons of local small businesses still have little to none online presence or engagement with their clients! Swoop in and help them out! For money, that is. Lol"
5113,"Lots to unpack here, first off most 4 year universities are nonprofits. Second, it's ""write off"" and doing community service on behalf of an organization is not a write off for that organization, I think you're confusing it with charitable donations.  

I joined an engineering fraternity and met people who got me two internships. I regularly get emails from alumni with job postings, it was extremely beneficial for me personally. If that had some positive or negative externality for the school I don't care because I am a grown up who makes decisions not by cynically guessing at the motivations of a large abstract institution, but rather based on how they impact me personally."
5114,"In my experience, work is for developing social skills while school was for developing studying habits and work ethic.  Social skills always need improvement"
5115,Which college you went to if i may ask?
5116,"Ah man it totally sucks! I think the grind of it also is jobs advertising ‘unpaid work but great for exposure’, it’s literally for the rich kids who can afford it. Nobody ever factors in the fuel costs, equipment/ software costs, rent and everything else. Exposure doesn’t pay and it’s literally a waste. I know that’s not quite the case with what you wrote but it’s on the same level. I’ve come to the realisation that the only way I’m gonna make it work with photography is literally by grinding and working for myself (which irony, still costs). 

I wish you all the best with your work,dude, I know how rough it can be!"
5117,"Did I say it was free? Do you know how a fraternity works? We pay dues to fund our own events and cover dues to the national chapter. We don't pay anything to the university and in fact we received 3 grand per year from the school to spend on on-campus events.

Are you actually implying that career days are funded by back room bribery?

I'm not a sociopath, and college does not fuck 7/10 students. The benefits of a degree are literally quantifiable on a macro scale.

The fact that you are even calling me a sociopath is hilarious. Am I a sociopath for eating meat? Am I a sociopath for shopping at Walmart? If you think the answer is yes then you either have an extremely sensitive moral barometer or you have no idea what 'sociopath' means. It's not just interchangeable with 'selfish.'"
5118,Thank you!
5119,"That’s exactly what I’ve been doing haha! Been helping a rock band in my area out with promotion as well as their photography. It is as you say, quite surprising how many business lack in that area. I’ve learned HTML/CSS and slowly moving onto JavaScript. That’s aiding me to build sites for clients (it’s amazing how boring and non functional some sites are). You’ve hit the nail on the head with combing everything - never though about doing it as a package so maybe that’s something to look into. I’m very much a gal with a knack for all different things and that’s where I’ve been struggling. I can never just do one thing!  Granted I’m a street photography (with a few band gigs on the side) but I just can’t stoop to those school photo jobs and such, if sucks the life out of me. 

Soon going to be conveying a van to live out of and travel around Europe so my goal for now is trying to figure out how to do these sorts of things from the road remotely, it’s a tough one but it should be manageable! *fingers crossed*"
5120,"I think you meant ""Schools *don't* teach you how to think.""

For someone who thinks grades are meaningless you sure do seem to put a lot of stock into them. 

True, you don't get graded on your social life. But your social life can get you jobs. Your social life can get you fulfilling relationships. Your social life can get you a support system to help you not fall into depressive episodes. It's your fault if you chose to ignore all of that in favor of test taking."
5121,"I didn't mean necessarily a package deal, just like ""here are the services I can help you with"" sorta thing, but wow!  that sounds awesome!!! Good luck on your endeavors!!! I've very locked down to my location right now, waiting for the girlfriend to finish her bachelor's. Maybe we can get out and about the world in a few years. I wish you the best of luck!"
5122,"> I was not referring to career days I was referring to the alumni email with job posting from the same 4 companies at the top of the list every news letter.

I was referring to the alumni of my fraternity. Also I think you have the wrong idea of what kind of fraternity I'm talking about, this is a professional one for engineers, not a social one. Maybe the frat makes the school money, I don't really care, that's not why I joined.

> If you eat red meat 7 days a week, then yes you are a sociopath.

So you don't know what a sociopath is, got it. You think it means anything selfish or inconsiderate. Not sure how I'm even supposed to prove that wrong. It's like trying to say that the flu is a form of cancer.

> Since the great recession the benefits only outweigh the negative for about 3 or 4 out of 10 people.

​Can you give me literally any evidence to back this up? Or am I supposed to just take you at your word? 

[holy shit what is this?](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/education-pays.htm) A source? Actual data? Holy shit no way.

> There are at least 10 studies 

Links to none. 

The more you speak the more I'm starting to think you may have learned very little in college."
5123,"Yeah I understand you. I managed to graduate with honors from university, but it didn't exactly translate into a lot of career success. So far anyway. Now I wish I had taken it less seriously and enjoyed myself more."
5124,"Ah I get you, something to defiantly keep in mind so thank you!! Yeah my girlfriend and I are sick of the UK and just want to hit the road it should be rad!! 

All the best to you and your girlfriend too! Also if you have an editing or creative insta I’ll be happy to give you a follow :)"

5133,"Before graduating, I’ll be honest, I was pretty depressed. Just kinda stuck in that 5 1/2 year rut of work, school, work, school. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea what I was doing half the time. Working in retail. 

Now, I’m about 11 months post graduation. I’m working in a field I never expected, but is perfect for me (and fits into one of my degrees!). I’m more confident than I have been in a long time. I’m dating a wonderful man who I love very much. My anxiety and depression, while still a problem, are much better. And I’m finally moving out from my parents’ house in 3 weeks!

I think for me, the biggest difference has been my confidence. I’ve gone from completely lacking it, to rocking it most days and being a supportive partner to my boyfriend. I think finding a job that resonates with me played a big part of it. 

With the winter coming, I can feel my depression seeping back in more. But I have reasons to push through now."
5134,"I realized it was okay to not be perfect. Outside of school there is no 100% or A+s. There’s just paying your bills and being happy with yourself. And sometimes what it takes to be happy and get the bills paid isn’t doing everything at a 100%, but realizing that 50% is okay too because you gotta protect your health. Or clocking out right on time so you can make dinner with friends instead of staying late to tie up all the loose ends.  Or maybe it’s your social life that takes a hit so you can prepare for a promotion, or earn an extra commission. The point is that not everything is perfect when you leave school, and that’s really okay. It’s less about 100% and more about finding the balance you like."
5135,"100%. Not just career/major, but in college, so much of my identity was tied to which clubs I was in, who I hung out with, which jobs I had (I was an RA, for example), etc. Turns out who I am is a lot more than that!"
5136,"Fuck, I felt this one bro"
5137,i said “fuck it” and started my own company and hired myself—the moment i did i got a client who then hired me to run his non profit for a time
5138,"I think I grew tougher, I did things I never thought I could do before but things just keep getting harder. College life was a bubble with a very clear objective and challenges, adult life feels much more abstract in comparison."
5139,How’d you manage to procure experience out of thin air and rejection?
5140,Yes! Also now I like a bunch of things that I’m not particularly good at and dislike a bunch of things that I’m great at. And I don’t care at all lol.
5141,"Personally, I learned a lot about myself.

Between falling out with some of my friend group and the rest of them moving to different states, I took a step back and did a lot of thinking about the last four years and how to move forward in the same city but with a different mindset.

Professionally, I realized that the thing I went to school for wasn’t enough to make me feel satisfied in what I did so I taught myself a lot of new skills so I didn’t get too complacent."
5142,"After graduating undergrad, I feel like I became more realistic about my limits and learned more about what I wanted in an ideal life and future job. I used to aspire to be a doctor or some high stakes professional, but later realized that there’s only so much I want to be able to handle from day to day in terms of stress. I realized that it was okay to live for the simple pleasures of life and that I didn’t need a career to define me or even be “defined” by some huge greater purpose. This guided me into a field I felt was a better fit for my interests and personality, while still having a decent work-life balance."
5143,"Lucky, for me it was the complete opposite. When I was in school I was following a plan, things were laid out for me. I was actually pretty happy during college because I had accountability to other people to work on stuff and finish my degree. I guess I work well within guidelines.

Then when all that went away? Poof went my motivation. I became so lost and depressed realizing I would never have the structure of school ever again and would have to make my own structure in order to succeed. I still can’t get into the field I studied in college despite moving to the city that is best known for this type of work and have only gotten a string of minimum wage jobs just to survive off of.

I am taking classes in order to improve my skills to get something beyond minimum wage in my field but unfortunately it’s super competitive out there"
5144,"Got a job as a contractor, I've learned a ton and I like moving from company to company without hassle."
5145,"Since graduating earlier this year, I've landed an incredible job and moved to a new city. I'm gaining so much experience and work with amazing people. I feel so blessed. This is essentially my first job out of college and my first time moving somewhere new and being truly on my own. College life felt like a bubble for me, an extension of high school in a way. In just a few short weeks I feel like a completely different person with more experience and confidence than I had before. I know I have a lot to work on and *so* much more to learn, but I know I will get there. 

I never would have dreamed this would be my life just a few months ago. It's been almost a year since I've felt true happiness and I'm finally experiencing it again. Comparing where I started when I first graduated to now... the difference is already unreal. 

I'm loving my life so much now compared to college, and I feel like I've grown more in a few months than I did the entire four years I went to school."
5146,"Can you elaborate about your hobbies? Just curious! I graduated college in 2017 and since then I've expanded my interests with travel, cycling, street art, urban design, architecture, hiking, scuba diving, and hosting couchsurfers"
5147,"Managing my money is starting to become easier now that I'm working a stable FT position, and I don't have to worry about any academic financial obligations such as tuition, supplies, loans(for now), etc. When I was in school, I was working little hours and barely making enough to get by, so I was basically living check to check. But now I'm making enough to build a savings and have some extra funds to have fun every now and then."
5148,"I learned more about the ""real world"" and myself in the sense that in college, I didn't really know what I actually wanted to do once I graduated or even if I would get a job. When I graduated and started working, I got exposed to a lot more different types of jobs and people who had wildly different career paths then they had originally had or thought they would want that it really broadened my understanding of my own capabilities . Like someone else said, the real world doesn't hand out grades or 100%s but is more concerned with your output so I think I realized that maybe there were some things I thought I couldn't do in college because I had to do it very very well but that actually, I could have done because you don't have to be great and it could have set me up much better in the future. You just have to do your best. Idk."
5149,"I did student teaching in the fall after I graduated college. It whipped me into shape for the teaching world and the adult world. It taught me how to be more savage and less sorry about it. I learned more about how to conduct myself professionally with both teens and adults. It made me feel more accomplished as a person because I did a wonderful job and showed me that I can handle the teaching world. 

It really made me question how on earth teachers can work with kids or teens all day and then go home to their own kids. I know I’m not cut out for that, so I don’t want to have kids. I really enjoy the role I play in their lives as a teacher; I don’t want to play the parenting role. (But I have wished I could adopt some of my kids who have unstable or unsupportive homes). 

I still don’t see how my cooperating teacher wakes up so goddamn early every day and functions...oh wait I do. He drinks copious amounts of coffee to where he practically has to pee every five minutes. 

I am still not a morning person, but the school I work at now starts later and I don’t have to travel as far, so it’s much easier on me now.

The high school I student taught at was kinda rough, but I made it through. I still think about the kids I taught and I miss them. I just remembered that they graduated in June!"
5150,Same I started my own company

5152,"Very cool hobbies! Mine kind of went in a weird loop because though I majored in English, my last year of college and first year post-grad I was all about breaking into the personal finance world. I work as a personal banker now which I enjoy, but I can’t wait to get home and write stories or freelance articles for magazines, cook, dance, and work on my art-related Etsy business."

5157,"I’m ten months out from graduating...

I thought it’d be easier to save money and be healthy than it is, but that’s not too shocking. I’m working on it.

I love my job. I’ve learned A LOT in that realm. It’s very technical so I’ve learned a lot about my industry. I’ve also learned a fair amount about how to communicate effectively. I’m using a lot of the time management skills I learned in college.

23 but still feel 18 sometimes. Each day is an opportunity to solve a problem you’ve never had to face before. The more problems you solve, the more confident you feel. Even if you’re constantly facing problems you’ve never encountered before. That’s how I feel anyways.

AMA if ya want"
5158,"Personally, being rejected from jobs gave me confidence to date."
5159,"It’s been a year and half here. I’ve successfully landed a couple of jobs via personal connections and networking, but I wasn’t happy due to companies’ poor management, lack of support from seniors, and lack of self-awareness and self-respect to move on. On top of this I was going through a break up, living in a poor neighborhood witnessing crimes and recently had a bad mix of anxiety attack with conversion + depressive disorder. Failures and hitting rock bottom helped me to realize self-worth on my own, and with people who truly cares about me.  Realized that you won’t know what it’s like to and how to live without a framework or right answer to life, job, relationship and happiness until you’re completely out of school and feel like you’ve reached the end of things."
5160,I learned how to cook  anything. Cant guarantee the taste tho
5161,I learned that what you learned in school has little relevance in the real world.
5162,Stopped giving a fuck as to what people think
5163,"I felt that way the first couple years after college, especially because I was so focused on getting established in my career. That’s okay at first, but purpose will be in what you create whether that’s with a 9-5 or not. Creating relationships, hobbies, memories, etc. try to find ways to love yourself and create things that are bigger than your job. I’m working on that now. It’s definitely a balancing act."
5164,+1 for this. I only work so I can use that $$ to pay bills and do fun stuff.
5165,I can’t even get a job. I just feel so mentally unwell.
5166,"I honestly never took meaning from my actual job, just the pride in providing for my family and my hobbies. Only thing I can offer is learn to love working, not the actual work. There is honor in simply being able to provide and be independent."
5167,"yes, you're not defined by your work. go travel. attend events you're passionate about (for me, that would be concerts and soccer games and soccer pubs). pick up hobbies you love (such as hiking and biking for myself). meet interesting people (I've hosted lots of world travelers on Couchsurfing and met many amazing people in hostels). take over the world"
5168,"I feel the same as you. It’s to the point that I am miserable 3 seconds after I awake in the morning wondering what I’m even doing with myself and have been out of college for almost 3 years.

I’m really working to turn myself around and discover what I want out of life by just setting goals to see how I feel in pursuit and once I accomplish them. 

Don’t worry. I believe a lot of people feel the same way as us with out 9-5’s. It takes time to learn who we are on a deep level."
5169,"Make sure that you are still doing things that you still enjoy. Straight up happiness. Like other people have said, hobbies and relationships are huge. Honestly, it may take time to feel it all coming back. When I started doing things for myself, I felt either guilty or that it was fake happiness. But I think that is because I was in such a routine of work/chores/errands and other routine shit. 


Your work doesn’t have to drive your purpose. Nor does your purpose have to be profound and help humanity.  The purpose of your life, is to live your life, in a manner that brings you joy. It may not bring others joy, but that doesn’t matter. YOU need to be happy before you can truly make others happy. You cannot pour from an empty cup"
5170,"Absolutely!!! My father in law never went to college. Straight out of high school, he became a plumbing apprentice. He worked as a plumber for a commercial company, so he built the plumbing on local schools, prisons, huge buildings downtown, etc. He worked his way up to foreman and was a supervisor by the time he finished and retired a couple of years ago. 

If you ever ask him if he was passionate about his job, he wouldn't hesitate to say NO. 

He didn't live to work. He worked to live. 

He lived a job that was just okay, with a good pay and benefits, that took care of him and his family, but his life was way outside of that realm. 

He's a competitive bass fisherman who travels all over the country fishing and competing in amazing tournaments. He was fishing in Mexico last month. 

Sometimes, we have to work and just make money to live and that's that. But then our passions lie elsewhere. We follow new passions and ideas and pursuits outside of our paid career. 

If passion and career align, that's awesome. But it doesn't have to in order for us to be fulfilled and totally happy. You absolutely can find fulfillment and purpose outside of your job."

5172,"Your life shouldnt be based on your career. I only work to fund my hobbies/needs. After I work, I stop thinking about it. I dont check work emails. Try to find hobbies that you can do and have fun. Recently my GF and I have been into aquarium, fishing and now biking."

5175,A decent chunk of people find purpose in family. Either helping people in your own family or building your own can be an extremely challenging yet rewarding endeavor. Take a look there and see if you can find some purpose beyond yourself.
5176,"I'm a veterinarian. Yes.

I got had to quit my job for mental health issues 3 years out of school. I have PTSD from childhood abuse, but constant drain of being on call, working 10-14 hour days, and emotionally draining patients really exacerbated it. 

I realized throwing myself into my work at the cost of all else is extremely unhealthy. Straight out of high school I literally would school/work/sleep. The past 10 years of my life have sort of been a haze, I don't really remember making any substantial memories.  I've put myself into my hobbies more, and suddenly I'm a lot happier. Previously I wanted to pursue boarding in a specialty (another 5-8 years of school at minimum wage with 200k of debt :) ) and I decided that's not what makes me happy.

I want to raise lizards and do art. Probably eventually going to get a house in the country and be happy doing my own thing. ""Purposes"" don't matter."

5185,Sure.
5186,Did you know you can do whatever you want in this life?
5187,"I graduated last year and I’ve also completely lost interest in the field I studied in. I do kinda blame it on pandemic and burnout. But to be honest, just do what you wanna do. As long as you’re happy and the bills are paid, who cares?"
5188,"Hey! Reading this made me feel a kind of better about life. Same story as you, graduated with honors + two majors, studied abroad, had an activity social life, and 3 internships. 

I don’t feel turned off by my career field per say, however, I’m starting to realize the day to day job is becoming more mundane and I’m getting more stressed out than I should be. I don’t mind my job, but I guess I’m somewhat depressed that this is life now and can see myself getting burnt out (as I’ve noticed with some of my co-workers). I miss college and how balanced things felt and how accessible everything was. I also set high expectations for myself, and if I don’t achieve them I get stressed out. 

I also want to move to a new city, but being far from home and the people I love gives me a lot of anxiety. I also have been to a therapist before, and I have lofty plans for my career path and where I want to go, and if I don’t follow the timeline I have set for myself, I know I won’t be happy. 

We sound very similar. Know you’re not alone."
5189,"Consider the PTSD involved with an extraordinarily stressful uni life of artificial deadlines for artificial products which may be semi- to completely-unrelated to anything you’ll ever be asked to do again (unless you become a teacher or professor—then YOU will be imposing said on others)

Please consider the time involved and understand you may need to just chill for a bit just to recover. Somewhat unrelated example: a woman carries a baby for NINE months and I’ve read it takes  TWO years to recover physically, including hormone levels. 

You just gave birth to a diploma. It’s taken a toll. 

Also, I’ve found the actual day-to-day job is almost entirely unlike what I studied and how I studied it. 

Relax, try it out, see what you think! You can always go back to school if you truly hate it! Lololol 🌺"
5190,"I totally feel you, I graduated last year and it’s been rough. Not sure if you’re also an American and experiencing recent post grad life and this quarantine all at once, but lemme just say to you what I should say to myself: in school, there is a clear goal. Homework, assignments, tests, etc, there is a clear measurement of progress and success. After school, there is no clear way to measure ur progress, or at least not as defined as how school does it. Also, school gives you a structure, the world doesn’t, so it’s understandable that you feel unmotivated since there’s no clear thing to go for right now. One thing that I think might help is that you’ll be okay. There is so much life ahead of us and we have no idea where it’ll take us. Give yourself time to enjoy the small things in life without something like school or your career taking center stage. You don’t have to be pursuing something bigger and better every second of every day. Working on yourself doesn’t just mean improving your ability to function in a capitalistic society that deems your worth on your productivity. Take your time and don’t be too harsh on yourself friend! :)"
5191,"Yea so here’s what might be happening and what to do about it. 

College was a structured thing. They told you where to be and when. They told you precisely how to get a good grade. So the “train tracks” were there already and all you needed to do was to run the engine super fast (ie. Study) and you knew that there as a direct correlation between your effort and class grade. You knew that even you hit the gas, put in more coal, throw in extra electricity... whatever, you could run faster on these train tracks with the engine you got-things were KNOWN and a path to progress was KNOWN. 

Now, you’ve just come off of the train tracks. You have no idea where you are, if there are train tracks, where to apply force, how to create your own tracks. You can’t see where to apply pressure to get an output. Because no one is there with a step be step instruction of how to get a career job and get career money; and not just any random amount of money that any one without a degree could have gotten. So, your mind has an expectation of where you should be... after all, you have had great grades and have done internships... that has to count for something.

The truth is, you’re not on the ground anymore, you’re in the ocean and your wheels don’t do much here. So, first, you need to build a boat and then you gotta learn to row that thing. You have to build your own systems. Your employer will create expectations for you but you gotta get their first. 

So, how are you suppose to start, what’s the right move, what if you make the wrong choice, everyone will think you’re a loser, and you’re suppose to be successful... people are expecting a lot. You’re suppose to marry someone soon, or support someone you’re with. There are real expectations now. “Grades” are like “mother’s milk” - and you’re finally an adult about to have problems that are ADULT AF. For instance, if you didn’t study, you’d fail a class... ok but you could retake it... but if you completely failed in your career, you’re entire LIFE may unfold way way differently than what you imagine. 

The pressure of all this has caused you paralysis. What seems like non-interest in things is really just fear. You’re in the ocean and all you know how to do is put more coal in. 

You need to build yourself up. You need to define who you are. Your school experiences will help but not as much as you had hoped.

So HOW?! ok, luckily, the answer to this is actually too simple, which is why it’s confusing. The career you studied for IS NOT THE ONLY CAREER CHOICE. I know you feel like you should already have had decided everything and that you’re late and you are falling behind, I promise you that you are a baby in the world when it comes to careers. 15 years from now, you might be answering a question like this and in the middle of your career. 

What you need to do here is a GaryVee type approach. Since you don’t know what to do. You need to start multiple threads - meaning get really uncomfortable like it’s finals week and start forcing yourself to look for work from 9-5 each day, take weekends off. Just like work. You need to target a specific field for now. Doesn’t matter which-just go with something that interests you a bit. Go hard, talk to as many recruiters as possible. Look at job descriptions online (at least 10-20) in one specific job title (niche as far down as possible into a single job title) and start creating a resume which addresses those job descriptions. 

Once you have an industry> specific job geared resume, then you are ready to start looking for the job. 

Here’s the procedure: Find a job req online and rewrite portions of your resume to March that req. save this resume with the date and title of the req in the name. REPEAT this process each time you find a job req. don’t just submit the same resume to all jobs. Do at least 5-10 per day. 

BEST WAY YO SUBMIT: go through hiring agents. Don’t waste time on submission on website too much. Go find people on Linked in who are recruiters with openings - talk to them directly and submit your resume. Don’t just submit resumes. Best is a phone convo (I know that’s difficult, but that intimidation goes away after a while). 

Once you have a job, do the job for a year and see if you like it. If you don’t, repeat the steps above for another career/field. Note that the more you switch, the further you delay your rise in that career. So, be careful with your choices.

If you do this right, in the next few years, you would have tasted a few different careers. And you can decide which one you like at that point and go ham on that career and learn it all. 

TLDR: You are in a real life MMORPG and this is your character selection screen. Choose wisely, but note that each stat takes time to earn and you might have to try different builds to finally settle on the character class you realllllyyy like. There is NO WAY to know until you ACTUSLLY start and attempt to build that character. 


Good luck


Ps. I graduated with math, CS, and an MBA degrees and found myself lost until I figured this application procedure out. Now I’m a millionaire bcuz I didn’t give up and I started making good money and invested it well (well enough). I’m 14 years post graduate now. I run a [YouTube channel](http://CrushTheWealthGap.com) to try to help others do this and other kinds stuff in life"
5192,Wow this made me feel so much better. Recently I’ve been obsessed with becoming a flight attendant lmao.
5193,"Graduated in engineering a year ago and was in the same boat for a while. I literally wanted nothing to do with anything science-related since it had been my entire life for 4.5 years. I was completely mentally spent. Engineering/building stuff in general was always one if my main outlets for executing my ideas. And for like 8 months, I had no interest in it at all.

Now, I've noticed my original enjoyment for what I studied is starting to return. 

I'm not saying it's going to take 8 months, but just give yourself time to decompress."
5194,It was a plumber for me haha
5195,"I feel very similar. I thrived in college and ever since I graduated in May, it’s been a steady crash and burn for my overall life. I was feeling pretty depressed for a number of months and I’m just now slowly crawling out of that spiral. My post-college career plans feel derailed for the time being because I live in a rural area that lacks the jobs I’m really looking for, and ultimately I don’t have enough money saved to move for a prospective job anyways. So it kind of feels like I’m starting at square one right now- just trying to secure any job so I can make money so I can save up so I can eventually pursue opportunities to move for work in my preferred job field... it’s rough and I’m trying my best to not feel too down about not being “on track” right now, but that’s easier said than done honestly."
5196,"I'm in the exact same situation. I also graduated early and pretty soon I'll basically have spent all the time I ""saved"" doing nothing but sit at home and ""look"" for a job."
5197,I feel like this right now... thank you for making this post. I know I'm commenting on it super late but it brought tears to my eyes because you just put it into words perfectly. I just wanna work retail for the rest of my life even though I have a degree and diploma and interned at a major record label. I dont wanna do this for like 42 more years
5198,After college I fell into a year long bed ridden depression. Your not alone
5199,hey man im 25 and graduating in 2 months with my bachelors. i wanted to comment so bad and got giddy becaause im going through the same thing but not quite the same. i did really well iin college but my gpa went down because i had no motivation to learn anymore. i went from a 3.5-3.1 (i also go to a reall tough school)  i hated college and i regret doing what i did i got into grad school. All i did in college was smoke weed and study and go to school clubs and go to work. so listen my best advice to you is to go out and explore the world! go into the workforce and move to another state. i dont know your situation but totally do it! move to a new place where you dont know anyone. its also ok that you might have some tough times and eat shit when you live on your own with bills work and stress and what not. im an open book so you are more than welcome to message me.
5200,Depression and anxiety attacks me sometimes and I just feel like nothing at all.
5201,"I am doing much better now. I got my first job about a month after I posted this, changed jobs in January and now have what I would define as my dream job. I moved back to the city I went to college in, reconnected with old friends, made lots of new friends, started volunteering. Still working on my mental health but I am leaps and bounds from where I was when I wrote this post. There is hope. This post was written in one of the darkest times in my life and the person I was then would be proud of how far I have come."
5202,"OP, I know it’s been a year but can you give us an update?"
5203,This is really good advice thank you
5204,"What did you do for those 8 months? I am in the same situation, I tried taking time before starting work, to travel and just relax, but I still feel burned out after 6 months. I started the job recently and relocated to another country and I just want to quit and sleep all day."
5205,"I’m really happy to hear this, and I totally am glad you got a chance to respond because I was looking up “severe burnout after graduation” on Google and your post was the first to pop up.

I deeply related to your post, all I’ve wanted to do for months is lay on the sofa and zone out. Nothing is interesting, I probably started drinking a bit too much, as well. 

With COVID and everything that happened, I just lost all care about anything I’ve even studied for and my loss of ambition skyrocketed. 

I’m a much older graduate than most traditional students, but I worked while going to school and I just lost all excitement about everything and am brain dead"
5206,This was really wise advice
5207,"So glad to see this post because I’m graduating with two college degrees. And I feel numb, burnt out, no motivation even in my marriage. Thank you for sharing."
5208,"I didn't graduate with honors or anything, but it took me along time to finishing my degree, because I was putting myself through school so I was constantly taking two courses or more and working 50+ hours, and now I don't really have to that anymore. I feel like I'm able to catch up with my feelings a little bit, but not in a great way. I want to celebrate, but I just feel burnout, and so tired."
5209,"I was burned out as soon as COVID hit. One semester of my MSW under my belt, thinking that I was finally doing something that I was really passionate about. Then the entire world turned upside down and while my classmates habituated, I did not. I was pretty much in a trauma response for two years without recognizing it. Then burnout happened when I couldn't perform well in my classes or internship... because fucking look outside! How are any of us doing anything?! This led to a very stark realization that my mental health was very far from okay.

Being the people pleaser I am: I refused to drop out, kept saying I could get things done that I definitely could not, each semester ended with a grueling scramble to not fail. What was supposed to take two years ended up taking three. I got all dressed up, walked across that stage a year late for graduation, grabbed the fake diploma and walked straight out of that building. I barely kept the cap and gown on long enough for my partner to take a picture.

I had to work full-time through it all and when it was finally over, I wanted to be as far away from social work as I could. The thing is, despite barely remembering my education, it was all still there--engrained in me.

Now it's been about six months and I'm burned out in the other direction. I have a degree in social work and I'm watching the administration at my hourly job run the business into the ground. I have so many ideas for how to improve it, yet here I am: a low level employee offering suggestions and volunteering my time to research new models. Fuck that.

I have digressed so far from what I intended to say. **The point is**, I am blown away that career readiness is not intimately engrained in every degree program. I know a LOT about macro social work, but I have no idea how to get my foot in the door. Rigorous academic expectations coupled with the perpetually increasing cost of higher education hell makes it really difficult to even want to knock on a door, let alone stick my foot in it. It's really frustrating. 

My plan now is to quit my job, run for a board position (voluntary but I'm doing it out of spite so its fine), and start advocating for changes that actually align with the ""core values"" of the business. And if I end up not doing that, that's cool. I need to recuperate from a lifetime of burnout for a couple of weeks anyway.

Thanks for your post, it really helped me process this stuff more completely. Not sure where you are now, but I hope its far improved from the burnout you were experiencing at the time of this post. Godspeed."
5210,"this is the best thing I’ve read, a year later i’m reading this and it still applies, thank you so much"
5211,"We do sound very similar! Setting extremely high expectations for myself and beating myself up when I can't reach them is something I'm trying to work on as well. I'm sorry you feel your day to day work is mundane, that's something I really fear right now as well. I hope things go well for you! DM me if you ever want to talk!"
5212,This is an old post but are you me? I am stuck is the sane annoying situation. It feels  like I am stuck running in place. No prospects but can’t leave. I been applying for online jobs but my location is so far removed I can’t get decent enough wifi. My only option is to save and move. But it is such a slow burning process. I hate it so much. ;/
5213,Thank you 🌼🌸
5214,What did you study in and how is therapy not helping?
5215,"Although it doesn’t hurt to go out for a stroll around your neighborhood looking for some sweet furniture pieces being tossed. I live rent controlled in a very nice part of the city and these rich people around here will throw out the nicest furniture. I legit got a free full length mirror, I damaged, that matches my current furniture for free when I was out walking. I snatched that shit right up."
5216,"Moving into a new apartment next week, planning to hit up a lot of secondhand stores. Also preparing myself to live in a mostly empty apartment til the first paycheck rolls in. We'll see if this works haha"
5217,"Cookware! That stuff will save you money and if you can care for it will save you money over time. Also cooking in general is probably the best way to save money. Become good at cooking 3 or 4 proteins. The other side to this is how much it will save you on dates. 

Assuming it will be a one bedroom apartment buy a couch with a bunk  in it. Even if you have the second bedroom these couches let you accommodate more people if you want. This means extra sheets or a sleeping bag on hand too. 

Ice trays are really great! One for ice, and second for sauces you can freeze and use in a pinch. 

A chefs knife... it is all you need. Ideally you have a few more kvives but if you don't believe read Kitchen Confidential 

Sorry most of these are cooking related but I cant do much better at the moment"
5218,Following your ikea trip - check your local Craigslist for the same/similar products. That and the As-is section is amazing.
5219,"to piggyback regarding furnishing, dont buy expensive FOR your apartment unless your industry/career is has a fairly flat pay increase and high retention rate. since joining the job market 8 years ago my salary has increased 80% and i've held 5 jobs. Ikea, and surprisingly Target are your friend.


definitely go slow, buy your basic couch, tv and table and then spend a while contemplating what else you may want, dont feel an obligation to fill the room quickly."
5220,"If your parents have a Costco membership? That was my best 21st bday present ever. It was seriously like 2 years of TP/paper towels/napkins, and a month or two of less perishable stuff. 

Aside from that it was hand me down furniture that I still have tbh. It’s old and beat up but it works."
5221,"Second a chef knife. I love cooking so a good knife is important to me, your first chef knife you definitely don’t need to go all out like I did but I bought a 40$ Victorinox chef knife and pretty sure that was the best 40$ I’ve ever spent of kitchen supplies, it handles so well and sharpens so nicely. If you get more into cooking I would highly recommend one, it’s such good quality and it’s pretty much the only knife I use except for peeling stuff."
5222,"Also if you download an app like nextdoor people will be giving stuff away for free or low price all the time. Moving sales, etc. I live outside of downtown Boston and see so many full pianos being given away for free — makes me wish I had space for me and my multiple pianos. 

Be sure to check curbs around the end and beginning of months. This is when people are moving out of rented apartments. Earlier this month someone dumped a matching IKEA bed frame, drawers, cabinets, a motorized scooter, a working printer, and a small bookshelf behind our apartment. Soon enough everyone was stopping by to check out the free goods. I walked off with two like-new shelves. 

If you don’t live in a city, I recommend driving around at the end of the month near places were young people who move a lot would live."
5223,"I second IKEA. It’s the holy grail of people tired of beat up free furniture who are just starting out. You can also find good second hand ikea furniture for free in moving clearouts. 

Also, like comment OP said, it’s great for picturing the look you want. I love those showrooms."
5224,Check out Marshall's for decent cookware for cheap. Also you can usually snag some decent furniture too.
5225,"My best tip is to buy things slowly over the year you have so the cost is less overwhelming when you are going through an already stressful move. You don’t need to buy big stuff — just a pot or pan, towels, a lamp — something you can store in a closet until you moved out. This really helped me when I finally moved into my apartment and stored most of the stuff in my parents’ garage until I moved. It also helps pump you up and get you excited about your new place, too."
5226,"The comments aren’t loading so I hope I’m not repeating anything.  But Facebook Marketplace is your friend.  I find everything for cheap there.  Additionally, there may be Facebook groups for your city which are for exchanges.  Here is a list of options for furniture:

Mattress
Bed-frame
Oven/stove
Table 
Chairs
Desk (optional)
Desk chair (optional) 
Closet 
Couch
Coffee table
TV
Bedside dresser
Bookshelf


Not everything is necessary.  I myself don’t have a dining table or chairs, or a desk.  Generally, it’s easy to find cheap secondhand furniture, it’s just hard to get it all to the apartment.  Having a car goes a long way.  Good luck!"
5227,"I also recommend putting TRASH BAGS, cash, paper plates, plastic forks, a cup, paper towels, and (if you drink) a couple beers in your first day box. No one wants to cook after a long day of moving in so ordering pizza is usually a good first meal. Also knowing I had a cold beer in the fridge waiting for me once everything was out of the truck was a nice motivator. 

I also have a separate box that goes with the first day box with cleaning supplies. Technically the apartment should be clean when you get there, but it’s usually a good idea to do everything a good wipe down 

Be sure if you find furniture on the street to wipe it down and CHECK FOR BED BUGS OR SPIDERS before you bring it in. Street stuff is a viable option, but it’s important to consider Why it’s being thrown away. 

Craigslist and FB marketplace are great for getting 2nd hand stuff. You’ll def need a truck or van tho, most of the stuff on there is pick up only. And don’t give anyone money until you hve a chance to look at, try out any furniture. You’re always allowed to back out if it’s not up to standards.  

I’d also recommend not skimping when it comes to a couch. Big and comfy couches are the hardest to move, but I got a cheap gold out couch for my last apartment and it gave me constant back and tailbone issues for a full year."
5228,"Check out r/cookingforbeginners and r/EatCheapAndHealthy. r/MealPrepSunday and r/budgetfood may be useful too. 

For your future apartment, you could also check out r/adulting, r/aptliving, r/malelivingspace, or r/femalelivingspace. I'm sure those subs have dealt with these kinds of questions before as well so if you search them, they may give you additional info."
5229,I appreciate any cooking advice! I have no cooking experience at the moment so... I need some serious assistance.
5230,"Second hand stores, thrift shops, consignment stores, lookout for garage sales, Facebook marketplace. That’s all I can think of right now"
5231,"Microwave!! 

If your place doesn’t come with one and you have the money after moving for it, I really recommend buying a microwave first. I lived without one for 7 months, one of those when I moved into a new apartment and had nothing set up, and it was rough. Can’t heat up food on the stove when you’ve got no pans. Same with the oven. A microwave is your best friend. It will keep you sane as you settle into your new place."
5232,Have one piece of furniture that you absolutely LOVE (even if it’s a little more expensive). For me it’s my vanity. I use it every day to do my hair and makeup. It’s probably my favorite item in my apartment and just that fact makes my space feel more like it’s *mine*.
5233,"IKEA as is section. Hit up thrift stores. Also, if you are near a college town they have moving day and kids throw out all kinds of good furnitures. It’s usually at the end f a lease year. Like August."
5234,"Garage sales, thrift stores and Facebook marketplace. Don’t buy anything new, buy as much as you can secondhand or get at a reduced cost. Take care of the things you get as fast as you can so that they last as long as they can. When you get more money buy better things."
5235,"For pots and pans, go for a cast iron skillet and cast iron pot/Dutch oven. Spent 5 years in college cooking a majority of my meals with both the skillet and dutch oven. Cast iron can literally last you a life time as long as you take care of it, which isn’t a major hassle."
5236,"Moved out for the first time 2 yrs ago! IKEA is the best! My entire apartment is basically furnished by IKEA. You can find quality furniture that will last a while for a cheaper price. You just have to be able to build everything for yourself. I get a lot of compliments on how nice my apartment looks as well. It’s all IKEA!  And just like others said, walking around IKEA gives you a lot of great ideas as well, and it’s fun."
5237,"Used furniture is a lot less expensive than new, so see if your area has any good local shops"
5238,"Invest in a GREAT MATTRESS above all else. It might hurt at first (I think mine was like $600+ for a Queen) but has literally been the best thing I have and will last a long while.

Outside of that I’ve gone about furnishing my home as where I’ll spend the most amount of time and go from there. I have a 2 bed to myself so I have a little more wiggle room then those with roommates in terms of decorating and overall value of furniture."
5239,"On knives, those chef knives with self-sharpening sheaths will save you the hassle of getting them sharpened. My old cook housemate bought a real nice one but when I moved into a new apartment I found a cheap one at big lots that’s not as fancy but just as nice."
5240,"read kitchen confidential. 

r/askculinary is a friend"
5241,Amen!
5242,How old are you? That's pretty cool! I think I'll move out right around the time I turn 22.
5243,Tbh I get a lot of my stuff from Facebook marketplace. If you keep your finger on it you can get amazing deals for things when people are moving or just downsizing
5244,"Get thrifty and don't turn your nose up at stuff you find on the street. Eventually you will find your own unique style, made up of a handful of thrifted stuff, some street rejects, and new items from the store. 

But you gotta get there first, and it doesn't happen overnight."
5245,"I feel you,  as for the active thing I work a physically somewhat demanding job and am standing/walking all day so when I get home i dont want to leave because I am an introvert and have spent many hours away from home and now I want to only be home."
5246,"Thank you, you’ve given me some hope as a recent graduate in these uncertain times. Happy to hear everything worked out well for you!"
5247,"Thank you for sharing. I just graduated, and ended up taking a summer class to delay the anxiety of finding a job."
5248,"Positive affirmations work for people that know they are capable. To those who have low-self esteem they seem like a mantra of lies, making them feel bad."
5249,I went through this timeline almost identically. If anyone is reading this comment know that you aren’t alone. Multiple people experienced this and I’m sure thousands of others do as well. Always feel free to reach out to me and one day you’ll look back at this as a fond memory and not a nightmare like it seems at times.
5250,Nope!
5251,I am going in college this fall and this is the most I fear about. Thanks for sharing this. Needed to hear it!!
5252,"That may be true, but there are positive affirmations that can build your confidence or self esteem too. I mean I didn’t believe or thank too much of the positive affirmations until a lot later."
5253,"Out of curiosity, are you at a big 4?"
5254,"I actually enjoy my job as well... Not so much the people, but I can honestly say I love what i do."
5255,I’m in the same boat and can’t tell if it’s just because I’ve only taken entry level positions or not.
5256,I'm an electrician apprentice
5257,"I’m a millennial and I love my job; we exist. Here is the secret: you have to be willing to relocate. I’ve been working in this field for about 6 years and have switched companies 3 times. I sell it on my resume as highly diversified experience and it works. As long as you don’t drop anchor, you CAN find a job you love."
5258,"OP, find a career that makes you happy. Don't settle for less until you find a position or career that will give you the minimum stress. Perhaps its the environment or company you may be working?"
5259,"People who are content with their jobs aren't complaining online about ""Oh I hate my job"" ""Life sucks""."
5260,"> OP, find a career that makes you happy

That sounds like a good way to be broke and miserable. Find hobbies that make you happy, and a well paying career that you don’t completely hate. Spending your life trying to find happiness through work sounds like a recipie for perpetual disappointment."
5261,"I don’t mind my job. I enjoy the bits of programming and deep diving that I get to do. It’s chaotic and messy and often rewarding. But it’s not a passion. I do it for the money.

edit: removed some financial figures because I thought this was another sub"
5262,"In a word: guile. I went to school for psychology. This field requires a degree in finance and usually a series 3 or 30 broker certification. I have none of those qualifications. I was pretty much able to talk my way into it. The whole process taught me the value of being able to sell yourself. If you are interested in something, and can relate to it with passion, in certain situations, that is more valuable than a degree. Not having any education in finance or markets hasn’t held me back at all, since all the information to learn everything is out there and I’m the kind of person who seeks mentors and clings to people smarter than me for help and guidance."
5263,What do u do?
5264,I work in agriculture as a commodities trader. Buying and selling of grain and trading futures.
5265,"Work might not always be fun and can certainly be stressful, but being able to find enjoyment in your work is extremely important to me. If I don't enjoy it, I am not going to do good work, and I am going to feel shitty. My advice would be to find enjoyment in what you do, or find a job in which you can."
5266,How did you break into this field?
5267,It's tough as a first year but most of the workload depends on what your company specialises in
5268,"I mean I kinda hate my job and it's literally only helping people at its core (addictions therapist) . I was and am passionate about my field but the day to day grind sucks the life out of everyone I feel like. 

There's no one job that's JUST the thing we like- theres always another 80% of crap we have to do. For example, if I could just do therapy sessions and run groups I would love my job. But that's maybe 30-40% of my job. The rest is paperwork, emailing, going to court, documenting, staffing, working on grant funding, more note and insurance paperwork, and dealing with coworkers. 

I feel like no job is ever one thing so we get saddled with extra things no one wants to do but has to be done. Idk if this makes sense. I'm burnt out from work lol"
5269,Certainly the minority
5270,"Different perspective here- I'm one of those nonprofit folks who loves my job, but I have plenty of friends who don't love what they do but make plenty of good money. They buy nice things and take vacations, and they just work to make their money. It doesn't seem like a terrible plan, as a nonprofit person who loves what I do but makes far less money than my peers. Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy you things and experiences, and sometimes those things make people happy."
5271,"Ask yourself, what are the reasons why you dread your job, do you hate the commute, terrible bosses, coworkers, hostile enviornment, being at a computer for 8 hours. I don't think everyone hates their job, the ones that do hate their jobs are very vocal about it, and the ones who love their jobs aren't as vocal about it, the reason why you hear and see everyone say that ""They hate their jobs, life"" is that people are more likely to share bad experiences such as ""I hate school"" ""I hate work"", ""I hate my marriage, wife, and being parents"" or ""I hate living at home"", nobody says ""I love my job, my life"" because negative people will crap on you. Are the people in your life positive about their life, you just need to find positive people? If you hate your job, you can always quit, as long as you don't have any debt, have money saved up etc and can cut back on your finances, ""You can make money but not time"""
5272,"People who enjoy their jobs don't post about their job, so it's an echo chamber."
5273,"dude this has no comments on it for some reason. I just gotta say, nice writing"
5274,"Agree with this. 

Maybe the thing to say is “find a career that’s in demand, so you can work where you’re respected or find a different workplace”


I spent a year in art school following my passions, then realized I was miserable and was going to have to work super hard to just not be broke. 

So I went into engineering instead."

5276,"I love my job, sounds like you just need to keep searching"
5277,"I mean you basically touch upon the two real variables: job satisfaction and income.  Both variables exist on a spectrum.  Ideally, you can land a career on the high end of the spectrum for both - both satisfying and pays well - and some people do achieve this! 

I'm of the opinion that there exists a path to achieving this for virtually every person, though some will surely face far more obstacles than others.  I'm also of the opinion that it is totally normal and okay to have to choose between one variable or the other for a long time in life.  You may very well have to face the choice you posit: do you focus on finding a super satisfying job that pays poorly, or a very unsatisfying job that pays well?  Job satisfaction OR money?  

If you truly are not finding any possibility for high job satisfaction currently, then I'm inclined to agree with your assessment and say go just work for the income.  Then pursue the things that make you happy on the side as hobbies.  I always cite the fact that for literal millennia, all of our ancestors worked merely to *survive*.  That's all you really have to do as well.  The whole concept of being able to pursue a ""satisfying"" or ""fulfilling"" career is a very modern luxury we are afforded.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with work being...work.  

If the reason you can't find job satisfaction currently is because you have no idea what that even looks like or what you'd genuinely enjoy doing for a career, then you're simply going to have to do some soul searching to discover what might ignite that spark in the future.  It can be a long path and even tougher than earning money sometimes, but you'll get there!"
5278,"Mike Rowe has a lot to say about work that I really like. There are sewage cleaners happier than 80% of the people that post here. You gotta learn to love work not necessarily the job itself, eventually even painters and writers get sick of what they do from time to time."
5279,"No.

Because everyone doesn't hate their job. 

The premise is fucking bullshit. How do I know? Look around! Plenty of people love their jobs.

But do most people dislike their jobs? Probably. ***Hate*** it? Probably not.

So you should start thinking from: 'Most people dislike their jobs. What should a person in that situation do?' 
I'm not sure this premise is right, either, but I'm sure that it is righter than the current one. The problem with mine is that I'm assuming office drones are the majority.

5284,I have learned the hard way to let people go when i find either I don't like them after conversations or I don't like me. The latter one is far more toxic to my spirit.

there were a few friendships that i have been trying to encourage communication from the other side or hangout but still got tired of starting. I don't want to be the one talking all the time, but I don't get much response back asking if there's anything new or other things :/

I have had a phase, still do sometimes, that I google reddit results for friendship problems that seems to be common with a lot of people. it's like people just want to shove you in the past i guess. I'll learn to move on

worse/weird part is i work two jobs and I still make time to talk or check up on people during lunch break even if it's sending a text"
5287,"I've come to accept that people are just more worried about themselves most of the time and learned to live with that. We have fun and shit, but I don't expect them to care anything much about me. We know who each of us are, we say hi when we see each other, we hang out if either of us bothered to reach out, but that's it. Anything more than this is just extra.

Gosh, it's been so long since anyone apart from parents did care that I don't know how to answer properly when someone asks how I was doing."

5290,"Yeah, I understand that people go through stuff that they're not willing to share with old friends. I was a little sad cuz I wanted to check on my friends once in a while (which is like once every three months). Some don't reply or put in very little effort. 

I'm slowly getting used to it though. It'd be nice if everyone cares more or at least know that they could still share stuff with old friends and we'll be here to give moral support."

5301,"I haven't been able to. When I'm done doing the things I *need* to do I settle into just one of the things I like to do and just spend all my time doing that. Usually that's internet and video games, and the other stuff I like, including things that might benefit me, like reading and exercise, get pushed to the wayside. 

70% school/work and 30% electronics is no way to live your life."
5302,"A lot of people mentioned prioritizing and that’s a great start. Another method is to combine some activities. 

Grab a friend to run errands with. Listen to audiobooks while on your way to school or work or while you’re cleaning your house. Make a board game or TV show/Netflix night with friends. 

It’s also important to learn what I did (albeit the hard way); you’re only human and there are only so many hours in a day. Don’t beat yourself up for not doing everything you had or wanted to do; tomorrow is another day."

5304,"Totally agree with @[ariesangel0329](https://www.reddit.com/user/ariesangel0329/), I'm at my last weeks as a uni-student and commute work couple of times a week. I try to study for an exam omw to work so I can spend more time with my bf when I finally get home, if I don't have any exams- I listen to podcasts so I can learn something new, or read a book.

I'm living abroad so when I do grocery shopping or do my errands I talk with a friend on the phone (and I ALWAYS ALWAYS call my family when I do the dishes lol)

I think we all have small slots of time in our day that we can fit in there lots of stuff, in a way it makes you feel more accomplished and also gives you the time and the freedom to do other things."
5305,"Don’t let entertainment become a chore. 

Seriously, watching a show cause someone you trust recommended it or the commercial look good is fine, but don’t let it become another thing to check off your to do list.

But if you are concerned about keeping up then multitask. I usually stream while I cook or listen to podcasts on my drive to work. I’ve been doing a ton of drafting recently and it’s gotten me through like three tv shows in the past month because I need something on in the background. My friend and I who are super busy have study sessions, where we get to hang out and be together while also getting homework done."

5310,"I've made it a priority to remind myself that the things I want to do aren't things that I must do immediately. The books I want to read, shows I want to watch, etc. aren't going anywhere and neither am I. Once I've done everything I need to do in my life and I find some downtime then I can enjoy them. If you do have constant fear of death for seemingly no reason, I strongly recommend you seek psychiatric help- I had those feelings when I was overwhelmed in the past and they were very difficult for me to shake."
5311,"Remind yourself that you are not expected to be perfect at everything. If you expect yourself to do everything then that’s unrealistic. Choose your destiny wisely. It’s going to be bittersweet. We will always wish to participate in everything we can imaginable, however, that’s only possible if we don’t have priorities to fulfill. On the the bright side, if you plan accordingly, like weeks ahead, then opportunities for those beautiful and fun activities should happen. That’s what, I think, having a mature outlook on life is all about. You really gotta plan for things, and let the chips fall where they may. You can’t expected too much out of life, however, you can prepare for it. Everyone has a different destiny. So don’t model yours after anyone else’s. Good luck! And don’t put so much pressure on yourself."

5316,"I’m a CPA (Tier 2 firm, Audit) 

Use this time to pass your exams! Was your first job in public accounting? Weather it was or wasn’t, I expect the hiring freezes in tax and audit will end by late summer. Both service lines are pretty recession proof (can’t say the same for consulting, my firm already made layoffs there). If you’ve passed your exams, you’ll have a leg up on all the other candidates. 

Public isn’t great but isn’t as bad as some people claim. The hours suck, but the time off is excellent and there’s tons of perks at bigger firms. Plus recruiters love it and after a year you’ll have tons of solid exit opportunities.

Edit: I should say, if you feel like you’re entering a period of Depression probably don’t immediately dive into the CPA lol. If you have the funds, this would be a great time to travel (domestically, obviously). But from a career perspective, yeah, CPA."

5319,What was it about the culture that made you quit?
5320,"I used to work in a big 4 but not an accounting type role, but in general they expect a bare minimum 15% overtime (salaried, so you aren't being paid more for ot) and even if you work those extra hours you still get shit for leaving ""early"".  Partners and senior managers put in damn near 100 hours a week, like I could log in at any time after hours and there'd be a high chance my boss would be online too. 

The whole industry is an embodiment of ""work hard, play hard"" except the play hard just means you get a few free shitty meals and a happy hour every once and a while (which many people notoriously get absolutely shit faced at, because 1. It's free and 2. You just want to forget how shitty your work life balance is).

Tons of staff and seniors eat that shit up, thinking if they put in all the hours they will become the youngest partner ever. It's toxic af, like a frat or cult basically."
5321,"This is a rough time for you to be going through this, especially amidst the pandemic. 

If it’s any help at all I urge you to spend some time with yourself, your mind and your heart - the good and the bad, the hopes and fears, and what makes you feel successful.  Journaling is a great way to start if you enjoy writing your thoughts down. 

Don’t beat yourself up about the CPA exam - I used to work for a firm that had a great partner who had taken the longest to pass his exam (back in the way before years he’s got to be like 45-55?) AND there was a high level senior who struggled with his exams for years who I heard recently passed all 4. And this is after working there for ten years!! 

I quit that firm last year at the start of winter after struggling for years to convince myself that I needed to pass the CPA exam to be “successful” and to meet the social expectations of my peers. Turns out quitting was the best thing for me at that time. (if the year 2019 was like the year 2020 I would NOT be saying that same sentence most likely.)

Anecdotal experience but it turns out Accounting was just the major I chose to try to be “employable” but my lack of direction and true interest in the career left me emotionally dissatisfied AND the culture was SO TOXIC. Luckily I’m now employed in an entirely different field in the same area and on track to make a similar salary as where I was when I was a fresh senior. 

Keeping up the charade and and working in a toxic environment filled with colleagues who were part of the problem was so exhausting. I had started counseling before I quit and thank goodness I did as it was my tether to the reality of being young-unemployed: skilled but not skilled enough, adult but too young, experienced but not enough. The time wasted schooling for what? I’m still clueless. . 

Wow I am rambling - sorry just really feel for you and want to encourage you to not be hard on yourself - PM me anytime if you need a vent. 

What it boils down to is that you deserve to be living your life in a way that satisfies your dreams and your heart so that you may look back upon your life with as little shoulda/coulda’s as possible. Try not to overlook possibly changing courses in the direction of your career interests/goals. Best of luck!!

5322,"A bit unrelated, but what would be the best way to find/get an entry level accounting position with no experience in bookkeeping?

For the most part, the positions I've seen all require a minimum of a few years of bookkeeping experience, so what would be the best way to get that foot in the door?"
5323,"Use your time to pass the exams. Keep retaking FAR. But If you need some ego boost, take AUD first. The easiest in my opinion. 

This is just my two cents, but having the professional license makes me feel so much more grounded especially during times like this. You know that those 3 letters will always make you employable and a professional. It gives you the power and confidence. 

But for now, take the time to study. But always have your resume and cover letter ready."
5324,One bit of advice I would offer is to never quit a job before having another one lined up. I know it’s tempting when the work environment isn’t the best. But the worst thing that can happen is you quit and then can’t find another job. Just stick it out and allow that’s toxic environment to motivate you to apply to even more jobs!
5325,"I've been thinking about that especially while I've been working at home. I worked for an IT company at first place of work and my manager was a CPA at EY. I still have unlimited access to CPA material, so it's a matter of motivation and discipline on my end. 

I've been internally debating pursing the CPA route, but I'm also interested in taking Data Analytic classes as well. I'm just feeling unsure about the direction I want to take my career..."

5329,"The CPA will be useful in pretty much any direction you decide to take your career, unless you straight up decide to dip out of accounting/finance/economics/business positions. You can be uncertain about your jobs, but there really should be no uncertainty about whether you should get your CPA or not."
5330,"There’s always going to be highs and lows in life, considering the circumstances with the whole world burning down try not to be so hard on yourself about getting laid off, it happens to perfectly good employees during normal times. 

Focus on what you need to do for the next month or so, and if that becomes too crazy to think about focus on today. And when even that gets to be too much the focus on the next hour.

Things will get better or at least they’ll be less shitty."
5331,Tax firms are still looking to hire. They’ve been getting a lot of questions with all the changes in the law and response to coronavirus; and people still need tax advice — perhaps now more than ever.
5332,"My advice is as always: Start working for yourself. Do you have some savings or credit? Maybe focus on passing your CPA exam and start a website and start collecting emails. Ask friends if they need help with accounting. Check with people on stock market forums/Facebook groups. People messing around with the stock market right now will need help with taxes and such. 

Or find something else you can do that is working for yourself... Right now the only person who will pay you what you’re worth is you. The problem is most people who are really good at the skills needed to produce products or services for a business are really bad at the business part of business."
5333,Go on...
5334,How is dating when you're living with mom and dad?
5335,"I've studied accounting but my degree is just in Finance. It's for that reason as well that I've never done any accounting specific internships, hence the lack of any experience"

5337,Was your salary decent? Did you work on weekends? How long did you work at the Big 4 and did other colleagues follow the same path?
5338,This is the reason why I could never do public. It’s insane.
5339,Ah yeah Cali is pretty crazy for that I imagine. Your parents are cool with you bringing girls around?
5340,"I was there for 3 years, started entry level at 50k, ended at 63k mostly due to a 20% raise from a promotion. Typically yearly raises were 2 - 3%. I was not client facing, so I didn't make the firm any money hence the low raises. Client facing coworkers could get upwards of 5% yearly raises and promotions regularly plus bonuses. 

I rarely worked weekends because I didn't care too much, but tons of people do. 

Don't get me wrong, the pay is good and the benefits are great (401k match sucked, but there's a pension). QOL is not worth it in my opinion. I left because I was offered my dream job at a different company, one that I could have found at my old company and was in talks with managers for it, but ultimately the timing wasn't right.  I wouldn't have stayed even if the 2 companies both offered me the same job."

5344,"Education's primary purpose is not really a job training program. Whether that fact needs to change is certainly an argument with merit, but it is beside the point of my post here. Trade school is a professional skill program which will directly train you in marketable skills, but liberal arts universities are about the more philosophical meaning of ""education."" The reason bachelor of arts students have to take math classes and bachelor of science student have to take humanities is to give them a well rounded knowledge base and ability to think in many realms.

Integrated history and literature classes arent meant to help you be a writer or historian; they're meant to train you to think from other's perspectives and to read into text more than just the literal words on the page. A news article or piece of political rhetoric might say one thing literally, but what it says might have greater implications beyond the literal.

Integrated math and science classes arent meant to help you be an engineer or biologist; they're meant to train you to think about and comprehend universal mathematical relationships and understand the language of science. A clear example of why its important that non-scientists understand the scientific process is the growing anti-vax movement. Most people will not be paid to be immunologists, but by understanding the scientific process and language of science, they can understand that immunologists come to their conclusions from sound reasoning and experimentation.

Lastly, education is about preparing students to participate in the discourse community of their chosen career field and bringing them up to speed in their field. As a computer scientists major, there is a very steep learning curve of jargon, unique concepts to computing that arent common to other sciences, and unique methods of conducting and presenting research compared to other areas of science such as biology or physics. A computer science student or biology or literature is being initiated into the community through their study in only a few years. They specialize their knowledge and skills to participate in the continual progress of their community.

Continuing with the comp sci example, a computer science major who wants to go into development cannot hope to know the dozens and dozens of langauges being used in programming today, but by understanding the fundamental concepts and general methods of the community, they may quickly pick up any skills they need. An individual with training in the field will \*most likely\* be able to adapt more quickly to changes or pioneer new things more sucessfully since they have the context of their education. And before people say that this can be done without a degree, that goes without saying in the internet era. The education institution expedites the process for the vast majority of people."
5345,"If this is a decision you’re considering, I’m on this exact topic now in my Labor Economics course. To find out if earning a degree would be more beneficial than just entering the workforce now, you’d want to consider: 

Tuition (entire university cost)

Salary you could earn now

Expected salary of whichever field you study

The Discount rate

This is actually a topic on an upcoming exam of mine, so if you’d like me to do the math for you, I’d be happy to!"
5346,"Can I ask when you got your degree? And secondly this is a horrible argument. Saying that a degree itself doesn’t apply to the real world is plain wrong. Social workers, doctors, nurses, psychologists, teachers. All professions that need the degree because it specifically prepares those professionals for the workplace"
5347,"A degree is just an official document that states that you’re teachable, complete most of your work to a satisfactory level, show up most of the time, and are probably not an idiot (emphasis on probably). If your degree happens to be related to the field you’re entering, it also let’s people know that you have some background in the subject matter, but can’t generally be considered an expert.

Once you’re in, they’ll teach you the rest... usually."

The degree matters, folks."
5351,Are these lessons really worth paying thousands and thousands of dollars for? Everything you're talking about I pretty much learned in high school.
5352,"I have a degree in mechanical engineering technology and I work as a manufacturing quality engineer for a supplier of medical equipment. 

I don't need my degree for 90% of my job. However, the 10% of my job that I use information directly from what I learned in school that's the difference between me having the job and me not having the job. 

Think of it from the companies prospective. The company you work for is your customer and you are selling it your labor and your knowledge. 

Let's say you go to Walmart and you see two containers of ice cream. One is 90% full, one is 100% full. Both cost the same.

Which one do you buy?"
5353,"Here’s the thing. You may very well get different things from a degree than expected. 1. Networks for professional advancement 2. A broader base of knowledge if getting something like a liberal arts degree3. A broader world view as you come across people of different backgrounds than you had in high school. Vital in an increasingly global work environment 4. Better critical thinking from designing research projects to taking a pre-law course and experiencing the Socratic Method 5. College is to make you a more knowledgeable and productive person in life, not just a job unless you are going for something like a nursing or engineering degree that is more of a professional degree than anything"
5354,Comparing the experience of college to gaming is nuts.

5357,"Unless you have a lot of work experience don't do an MBA. I cringe at all these people going straight from an undergrad to a MBA. I work in finance and it's a running joke about the fools who get MBAs without experience - you are about as employable (realistically) as a new grad with no experience. 


By all means, get the MBA after you have a few years experience but not before."

5360,"Regardless of if your specific job actually needs a degree to do the work, many jobs still require one. A degree may tick a checkbox and get you past ATS at least. It can still help you beyond a first job. I’ve heard of many stories of people who struggle to advance in their careers to managerial and other positions because they don’t have the degree required to be considered, despite otherwise being a qualified candidate."
5361,"If you’re doing anything in science or engineering 

Good luck doing anything other than manual labor without an accredited degree."
5362,"You learn a lot in your own discipline (major) as well as across other disciplines. You learn to work on teams and with others. You learn to see things through. You learn how to communicate, including listening to others and learning. You learn to work on projects and complete them on time. You demonstrate that you can finish what you start, and you learn how to do that in the process. You learn lots of things that apply to the real world."
5363,"I went to school for something very specific in a research field in technology. It gave me access to great profs, internship placements, networking events on campus, and hands-on learning I would not have received otherwise. The thing is, I was very focused on what my goal was professionally and what field of study would open doors and get me into industry.

I feel like some of the big issues with so many people getting degrees are:

* Many people don't actually have a specific goal and are going deeply in debt without an actionable plan
* Many people are getting degrees in things that, quite frankly, don't actually give them a marketable skill set that employers would be interested in. 
* People have bought into the notion that simply going to college and getting a piece of paper will lead to career salvation. 

I've gone to school with many people who has absolutely no business being in a university class and legitimately had no passion or thirst for learning and were just going through the motions doing the bare minimum to graduate. Then they become resentful and angry when they can't find meaningful employment because they have zero marketable skillset, little soft skills, and fail to market themselves well in the job market. 

&#x200B;

If more people would go in with their eyes open and actually have a plan of action things would be very different in terms of the degree you get offering real-world application professionally."
5364,"I'm not saying college is for everyone, and I was extremely privileged to be able to attend and to get aid in paying for it. You are partially correct, you can learn a lot of the same skills in the working world. However, in college you learn them WAY faster, and you have the benefit of learning them before you enter the real world. That's the real advantage, having those experiences in a time and place where mistakes and consequences do not carry the same weight that they do out in the working world."
5365,"For me at least, it was all those “buzz words” skills like “teamwork”, “organization skills”, “critical thinking”, “problem solving”, etc. Yeah, you might not ever apply your knowledge directly, but brain is a muscle, and college exercised that muscle for me, so now I know how to approach some unknown task or how to tackle a project. Obviously it helps to work in the field of your degree, but you don’t necessarily have to to apply those skills well. 

In my case, I majored in math and statistics. Do I ever solve actual math problems at work? No, but I use similar logic to accomplish day-to-day tasks."
5366,"It may give you an advantage over people going for the same job as you, but as a whole compared to just people in general, it's not really an advantage. The richest people in the world are business owners, many of which didn't go to or finish college. And, im not just talking about the well known ones. I studied IT in university and hated it. I made most of my money from languages, coaching, and marketing (which I all learned via self study, testing, and perseverance - albeit still spent way less time than I did at college).

It's getting less and less important now that you can basically double your income by working online, and in literally any field. I mean people are making 5 figures a month eating fish sticks on video."

5368,"Not to everybody, no. And that's why college is not for everyone. But also you did not learn the same skills in high school, and I only mentioned the two easiest ones to explain. There were a lot more nuanced skills and lessons that I didn't bother getting into in my comment. 
I am a hiring manager at my company and I see the difference every day.  People who went to college (even those who dropped out after a couple years) are consistently stronger candidates than those who only have a high school education. And it has nothing to do with the degree itself. It's about how they carry themselves, how they write applications, how they interview, etc."
5369,"You're right, doctors and other specialized fields do use their degrees. however, from the context of this question it was quite obvious that they are not talking about being in a specialized field. If they had gotten a degree for something like that, then they wouldn't be asking how it applies to the real world. Read between the lines, my friend."
5370,"That is definitely possible, and you may have been lucky. Some high schools and teachers are genuinely great at teaching important skills. It also depends on the person. Some people are much better at picking up opportunities to learn lessons, and you may be one of those people. I am speaking generally but of course there are always exceptions. There are also people who go to college and just get nothing out of it because they didn't bother to try and learn anything outside of the core academic material"
5371,A college degree teaches you many trivial fun facts that 95% percent of which will have little application to the real world. Quantum mechanics is fun and dandy but what it’s really teaches you is probably solving. Teaching to be able to overcome problems you don’t know the answers. Thinking back to high school majority of students only care about getting the answers. Successful college graduates shouldn’t no longer be focused on knowing or memorizing solutions but rather the system to find solutions for themselves.
5372,"You're 100% right. Most recent grads try to highlight their educational background on their resume and it's usually a mistake. Education is a minimum requirement, not something that gets you a job. Now, it might make sense if you're graduating from a very prestigious program, but even then I would avoid making that the centerpiece of your resume. 

Employers are going to pick the best candidate for the job, or someone they know. That's really it. If you don't know someone, you need to be the best candidate. So if your best quality is having the same degree as every other applicant, don't expect to see much success."
5373,"I studied international business (something that a lot of people would consider a useless major) and it's a m a z i n g

gave me a completely new perspective on so many things

but yeah, you need to work in a job that's related (isn't that obvious though?). I'm working in revenue management so I apply a loooot of the things I've studied. yes, they did teach me ""what I need to know"" on the fly at work, but what I know from university lets me exceed expectations. very often I know things that others don't and that allows me to make better decisions. which improves my potential for promotion.

I think it also helps me more because I studied the university while working full-time, so next day at work you can immediately recognize the stuff you read about or heard at a lecture and that reinforces the learning

also need to point out that I was a very good student (graduated with honours), so it might be more useful for me than for someone who just passed exams and forgot everything the next day. I studied everything very much in depth. in fact I think this is one of the most important factors."
5374,I moderately workout. I somewhat interested in bars. I hardly play games. Not into writing but open to reading. That’s just me though
5375,"You would join some kinda of recreational league. Whether it’s golfing, softball, bowling, etc. then you’d be forced to interact with people."
5376,Joining a gym like a martial arts gym or a climbing gym has been my preferred after work thing. It’s exercise and meeting people and more interesting than weightlifting.
5377,It's just ideas
5378,[removed]
5379,"Look to see if there’s an artists warehouse somewhere. Idk if it’s my west coast american talking, but there’s tons of art classes offered at warehouses turned into art studios.

The one near me offers welding, metalworking, woodworking, leatherworking (my specialty!) and lots of others. Classes are about $40 each for like 3 hours of classes + supplies so I think it’s well worth it. Usually they also offer membership where you can come in and use their workshop as much as you want. It’s a fantastic place for meeting all sorts of interesting people.

Edit; also you definitely don’t have to be artsy. If you ask for a tour more often than not you’ll find something that’s at least interesting, and you’d be surprised at how much fun it is to pick things up. Plus when I was getting started leatherworking as a poor student, they had a box of scraps I could practice on for free. It’s a hub of artists supporting artists, no matter your skill level. I guarantee you’ll find something mindblowingly interesting surrounded by interesting people."
5380,Do you like nature? Tons of hiking clubs
5381,"One of my friends had the best advice I'd heard when it comes to hobbies and it was that if you choose to commit to something, see it through til you have something to show for it, to the point where if you have kids you can tell them, yeah, I don't just know about that, but I've really done it. 

His example at the time was painting and he had the gear and the knowledge and stuck with it to the point where he'd created a painting he was proud of. For me one of the ones I've stuck with has been photography, the mindset being that unlike other forms of tech, a camera is a tool like a set of wrenches, rather than something to be usurped and outdated with the next generation, and to invest means having a lifetime of captured experiences going forwards.

There are SO many hobbies, experiences, and interests to have out there, and it can be easy to get lost in chasing the next thing if you come to a point where pursuing or improving with your hobby might become difficult or discouraging. If you opt out early on, you're gonna find yourself overwhelmed or surrounded by a bunch of gear for half-baked ideas.

A mantra in general that I abide by: there's a mindset behind every interest and hobby, there's a reason why people think something is cool. You're human as much as any of us are, and by that logic if you can internalize and get behind that same understanding, so there's no ""wrong"" answer if you're on the fence about choosing or committing to any hobby.

Last thing on this topic, I personally have tried to choose and perfect or hone hobbies that account for all five of our senses to be able to lead a full life and to be able to share that with others. I try to be a great cook so I can cater to my own tastes n smells and for others, I try to be a great photographer to capture the unique glimpses I have, I'm open to different genres of music and appreciate sonic art and hone my tastes so that I can have the right tunes to capture all the right emotions, and I try my best to have good sense in personal hygiene and self-care for the physical sensation of touch, just as examples.

There's so much out there! So don't leave any stones unturned, we only have only right now."
5382,I think they're just trying to gauge your interests. What do you enjoy doing? What do you do in your spare time?
5383,disc golf!
5384,Music is a great hobby
5385,"Rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking, kayaking have kept me sane"
5386,"If you’re political at all lots of places have a “young X club” (republican, Democrat, even DSA). And they’re usually having some sort of social events to get new members. 
Also bar trivia nights"
5387,"Crossfit is a great way to meet people. Lots of them are great folks who are working out to stay in shape, although there are some who are pretty intense about it.

The nice thing is that it’s your workout, so you can go your own pace, and many adults who do it are very consistent about it, so the same time slots will have you seeing pretty much the same people.

It’s a good time, and it’s decent fitness to boot."
5388,I'm still technically in school but would second the climbing gym suggestion! In my experience everyone is super friendly and it's a much more fun way to get some exercise in. They also tend to be open very late.
5389,Fill alumni surveys
5390,Hang out at the bars where undergrads do and exploit daddy issues
5391,Ultimate!
5392,"Would you like to play some? Hearthstone has in person gatherings, a lotta places have board game gatherings, and games workshops have amazing starter packs and communities."
5393,"Is going to the bar really a hobby? I mean, I like it as much as the next guy, but I wouldn’t call it a hobby."
5394,"That sounds really cool! Totally different from the kind of art places in my area. The ones around me offer classes such as painting, meditation, yoga, and dance."
5395,"I used to climb regularly, been doing Muay Thai and BJJ for the past 5 years now. Both amazing suggestions!"
5396,"I’d recommend volunteering, I’ve found it to be helpful in meeting some new people."
5397,Jujitsu
5398,Do some jiujitsu! It’s an amazing sport and a life long skill. The people you meet are amazing and it’s a crazy workout plus you learn how to defend yourself!
5399,"Didn’t do this until after college but join some rec leagues, joined a bar league volleyball team and expanded my friend group, helps with the exercise a bit too."
5400,"Building guitar pedals, spending time in adobe illustrator, smoking copious amounts of weed"
5401,"Read! It’ll help you find the more actionable things you want to do that a random reddit post couldn’t tell you.

Also joining a league of any kind is a lot of fun, like a soccer league or masters swim team."
5402,What about some kind of art?  You could take up drawing or painting or photography or anything else.  It would probably require an investment on your part eventually but IMO it's worth it.
5403,"if you’re ever feeling lonely, tinder is great for getting girls 🙅🏽‍♂️"
5404,My university had an online portal where you can apply for interviews. Got in and was offered a job afterwards.
5405,"Yes, and it was during covid. My major was Electrical Engineering. Got a job working in Power Distribution so I’m technically essential."
5406,Yeah I’m not trying to sound like I’m looking for a way around it but I just find it hard to believe that literally everyone who has a job after college knew someone
5407,"It’s already impossible enough to catch up with and maintain friendships with the people I actually consider important in my life, what makes you think I have the time and energy to maintain a whole other slew of fake friendships too, just on the slim chance one of them might “know someone.”"
5408,"Yeah I posted this because someone posted “tips for college graduates” and the first tip said that networking is crucial and gave a whole story about why it’s crucial.

It’s just kind of annoying when people make it seem like it’s impossible to land a job if u don’t try to get to know someone. I just don’t want to fake trying to be friends with someone just to land a job"
5409,"I got my job without networking but I was an intern first. A very very persistent intern at that. I work in IT, more specifically IT project management as a business analyst. I want to be a project manager and have been since high school but this is just my first step. I would suggest being okay with starting as an intern especially in this climate. It seems most companies don’t want to take on the risk of having a fresh college grad with no work experience.

I also want to add it’s harder and more competitive to find an internship than it is to find a job. Don’t get discouraged you’ll land something soon."
5410,"Let me tell u networking is not helpful unless you’re able to get to a point where they’re you’re actual buddy or you’re just lucky because they’re willing to give you a shot. This is in business I’m referring to (networking in the science industry landed me a job) also if your from a wealthy family or family that has connections, nepotism is your best friend. 

I studied a dual degree in science and business and let me tell you, I networked day and night straight for 1 whole year going to corporate events every single week day and eventually burnt out. Sure I met some successful people, rich people, powerful people but in most cases you still had to apply for the job and they’re referral wasn’t worth all that much unless you’re absolutely exceptional. 

My advice is just apply, be your best self at interviews and I cannot emphasize this enough, intern, intern, intern. In most cases that will land you the full time offer especially at big companies. I got into something similar ish to you and is tech related and that’s how I got to the big 4."
5411,"i did, school career center had recruiters and applicants match through the internet, definitely check that out or ask the career center if there’s a website they might recommend you visiting for something like that."
5412,"Yes this was pre covid but I applied to a sales position at a SaaS company. Didn’t know a single soul there. A week after I submitted my application I was starting to get antsy. So I went on LinkedIn and found all the recruiters who worked there and messaged them on the status of my app. 

Within hours I was connected with a person and scheduled to do a phone interview the next day. After that I got a job offer and have been there almost 2.5 years now. 

So if you don’t hear anything for a bit, do a little LinkedIn scoping specially the recruiters there and see if they can push your app through"
5413,"It’s not as convoluted as you need to be best friends with people, but take something as easy as joining the club for your major. A lot of local companies to colleges will send recent grads to help out with recruiting or if they don’t, the grads will know if the company is hiring. These clubs can help facilitate that connection by having recent grads come in to speak with students about the jobs and connections can be formed from there. Every internship I got in college plus my current job was through this method. All it takes is to show up to some meetings and get involved"
5414,"^this is the way to do it. I’ve had a few jobs now where I didn’t know anyone previously, I’m terrrrrrible at networking, and the only way I ever got interviews was by reaching out to someone on Linkedin. You don’t have to wait a week either, anytime after sending in an application is fair game, you can send a message same day. Either find a recruiter or someone in the same department you plan to work in, or anyone at the company if that fails. Worst case scenario they don’t respond. And if it helps, I’m also very introverted and it will feel weird to send these messages, but I promise it’s not as awkward as it feels haha"
5415,"I was kind of thinking the same thing. When I went to career fairs, I felt like I didn’t really accomplish anything. Sure I talked to them and gave them my resume but they would just give me a website to apply on and nothing would happen after that. Just felt like a waste of time tbh. And I didn’t want to put so much energy into trying to be fake Buddy Buddy with someone to get a job.  

And yeah I plan on trying to intern somewhere before graduating in December. Will continue to strive for that by the time Summer comes. Thanks for ur input."
5416,"It’s totally possible. While it’s good to know people, organisations are most interested in whether you’re up to doing the job and how you’ll fit in. I landed my first professional job within a couple of weeks of finishing classes and didn’t know anyone at the organisation."
5417,"Yes, 1.5 years ago. But it took 200+ rejections to get 1 offer"
5418,"What do you say to the recruiters without sounding desperate?

Even when replying to emails I get from recruiters I feel so awkward and like I'm  asking for a favour if I want to know more about the position they're selling"
5419,"Hi, extremely introverted person here, I've also had my fair share of troubles with anxiety, depression and social anxiety. I got a job without knowing anybody. I don't have social media either. I was born and raised in the middle east, but my family moved out to Pakistan to live here permanently, and in a new city altogether. I've also been a self studying student, so I've completed my professional qualification as a chartered accountant entirely on my own at home, so getting a job in a new country without knowing anyone was something i was really worried about. After my last exam, I made my CV, and i applied at around 50 or 60 places, i was really hopeless in that time, which lasted around 5 or 6 weeks, but then one fine day i got a call from this multi national  company for an interview, it was my first ever(and only) interview I've been in, it went terribly in all honesty, and then a day later i got called in for a final interview with the chief internal auditor, which i was really surprised and confused about. My final interview went really good. After a few weeks, I got a call that I've been hired, I've been working there for about 16 months now. I'm really blessed."
5420,"It's not so much ""networking"" in a stereotypical sense where you're supposed to go to networking events and give people your business cards and casually sell yourself.

It could be having a good rapport with a professor or joining a club that suits your interest and meeting someone who connects you to someone else.

I had a guest lecture come in for a talk and I asked a bunch of questions and then went up to her to learn more about generally how to get into that field. She ended up having an opening and encouraged me to apply. Getting a job through the guest lecture didn't even cross my mind. It's just about talking to people and showing genuine interest in what you do."
5421,">I just don’t want to fake trying to be friends with someone just to land a job

Most people who can connect you to someone aren't looking for you to pretend to be their friend or even actually be their friend.

You just want to have enough rapport going so that they feel confident referring you to an opportunity or colleague."
5422,"I got an interview in 2 hours, I’ll let you know!"
5423,How much EE knowledge do you need? I forgot EVERYTHING from school.
5424,"I work in fast food.

&#x200B;

I have an MBA.

&#x200B;

Network your ass off, kids.  Don't be me."
5425,"me too, summer this year is when i finish my degree. God college is not for me ,can't wait to finish it off and just get a job."
5426,"In all honesty, networking helps but of course there are ways to land a good job without networking. 

It may depend on the field. I’m in the psych field and landed a job with relative easy in behavior analysis. I also worked on the hiring side and called people based on their degree/experience. Of course I would also interview people who I networked with, but both groups were offered jobs equally"
5427,Yeah lol I hate networking. I could see its benefits but it's not the end of the world. I'd be moreso focused on making sure you have the required experience/ skills they're looking for
5428,"Glad to hear your experience and glad to hear that everything worked out. I’m planning on trying to intern somewhere during the summer before I graduate, I just want some type of experience outside the classroom. Thanks for your comment!"
5429,"By ""networking"", they mean going to the career center and doing the networking events. Most don't actually know the people."
5430,"Basically none. Taught me all the basics and have other engineers I can ask questions to. The degree is just you ticket into the room. Most jobs don’t really use most of the stuff we learned, maybe just a couple of fundamentals and the rest can be learned."
5431,"I didn’t get my job from networking. I used one of those networking websites of my University to find emails of people (including my now boss) who went to my school working at the company I’m applying to and cold emailed them a story of why I want to work there and my resume. This helped me make sure a human looks at my resume. The HR manager and my boss saw my email and got me into interview and I’ve had that job since. 

I landed a few interviews this way. Since I’m international, I didn’t really know to network really well as I wasn’t in a frat or any such society.  In fact my networking at career fairs and such never really landed me an interview."
5432,"Yep! I worked with a temp agency. My contract position led to them offering a different position full time. I’ve been there three years now and while I don’t love it, I’m content and know I can move up within the company."
5433,"Yes, fortunately I did. However, I think it may be field-dependant"
5434,According to lil uzi vert your old
5435,Lil uzi vertical doesn't even show up to his shows.
5436,"Today was actually the last day of my high school internship and I was just sitting in my office talking with one of the engineers for a while when he mentions something happening in ‘89 and said “I bet you don’t even know what 1989 was, it was wayyy before your time”. I just responded with it was 12 years before me and he just looks at me and says “I hate you for making me feel old” and chuckles"
5437,"I’m 23 and just graduated with a bachelors in May. I landed a really chill, entry level office job with a large international company. The branch i work at is tiny, a total of 8 of us work there. I’m BY FAR the youngest person probably who has EVER worked there. My coworkers are all at least ~10 years older than me, and half the people who work there have worked there since the 80s. One lady has worked there for 35 fucking years. She said she got the job cause she had a master’s in Spanish. IN SPANISH, fam. 

Anyway. My supervisor was talking about data safety or something similar and said “you guys remember in the mid-90s when there was this big security breach at [insert company I don’t know]?” And my coworkers who were gathered around said yes, and he kind of looked at me wondering if I knew and I said “you mean the mid 90s... like... when I was born?” And I think that was the moment everyone kind of dumbfounded realized how young I am, and how old they are. One of the guys who has been here since the 80s even said “good to know you’re in your 20s. I thought you were about 12.”"
5438,"That was me a few years ago! Worked at a summer camp with recent high school grads. It makes you feel real old, but it helps you stay current!"
5439,Oh I have. Tom’s a stand up guy. The grandpa I never had.
5440,You should 100% befriend that guy
5441,"I listen to a lot of podcasts so that’s where I get a lot of this random information, but otherwise kids like to talk about themselves so usually I just let them talk and eventually I’ll learn something new."
5442,What’s a finsta?
5443,"I feel this so hard some times at 26 and on the opposite end, I’m so much younger than most"
5444,https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/finsta
5445,Is there someplace where teachers or other professionals who need to keep up with kids can go to learn these slang/trends?
5446,"There was this professor on twitter who made an entire list of slang that he’s heard and put it into that list and the definition of it let me find it for you!

Edit: Here you go! 
[slang ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yrJmMHPkZzrxfWbUb4jALN0neE1tbkgH/view?usp=sharing)"
5447,"Maybe this is because I’m usually around people who are older than I am, but I’ve rarely felt old. Early to mid twenties is still the start of one’s life in my opinion."
5448,There is this thing called time and it means you will age and won’t always be the youngest. It literally happens to all of us.
5449,But I love it when I'm talking to older people and they  think I'm crazy to think I'm old.
5450,"I relate. 

I'm good friends with my soon to be SIL who is a senior in highschool. We hang out like normal friends but when she mentions how weird it is to be 18 turning 19 soon and that high school sucks I feel old as fuck. My SO feels the same."
5451,I think you're there
5452,"Older coworkers who can work some humor into the experience should get gold irl. I work that little battle occasionally just trying to undermine people who have no sense of humor left at all, or weren’t smart enough to have one in the first place."
5453,"Oh man, the worst part is when you still get it wrong after spending so much time on it."
5454,I totally relate to you. What I recommend is turning off your notifications for emails and only checking them a certain time each day. That way you just get to stress over with and you don’t let it keep nagging at you all day.
5455,"I relate to this as well.  I get most anxious writing the email, I’ll sometimes spend an hour writing one just to fine-tune what I want to say."
5456,"This helped me when someone told it to me. I heard someone say that around 90% of things we worry about don’t actually happen. 

It can actually cause more stress worrying about what could happen than preparing for as much as possible and just reacting intelligently when something negative happens."
5457,"Regarding point 1, I used to have a terrible manager that would keep throwing balls back to people by sending nonsensical emails. For the ball to be in their court, i’d say the email still has to have some standard. (Which I’m afraid I might be falling short of.) 

There’s quite a lot of potential for error in my role. Especially since I’ve been thrown in to learn the ropes along the way. Point 2 is very true... 

As the production cycles go by I start to learn about previous mistakes and try to rectify them, but in the process I just end up making new ones. :| Then I have to annoy people for help. Still needs some getting used to."
5458,"I still gladly mute my notifications over the weekend and after office hours. But I tend to dread coming back to them SO MUCH once the break if over. 

I do have a list too! But I have difficulty checking things off because they tend to involve a lot of little subtasks here and there."
5459,"I feel that, I tend to over analyze them too much lol"
5460,Screenshot this next time I send out emails
5461,It helps when you work in an office where people can barely speak English and as a result there is absolutely no pressure to write anything that makes sense grammatically or otherwise.
5462,"I would suggest taking the ASVAB ( I think that’s what it’s called). The test you take to place a job in the military. You may not want to join, but the test can show you what field/jobs you would be well suited for... if you do take it and decide not to join just change your number after you get your results or you may get numerous calls about joining."
5463,I needed to hear this for my own reasons. Thank you.
5464,"If you’re not 100% certain on a degree then do not sign up for university, take it from a guy with 70k debt and no degree. I kept changing course because I didn’t like anything I tried, turns out I enjoyed getting my hands dirty, so now im an apprentice electrician. 

I would recommend a trade, if you don’t like that option, then just find any job, it wont be high paying, but you won’t be racking up debt while still deciding if something is right for you."
5465,"Gone are the days of picking one career and sticking to it for your whole life. Nowadays people switch not just jobs, by whole careers and industries every 5ish years. Go with what feels right for you now, and then later you can make changes based on what is next for you. Most people are unsure of their major the entire time they are in college, and then they graduate and do something totally unrelated to what they studied! The reason most people are pre-med or pre-law in college is because they haven't been exposed to enough of the work world to even understand the countless possibilities of different careers. I started studying architecture, but then I took a class on global poverty and it totally changed the trajectory of my career. 

You can't even imagine what is down the road. My dream job that I got at 28, I wouldn't have even understood it if someone told me in high school one day you will be a Program Officer doing community development and investing in affordable housing and parks in low-income neighborhoods. 

In my career, I've done architecture and international development, improv comedy and produced an award-winning online talk show, went on to get a masters in city planning and public health and worked in community development for a few years, recently I moved to Mexico and became an entrepreneur running an online education company. I'm 32. I have plans to start a foundation and maybe become an actress. Who knows where that will lead.

I also made this YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYqRZpXBpfA&t=6s) with an exercise to help make decisions about what major to pursue. Try it out and let me know if you have any questions."
5466,"that's an anxiety a lot of us face, my dude. one of the best things that American (assuming you're in the US) higher education has is the flexibility to allow students to begin focusing on a specific topic by at the very latest their sophomore year. use your freshman year to take care of gen-ed requirements and get a feel for what you want to major (or even minor or double major) in. and even if it's something that you have more of an interest in rather than a passion, you'll still have better employment prospects with a BA/BSc than if you just had a high-school diploma. you may find as you're on the way to getting that degree that you actually like what you're studying and want to make a career out of it, or you may just see it as a means to an end to pursue another passion of yours. your interests will undoubtedly change in some form or another once you get to college. my best advice is to take it one day at a time, come up with plans on how to use your education and training to pursue something that you want, and come up with some contingency plans if you really can't stand college

good luck, buddy!"
5467,"probably an unpopular opinion, but IMO pick the most technical thing you can possibly study, Physics for example.  Basically learning that stuff teaches you to think in a certain way that is applicable everywhere.  You can learn most things outside of school on your own, but it’s pretty freaking hard to do that with physics.  You don’t have to go anything physics related in the future anyways.  People respect the rigor you went through to earn the degree, and it shows you can learn."
5468,"Highly recommend a gap year. Wish I took one of my own. Society makes you feel like you have to have it all figured out by the end if high school but you don’t. Take that time to REALLY find yourself. Put ALL your attention on yourself. Realize that being alone is the best thing that can happen to you during that. It takes out all outside influence. Seek inspiration, treat it like you would breakfast. Build good habits while destroying the bad ones. I feel like if you really put in time and effort into yourself for a whole year you would be amazed. I’m still in the early stages of my journey but I’ve realized what I’ve been going to school for isn’t anything I’m passionate about and I was only in school just for the sake of it. Once I started focusing on myself I started realizing what I wanted for myself so hopefully that happens to you one way or another. Good luck!"
5469,"I also switched my majors a couple of times (started with CS) and ended up switching to Econ and loving it. Didn’t really have work experience before college either.

I wish I had not selected a major within my freshman year of college and “wasted” time/hours going to classes I’m not interested in."
5470,"I am 28 and sophomore in a PhD program, yet I am still not sure if this is the right decision for me. However, I have a much better sense of it than I did when I was starting college. As you get older, you will learn more about yourself, what you’re good at, and what you want to do professionally. It’s hard to foresee that exactly, so go with your best gut feeling now and there is always room to make a major change and even a career change later. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself now, allow yourself the flexibility to be what you want even if it changes."
5471,"Dude... you are a prime candidate for a gap year! I know it's not as common in the US as it is in the UK, but trust me (from experience), it's waaaaay better to """"""waste"""""" one year figuring yourself out, than four years (paid) in a programme you don't really love"
5472,"You won’t know unless you try, so experience is key. 
If I were you, I’d work on communication skill as those are priceless"
5473,"Honestly man, you won't know until you get going. There's so much behind the scenes in every career path that no amount of research could give you a realistic expectation of how well you'll like it. The burden of choice is real - anything you choose to pursue comes at the cost of pursuing something else.

My best advice is to stop thinking and just start doing. Take advantage of the opportunities as they come. Don't think about the career as a means to an end, instead just think about moving forward from where you were yesterday. Your passions and interests will help guide you along the way. Good luck!"
5474,"Dude take this from a 27 year old with $50,000 in student debt. IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO STUDY, TAKE A YEAR OR TWO OFF OF SCHOOL. 

There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with it! 

I went to college at 18. I had no idea what I wanted to do. I thought I'd go and figure it out there. I tried majoring in engineering, math, biology, education, and eventually premed. I spent 4 years just figuring out what it was I wanted to do. I am first gen Mexican American so not only did I have no idea what I was doing but I was also feeling the pressure to succeed from my family and society. 

I ended up super depressed and told my boyfriend I was on the brink of a mental breakdown and needed to be closer to home. My boyfriend (now husband) was going through a similar situation. And many friends and acquaintances were too. So we decided to just leave. We went back to our hometown and just took a year off of school, worked and just relaxed and tried to figure out what it was I wanted to do. I was $50,000 in debt. My husband was $30,000 in debt. And we had no degree to show for it. 

I finally found out what I wanted to do: nursing! So I took literally like 4-6 prerequisites courses I needed for the program and applied and got in on my first try! I am almost a nurse. I'll be doing something I love and making $60-70k my first year as a nurse. I have a daughter now with my husband and he is also finishing up school in something he loves. We are 27 now! This should have been done years ago. We could've been done with school at 21 and be good now. But we simply had no idea what we wanted to do with our lives and at 18, you feel like it's the end of the world if you don't know. You feel that every one will judge you or laugh at you for not being in college. You're too young to really understand the consequences of making big decisions like taking out student loans with out having any direction in life. 


We're both 27, $80k in debt, and still can't buy a home. Idk when we'll be able to even buy one. I'm tired of living in apartments in the ghetto because we can't afford anything nicer due to our student debt. But hopefully once we are graduated, we will be better off. 


If we would've taken a year or two off after high school, or even 3 years, we wouldn't be in so much student debt, we'd be better off financially, and we'd be happier. 


So take my advice, take all the time you need in the world. But never stop working towards something. Don't just take a gap year (or 2 or 3) and have no plan. Have a plan. And revisit that plan constantly if not you tend to lose sight of it. 
Take your basic courses at a community college in the meantime. I wish I would've done part time at my community college to get all my basics out of the way while I tried to figure out what it was I wanted to do with my life. It would have saved me thousands in debt. 


Work. Save money! Don't go into debt (credit cards, car payment, etc). And just live with your parents if you can and want to. Take time to figure shit out. There is NO rush. Good luck."
5475,you sound amazing! hearing your career experience brings me a sense of comfort
5476,thank you so much for validating my degree even though i’ll probably never use it again lol
5477,What do you do now?  I’m an electrical engineer who wishes he did physics or pure math...or at least dabbled more in those areas
5478,"Why is that, might I ask"
5479,"I began college while still in high school. I never had any work experience other than retail. So, all I knew how to do was take tests and write papers. I wasn’t aware of what I wanted to do in life so I used school as an escape. I changed my major about 4 times in undergrad because I wasn’t good at accounting, and none of the other majors really made me happy studying. I finally landed on Economics and I fell in love. Now I’m finishing up my Masters in Healthcare Economics... I think it would have cut down on all of the unnecessary classes and gave me an idea of where I would fit into the workforce as well providing me with something to work harder at."
5480,"I know it’s such  cliche thing to say, but you really aren’t the only one in this situation - this isn’t to downplay your feelings at all. It’s absurd to expect every 17/18 year old to know exactly what they want to be when they grow older.

The number of older, successful people who were in the exact situation you are in now is remarkable, honestly, you will find your path.

Give it time, pursue the things that interest you, but stay realistic. Take on hobbies (or continue current ones) which interest you. Keep yourself well rounded, outside of your education. Life always falls into place, even if it takes time."
5481,"I’m 21, 2nd year of university - I still don’t know what I want to do.... I’m starting to get a clearer picture of what I want to do. I finished school in 2015 and had 0 clue where I was headed. It just comes with time if nothing else. Pick something you enjoy and learn about it!"
5482,Look into trades
5483,Ayeeeee das me!
5484,You're not alone. I'm working my first full time job now since graduating. I'm doing something completely unrelated to what i was studying. I'm working for about a year already and i STILL feel lost because i know this isn't what i'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. Just gotta keep searching till you land on something great (hopefully) i guess.
5485,I changed majors in college a few times before I found something that really resonated with me. Don’t stress out over it. Take enough different types of classes to see what interests you. You will do great!
5486,"You still have two yeats to decide what you want to major in, so don't sweat it. You can try different classes in college and see what you like."
5487,"I used to worry so much about this I would cry. Trust me when I say this- don’t worry about it. I know it feels like the whole world is coming at you faster than you can handle, but you has so much time... maybe even 6-8 years before you ever decide what career path you want to take. Just relax and enjoy life and work hard at whatever comes your way, but don’t stress to much about anything. Really dumb people make it through life relatively unscathed, and you seem pretty smart. You’ve got nothin to worry about :)"
5488,"go for a two year or maybe a one year certification first

dental hygenist is a good gig and if i could redo my two year ""interdiciplinary"" associates i would redo it as a focused career

get some work experience that pays well and use that cashflow to try new things (festivals, travel, one off college classes, private classes, etc)

use your cash and free-ish time to figure out what you are actually interested in then once you've developed your private interests or discovered what kind of personality traits govern those interests

(in my case being meticulous, and focused on appearance and details)

then use those discovered traits (and if lucky those developed intrests/skills) to determine a 4-6 year degree that suits you


you can't be expected to know what you want to do when you've never had the finances or unsupervised free time to do or try anything freely in the first place"
5489,I had the EXACT same feeling as you and taking a gap year i think is the best answer. My family was super against this and it was an option for me since they threatened to kick me out but I just took a couple classes at community college for two semesters part time and thought about it a lot and the time just helped me realize what it is I want to do. It’s so hard to come up with something under all the pressure just after graduating high school but when you take yourself out of that situation and give yourself time to think you will figure it out. It’s better than wasting your time and making a quick decision you’re either going to regret or have to change and end up wasting your time. So definitely consider a gap year or if you want you should take some general education classes at community college.
5490,Here’s two things to think about. 1. Most freshmen change their major at least once in that year. 2. Many people end up doing something outside of their major field of study but having a college degree still helps them earn more than those without a degree. Maybe pick a large public university so that you have more chances to stay there should you settle on a particular path
5491,"Trust me, I felt this way at first, too.

So I took some time off. 2 years, to be exact. I took 2 years off of school to just work full-time, and do what I wanted to do. I changed my major 3 times before I found the right one. It may take some time, but you'll figure it out. Some people know from a young age what they want to be when they grow up, and others take a little while. And that's okay.

It doesn't matter how long it takes you to get there - it matters that you get there."
5492,"I think you're taking this the wrong way. A lot of people are fake at work. Its work; we aren't there to make friends or be buddy buddy. At most, we can get along even if we don't necessarily like each other. It's kind of like a coping mechanism. After work, I can finally be who I want to be without thinking about workplace etiquette or society. It's the one way to recover and recuperate after work."
5493,A very large majority of this world are NPCs
5494,"I would describe this as “political”. 

My job is similar. Very political, trying to get everyone to like them, to move up in positions. Not all are like that though."
5495,"I've worked retail for a number of years (even during this pandemic) and yeah i have a fake smile and a fake voice that I use. Its default and calculated to be nice sounding. 

To get the genuine me you need to get in my circle, which is increasing difficult after school. I'm always nice though, just the tone of my voice and my diction is different."
5496,"They’re not “doing it for promotions/raises/whatever” they’re just adults. You were friends with them because you work at the same place. Once you stop working together 99% of the time the friendship fades. That’s not them being fake, it’s you failing to understand the basis of the friendship. Also nobody is overtly mean to each other in a normal healthy work environment. People being nice to you does not imply a friendship, it implies that they don’t want to create a toxic work environment."
5497,Work is all an act
5498,"Just echoing some of the other comments, but the age old saying “fake it til you make it” is too real. I’d add to it and say, “fake it til you make it and then fake some more”. Being fake has negative connotations, but I also like to look at it from a different perspective. 

When I started working a real adult job, I realized how many “adults” didn’t know what they were doing. I work at a pretty big company doing analytics. But the amount of times you run into people “pulling” numbers out of thin air was astounding. Even though we try to make educated guess, it’s all about sounding smart and confident. If it works out, you celebrate, if it doesn’t, you dust yourself off and learn from your mistakes, either way, it’s all about how you “appear”. Even if you fail, you can fail with charisma (e.g admit your fault, figure out what you did wrong, and not make the same mistakes). 

Ever since we were little, through middle school and high school, it was all about how we look and sound. And sorry to break it to a lot of people, but that’s not going to go away. As we approach adulthood, it’s definitely less about the appearances (still very important in some industries e.g. marketing, consulting) but more about how charismatic you appear. Good looks will definitely help you out, but it’s really about how you approach things whether it be your job and your relationships. One great example is, when I switched jobs, there was this one guy that made an effort to introduce himself, helped walk me around the office to get to know everyone. He appeared very charismatic to me and he became a great coworker. Now, I’m not saying he was being fake, but regardless of whether it was fake or not, it made me feel great and I aspire to be that person in the future. 

To keep the long story longer 😅 , everyone is faking it til they make it, but it’s all about perspective. Being “fake” can be a good thing. It can be translated into “being professional”. There is a time and place for everything. I don’t care if you’re an asshole outside of the workplace, but you keep that shit outside of the workplace. I expect you to give me the respect that I give to you when we are working."
5499,"Well, it sure is that way, Carl Jung has described this as having a persona, and we all have them and use them in different things. It's what keeps the world turning in a way, certain profesionals act in a way that profesionals are expected to. It's something we have to overcome, for sure, but it's not an aspect to worry. Exposoing your true self to everyone would be tiring and making you overly vulnerable."
5500,"Where did you work? How much were you earning?

Maybe most of the people there simply didn't want to be there. Many of us do jobs we don't like to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table."
5501,"you hardly make friends after grad. particularly at work. and after some time, you wont bother."
5502,Not at all! I work in a big office of 600 odd people and I would say I genuinely like 40 of them and I think they are lovely people. Just gotta see the best in everyone
5503,Yes ! In addition to fake extremely selfish and hypocrite too !
5504,"Every single one of us is [""performing""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life) a version of our selves to others we interact with.  We all tend to behave a bit differently to our friends, our parents, our teachers, and our employers, according to a super complex set of social cues and rules that we've all mutually learned.  It can definitely feel ""fake"" or disingenuous, especially when encountered in a new setting for the first time.  Bit also helps to understand that it's a completely ""natural"" part of human psychology and sociology.  

That said, I personally believe there are good and bad versions of these performances.  Just as there are ways of engaging in these performances while remaining true to your ""real"" self, so to speak."
5505,They have to and lately it’s soo every increasing. To be “political correct” isn’t just about having the acceptable political views it’s about molding yourself vs your own opinions and thoughts that results of you looking fake
5506,"Not date one girl the entire time. Should’ve broken up that first week of college. If I could go back, I’d listen to my gut feeling"
5507,Pick a more realistic and employable major than a major that I just enjoyed learning about
5508,"Definitely. I’d apply for scholarships so I wasn’t 50 grand in the hole off the bat, skip less classes, actually date someone I saw a future with, and apply for internships. I’d still party life a mf tho.

On skipping class, I did the math one day and it was something like $65 per class per day for tuition excluding room and board. Lot of money to just hand away when you don’t attend."
5509,"Take the classes more seriously and  relax.

Also be more selective with who I choose to associate with"
5510,"I called my tribe my ""partners in crime,"" because group studying with people I could ACTUALLY study around was paramount and also very hard to find.

:D"
5511,I would take advantage of more opportunities like internships and building a network with professors I liked/admired. When I realized I should’ve been doing these things it was kind of too late and now I think that those experiences would’ve had a significant impact on what I chose to do after college.
5512,"Shit, I take back my other answer. This is the one lol"
5513,"There's two directions I would've gone:

1. Community college straight out of high school. Would've been a transfer aiming for BS Nursing, BS Bio, or *maybe* BA in public health. But the rest of that route I'd never be able to predict, as I would have none of my current friends and college experience (obviously). There's things I loved and hated, but I don't think I'd throw everything away to start over. It all happened, as it was supposed to.


2. 5-year in Biology as I originally did. But possible changes?

 - Attend more campus events, participate more starting freshman year (""gotten involved"")
 - Also get more involved with my science department, chat up professors, take more ""intimidating"" major classes
 - Go to all tutoring and office hours every chance I got = way better grades
 - Kept exercise in my weekly routine, particularly the [Pump It Up](https://youtu.be/gb_vhm2UB7A) game in our student center. I think I would've coped better with my troubles if I kept active, and away from moping in my apartment all day
 - Stay away from home as often as I could manage (drove 20 mins home every weekend, crashed for a day, then went back to dorm/apartment). Would've made deeper relationships, more memories with my friends, maybe even met more people. Most importantly, get a way better sense of independence and self-assurance. Kinda biting me in the butt, again living with parents who still see me as my 18-year-old self due to my lack of growth.
 - Idk how this would've affected me academically, but get a job starting freshman year. On-campus job would've been the best balance, even if it was being a barista, desk worker, or washing dishes at the dining commons. It would've been better to establish any kind of work ethic early on.


For all intents and purposes, I technically am going to college again. I'm trying my hand at getting into nursing school via the old-fashioned community college route, but I was recently denied for this year's program. But yeah, I don't mind doing college ""again"" in this sense. I feel like I must push myself harder than I did when I was younger. Even after my first degree, the world continues to confound me on where to start. I'm juggling the issue of available opportunities and time pressure to get this new degree started, but I think I just have to trust where the process goes."
5514,"Not OP but FWIW, I really don’t see how computer science would be unwise."
5515,"I would not date anyone seriously. *No one.* that’s what derailed me and almost cost me my degree, I dated someone very abusive who did everything to keep me from passing my classes. I graduated anyway. 

I was a bio major- I’d get chemistry started and out of the way as soon as possible. It almost kept me from graduating because I barely passed it in my last semester. 

I would focus more on my research and classes, and finding people to study with. Learning it alone is hard, it’s even harder when you’re exhausted from working. 

If I was still working 2-3 jobs during, I’d take fewer credit hours. The absolute worst semester of my life was when I took 19 credits and worked 3 jobs around school. I failed two courses that semester, it wasn’t worth it. 

I would have worked a lot harder to find scholarships, or taken out loans sooner. Yeah, I’d have more loans, but I would have ultimately spent less money and time on/in school. 

I would have gone to a school outside my hometown. I should have gotten my AA at home, and then my BS somewhere else. I would have grown a lot more as a person a lot sooner and I’d probably be happier and less lonely now. 

Do. Internships. I should have worked internships during the summers while I was in school. My abusive ex wouldn’t allow it so I just did what he said (that was a bad time in my life). The connections and experience you gain during those internships is invaluable."
5516,Explore more of my interest areas. Anything and everything I was curious about.
5517,What was the other major?
5518,"please tell me more! because I’m about to apply for UNI (in Finland) and I’m choosing a computer science/IT program because I think it could be interesting despite not knowing almost anything about it. I just think it could be a great foundation to build a career from and I could go in many different directions with a degree in the computer field. But if I were to choose from what I truly think is fun I would choose something in the art business, either filmmaking or interiordesign. I just don’t think those degrees would give me a stable future, though. Am I making a wise choice? What did you major in? In what aspects do you/ do you not regret it?"
5519,"computer science. i probably would've majored in accounting because it was pretty intuitive to me and the stuff that wasn't i would beat into my head by studying. but coding's fun when you solve a problem, so. i would've left finance in order to hone in on CS more. i was pretty much focusing more on CS anyways and have a job in sw dev now. 

in addition to the stuff listed above, i definitely would have talked to upperclassmen more as well as give more advice once i was in that position."
5520,"Graduating this month, and I choose this answer as well"
5521,"Yep, would have studied math, and also probably focused a bit more time focusing on myself (establishing a workout routine, taking wellness courses, etc.) and establishing more external motivation for classes."
5522,"Absolutely not. I would have looked into getting into a trade. College diagnosed me with anxiety and depression, countless missed days and nights with my family and ENDLESS tears of frustration. I would not do it again, ever."
5523,[deleted]
5524,"Differently:

Get Involved Earlier-I had a toxic friend group freshman year that didn’t want to do anything but play video games which made me too scared to go out and try things.  Good news is that I really learned from this Junior and Senior year and had a lot more fun being involved. I also would’ve had more friends than just having to live or die by that one friend group. 

Go in-state instead of out-of-state (Maybe)- I debate this one a lot. On one hand I went from a small city to a big city that was right by the beach and had lots of stuff to do. I had so much fun exploring the new city and everything. But on the other hand it would’ve been nice to see my family more on weekends or hang out with old friends if nothing was going on at campus that weekend. 

Pick an easier major that was more employable- I switched from Accounting to Bio-Chem to Public Health and I should’ve just stuck with accounting probably. I would’ve had more free time and an easier time finding a job out of school. 


That’s about it though, I did a really good job in classes, trying new things, volunteering, developing my character.  I mainly just wish I did more of that stuff sooner."
5525,"Considering I didn't graduate, absolutely I would.  If I thought I could get financial aid again, I'd even consider a different school and starting over.  (Would take me about $6000 up front to go back or transfer my credits, not considering tuition going forward.)

Differently?  I'd get into therapy so depression and loneliness wouldn't keep me from getting to classes or keeping up with assignments.

Edit - After looking at more of the posts, I realize a big one...  I wasn't out then, and probably didn't really know that I needed to be.  Being transgender and pansexual, I'm pretty sure I could have found more communities I relate to than showing up to intramural soccer games and being the only person on the team who never went out to a bar after."
5526,Joined a different fraternity or not join a fraternity at all
5527,"Try to learn more actual skills/new hobbies. I realized my senior year that while I had a lot more knowledge, I couldn’t actually do anything that I couldn’t do in high school. I started taking piano lessons, and that was one of my favorite things I did. I wish I had taken better advantage of things like this. I may have found more things I really enjoy, and I’d be a more well rounded person."
5528,"I'm less than one year out but absolutely. I don't think I'd change a whole lot, I just miss living with so many friends so close and the ability to just say ""fuck it"" to your responsibilities for the day with no real consequences. I also weirdly miss the low level, constant anxiety that I felt at school, I think I've lost a core part of my personality that I actually really liked now that I kinda have my shit together."
5529,"I probably would stay away from college. I have never been one for studying, and it seriously caught up on me when I was nearing the end of my Master (which I didn't finish). I learned absolutely nothing and it was not at all worth the time.

I'd maybe go for farrier or programming instead. Not really sure, but probably not college."
5530,Basically this is entirely how I feel.
5531,"Not be anxious and depressed and engage in social interactions and try to make more friends. University was one of the loneliest times for me until my last term, where I changed myself. It was the best term, as if I got to experience the true joy of university and experience the impact you can make on others. 

I guess I did learn something there which was more important than education, being able to form myself in a way where I could be content with myself."
5532,"This. Sometimes I wonder if it would've also been better for me to take 6 months or a year out of high school, just working some entry-level job for money while I figured my interests out. Or continued volunteering at my local hospital. But society looks down on those smaller jobs, so I just went with the flow. The pressure to go straight to college loomed constantly, because that's just what you *do* when you leave high school. And how I needed to be done with this part of my life by the time I was 21-22. ""They"" always said: ""as long as you have a degree, you're gonna get a good job, and that's all you have to worry about..."""
5533,Yea it's a great pick career wise
5534,Worrying less about grades and investing more time/effort into my social life because the couple jobs post-college that I took didn't ever ask my gpa.
5535,"Pardon my French but I didn't follow the ""don't s\*\*\* where you eat"" rule. I made most of my social circle early on through a girl I met (mistake 1). Turned out to be a nasty relationship where she'd kick me if she got upset and I only broke things off when she cheated on me while I was undergoing some other issues in my life. I quickly learned that most of the people I was hanging out with were her friends, not mine, and thus they didn't stick it out with me (even those who felt I was justified and mistreated). 

But, to make matters worse for me, in the aftermath I wound up dating her roommate, who was part of the group of half the people that stuck by me. That girl really wasn't right for me, and it ultimately didn't work out. Of the people who didn't leave with my ex, a fair amount were ticked off with me and ditched me because they viewed my dating the roommate as revenge or just felt awkward being in the room together with the two of us. 

After that, I really just lived for grades. Wound up graduating suma cum laude because I killed much of my social life and at that point just turned all my focus to studying to fill the void, where I was hitting perfect grades most semesters (no small feat in architecture school either). It's a nice distinction, but I also realize I just lost what was arguably one of the most worry free periods of my life, and the easiest time for me to make friends prior to working full time, to a number. And I'll never get that time back. 

I've adjusted well into getting my masters straight after and going into the working world, and I feel everything I went through was necessary to become who I am today, so with that in mind I don't think I'd change a thing if I went back in time. That doesn't change the fact though that I feel like I've squandered a lot of my time in college with the wrong people and focusing on goals that have limited relevance hereafter. I feel regrets, but certainly not a need to go back and change the past."
5536,"Try online tutoring?  I got a friend who was in the same position as you.  Now she does online tutoring, don’t know which company though.  I think Qkids or VIPkids? Have you also thought about teaching in another state?  My state has an ARL program, alternate route to licensure, in order to fill in our classrooms.  The school district I’m in always has 700+ empty positions each freakin year, my admin thinks that’s a bullshit number and is most likely double that. There’s definitely a demand."

5538,"I was in the same boat as you (failed in student teaching, but still graduated), and I decided to teach in Korea for two years through [EPIK](https://www.epik.go.kr:8080/index.do). It was an amazing experience and I would definitely recommend it. The air quality there is better too. :)"
5539,"Try to apply to the charter schools there. I too am struggling with the state test, but in another state, but I had over four different interviews for two different charter schools. I was extremely close on one of them. Students always tell me that I should be their teacher, which gives me more confidence to push on. I am currently in grad school for a master of education in secondary education with a teacher certification. 

Worst case scenario, you have a master degree and can still work in education. Apply to educational companies for work. 

Also, post on the teachers forum for more help. There are teachers that have been going through the same thing. You are not alone."
5540,"I'd recommend finding a therapist, many of them work on sliding scales. They can help you with the negative thoughts, distancing yourself from your parents' criticism, prioritizing your health, and finding a new path in life, if that's what you want. Failing does not make you a failure, and no matter what thoughts you're having, you haven't ruined your life, you've taken a detour. Life would be boring af without detours."
5541,i second this. join us at r/vipkid. we’re all miserable but we work from home and earn a decent wage.
5542,I'm in Korea right now (visiting my wife before her green card is approved) and I was about to recommend this as well. I'm sure it's a much safer bet than going to China.
5543,You could do online teaching English from home. All you need is a bachelors degree
5544,"This was a year ago. It was too late to withdraw for medical reasons and I couldn’t make it up over the summer, I’d have to come back in the fall. My school was under the impression I could easily get my certification through BOCES, but but they didn’t know my cert had to go through the state, and the state had a lot of different rules. I am pissed af at my school, they treated me like a problem them wanted to hide instead of someone who was struggling, but I don’t think there’s much I can do at this point. I hate them, tho. I thought I was going to a good school with a good reputation, and all I got was a theory-based education with no practical application."
5545,"Which state do you live in? I’m not opposed to relocating, I just don’t have any money to do so at the moment. I’ve heard my state is ridiculous when it comes to alternative licensing"
5546,My health got really bad during student teaching. That didn’t help things.
5547,Perhaps try being a tutor or do online teaching?
5548,"This might not interest you at all, but another idea in addition to the advice already given is going the non-profit route. There are many non-profits that provide resources for immigrants and their families - one of my friends recently got a job at one where she does a combination of providing tangible immigration resources, language classes, and community building activities such as dances and craft fairs."
5549,"I worked for epik in Korea and Interac in japan. I loved both of them,but had to leave due to various personal family stuff or health issues. A lot of ppl I went over with to Japan are still there. It could have been forever, I’d always wanted to go. Now idk what to do. 


I think a lot of it is “the grass is always greener”. I had a tough job as a kindergarten teacher at an international school, and was dealing w isolation, stress, and undiagnosed health issues (which are a bit better now). When my contract was up, I was ready to leave. 


I feel like going back would be me trying to recreate the past (tho I wouldn’t mind a college job)."
5550,"What state does she live in? There is a lot with refugees here but they focus on volunteer work... idk if I could get a paying job, or if I could, how much it would pay.


Thanks!"
5551,"I didn’t get into jet but got into interac. I taught for a few years before getting my MA, so that’s why I thought I was so sure about it. But teaching in the US is so different. And technically I don’t really need a degree to go back overseas, but in Japan I felt like I hit a hiring wall once I was trying to work outside of public schools. 



That’s why failing student teaching really hit me hard - I had years of experience working w kids. I thought I’d do well. But I was told to “forget” my experience, that it was a detriment, since I didn’t do it in NY. Ugh. W/e"
5552,"Not to be rude but how in the world did you fail student teaching? In my experience that is pretty much impossible unless there is some underlying issue you aren't disclosing. On another front you could do an alternative certification program, most states have them, PACE is an example. You teach while you get your certificate."
5553,Maybe you could try applying for the JET program for teaching English in Japan? I think someone mentioned the Korean equivalent of it somewhere in the comments.
5554,Do you know what you’re off to after Korea?
5555,There might also be ESL schools where you live. I have a friend who doesn't have a teaching credential but they work at an ESL school in their city.

5563,"Not me, a few of my coworkers were.  They had no complaints about the ARL program.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between those that were and those that weren't.  Housing is affordable here, good apartments for good prices, some teachers even rent together with other teachers."
5564,I mean if they failed their teaching class do you really think they should be a teacher though?

5566,"Yeah, good luck with that.  Almost no one gets paid to do what they love.  Most of us are just stuck here slaving away, making money for the awful bastards above us.  That's how our economy is structured."
5567,Your feelings are pretty common. Keep at it and it’ll start to feel a little less weird in time.
5568,">Your name checks out lol.

Yep!

>Each one of those options makes well over 6 figures for many individuals.

Define ""many.""  Spoiler alert:  There aren't actually that many people making six figures from blogging or making YouTube videos.  Plus, the only way you get paid much at all from blogging or making YouTube videos is by making the same terrible, clickbaity content that everyone else makes these days, which is already turning our entire culture into garbage.  And there are lots of things that you can't design a business around, not to mention that lots of people aren't business-minded, can't deal with the stress of running one, etc.

>If you have a passion / hobby, its very likely that someone else out there wants to learn / partake in it.

If you have no passions because the world has crushed them out of you, I guess you're just totally out of luck."
5569,"I'm just going to be blunt:  It sounds like you have no real understanding of capitalism or economics in general, among other things."
5570,Exactly ! Quality vs quantity of hours is a biggie for me. I do better with short hours but get a lot done in that timeframe. Good suggestion and I’ll definitely bring that up to my boss once I’ve settled in
5571,"Ok well it worked for me LMFAO

Who pissed in your cereal this morning?"
5572,"The support you’re giving here is admirable — but I think the main problem u/jadedpessimist is highlighting is that just because you may be one of the few people that’s doing what they love for a living doesn’t mean it’s attainable for many, let alone everyone. It’s survivorship bias."
5573,"If there’s one comment OP should listen to it’s this one. While others may tell you you’re exactly where you should be and “you should be happy you have a stable job,” your life is traded off as an expense. 

Find what it is that makes you happy, whether it be travel or being with friends and family and strive to achieve time instead of money."
5574,"You’re young dude, keep your head down and find something to like about it, it’s all new. We live in a time now that one salary job isn’t what you do forever, but for now it’s great experience and the stability and routine has its perks.

Down the line you’ll discover another opportunity after building a bit of a foundation, especially if you have debt you need to start paying off"
5575,Maybe you would like trade school?
5576,"Try your best to stick it out and see if you feel the same in 6 months-1 year or longer perhaps depending on your tolerance.

And pick up hobbies outside of work to keep your life fun and interesting.

I felt the same way when I started working after graduating and I've adjusted nicely into the office schedule. Kinda enjoy it actually."
5577,"What would you do every day, even if you never got paid to do it?

That’s the question you need to ask, and then chase after it…

Get to the 9-5 every day, get that paycheck, but when you go home… don’t go to sleep, don’t turn on the xbox, but instead work…

Work to get out of it, work to achieve your dreams, build something that you are excited to build.

Climbing to the top of a corp ladder will get you nowhere, but building your own ladder will."
5578,why not try working in a restaurant or somewhere else with more activity?
5579,"Thank you for writing this, i feel like we would get along really well over some beers as this im living exactly what you just described as a 22yr old"
5580,Great idea honestly I feel like that would be something I’d really like
5581,I did enjoy working at a bakery and my family frowned upon this but now I see that there is really no right or wrong path. Thinking something like this could be the move
5582,"Heard. I do taxes so I only have go to work a few hours a day from late jan to normally April then after that it’s less and less time at work until it’s basically zero hours until the next tax season. I can’t imagine doing 9-5 every fucking day. It’s my life, not my jobs."
5583,I did this in my first job as well in 2015. I was suicidal and drank myself to near death during the day. Luckily I was able to move careers into something I love now but I can say with 100% certainty I was lucky. Get out now if you can and never ever look back at cube life.
5584,Hey thank you so much for sharing ! I was in your same positions a year ago and definitely enjoy some loosey goosey time while you can :) I worked at a bakery and did a little doordash/random other gigs to keep afloat. I realized I didn’t need a ton of money as long as I paid rent and had good food. Summer is awesome in that sense where you can reset and take the time after so many years of schooling! I’m gonna try to use the next feed months to also sift through what I like and don’t like  as well. I also thought about journalism! Best of luck and enjoy your time :)
5585,"Your name checks out lol.

But there’s always a way to get paid doing what you love. Just takes work. 

The way I look at it is either to make a business about it, Blog about it, or create youtube videos about it.

Each one of those options makes well over 6 figures for many individuals.
If you have a passion / hobby, its very likely that someone else out there wants to learn / partake in it."
5586,I'm in the exact same boat as you.
5587,"Thank you for this….starting this job was a healthy slap in the face, especially since it made me realize what I don’t want to do. It motivated me to explore for my next step and see what I can find that fits how I want to live my life. I really appreciate this"
5588,"Absolutely! That’s what we are all searching for in life. 

Try to not look down on this job. Like you said, this job helped you realize what you don’t want to do. You should be thankful for that! Many don’t find this out until much further in their career. I wish you the best!

Side note: checkout the book called “The millionaire fast lane” by MJ demarco. Was a life changer when I found this and it seems like you’re in a PERFECT position to read it."
5589,"Get your pilots license, fly planes/helicopters for a living"
5590,Last part is so good…thank you for the reminder. I definitely don’t have any interest in the corporate ladder so will definitely use the next few months as an explorative phase
5591,"of course, i say if you enjoyed it that much, go for it, dont let other people alter your opinions"
5592,"That's a rough feeling, I've been there. Sounds to like this is not the career path for you. I would give it a little time to see if it gets better, but try not to get comfortable so you don't get stuck. While I was there I would use it as an opportunity to network build my contacts and look for paths into other careers. Have you looked into doing outside sales?

If I could go back, I would teach myself how to dial in my finances and start working towards financial freedom earlier. I would be pretty close to being able to retire now If I started in my mid 20's. I'm 31 now. I also can't stand the thought of being chained to the cubicle the rest of my life. Hit me up anytime if you want talk."
5593,"The same incorrect, stupid, useless advice that gets posted here all the time.  ""Just wait it out and it'll get better!  Just pick up a hobby! That will keep your life fun and interesting!""  Bullshit."
5594,"There's a lot of choices, research all your options and you may find something you like!"
5595,"I often struggled with considering myself “lazy” in college. I didn’t participate in many clubs (maybe two or three intermittently in my four years), I didn’t go to many parties or take additional courses... but I think the biggest reason for this was that i went way overboard in high school w/ overextending myself and by uni I was just over it. 

I was happy enough to just focus on my studies, have some close friends (same ones for four years), and then spend most of my time relaxing and having some solitude. I was no longer sold on the high productivity = high self worth concept that I believed in high school. I knew for my career in education I would need to have a couple youth-work based clubs in my pocket, so I did those but not much more.

I have one specific regret- that I didn’t use the gym more!! I was paying for access to a gym and pool w my tuition and I barely utilized it. Oh and also the piano practice rooms - I do wish I’d spent more time on those interests to build up better habits and skills."
5596,"Absolutely. I focused more on partying and put in just enough work to pass classes in an easy degree field instead of really trying to figure out what I wanted to do career wise and shoot for a degree that would open more doors for me. Mainly because I was terrible at STEM-like classes in high school and figured I would just fail out in college, waste more money and end up not graduating in 4 years. I essentially shot myself down before I really gave it a try.

I’m 24 now, and after working in a dead end career field I’m not happy with, I regret not trying harder in college to set myself up better for success and happiness in another career. Would I still rush my fraternity, and party and all of that? Of course. But if I could do it all over again I would commit more of myself to my studies and make the time, effort and money I spent on my degree actually worth it."
5597,You're still soooo young
5598,"Senior in college now. I felt like I had all my ducks in a line with extracurriculars, straight A’s, and a great group of friends— then Covid hit and my motivation seriously plummeted. I wouldn’t have dreamed of cheating on tests before, but now I do it all the time since everything is online. It’s really tough to have all these deadlines but no will to do the work. I’m sure in the future I’ll regret not working harder my junior and senior year, but this pandemic really screwed me up lol"
5599,"I can totally agree with you here. I am in my senior year and am a bit burnt out and am also not into college like I was when I started. I am taking finance right now (business major) and I can only imagine how gruesome it is taking multiple finances courses. I too use activities like working out, cleaning, or watching movies to disconnect from my school work to keep my mind going. This lack of school enthusiasm, paired with the pandemic has really killed my motivation."
5600,There are definitely some fluff majors out there. Sorry.
5601,"My social life was great. My issue was my major. I majored in sociology and I loved it. I learned a lot and it helped to shape my world views. The issue is unless you work as a social worker or something in law enforcement/criminal justice there isn’t a whole lot to do with the degree. I worked as a counselor for a few years and enjoyed it but I ultimately ended up going back to school for software engineering. I had a lot of fun my first go through and I don’t necessarily “regret” much but I could have saved myself a lot of time, energy and money if I had been more serious my first time around."
5602,"It seems like most fall into two categories; either they studied something rigorous and regret not living it up, or they studied some fluff major and regret their post-graduation quality of life."
5603,Does your school have a counselor? Maybe you should talk about it?
5604,"Yes. 

Social life was great but I didn't try so hard to actually learn and do well in my classes. Never failed a class & graduated in 4 years but graduated with quite a mediocre GPA. 

I finished with an Economics degree but if I could go back I would've double majored or at least majored in MIS since that's the line of work I've fallen into. Back then I just didn't really have a plan for what I wanted to do work-wise after graduation which most likely explains my lack of motivation."
5605,"Give yourself a break here, you're truly just trying to survive unprecedented times and they're called unprecedented times for a reason. Clearly, I don't know you but I bet in the future that it won't be working hard that you'll regret but you'll regret being so hard on yourself during these times. You'll hopefully look back and think, I'm glad I was able to pull myself through that."
5606,"Totally feel this way. I was a little older when I started going to university so I felt like I never fit in because I was always 2 or 3 years older than most kids in my classes. I joined a lot of networking groups and clubs while on campus, but I never really made good friends with anyone. It also doesn't help I had to work a lot to support myself during college. But oh well, what can I do now."
5607,There were a few classes that I wrote off the beginning because I thought it was boring. Then later in the class it got really interesting and I was upset I didn't take the beginning seriously. Specifically geology since I now live in the southwest surrounded by rocks
5608,"I wish i was more lazy, trying in college doesnt amount to much of anything. Cs get degrees"
5609,"Not really. I got the degree, that’s all that matters. I made myself look good on the resume and learned 90% of the skills on the job."
5610,"I had a pretty active social life in college (dates, parties, spent time outside a lot), and have been experiencing extremely hard time making any friends when became a working professional. It was quite hard to overcome loneliness, but now I am feeling just great staying home and playing games, etc., even before pandemic (haven’t made any new friends since graduation). So I really think it kinda always becomes lonely for those who get into workforce after college so you are not missing out currently imo.

However, I agree that during college years it is important to network more and make some connections. Having fun is also important cuz you might just never have that opportunity again."
5611,"I’m in between. Graduated with a bachelor’s in Math, super tough major, but I also partied 4 times a week. Only focused on major classes though so all of my non major classes took a hit.

It’s funny because my overall GPA and my math class GPA have like a .4 difference. Still ended up with that post graduation regret though but mostly due to not networking with professors."
5612,"Yes. I completely regret not fully utilizing all the resources my school provided. They want you to succeed, make sure you’re using everything they give you."
5613,I only regret worrying about the future. My college was a very introverted one and I had a mental breakdown my senior year cuz i thought that that was bad for networking. And the on-campus clubs werent shit for fuck when it came to advertising. But now I'm r/antiwork so... Yeah...
5614,"At these prices? Definitely job training. If the government decides to vibe check academia (who really have it coming) by shit-canning the loan program, maybe prices will drop enough to start considering the pursuit of a degree for the sake of education. For now, there's books and youtube videos."
5615,"Does it make sense to drop five figures on something with no ROI? I’ll tell you the only two scenarios where it does:

1.	You’re filthy rich
2.	You’re young and stupid"
5616,"Community college is a great option. I went to one. Highly recommend. Doesn’t change the fact that you have to, y’know, get a job after graduating. 

>	narrow capitalistic lens

I was wondering when something like that would pop out. Lol."
5617,"No. I used to extremely socially reserved and depressed. Going out and making friends, partying, spending time away from my small ass room indirectly improved my grades because I had a better state of mind. My GPA was much higher after I had a life."
5618,"I wasn’t lazy in the sense that I was genuinely into some clubs / performing groups. I remember those experiences better than most of the academic content. Also so glad I took a programming class even though I wasn’t a CS major. It’s a useful tool for automating entry level tasks in any career path.

If I could pick a different major knowing what I do now, I would have majored in Biology with a minor in CS or Statistics (which might have led me to Bioinformatics).

No regrets on the friendships, even though I’m out of contact with most of my college friends."
5619,"I wish i started college with a clear goal of what i want to get out of it. If I had that I think I would have been more driven to apply myself to what I am learning. I didn’t realize until my 4th year what I really wanted to do career wise, but with so much of my college career behind me, it’s a tough situation. I am very sure that I will graduate soon, but I think if I had that drive from the beginning, maybe my GPA would be a lot better, or maybe my transcript would look a lot better, or more likely then not I would be more knowledgeable in the career field I would like to enter. But it is what it is right? Obv could be a lot worse. I’m just grateful that my bad habits didn’t get me kicked out of college."
5620,"I feel like I should’ve tried to initiate more social interactions. I did make friends but I feel like I could’ve made some more quality friendships and/or had a more lively social life had I been more friendly/initiating. I found it difficult to feel close to people, even those I considered friends, so I think I needed to also feel more comfortable with being vulnerable with others. These are things I’m working on in therapy now and I’m not sure I would have even been capable of making some of these changes in college, but..."
5621,I’m in college right now and I’m watching it pass me by but my trauma makes it so difficult to try harder
5622,"Yeah. I wish I had not worked and taken out more loans instead to be honest. Working really tanked my GPA. And I wish I had done more internships(why did nobody tell me about all these cool internships for ecology while I was in school????).

And I wish I had dated way more. Way way more."
5623,"I worked my ass off im college. Had a fully booked schedule 7am to 10pm 6 days a week. 4.0 GPA, Division 1 Athlete, all academic all American, all while working at least 2 jobs. I wish I had been lazier. I had a full mental breakdown by the end of junior year which I barely survived. I never stopped to think if the classes I was working hard at were actually things I cared about and now I'm in public accounting and hate my life."
5624,"Same! I tried using our school’s gym my freshman year but the stupid hand print scanner could never pick up my fingerprints, so I just didn’t since it was always too much of a hassle."
5625,Half of the people or more working in their respective fields didn’t major in that so it’s normal to work in a field and went to school for something completely different (unless it’s specialized). Most jobs want things done their way anyways so it’ll be like you’re learning from scratch regardless of what you studied.
5626,"Thats what tore me apart in school

I want to live in the forest. But you cant afford to live in a forest when you get old unless you didn't spend all of your youth in the forest. Its horrible"
5627,"If I’d ever figured out what I *wanted* to do I wouldn’t have become a CPA in the first place. My whole family is CPAs and so I knew what  I was signing up for: excellent pay, lots of vacation days, and a job that really fucking sucks. But I never found something I enjoyed that I was good enough at to support myself, so accounting it is."
5628,"I didn’t hate my major, but it wasn’t until my junior year of college that I realized I wanted to become an ultrasound tech. I could’ve done that straight out of high school..."
5629,"Okay my answer is gonna be off-topic. I don't actually hate my majors (polsci, econ) but I realised that I wanted nothing to do with a career in either field. My degrees are pretty generic anyway and people go into various lines of work. If I ever go to grad school, I'd choose clinical psychology :)"
5630,"Life is trade-offs. I think one thing that is true about my generation is that we watched too many Disney-like movies/shows that told us we could do whatever we want however we wanted. Or maybe it’s just me. 

But if you want to live in a cabin in the forest, work and save towards that! I don’t think it’s that far-fetched and unachievable at all."
5631,"I had a similar path, aerospace as an undergrad major was honestly terrible and I regret not going with comp sci, applied math, or physics. All it does it give you a pigeonholed mechE degree IMO"
5632,"Here's my 'If I Could Redo College Wishlist' :

* ***Reduce the size of the student loans I took out***
   * The regret of choosing a certain major is only amplified if that major is attached to debt
   * I didn't start building wealth until my loans were paid off. I wish I had taken advantage of that extra time and the compound interest that would have come with it.
* ***Focus on learning skills that can be applied to many different fields of study. Having more tools in my toolkit would have opened up many more doors for me.  I'd particularly focus on the following:***
   * **Public Speaking**
      * I wish I had spent more time practicing presenting my points to a room full of my peers and supervisors 
   * **Data Skills, especially in an open source tool (i.e. R or Python)**
      * Data wrangling (i.e. querying and manipulating data)
      * Reporting and data visualization
      * Writing functions (i.e. thinking about how to solve series of problems rather than individual problems) 
      * Version control (Git) to track all changes to your work
   * **Computer basics (especially in Windows)**
      * It would have reduced how much I relied on IT earlier in my career
      * This would also have drastically enhanced my experience with using my personal computer
   * **Becoming at least conversationally fluent in another language**
      * I took 2 years of French in college, but I wish I had pursued it further. 
      * Understanding another language would have granted me access to so many more people and thoughts (not to mention job opportunities)
* ***Learn more about the following topics:***
   * **Personal Finance**
      * This goes back to the student loans point I made earlier, but it also includes learning more about investment strategies, budgeting tools, and taxes
      * I could have started planning my finances and increasing my net wealth far earlier
   * **Psychology**
   * **Negotiation**
   * **Marketing**
   * **Nutrition**
   * **Fitness**
* ***Do more of the following:***
   * **Say ""No"" to things that didn't interest me at all**
      * I went to so many hangouts/parties/bars that I didn't care about at all, and that was such a giant waste of time. I don't regret going to the ones I wanted to go to, but I wish I had realized that turning things down would have been ok.
   * **Go to live events related to my interests**
      * I really wish I had gone to more concerts, movies, and lectures from guest speakers, especially since most of them were free for students!
   * **Go to office hours**
      * Experts were setting aside time where I could have gone and picked their brain and what excites them about the subjects they were researching and lecturing about and I practically never went. I was an idiot. I would have learned so much if I had just shown up there
   * **Use the gym**
      * I have paid a lot of money to go to gyms that are nowhere near as nice as FSU's Leach Center. I wish I had taken advantage of that gym way more than I did."
5633,Accounting major here graduating in May. Refuse to pursue accounting as a career choice though. Know I’ll hate it. Good thing is the accounting degree is well respected in the business world and can get you a job anywhere esssentially.
5634,"In nursing now. It's not that I really hate it, I just feel like I can't grasp the material fast enough and I picture myself being a terrible nurse. 

I wish I would've gone for something in computers, a veterinarian, or even finance."
5635,"Not gone to college. Seriously, it’s been almost 10 years since I graduated and I can’t make more than hourly wage. I didn’t hate my major it just doesn’t cut it in the real world. It’s better to just go into a trade or vocation."
5636,"Currently studying french & information science. I would have preferred to do food science or a business degree. I hate my current major, it’s uninteresting."
5637,"Exactly!
Luckily I was able to refocus on software and simulation with my internship and research which allowed me to escape the pigeon hole. Not sure how’d it would’ve ended otherwisez"
5638,"I graduated with a degree in Marketing. I thought I was over corporate business, but I’m just discovering that politics is even shadier, with longer hours. I’m thinking of getting a grad degree in Data Analytics, Stat or Finance."

5640,"I was a communications major. It was fun during school, but now I’m struggling to find a job in my field. I think it’s over saturated and just a numbers game at this point. I would’ve gotten a degree in marketing or something else more business related if I could go back. Hell, maybe even teaching. I’m miserable right now working IT Helpdesk. Don’t know what the next step is or what the next goal should be. I feel directionless."
5641,I feel this. Got my bachelors in mechanical engineering but all of my internship and work experience is sales engineering and project management. I definitely would have switched to industrial engineering had I known the line of work I’d find myself in. Way too many nights filled with headaches in the library while my IE roommate did all his homework comfortably at our apartment while smoking weed.
5642,"I'm going to agree with you on this. I'm just a couple of years out of school and have done mainly sales-based tasks and projects in my job roles, while having a BS in mechanical engineering. While the ME degree got me the job, I think IE would have helped a bit more and suited my skill sets more. And I wouldn't have taken that awful heat transfer class!"
5643,What was your major if you don't mind sharing?
5644,"I don't hate my undergrad major in the slightest and really enjoyed the independent research I got to do. However, graduating with a BA in environmental studies was like telling employers ""hey, I have a vague degree in pessimism.""

I actually focused on how human relationship to nature is highly dependent on individual/social factors, meaning that a lot of mainstream environmentalism is isolating the population support we need the most. Employers in interviews and others I'd tell would be like ""wow! that's so interesting! we need perspectives like this!"" but at the same time say ""eh, we can't turn a profit from it"". I feel like bachelors without masters or solid work experience is only good for profit-driven fields like low-level administration, office jobs, insurance, etc.

I'm in an environmental design degree now, hoping that getting my master's in a specialization with marketable skills and a trade improves my job opportunities. At the end of the day, no one cares how important your research or knowledge is if it's not able to turn a profit."
5645,"right? Like if you want to be a therapist/psychologist you should know within a semester that you're headed to grad school. Otherwise you can do all sorts of non-profit work, case management, and a ton of stuff with both degrees. People don't fucking pay attention to what they're doing and then suddenly four years later- \*shocked pikachu face\*"
5646,"I graduated with a finance major, which was not interesting to me at all. Now I got a typical office job and it is unbearable. 

I wish I would've done something related to art/design back when I was still motivated, since that's something I'm really interested in"
5647,"I actually am the reverse- I hated my major in school, only to find I actually do enjoy my professional life as an architect. I enjoy thematically what I do and my day to day tasks, but when you're consistently pulling all-nighters in school and miss out on a social life because of it, that really sucks the life out of you. Plus, I found a lot of my peers and faculty in school could be pompous, narcissistic a\*\*holes. Granted, there are offices that are like this, many of which actively seek to perpetuate studio culture because the people there loved school and our insular design culture. I actively sought out places that were more humble, valued work/life balances, and where the people were in the field more so because they enjoyed being dorky in one way in the office and having their own set of quirky interests outside of it. Luckily, there actually are quite a few places like this in my field, as it seems there is an active divide between people who view this as a job/interest and people who view it as a lifestyle. I found the former, and couldn't be happier. 

During school though, there were multiple times where I thought about quitting and going into public policy. I actually am interested in politics and local urban policy, so it seemed interesting and I really did love the policy electives I took. Glad I didn't though. What really got me through was my stubborn attitude towards life- don't quit until you've seen something though to the end, and a couple professors that I actually do admire deeply that told me I do quality work and I should stay on the path to licensure."
5648,"Fellow finance major here, current undergradute student. I've definitely learned a lot of cool and interesting things, but overall I'm not as in love with my major as my freshman self thought I'd be. I don't know why my younger self expected otherwise, but a lot of it is pretty dull, mind-numbing stuff. 

My degree requires me to take some non-finance classes business too, and maybe this is a case of me succumbing to ""grass is always greener on the other side"" syndrome, but the business law classes that I took sometimes have me wishing that I picked that as my major instead...."
5649,I hear you but also you have to work in community mental health for roughly 3-5 years before working for yourself as a therapist/psychologist. At least the corporate world has a fast turn around in terms of salary/achievement.
5650,"I have a degree in Supply Chain Management and work for a major industrial supplier and i’ve found it’s not my ideal job at all. Loved the topic in schooling, but it’s different in the applicable world. Looking back I wish i would’ve followed a more passionate or ambitious career."
5651,My degree is in sociology and it absolutely wasn’t worthless but ok
5652,"Social science degrees are about what you make of them. Connections, extra curricular activities, internships will all make degrees like political science, sociology, or psychology absolutely fulfilling."
5653,The grass is always greener. I hate the corporate world and working in an office; but then when I find out how much my friends who didn’t go that route make (even the ones in high skill trades) and I hate it a little less. There’s trade offs for everything.
5654,"took civil engineering, realized it's not fulfilling if i didnt go the research path (i like design, but hated construction management); should have took com sci instead: more opportunities, and dare i say, future-proof"
5655,"It might be that you’re personality is still currently built for people who like the more abrasive type. You might be stuck in a transitory period right now. If you genuinely prefer being nice, keep it up and pay attention to the people that notice it and reach out to them. You’ll find strong friends in (most of) them."
5656,This is some very quality input. Thank you.
5657,Being a dick isn't how you get friends. Confidence and charisma as well as hobbies are the best way to make friends.
5658,"The lack of friends isn't correlated in the decline in your dickish behavior, it is due to the subtle transition out of highly concentrated peer group into a much more diluted general population. In high school, everyone was within a few years of each other, living a generally shared experience. You had easy hooks to start and maintain friendships. The effort to required to sustain those friendships was kind of baked in, everyone was going to see each other because you were required to be in the same general location, 5 days a week from 8ish to 4 pm.

After high school, and even college, there are fewer ""easy"" and serindipidous friendships. It can be hard to relate to a co-worker who is going through a divorce with two kids as 20 something, and it can be equally jarring for someone older to relate to the dating life of a 23 year old who never had to call a land line and ask a parent of someone they are interested in ""Is So&So available?"".

What you are finding out is that, [making friends as an adult is hard](https://www.bustle.com/p/why-making-new-friends-as-adult-is-so-hard-what-to-do-about-it-13110605)! If you think back to how you met friends in high school, how many did you make simply because you were sat next to each other in class, or you were paired up on a project? Friendships in high school were like shopping at the super market. As long as you had a few bare necessities, you were bound to walk out with a few friends. Friendship as an adult takes away the convince of the super market, and now you have to cultivate you own. It isn't as simple as stopping by the store and picking up a carton of eggs, sometimes as an adult you have to build the chicken coop, and raise the chickens in order to get a couple of eggs. Seek out those shared experiences that you used to take for granted. Find a new hobby, or revive an old one and join a group, a shared interest in things can help be that same foothold that you had when you had to share a class with someone. Good luck!"
5659,[deleted]
5660,"I was in the same boat as you. Complete prick in high school and had a moderate circle of friends, in the transition phase of me realizing thats now how I wanted to represent myself, I had to realize that those people who were my friends in high school were only my friends as a matter of convenience/pity/proximity and that as people get older they have less time to play games with people.

I was not able to repair most of the damage I did to the friendships I had in high school. A lot of my friends now are primarily work and college friends and even now my defensive posturing can sometimes drive them away. It takes a lot of work but being nice isnt what *gets you friends* per se, but being nice just makes you happier and more pleasant to be around. The people will fall in line eventually. Just live a good life and everything will come together."
5661,"To add onto this, the memory of you being a dick also sticks, and just because you're nice now doesn't erase people's *impression* of you. Impressions last, and it takes time to live it down. OP, you seem like you're in your mid 20s, which is also around the time when people start reevaluating who they value as friends, and so maybe they're remembering all the times you were a dick.

That being said, continue being nice. That's just a good quality to have.

If you're thinking of being a dick just to have friends, then you're not as nice as you think you are. And the friends you will acquire would most likely just be superficial acquaintances"
5662,"> Tl;Dr I was a dick in high school and people wanted to be my friend but now I’m nice and I have no friends. Now I’m debating on whether I should be a dick again. 

If you get that chance, apologize to people and move on. Don't expect them to forgive you. If you don't have the chance to apologize, it's okay. Learn from it and move on.

Build enough of a good/positive habit and you'll draw in people who have the same vibe over time. Go and meet people and be a good person. There will never be enough good people in the world and we need every one. :)

Thank you for self-reflecting."
5663,"Idk dude. I don’t have many friends and I’m still in high school. I don’t have the social skills to connect to people I don’t know/do know that well, whether it be sitting next to them and doing activities for school. Even with the friends I do have, I get weirded out cuz I don’t know how to start a lasting conversation. I just be nice to everyone I come in contact with and people notice it. For example, I go to a pickle ball court to play often and I met adults that I enjoy to play with/against. I guess I do connect with them better than my sport/school friends. You might just connect with older/younger people better and that’s the age range that you can have many friends with. Don’t take my word on it, I’m a sophomore hahahah"
5664,"Dude, same life. However, I got dickier after high school and it still drove people away. People dissipate in adulthood regardless. I find that it’s harder for the abused because we have literally been trained to keep people at arms length so that we don’t have to tell our secrets (what happens at home stays at home was my abusers favorite line). An SO as well as a dog help me a lot when I feel really lonely because when things get hard I tend to push people away. Ultimately, therapy is needed for me to change this behavior but quite frankly I don’t have the money or the time. I would say do what feels right, if you feel like you should be nice, be nice. If you feel like being a dick, be a dick. People fade from your life regardless."
5665,"Probably just growing up. That happens for some reason. 

Don’t be a dick bro."
5666,I have said sorry to a good few of them.
5667,It’s always nice to hear about things getting better in people’s lives
5668,"I found I left my old friends behind and had to develop new friends whenever I changed my living conditions. Since you enjoy helping people why not volunteer somewhere? At least you will meet people who enjoy at least one thing in common. Other things are athletic leagues in your area, community organizations from places of worship to historical societies. There is always something but you have to go find it. At school everyone was thrown together. That’s easy"
5669,To be honest don’t read too far into it. It’s really easy to have lots of friends in high school and I think almost everybody experiences a decrease in social connections when you graduate and move on. It’s probably not correlated at all with your behavior and could just be your living situation or things out of your control. I have much fewer friends and my gf lost a ton too just because we work now and moved away and our neighbors have nothing to relate to with us. Sometimes life just puts you in your situation and the best thing is to just be content with yourself and look for opportunities to eventually make new friends.
5670,"High school is like being in a shark tank every day and a lot of times people would rather be friends with the dick than be targeted by the dick. That might explain why you had a lot of friends in high school, plus school provides daily proximity to people you have things in common with. I don’t think reverting back to what worked then is the answer. Just my two cents, of course. And I promise your being a nicer person isn’t the problem. It’s just a lot harder to make friends as an adult. Maybe try joining a social or service club or an adult sports league or looking for groups that interest you on meetup.com. The more people you expose yourself to, the better your chances of finding people you click with."
5671,"Literally everyone loses many of their so-called friends after high school ends.  It’s natural, and makes perfect sense that it would happen.  Everyone is done with mandatory schooling and then embarks on whatever they feel their next step should be.  

Some people end up going to the same colleges and keep therefore in touch like nothing has changed during their stay there because it’s a no brained to have some friends going into a new experience if you have the option.

A lot of others will move out of state, go work somewhere right out of high school,  hang out in the hometown doing nothing for a little bit, etc.  People that were friends for years in high school might try to keep up the relationships from a distance, but it almost never lasts long.  They meet new people and you just end up being a high school memory.  It’s nothing against you, it’s just how it is.

However in your particular case, since you admit to being a dick in high school, I’d assume you got a lot of attention and had “friends” because you may have been viewed as an alpha of sorts.  In their head they may have been waiting for the opportunity to not have to hang out with someone like that anymore, and not worry about the repercussions of “de-friending” them in an environment that they’d have to see the person every day.

Ending high school is the perfect time to restructure your friend base because everyone splits up and is no longer really acquainted or expected to see each other every day.  You may have been on their dump list and just slowly started seeing those decisions come to fruition.

So after all of that, I’d offer the advice of: no, don’t be a dick on purpose just to try to attract friends.  Being a dick as an adult doesn’t help you. It attracts pretty shady figures may even land you in more trouble than you were looking for at worst, and at best it just nurtures a really bad personality trait that will pretty much ensure you won’t find lasting relationships with people you actually like, given that you are self aware that you were a dick in the past and changed to a nicer person over time."
5672,"You’re not in high school anymore so people don’t put up with shit. In high school you’re forced to be around the same people so of course you eventually make friends. But as an adult you no longer have that so it’s actually
Harder to make friends anyway. Being a dick will only make it worse. Plus do you really want to be a mean person just so you can have friends? I think you’re better than that, the fact that you made this post shows you wouldn’t like yourself if you did"
5673,Very well put!
5674,"third'ed. this is good advice; it helps that when you're younger a lot of social existence encourages you to find (if not forcing you to spend time with) others who share your hobbies.

there's a reason they say it's harder to make friends as an adult. OP is just dealing with this.

The best advice is to find something that you can do to put yourself in contact with others who might share your interests.

Some quick, top of the head ideas:

* join an indoor soccer or flag football league as a ringer (they'll put you on a team) or just join a gym that offers a lot of classes you could jump in on that's included in membership, or find a morning jogging club if you're into that
* ask around for a D&D group starting up or needing someone to join in, or visit a local game shop and ask what events they are hosting soon (they will be hosting something). same goes for video games if you're not into tabletop
* if you're a musician, post ads asking if people want to jam or are looking for a person who plays \[whatever you play\]. there's a million places you can find stuff like this--college dorm corkboards; online music forums; etc.

GL!"
5675,"That's an awesome start. You've already done more than many people. 

Don't be a jerk and continue the progress of self-development; one day at a time and one thing at a time. *In the near and far future, you will thank yourself for this.*"
5676,"That’s retarded. Literally one of the pillars of relationship formation is to treat others like you’d like to be treated. I don’t see who’d want to be treated bad. Don’t try to go all “subliminal psychology”, because it certainly doesn’t apply in this context."
5677,"What “basic psychological level”? Everything I’ve been taught about psychology says the opposite of what you’re claiming. On an anecdotal level, everyone who is a dick to me is promptly removed from my life. And I’ve seen others do the same."
5678,R/niceguys
5679,You might be an incognito dick
5680,"you had friends in high school because people that age correspond being a dick with being confident. people flock to confident people and while you might not be a dick anymore, you might not be doing anything that exudes confidence. my advice is not be a dick, because people your age will not be your friend because of it. maybe pick up a hobby or volunteer somewhere, you’ll meet more people who are interested in the same thing as you and if you’re good at it people will naturally gravitate towards you."
5681,"TLDR: In high school people had no choice but to see you, and if you were generally a dick, it was a good strategy to be on your good side so you would not be a dick to them, or less often. After high school, they could choose whether to keep in touch or not, and if you were a dick, people might skidaddle.  Now friends have to be made piecemeal from zero, so your artificial popularity doesn't help. Being a dick will make that harder. Being nice is a good start. Don't worry: time will do the rest an friendships will come.

&#x200B;

Have you heard of ""correlation is not causation""? When people eat more ice creams the weather is hotter. Eating ice cream won't keep you warm. So in high school you were a dick and had lots of friends, out of high school you are a nice guy and have less friends. OK so your character changed... correlation. But other things changed too: you were in high school, then ...you entered Adultworld. I suggest that correlation might be more useful to you.

High school is an artificial environment, it imposes a community, a small cohort of people who share with you a third of your life, cultural references, memories, tasks, tribes, are all the same age, with the same teachers, classes, in the same neighbourhood. Many of those might even have gone through school with you. You have limited social choices, limited social opportunities, limited out of school responsibilities. To some extent you are stuck with those around you, so you will hang out with them, regardless. In addition, you may have a lot of social insecurities, around fitting in, around friendship, dating, not being left out or ostracised. That can sometimes mean that the person who is borderline horrible, is ""apparently"" more popular, because it is safer to be in his or her good side pitying those they are belittling, than to be one of the targets. So people may have been nice to you, hung out with you, but not really liked you, or liked you with reservations or insecurities. But in high school, there was no way to fully avoid you, so probably best to keep you sweet.

Adult life breaks that necessity of community. You now don't see everyone every day, and you choose, whether you carry on connections or not. You also make new ones, at work, in your hobbies, in your new educational space. So people generally drift. Few of us have more than one or two high school friends in our late 20s onward. Many have none. If you were a dick, that will be even more the case. People don't have to invest in that guy who was a dick back when. And new friendships take time. Many people in that transition after high school experience what you do: a bit of social uncertainty. Uni/college helps those who do that; work sometimes; hobbies too. But mostly, time helps. You find your centre, your passions, your journey, and along the way, you meet, always, at some point, fellow travellers.

&#x200B;

So don't worry: you are not alone in struggling socially after the high school village. And friends await you. But if you revert to being a dick, you'll have to wait longer. Keep being someone you would like as a friend, and friendship will come."
5682,Fuck you
5683,"Agreed. It’s just that many dicks give off the illusion of confidence and charisma. Drop the insecurities and you get the best of both worlds: a kind, confident and charismatic person."
5684,Very encouraging thank you.
5685,"good pay, flexible schedule, friendly *and* good manager and coworker

Reason: 

Selected:

1. Good colleagues: I have theorized that how bearable a work is depends entirely on the people around you. If both managers and coworkers are friendly, competent, and understanding, the job will be easy regardless of how hard it actually is. If you have good coworkers to share the load and complain with, that just builds camaradery. If your manager is competent and understanding, you won't have to put up with bad management and that is good for morale. 

2. Good pay: so I can afford to have savings and make investments.

3. Flexible schedule: I have hobbies, and I would like to have time for it at reasonable hours.
 
Not selected:

1. Aesthetics is really a no factor in the grand scheme of things

2. Benefits are great, but they can mean anything. Give me a good enough pay, and benefits can be ignored.

3. Easy work = boring work = unrewarding work = me hating myself. Any job too easy is not worthwhile.

4. I've gotten used to long commute, so I just use my time in traffic for something productive like a good video essay or podcast."
5686,Think I'd personally swap out the schedule for good benefits/perks in the top 4. I like sticking religiously to a 9 to 6- there's a hard boundary for what's personal time and what's work time.
5687,and it'd be good for your personal development as well which would help in negotiating higher pay and promotions

1. Good Managers = Managers that are easygoing and chill will keep their retention rate high
2. Good Coworkers = This is also important because I want to be around people that I at least tolerate, get along with

Use your resources wisely. If you have the skill to get the job, thats great, but that is half the battle. 

I was an illustration major in college, but decided to pivot more towards design. I did not go to a well known/top of line school. I was able to get internships/freelance all throughout college, and have a job right out of school because I networked / was ready with a portfolio for any opportunity/seeking out opportunities and using the resources and people my professors knew. I was easily able to find a second job in design once I decided I didn't like my first one. 

If you don't do this during school, you aren't doomed, it just takes time. Also another thing to stress is, don't network with just the intention to use someone. Be kind, make friends, help them out when you can, and they will do the same for you."
5724,Which field do you plan to work in after graduation?
5725,My comment had nothing to do with the usefulness of the degree itself. I realized by my senior year that I hate politics but it was too late to switch majors so I'm not sure what I want to do when I graduate.
5726,"Oh okay, what were you’re interest then?"
5727,"Woohoo! Congrats! I am also a designer, so it always makes me happy to hear other designers getting job!!"
5728,Well done!!
5729,Reminds me of my own journey not many months ago. Congratulations!
5730,congratulations
5731,Congrats!
5732,That’s the degree I did and I turned out fine?
5733, It's not that politics don't interest me. I just hate all the partisan BS. I've done campaign work in the past canvassing and it was terrible. I guess I'll try and stick with politics for now until I figure out what I really want.
5734,I'm an engineer but I wish I had gotten something like polysci
5735,Bachelors in construction management. Construction management
5736,I don’t use my degree (psychology) in my job but it helped me get an amazing job that was a trainable job and the requirements for it required a degree.
5737,"Absolutely and I would most definitely do it again. People always trash talk it and say that you don’t learn anything directly useful. I think that is completely untrue. Sure the programs I use at work were never even broached, nor will the specific tasks we did ever be done in “real life”, but all the team projects, written essays, public speaking, prioritizing deadlines and having to think critically most definitely have helped me be great at my job, in every way.


Edit: Business Management degree currently working in HR in a supervisory capacity."
5738,What’s your degree and job?
5739,"I’m a data manager at a pharmaceutical company, which means I help build studies then manage the data once the studies are live."
5740,"If I could go back, I’d definitely choose and try to get into a cheaper University. Attended a Private Uni and the cost was bollocks, with the same quality of education as my high school (high school was already ranked high nationally so I guess).

This whole thread is just a bunch of yes’s though. I feel hesitant to say no."
5741,"Yes college was worth it, even if I don’t use it for a job. I’m a stay at home mom now. But college taught me about the world and fundamentally changed my outlook and who I am as a person. That’s valuable it was worth the work to do it and it was worth the work I did to pay for it (worked full time through college.) My two degrees do impact my job but they did more than that by shaping me."
5742,I truly believe college made me into a better person.  On top of that it helps you get ahead of those that don't have a degree. Maybe the stuff you learned doesn't matter but having a degree certainly gives you the advantage over someone who doesn't.
5743,"Degree in business and now work in consulting, absolutely worth it"
5744,What job?
5745,Same degree and job. Same answer. Absolutely yes
5746,"Same situation here. The minute I got my masters, the job offers stopped coming in and I started hearing that I'm overqualified for positions. It's been pretty brutal."
5747,"I agree with you. I recently went back at looked at a business analysis I had in business 101 vs an analysis I did in senior year and It’s a huge difference. 

I think that people don’t realize how much they learn and how their knowledge builds on itself"
5748,"Mechanical engineer working at an automotive company. I have two associates that I got before transferring to a university where I got my bachelors. My bachelors was worth it despite the hardship in getting a degree in engineering but if I would do it again, maybe not. I work in an office and sometimes I wish I could have done a trade. I probably wouldn't be making as much ad I do currently and I'd probably be in alot more physical pain but I do think it's much more enjoyable for me to work with my hands

Try out community college to try different areas that interest you."
5749,Different degree. Same job. Absolutely.
5750,"My boss does most of the programming using SAS as a reporting tool and I have taken some coding classes myself but still have a lot to learn. Statistics, no. Our clinical department has an statistics department and they do all of the analysis."
5751,Shame you feel scared to share your genuine opinion. Reddit is a circle jerk
5752,"It depends on what your major is. If you’re getting a liberal arts degree it’s incredibly important, but if your major is preparing you for a specific job it matters less. I work with a lot of people who wasted a ton of money getting accounting degrees from private colleges."
5753,did you have to code or learn any statistics for the job? curious
5754,"Yes my college degree was worth it, I grew significantly as a person, started seeing life in a positive manner, stopped seeing everything in a dark light, i made lots of friends of all races, both genders, different cultures and religion, got super involved on campus and improved a lot in my classes. I am happy and pleased with my college experience. Would i go back again, debateable, i'd probably would go to a community college first."
5755,"It's weird. Everyone is expected to have a bachelor's at minimum nowadays but if you have anything more, a lot of companies say ""they're so accomplished why would they want to work here""."
5756,I transferred into university and engineering has alot of transfers with people who were 30+ years old. Many came from a military background or some sort of trade. It was always nice dealing with older guys since they brought alot more experience.
5757,"Hell to the yes. However, I started off as a community college and got a free associate degree. Then I transferred to a commuter university and networked. I had fun while making sure my priories were in line. My degree did open doors for me. Make sure you network, that’s more important then your degree."
5758,"Have my AA, and I only used it probably once. Wanted to go for my Bachelor's, but I'm burned out from college. I'll go back when I'm more stable."
5759,Yes and yes.  Electrical engineering for both.
5760,"If you’re hating every minute of it, then it might not be the right major for you. Personally, I loved studying business and even to this day find it fascinating to learn more about the intricacies of companies. If you’re studying entrepreneurship and still hating it but aspiring to be an entrepreneur there may be an issue there, what exactly is it that you hate, the work? The content? The lack of flexibility?

I’d say, even if your goal is to one day become an entrepreneur, it’s still better to finish with a degree, assuming it won’t be a large financial problem for you. You always hear of the stories of the Zuckerbergs and the Jobs and the Gates who dropped out and became successful, but unless you have some groundbreaking idea or some large natural wealth of knowledge I think you’ll find it a lot easier navigating the world of entrepreneurship with a bachelors under your belt."
5761,"Absolutely. It was extremely painful (4U) in many ways; never had a relationship and felt that friends there were often transient. But I graduated a semester early with a major in computer science and debt free. I now clear about $160,000 a year working in tech."
5762,"Yes, but dont let some mislead guidance counselor or academic advisor tell you it doesnt matter what university you go to. It matters. Academic pedigree matters."
5763,"Hi, I'm a business management and entrepreneurship major, currently hardly halfway through and absolutely hating every minute of it. Do you think it would still be worth it if your goal was to be entrepreneurial as opposed to getting a good job with your degree?"
5764,"I’ve read many threads elsewhere where people say it wasn’t worth it for them. And based on a lot of the content here, I’m surprised so many people are saying yes, honestly.

Please, feel free to share your honest opinion. I’m sure it’s helpful for others to see a range of perspectives. And no doubt, there are others who feel the same way as you, no matter if they’re directly here in this thread or not."
5765,"Exactly. People tend to think of nihlism as being bad, but for me it is freeing. My life has no inherrent meaning or purpose so i can decide what i want it to be. I enjoy fast cars, amassing wealth, and having no kids, so thats exactly what i am going to do with my life until my eventual expiration."
5766,"I majored in Economics. I thought I’d love what I’m working in, but part of me wishes I went for social work or something. That may just be the missing school part of me saying that though. 
And thank you for this."
5767,My parents are social workers. The one thing they always related to me was to never be a social worker.
5768,[deleted]
5769,"Overworked, underpaid, unappreciated, etc."
5770,any particular reason why?
5771,"The transition from one schedule of college and having time off versus 9-5 schedule can be difficult but try to think of it as finding a job so you can invest in your hobbies and try to have one or two trips a year. Plus hopefully you find a team that you like working with. Having a positive outlook on it will help your mental health. If you’re having a hard time landing a job, definitely work on yourself, your health and ways to make you stand out as a candidate maybe a certification or something"
5772,"I only just finally got over the mental prison of thinking continuing in academia is the way to derive a good career and success in life. Once you can let go of expectations and focus on what makes you happy, life becomes easier. Do things you’ve always wanted to do. Watch Netflix too much, go to a painting class, start doing club sports, travel. Embrace the serenity of not having anything you *have* to do just because society says so"
5773,I’m right there with you.
5774,"Fuck bitches, get money. I finally understand lil Wayne."
5775,"I’ve read that a lot in a few subreddits. I keep thinking of teaching or social work as a plan B and C even though plan A is the best for me aside from this “lost” feeling. If I switched plans now I’d be in more student debt and in a lower paying yield, but I feel like I’d feel more fulfilled. I’m just overthinking life I know that and I just need to make new goals with where I am."
5776,The purpose of life is give life purpose.
5777,"You’re right! I keep finding things to nitpick and the idea of being free is scary. I love structure, but for some reason a 40 hr work week isn’t enough structure for me lol. I just gotta fill my time with hobbies and being around people I enjoy."
5778,Are you me omg
5779,"Not that it’s a serious lifestyle change I would consider, but I’ve been fascinated with how one would live like our hunter-gatherer ancestors for a few months now as I’ve been reading more about early human history. I was wondering if, since you suggested it, you had any ideas for how one might emulate the lifestyles of our ancestors in today’s world, even if just for a short period of time to get a taste for it?"
5780,"I'm as lost as you. Just keep in mind that no human ever survived alone or without generations of accumulated knowledge. Try searching for extreme camping groups, and look up a local forager (upscale restaurants buy from them).

Oh, and run. We apparently did quite a lot of that. Almost as much as lying around averaging 18 hours of work a week."
5781,"It's tough because people will just say to work hard and make money. Ok, I get that's important but it's really a defeating feeling."
5782,Pass the butter
5783,"Your comment reminds me of the movie Into the Wild. It’s one of my favorite and based on a true story about a guy that was from a wealthy family and graduated college, but then decided to give all his money away and live in the wild. I know that doesn’t answer your question but you should check it out. I watched it after having a nervous breakdown about not knowing what I want to do with my life and it kinda calmed me down in a weird way, knowing that I have that path as an option if I really wanted to"
5784,"Your purpose now is to contribute to making society run, have and fulfill responsibilities and do something meaningful. Absent that finding something meaningful to do. It’s understandable that we do find it kinda stressful, having to wake up and figure out what to do with your life is really bizarre if you consider human history. Most of our ancestors didn’t have to think about it, they had to farm, so they and their families didn’t starve or maybe they did whatever their parents did so to not starve as well."
5785,You generate wealth for rich people.
5786,"Thank you for this! A positive outlook really can change a persons point of view, even when times are hard."
5787,We’re so used to seeing people on social media accumulate wealth and looking like they haven’t had to work a 40 hr work week and I’ve slowly gotten rid of social media because I forget that MOST people live in the real world and work 40 hrs+ a week. The most defeating thing so far is realizing social media isn’t realistic and it really made my mental health go downhill.
5788,"I got a degree in Education, thinking I could change the world and help people. I found that it does not pay much, and, financially, I could only do it as a second job. I decided to stick with IT. I have a couple of degrees in that too. It pays more. It is great to save the world, but I really like being able to pay the bills. 

Maybe you need a part time volunteer position or something like that. I get that you are feeling the “is this all there is?” feeling. If you have something on the side where you can help people, maybe that will help. Maybe there is a VITA type program in your area where you could help seniors and others (who don’t have a lot of money) with their taxes. Maybe your local SPCA needs a hand on weekends or evenings. Something like that might help."
5789,Graduate school!
5790,This is exactly how I feel. I also feel like all I worked for was for nothing.
5791,"I did economics too in college and feel the same feelings you are having today at 27. Unfortunately I wish I never did economics because at least in my market it’s been used as essentially a glorified excel worker. 

My advice is to screen a lot of jobs first before taking one, perhaps get your masters, because in economics it’s likely that the first job you get will in no way fulfill the reason why you studied Econ at all. That’s just my experience though."
5792,Work until you die.
5793,"OPs goals were to be employed, not single, and not live at home"
5794,"If your expectations were to become rich and famous, of course you’re going to be let down, 99.99% of the time. Make some realistic goals for yourself man"
5795,Please give yourself credit for finishing the degree. You achieved a goal. Maybe allocate time to those things you like doing even if they don't currently pay. I hope this provides a more positive view. Take care.
5796,Stop comparing yourself.
5797,"We’re in the same boat kinda except that it’s been less than a year since I’ve graduated and I’m 22. I feel out of energy daily and just overall depressed about my future. I sort of thought things would be different. At least I have friends I suppose. 

I’ve got no idea how my future will turn out. I don’t have any advice or know what I’m supposed to do next. I did one internship but it wasn’t enough. I can’t find a job or an internship or anything. At least my parents are letting me live with them so far. 

I just wanted to say this initially because I wanted you to have somebody to maybe relate to about how it all sucks. But I’m the type to try and help others even if it doesn’t work out or I can’t help myself. So here’s something I guess. If you’re American, there’s something called Job Corps you could look into. Um I don’t know if you’re past the cut off age for it, but if not then they can teach you a trade. And there’s apprenticeship.gov if you’re American. But if not, welp, good luck."
5798,"I totally get you, because the world can be really discouraging and our economic system sucks, but I encourage you to look into locus of control. You sound like you have a strong external locus of control (I have no control over my fate; why do things happen to me?) when it’s much healthier to have an internal locus of control (I’m in charge of my life; I make things happen). Figure out what you want to have happen in your life (and the goals you have at 27 don’t have to be what you thought you wanted at 15 or 22–you’re not responsible yo a version of you that no longer exists). But set some goals, even small ones, and work toward them. Take charge of your fate rather than letting circumstances and limiting beliefs take charge of you"
5799,"Being unsure of what direction to take is just a side effect of having too many options/free time. Just pick one thing youre interested in and start off by committing to learning a part of it for just one month. Dont be afraid to fail at it, especially if its something entirely new than what youre familiar with. Failure is the catalyst to improving - you just need to keep trying and persevere.

It may seem difficult right now, but everyone starts somewhere. Just understand that humble beginnings are part of the process regardless of what age you are."
5800,"Companies and employers are too entitled these days. They want the world from us and to constantly throw the onus back in our court. Then we complain a little and we're called ""entitled"". It's why I've just become totally r/antiwork at this point."
5801,I mean yeah parents suck lmao
5802,"I know you’re heavily downvoted because of your insincerity, but you’re 100% completely right. 

I graduated last year as the pandemic was unfolding, spent an entire year looking for a job in my field that I could be proud of, and nothing came around. I focused so hard on what I want, that I didn’t realize what I needed.

So to build on your point, for the OP, stagnation is regression. It may seem very difficult now but just going out there and getting a job can make a whole difference in your life. Not just any job though, a job with a high learning curve, and preferably also one that comes with some training. After spiraling into depression towards the end of 2020, I picked up a job I really didn’t want to do, but did it anyway in order to - keep moving forward - and as a result I now see new direction in my life, new friends and I couldn’t be happier with that decision. 

I saw additional comments though that were also brilliant such as moving out of your parents place, or simply stop comparing yourself to others. In life, we all grow and develop at our own pace, constantly working at the grand design. Just keep working.

Last word of advice to OP, read the book Principles by Ray Dalio (I recommend the audiobook version on audible if you like that). Take the words in this book to heart, and you’ll make it through this part of your life."
5803,"Her expectations were much more than that. “I thought I could be famous and successful, and rich and have much more then what I’ve currently achieved in life.... maybe my life is not going to be as high and mighty as I once thought”

I’m sure OP could find a job to survive (in non-covid times at least), I don’t think they are referring to that.  They’re talking about years of unable to progress a career and be as the quote above describes, which only occurs for a very minute part of the population"
5804,OP is lazy and that's the cause of their issues. I can't believe they are wondering what to do when they are unemployed and feeling worthless. Get a job and do something instead of sitting around feeling sorry for yourself. Do *something.*
5805,"I totally get you, because the world can be really discouraging and our economic system sucks, but I encourage you to look into locus of control.

5815,"you have an illusion your life isnt a mess. when you are young, your parents cover up for you so that your life looks good.

it was a mess all along, including your parent's"
5816,Yeah same man. COVID really threw a wrench into my life goals
5817,With a hint of epicureanism at the end there
5818,Same I feel like the rest of my 23 year old friends have full times and are engaged lmao and I’m here living with the parents eating pb&j for lunch while looking for jobs hahahah *cries*

5822,Yes
5823,:( I’m in the same spot at the same age..
5824,Same 25. And fuck diddy all i can’t seem to figure shit out. Tomorrow I’ll have shit together and know what the fuck I’m doing. Come next week ill be confused who the I am for another week. Go to sleep repeat.
5825,Same!!!! Feel free to dm me if you’d like
5826,"For me, I’ve been living up to others’ expectations and not focusing as much on what I would really like to do. I am not finding my work very enjoyable and fulfilling, and am pursuing a different career track. Also, my identity and the things I used to define myself have changed a lot in my 20s! I’m learning how to live without a lot of different people and circumstances."
5827,"I think that’s a totally fair and accurate assessment of a 20’s to 30’s transition for a lot of people. I didn’t change my career, but I finally decided to change jobs in my later mid 30’s. It was basically a very lateral move, but I am *sooo* much happier. I hope that you find happiness in your endeavor. :)"
5828,God I hope so
5829,"Turning 30 and also experiencing an identity crisis, but I’m listening to myself and what I really want to do and going for it! You are not alone."
5830,In that age range and I feel like a complete mess. You're not alone. It's just really.. ugh lol
5831,"Thank god, I'm not the only one. I'm a few months away from being 25 and stuck living with my dad without any job prospects. Almost all of my friends have gone to get full-time jobs and I'm just over here feeling like the most unlucky bastard."
5832,"Your late teens and 20s are a major rollercoaster, you're lost, don't know what you are doing with your life, unsure or uncertain about everything, it's completely normal."
5833,"Yes it's normal, I think it's called the quarter-life crisis. I'm 28 and up until I was around 25 I had no clue what I was doing with my life, and even now I'm in a career I can see myself developing in, I'm thinking maybe I want a change.

I think society and the way we've been brought up has a lot to do with it. We've all grown up with this idea that we have to have our shit sorted by the time we're 25 and by 28 be married and have a house lol. 

I think someone in here said just focus on what makes you happy, which is sometimes easier said than done, but you can also focus on the things you can control. If you know what makes you happy in work and in life, then try to find ways you can incorporate these into everyday life, and even into your work. 

Also look at your environment, is there any parts of it that inspire you, or does it feel quite negative? Just making little tweaks to your surroundings can make a huge difference. Also the things you consume lol, this is a good example of a friendly environment with people who are in the same position and offering support. But are there other things you take in each day that maybe don't help with how you think and see the world?

Those are just a few things you could look at. Hope everything goes okay for you! This pandemic hasn't helped anyone with how they see their futures or mental health :/"
5834,"I’m sure it’s normal, but I think the trend of infantilizing adulthood is a bad thing for society. A commentator said 25-35 is an awkward discovery phase, but I couldn’t disagree more. That’s what your late teens/early 20s are about."
5835,Nihilism B)
5836,"Huh. When I turned 30 or shortly after I just kind of shrugged and thought, “Well it is what it is at this point.” I wouldn’t call it no longer giving a fuck exactly, but it was more of an acceptance of identity rather than an identity crisis."
5837,I felt the same way after I graduated a year ago. You become super grateful you survived once you see other friends still in school struggling in finals in the next semester. That’s when you can relax in your cap and gown hugging your degree knowing you won’t have to pull all nighters studying again.
5838,"Congrats! I know exactly how you feel, I just graduated on Sunday.  I don’t know about you but it hasn’t quite hit me yet.  I think it’s because I’d normally be on winter break this time anyways.  My guess is it’ll hit when my sister goes back to school and I don’t."
5839,I’m leaving tomorrow and it also hasn’t fully hit me yet that I’ve graduated and finished school. Congrats to both of us!
5840,"It’ll feel real once you hit 27 and go “oh fuck, we were supposed to be sprinting this?”"
5841,"Congrats! Now the world is your oyster and you can go out and really do anything you wish. One lesson I've learned through some years is that it's never worth it to do something for the sake of fitting the mold - do what you want to do, and thrive! As long as you're happy where you are, that's really the only important thing. Have fun out there!"
5842,"Congrats and welcome to this part of your journey! 

It didn’t feel real to me until I saw/heard my friends taking midterms and finals and I wasn’t. It took about 2 semesters for it to really hit me."
5843,"That was me 6 months ago- got a full time offer from an internship I'd done during undergrad. It felt weird, and then suddenly being thrust into the world of navigating personal finance, career development, getting an apartment. Even worse, since my brother and I have a big age gap, I finished masters (did masters right after undergrad) right before he started undergrad (at my alma mater). Feels super strange, with a lot happening in a short amount of time. But enjoy the moment- all these things are manageable, and you made it to this point. Congrats!"
5844,reading this made me so happy that somebody made it
5845,Actually we negotiated our rent down because of the rona so it’s been a good thing for us.
5846,Yeah I had a hard time finding a good job at first and it’s easy to get discouraged. But I feel really lucky!
5847,Congratulations my man/woman !! :) wish you both the best ! ☺️😘☺️❤️🚀🌎
5848,Damn nice! Get a ragdoll if you can.
5849,Happy for you! Congratsss! 🎉
5850,Congratulations! I remember getting my first apartment too! It definitely is an exciting moment.

5852,"Do you have any hobbies? Focusing on them can take away from the monotony, and you can potentially make new friends through them.

Could you do any evening classes? Maybe programming if you were good with computers. There's definitely avenues into careers that don't need to start with college."
5853,God I miss this so much.
5854,Currently a sophomore and not having a good time in college. This makes me scared that I’m gonna miss out on something I can’t get back.
5855,"Push yourself to carve out the experience you want. You’ll find out soon that nothing will ever happen unless you make it happen, and it gets more extreme after school. Join clubs, go out when you feel like staying in, and force yourself out of your comfort zone. It’ll help you later in life."
5856,"Hmmm, it sounds like having been average is what bothers you. 

I can draw some parallelism with your story and mine; grade-wise I did well my first two years of high school, then average junior year and flat-out did not attend the first semesters of senior year. I had to take community college classes the last semester to graduate on time. I’m very confident that by all accounts, my counselors considered me a below average student who would not accomplish anything in life. 

So what happened to me after high school? I’m going to do a low-key flex, but I went on to college and graduated with a 3.72 physics BS and 4.0 electrical engineering MS, I work in the fastest paced industry in the world and I recently got my first review from my supervisor with it being well above expectations yada yada yada... 

The point is, what the heck happened between high school and college? I frankly don’t know, you know what I did when I stopped attending high school (unbeknownst to my parents)? Sleep in because I was (and still am) freaking lazy. But I really cared about what I studied in college and what I do in my job now so I’m this disciplined person now, whatever that means lol. 

For a long time, my high school years bothered me too. I also went to an ok school where I never got bullied, but I simply was this below average kid that hardly got through the cracks then. However, it’s been a while since this has bothered me. I don’t care anymore because I’ve proven to myself I’m not that kid, I’m not sure why I ever was but I let bygones be bygones. You need to do the same: find your niche in life, prove that you’re not below average and you’ll realize that you no longer think about high school."
5857,Some of us have shitty college experiences. It is what it is :/
5858,I didn't find out until my senior year. I found a group by accident that played dnd and drank and was a great group. Miss that so so much :(
5859,I hated high school so I cannot relate.
5860,"Don’t dwell on that too much. You still have a ton of life ahead of you. It’s easy to have those thoughts. Right now, things may not be going your way and that’s why you think of that time. A simple time. You seemed to enjoy everything. Don’t romanticize it to a flaw. 

Like others have said, pick up hobbies, get in touch with people, get in touch with things you enjoy. You’re not wrong for reminiscing, but please look forward to what’s ahead of you. And if you don’t see much in front of you, that’s the beauty!!!! YOU get to decide what the rest of your story is! How you perceive life is the biggest hurdle! You can be so much happier than you have ever been! 

Have a great day!!!"
5861,Wish I experienced that
5862,Go to a community college enough to get a degree still have fun and not be a feeder. It’ll be tough getting back in it but something to get you gpa good if it’s needed but it would be a better start and cheaper.
5863,"Thanks, everyone for their comments. I just saw these messages, really appreciated."
5864,I miss university so much. I still live in the same town that I went to college in and I miss it so much. Now I’m a corporate slave 😭
5865,I was a massive stoner in college and didn’t go out to party very much at all. Join a fraternity or social club. Not all frats party.
5866,True
5867,"I had the same feeling of regret after leaving primary school. This caused me to spend a few years of high school wishing I could time travel and relive primary school. 

Now, when I think about this, I kinda get this feeling of acceptance, like I can move on.

I now realise that my youth was kinda wasted as I was so attached to primary school, took me a few years to learn this but I can say I’m happy to move on"
5868,"Wow, that a massive change, I did well in school but what’s holding me back is social interaction, I can’t hold a serious conversation which is seriously preventing me from forming relationships with people. I guess everyone has a different definition of success

How important is social interaction in your career?"
5869,"I see, thanks for your reply, it’s comforting lol, i have a common question but is it hard to find a job after college? Some people are so loud being unable to find a job it scares me"
5870,"I feel like there’s nothing wrong with being average. Honestly, what’s bad about it? I feel like in our generation lots of people try so hard to stand out or prove something to others, whether it be in the form of showing off in name brand clothing or lifestyle. The thing is, do you want to not be “average” for yourself or for other people? What is average anyways? As long as you’re doing good you’re doing good! Also, I’m not saying this as a way to discourage you to push yourself if you ever go back to academics. Pushing yourself is awesome and is encouraged. But hey, if you’re doing good already or “average” then why not cut yourself some slack and just be proud? You’re okay"
5871,"Stick to the present man it’s pretty sad sometimes for me too but you have to face the reality that you are never going back. Make your life dope NOW. Nobody is gonna do it for you, and it won’t be as easy as back then. But the sooner you stare reality in the face the sooner you’ll get past this speed bump. And don’t go thinking life isn’t worth if now that you’re an adult. It is. You just need to find what gets you going. Try helping others. It’s incredibly rewarding inside and out."
5872,"I’m pretty shy person overall but it helps that many people who work this industry are also of a shy nature so it’s not a popularity contest ever. However, you still need to interact with people on a daily basis."
5873,"I engineering? It can be difficult if you don’t do any internships, but generally everyone eventually finds their way. Not sure about other areas of study though, it seems like there are majors that leave you with a very grim outlook."
5874,"Go to a school that’s far enough away that dorms make sense.

Join a fraternity.

Now you’re in turbo high school, except with more women and beer. Maybe you won’t see any truly wild stuff, but you’ll at least have open invites to parties every weekend if you want to go, and some bro’s to roll with.

Can confirm, am former frat bro"
5875,"As someone with ADHD and ASD I concur.

It sounds like many of your difficulties stem from executive functioning issues. Right off the bat I’d recommend you check out the book “Smart but Scattered: Guide to Success” by Peg Dawson & Richard Guare. 

I’m also a graphic design grad. Have always struggled in certain areas more than others largely due to my executive functioning but was lucky enough to be diagnosed early in life. Medication and therapy + exercise have helped immensely. I won’t lie things are still a struggle and it’s a lot of concentrated effort but life is far more enjoyable when you feel able to recognize and manage the ADHD (the ASD is a different story). 


I would add that often ADHD difficulties with executive functioning skills in everyday life can lead to the development of co-morbid disorders, most commonly Anxiety disorders or Depression."
5876,Google calendar/apple calendar is a life saver.
5877,"\+1 for this. My GF has ADHD, which I learned manifests itself completely different in women than in men. She had no idea until she got to college - apparently this is pretty common for women, whose ADHD symptoms go unnoticed in structured environments (like high school, when your day is mostly planned out, there's a parent to remind you to do hw, go to the doctor, etc). Once they get to unstructured environments (like college), women with ADHD will become extremely disorganized, struggle to focus, etc."
5878,"I was actually just talking with my boyfriend (who has diagnosed panic anxiety) and we were thinking I might actually have some undiagnosed Anxiety & OCD. I never have any problems with focusing on tasks, but I seem to get so wrapped up in being worried about doing things incorrectly & failing that I end up making mistakes anyway. I always assumed it's just a character trait I have but perhaps it's something more than that.

I'll have to check out that book later as the title sounds very much like how I've been feeling as of late!"
5879,"I hope you are ok! I feel like the comments haven't been super sympathetic when you sound like you are in a real hard place and need somewhere to moan. I am giving you a big hug! 

&#x200B;

Yes you could have ADHD, but I would take what people say on here with a pinch of salt, they only have a tiny part of your story to then diagnose you. Always worth getting checked out if you have any inkling, but it could have just been the jobs in question, if getting the shifts was confusing, perhaps the job and training was too. Being stressed could have also not helped. If it isn't your dream job, maybe you are just hardwired not to be as attuned to whatever details they were asking.

It's tough, but keep at it. Don't beat yourself up about the print shop, especially as perhaps it was not what you were after. You have the experience at least and you can learn from those mistakes to improve next time. It's great you got the job there in the first place if you are somewhere smaller. I am sure many people would have liked to have had that job too. But if you were paranoid of being fired all the time, it doesn't sound much fun and like a great job.

It's not too late to change ideas or to sort out a new living situation. Keep looking at dream jobs, wherever they may be - your boyfriend is managing to commute to work so perhaps an interview could turn up which you could catch a train to? Any jobs near enough to where your bf lives to be able to afford it? It might help speed up things job wise if you are looking somewhere where there are more opportunities. 

&#x200B;

You obviously can do things right though if you did well in school. It's just a little bump in the road, but remember all those great things you can do and all the praise you have received in the past. Persevere and see if you can work out a way to move somewhere with more opportunities, just to help get your career a bit of a leg up."
5880,"Same. I graduated from college two years ago and was unemployed for four months. I made attempts at the LSAT for law school and did not make admissions. On top of that, after those four months, the only job I could get was at the local target, which didn't work out after they fired me before the 90 day termination period. Life after college sucks ass, but it gets better."
5881,A little bit for some local businesses here and there but nothing that I felt like I could use in a portfolio or anything. I'm planning on being more serious about it now while I'm in this limbo position to find another job. I want to update my portfolio because as it stands it's still all projects from when I was in school.
5882,[deleted]
5883,U just need to learn from your mistakes and keep going! It will get better.
5884,my entire life is on google calendar
5885,"Really appreciate a useful recommendation instead of a reductionist and rude ""You're lazy, unfuck yourself"" comment."
5886,"Unfortunately, we're both not quite in a good enough financial position to do so unless if I got a really well-paying job. We both have substantial student debt and housing is very expensive around where we'd both have jobs. We absolutely want to but the money gods are saying no at the moment lol. Time for me to hustle!"
5887,"Hey man, I was fired from an executive assistant position last year for similar reasons.  I was truly giving it my all but I was performing terribly.

I found a job as a TA at a university and I’m excelling at it a ton. Identify your skill set and capitalize on it."
5888,"Hot-take: Having a shit job is shit. The lower the pay, the more menial the work, the more chance there is for fuckery from above and below.  


Yes, a no call, no-show should be an automatic firing for most jobs. Especially a few shifts - you fucked up in a real way. Luckily, this was a bullshit job, and getting fired is a godsend. You made mistakes because you didn't care, because how the fuck could you?

What you told us about the job:  
1. Minimum wage - if a business is paying minimum wage, it means they're fine replacing you with literally anyone else.   
2. Took you 7 months to get this job and the ""weird schedule"" - I may be interpreting this part wrong, BUT if it took you seven months from applying to the job and actually landing it, and if they really do have weird schedule policies (some places absolutely WILL add shifts last minute without telling you and make you responsible for their bullshit.  
3. Constantly worried about being fired - you confidence was royally fucked with, which made this shit job even worse. 

  
There's nothing wrong with working a job that pays the bare minimum (we all got bills, but not everyone has options), but if you're going to accept the bare minimum in wages, you need to realize that there are options that won't drive you crazy. You also need something you don't actually get invested in, because you can lose sight of what you actually want. You have a college degree, so find a job that doesn't need a degree but where soft skills are a little more appreciated.  


In my (unsolicited) opinion, hosting at a restaurant might be a good ""shit job"". Most are usually hiring, if you apply to enough you WILL get a gig. Many restaurant managers are shit at design but forced to do it anyway, if you adopt this as part of your job you can have more hours + actual experience as an ""in house designer for \*trendy restaurant\*"". You shouldn't accept less that $10/hr, as you will likely work shorter, more intense shifts. Make a resume that shows you're a living, breathing person that can interact with most people and is capable of giving a slight shit for a few hours at a time. It's unlikely anyone will call any of them, so feel free to embellish a little if you need to, but keep it believable, you won't need much work experience. Wear some nice clothes, and find a ""trendy"" part of town, ideally that's close to you. Visit restaurants between 2:30 and 4:00. Ask to speak with the manager, introduce yourself to them, or the person you speak to. Let them know you don't expect them to talk to you now, but you're interested and were hoping to talk with them later. LEAVE A RESUME with contact info. The job will be a little stressful when things are busy, but it's gives you experience interacting with strangers with low stakes. If you don't like the job, the pay or the people, or if you have a better opportunity with just a little experience it's even easier to get the next job like this.  


Here's the trick: Get invested in the job just enough to learn how to do it well and do what's required of you. If it's not related to design or your immediate job opportunities, don't be happy to do it. Remind yourself that even if you love this job, it's a stepping stone to something better.  


You don't have to work in a restuarant, it's just an example. Good luck!"
5889,“Discipline Equals Freedom”
5890,Why don’t you move in with him? You say he lives near the city where there are more job opportunities. Then you would have a place and a house
5891,"I really appreciate the kind words & support, I think the first part you said there about not being hardwired to focus on small details like that is right. I always had trouble in school catching those little things when I was working on a project, especially in design when you have so many other things to focus on to make the piece work. I've always been more focused on the big picture and the concept when it comes to design rather than the nitty-gritty stuff. I know I'm responsible for my own mistakes when it came to both jobs, but perhaps it just means I wasn't meant to be at either of those places any longer than I was.

I'm definitely considering looking for jobs near the city as well, it would be a big life change but I feel like if I was making enough at wherever I end up we would be able to make it work. Perhaps this is just the push I sort of needed to do something riskier and move towards a new chapter in life :)"
5892,"Ohh right, yeah I get that. Did you figure anything else out?"
5893,"Honestly maybe look into joining a start-up. Going into a career in business or finance is incredibly vague and honestly with your lack of a degree there’s a good chance someone could take advantage of you (see posts about life insurance cos that promise the moon and stars) Start ups are nice because a lot of them don’t require a ton of experience to join, you’ll probably be sent straight to sales but trust me that’s where the money is. Plus due to their small size you end up having to wear a ton of hats and get experience in a lot of things quickly. If you discover you love part of the job, maybe go back to school to get a degree in that area but at least you got paid to learn that and build your resume in the process"
5894,"Well first step could be getting your license. Some states will allow adults to complete and online course and then take the test at a dmv. After that try getting a job, anywhere honestly to just get some work experience and to fill up some empty space on your resume. Continue to work through college if you want a business job and take something that comes along that’s NOT an internship. Best of luck man."
5895," Rn I don't plan on getting a bachelor's degree. I'm studying to get my A+ and Net+ certifications (45k/year job). There are TONS of great no degree options in tech industry like cyber security, programming design etc. It's a really great way to get a liveable income and the ceiling for advancement is extremely high. It's one of the most up to date industries which can cut back on the menial bullshit. Con: in an office all day, some amount of bs customer interactions

Construction/trades. Good money, paid training, lots of options I haven't dug into this too much someone can probably elaborate. Con can destroy your body, bad for your hearing, early morning work hours, generally less educated colleagues. Pro or con, exposed to the elements some days

Airline stewardess. It's like 6 week paid training 45k/year. Get paid to travel the world. Cons: inconsistent hours for sleep and work, airports spread diseases pretty fast. Typical customer service bs

Truck driver. Good money 60k+ easy work, see the country or stay close to home. Con boring, see the country through rest stops only, isolating

Bank Teller. 45k/yr 6 week training. Simple 9-5. Customer service bs

Salesman. Unlimited earning potential, training varies, very transferable skill. Cons mentally exhausting, demands are certain personality, long hours for good results

Cnc operator. Idk much about this one. 45k/year

Office manager 45k/year

These are all the options I can think of atm

Or check with your family and extended family to see if anyone owns their own business and would be willing to train you or hire you. Lots of family members spend a lifetime building a legacy in their work, they would love to pass it on if possible"
5896,Shit I wish I had the opportunity to watch everyone else fuck up college so I knew what not to do.  Look at the successes and failures of your former classmates. Learn from them.  Take advantage of your opportunities.
5897,"Keep searching. 

The good thing about 22 is that you're still considered a ""young adult"" by law. There are organizations that take in young adults under their wing and guide them to a direction like continuing education, mentorship, get your driver's license, or pursue a career. 

Search for local paid training programs, apprenticeship, and internships. Normally it's non-profit organizations and government backed programs that offer these for free."
5898,"Keep this in mind. It’s not the end of the world. It’s recommended to get a degree, but it’s not a must, so don’t consider it one. 

A lot of people your age actually don’t have one and that’s okay. They turn out pretty successful too. Look at the bright side, in a way you have a head start because unlike most college graduates who are graduating now, you already know what the real world is like. You have a couple of experiences in that. And believe it or not, the real world isn’t like college or school, and being surrounded by like-minded folks of similar age. 

Even though you feel like you wasted the last four years, is it really a waste if it helped you came to a realization? The first step to solving a dilemma is acknowledging a dilemma exists. The truth is, no one in their twenties is suppose to have their life figured out. The twenties are meant for gaining a better understanding of yourself, of the world, who are are, and where you want to be. 

I have a few suggestions. Why don’t you start off getting a license? That can’t be too hard right? Take a few lessons, pay a few bucks, try to pass, and voila eventually you accomplished something. In the process maybe you can consider trade school. Learn a trade or two, but of course this time be on the lookout for scams lol. You’re not interested in finance or business so who cares about a college degree. Maybe look into a trade you like and think about getting into that. You’re only 22 years old. It’s not too late!"
5899,That's nothing I wasted 10.
5900,Anything you want? You’re 22 lol
5901,"What do you enjoy doing?

Is there something you know you're good or somewhat good at?

I'd say try to find things that check off something in these things so it feels like there's a sense of direction"
5902,"A lot of guys that joined the military and only stay for in active for 4-6 years are going to be in college right now. They'll be 22-24. Trust me, college isn't just 17 hear olds. 

Plus each class will have people way older than you. 

Stop holding yourself back because that is exactly what you've been doing and the language you're using still has me thinking that despite knowing what's wrong, you're not quite at the point of giving it your all. 

Figure out what you want and get it."
5903,"You may not see it now but you're still young. It's still a good time to start if you really want to go into finance. I'm currently in unskilled labour and had a 27 year old co worker who just left and all he did in his free time was skate and travel. Now he's spending a year travelling the country. In terms of the metrics you are using, you are ahead of him as he has no degree and you are currently studying for one."
5904,"Lmao right

Dude is still a baby"
5905,"I graduated at 23 (lost 1.5 years in university) and tried to create my own startup (failed) and freelanced until I landed a job at 27. I barely made ends meet as a freelancer. Now my new job pays good (not that much) but I’m happy and I’m learning and I know that this experience will take me places.

Don’t worry, we have all felt down and sad. I used to cry myself to sleep sometimes. But if not now, then when are you planning to pursue your dreams? You don’t wanna ‘wake up’ again in 4 years and ask yourself “what have I done?”.

Go for it. Fall forward. THAT is the worst that could happen! And fuck everything else."

5907,"Hello. First, get your driver's license with parents' help. Get a part-time job and put as much as you can into savings. If you haven't worked on your credit yet, do that too with a little secured credit card like a capital one card with a 200 dollar limit. Enroll in an online degree program or go back to community college- study hard and take classes through summers and whatnot so you don't have to be in college for four years. Do your research on a career/trade that interests you , commit to it and ride it out. These are basic steps I used to get my life together. You're 22. You've got this. All the best!"
5908,"You’re going to turn 26 one day. Might as well turn 26 with a degree.

Also, depending on what area you’re in, there are good state 4 year universities that almost exclusively have older students. In my area, (twin cities Minnesota), metro state is known for that. Still a quality, affordable education with a certified state school, but the vast majority of students are adults in their late 20s, 30s, 40s, etc

I feel like the whole college culture is a little overplayed. That part doesn’t really matter and you don’t have to be involved in it if you don’t want to. But don’t let that be your hill to die on for not getting a degree or pursuing a career you’re passionate about."
5909,Please don't call yourself loser or leech
5910,Don’t do statutory rape

5913,I agree my buddy did 3 years active and now he gets all free state school and money each month for school expenses while at college.
5914,"If you have the money or situation to take time off then you should! A good rule of thumb is that you get up to two years after graduation to be considered a recent graduate. I would recommend to take off six months after graduation and not worry about anything but at six months you should start looking for jobs but you don’t need to look too hard. 

Once the year mark hits start really looking for jobs but you still don’t have to take a less than ideal job. If it’s been 1.5 years after graduation basically take any job in your field. 

Most employers expect recent graduates to take time off to travel or relax. In interviews you can tell them that you took time off after school to help out with family or get your travel urges out of the way before you buckle down. 

Just really plan on having a job before the two year mark. After two years employers will start to wonder why you haven’t done anything in the time since graduation and they might question if you are still relevant or even if there is something wrong with you. 

Bonus tip, if your first job ends up being awful and your still under the two year mark. You can just quit without notice or anything and just not put that on your resume. 

Hope this helps!

Edit: I am dumb and didn’t answer all your questions. I took a 8 month break and didn’t notice any benefits or disadvantages in my professional life but my personal life was amazing! I was able to travel and spend the whole summer with my wonderful girlfriend, doing nothing but playing video games and eating bomb food. If you are in a financial situation to, highly recommend."
5915,This was a nice answer. Currently in the same spot after grad school. Working at a startup but still have bigger plans waiting.
5916,"Like why do they expect people to never take a break of work? It’s not weird it’s normal! We’re such a wealthy species that we don’t need to work 24/7. Taking time off is NOT weird!

Just proudly say: 

I’ve worked a long time to get a degree and then I decided to take some time off to enjoy life. 
In this time I learned that there’s more to life than just being productive all the time and since I could stay at place x I didn’t need the money for a job.

Now it’s time to move on and enter a new chapter. I hope your company can help me write that first page

Don’t be ashamed of not working for a few months. Just explain why and what you did. And if you needed to relax, just tell them, it’s totally human"
5917,"Do you feel like telling your employers the truth about taking your break make them look down on you or you felt like you were in a different position compared to those who were coming right out of school?

As for the job, it's not that I'm necessarily not excited about it... I'm turning 20 this year and to be able to start earning decent money right away makes me shiver with anticipation and it's definitely more the burn out thing. 

Thanks for the response! Hope things are going well for you."
5918,"I took 3 months off after graduation, I had a internship offer but I turned it down. My employment outcomes is still the same"
5919,"I took an entire year after graduating before focusing on my career search. Best decision I ever made. 

By the end of Uni I too was suffering from an eating disorder, I was generally sleep-deprived, high-strung, immature, and I realized I was out of touch with who I was and never learned to take proper care of myself. My mental state was suffering and I knew I needed a break. 

I figured taking some time to get my shit together by myself was better than trying to get my shit together while also trying to make a good impression at my first real job. Had I not taken that gap year, I would have dragged my burnt out ass from Uni right into the office and it would not have ended well. 

In my opinion, it’s ok to take a break but you need to know when the break is over. Take the amount of time you need to get yourself in a more sustainable and positive place, keep your long term goals in mind, and make sure you’re staying motivated."
5920,"Hey, I’ve read through your post and comments and in my humble opinion I think it’s imperative that you take time off after graduation. Once you join the work force you won’t have another opportunity to take an extended break for a long time probably (unless it’s in between jobs). Mental and physical health is of the utmost importance, and it sounds like you really need it. Remember that many companies value employees that have seen the world, have a general education not just from studies, are sociable and generally positive. You’d be a much better asset to a company having had some rest and epic adventures :) much more importantly, you’d be doing yourself a great service. 

You mentioned that you may have neglected friendships while you were studying. I’m almost 30 and have lived, studied and worked in different continents, and I’ve found that people I’ve met on travels and in different degree programs have become true friends for life - it’s just a lot harder to make those lasting friendships while you’re working. (And it’s way easier to date and find a life partner then too!) just some holistic things to think about :) 

I’m a career changer who tried a lot of different things in my 20s and took good breaks in and around, i think it’s made me a genuinely happy healthy person, and I’m way more driven than I ever thought was possible in my current corporate job (ha!)

I think at university we can become susceptible to the ‘official narrative’ of what you’re meant to do - insane workloads, top grades, extra curriculars, certain jobs, certain internships, graduating in a certain year, job offers at these companies etc. I think it’s all total BS and damaging to everyone’s mental health. Forge your own path according to your needs. Listen to your mind and body and live your truth :) (as much as your finances will allow!) sorry that got long. Good luck!"
5921,"I’m currently in the middle of this. 

Coming into senior year of university I had 3 job offers from prestigious big city corporate firms. 

In senior year I slowly came to the realisation I wasn’t ready for the real world yet. I needed some kind of “stepping stone” or something. A final period of time to do things for me before I was locked into the corporate cycle. 

So I looked into travelling, doing a season etc. and it all seemed feasible enough. 

So I contacted the firms and asked to defer my start date by a year. 1 said no, 1 counter-offered 6 months, 1 said yes. So I took the job with the firm that were willing to give me the whole year. 

After graduation I went travelling for 8 weeks and it was one of the best decisions of my life. I met some awesome people (who I still talk to and have met up with since). 

I am now currently on a ski season. Ultimately so far it has been quite disappointing in that I was misled on the job and I haven’t ended up enjoying work and due to the job have struggled to make many friends (it’s a small team compared to most jobs here and it’s not very sociable, although the few I did make again are lifelong friends). Ive has a good time but I definitely feel like it could’ve been better too. But I’m glad I‘ve done it.

It has been the perfect stepping stone. I still work pretty standard corporate hours, but I live with a few other guys in university-style accommodation. I go out 2-3 nights a week to bars or some kind of event. It doesn’t *feel* like I’m an adult, with a job and taxes and bills. But I am.  

Next step is I’m going to work on a summer camp as it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Then I’ll finally go home and begin my “big boy” job. 

It’s absolutely the right decision. I’m more confident, I won’t get hit with depression in my late 20s when I realise I’ve not done all these things I want to do. I can look back and say I’ve made some genuine friends for life and had an amazing year of experiences and personal growth. 

But I did have job(s) already sorted. However I think most companies are much more forgiving about having a year post-graduation these days than say 30-40 years ago."
5922,"Dude same, I am burnt out of my first engineering job too. I do environmental engineering and I feel like they just use and abuse recent graduates. They make us work crazy hours, travel to shitty places, and don’t even really train us that much. Plus my feeling is that they don’t care because it’s cheaper to burn out a recent graduate every year and just hire another recent graduate and use them up before they realize how shitty it is."
5923,"Thank you so much. Honestly, I came into my post-secondary in a very difficult period of my life, which has been a significant cause in why I struggled so much during school. I chose to dash like mad towards adult responsibilities... graduating early, taking an insane amount of courses and then start earning money and working hard to pay back those around me and earn for myself.

If anything though, like you said, it leaves me feeling much more anxious for the future and makes me feel like I've begun rolling a snowball effect onto my life. Like, I almost feel like if I were to find a job and start working right out of graduation, I'd be setting myself up to live this way for the remainder of my 20s, and at the very least it'd be difficult to leave if I wanted to, and I'd be miserable doing it.

It's insane how much money drives this society and me. I know that's why I work so hard- so that I can earn a decent amount and give rest to myself and those around me who I care about sooner rather than later. But at a certain point recently, it felt like none of that was worth it anymore. And if I'm going to hit that wall of realization this soon before graduation I'd have to make a critical choice between choosing to take a rest or continuing to dash like mad. 

Your explanation about ""needing a step of confidence"" before actually transitioning into the adult lifestyle is about as accurate as it gets. I went into my program straight out of high school and won't even be 20 by the time I graduate in May (20 in June), and maybe it's because of this I feel nothing like an adult. 

I feel like part of this comes from a cycle of guilt. I've restricted myself from seeing friends out of wanting to perform well in school (and the sheer craziness of my time schedule made it difficult to see anyone anyways), but my outcome hasn't reflected the best image of someone who supposedly ""stays home and studies all the time."" 

I haven't traveled in a while. Haven't been on a plane in 13 years. Barely go out drinking and I feel like something needs to change about that. I'm not outwardly confident by nature but I feel like an experience similar to what you chose would help me tremendously.

Sorry for just spilling literally everything. Your comment has given me so much hope, peace and frankly a sense of lightness that makes me look forward to things again. I'm glad to hear that your life is going well after graduation and I'm proud that you were able to make the right choice for your own sanity and not for other gains. All the best."
5924,"I graduated in 2016 and was planning on taking a break as I was also in a similar situation of feeling burnt out after a long and taxing 7 year school journey (4 years undergrad, 2 years grad school, and 1 year internship). I had also graduated from a high employment degree and had 3 jobs lined up 2 months after graduating. I wanted to negotiate a 2 month start date but ended up taking my parents advice (read: succumbed to their pressure) and skipped on it. Fast forward to today, I quit my job 2 weeks ago to go on a planned 6 month break. 

I ignored my suppressed feelings of accumulated fatigue for 4 years and kept “pushing” until it turned to a depression that made me struggle to get out of bed every morning. Although I regret not taking the break and continuously wonder how much better my career could have been if I had, it taught me the valuable lesson of taking my own advice over my parents since ultimately I knew what’s best for me."
5925,"Hiatus, not highatots.  Otherwise, thanks for the thoughtful response."
5926,"Thank you so much! I didn't realize the threshold for being considered a recent graduate was two years after completion, but that definitely puts so much of my mind at ease. Truthfully, I'd *love* to take a 6 month rest to really get everything back together, maybe travel and start exercising, but I feel I'm going to end up realistically taking something along 3 months. 

Still though, this makes me feel much better knowing that I do have some wiggle room even after graduation. Did you find yourself going back to study old information/books/material that you might have forgotten within that time? Or was your credential of graduating considered enough for employers to believe you?

My post-secondary is heavily marketed towards ""skills applicable for employers"" but in practice I find that most graduates have told me that the education they receive was only good for setting a solid foundation; they ended up learning significantly more on the job/in the workforce than they did in school."
5927,"Thanks so much. 

>Listen to your own mind and body.

I feel like that's something I've truly neglected for so long in order to reach a goal that seems to have become less important over time, especially at expense of myself. And you're right. 

All around me that narrative of people who are told to just work hard, grind like crazy, get good grades and perform at insane levels of productivity is having a collective effect on everyone around me. People look tired all the time, and all we do is laugh about it and compare to one another. 

I think I'm becoming a broken record replying to everyone here but I'm truly thankful for your reply. Thanks so much."
5928,I took a year off to travel. Started looking for grad roles pretty soon after graduating though and locked one up that was due to start in 9 months so that I could travel stress free
5929,"Interviewed in October, told them graduate in December, but don’t want to start work before March. My boss encouraged me to take this skiing trip through Europe more than anything. 

Take time for yourself. You work for a company, but also work for yourself. Starting the day after graduation I frequently hear gives you no benefits and all downsides. 

If you can, take time off! Travel, see the world, try new things, spend time with family. Your financial situation and employment will dictate this the most, but spending time with yourself will be the most healthy thing you can do."
5930,"A lot of this really depends on your personal financial situation, your field, the state of the economy, and how long you plan on taking off. A couple months like you said in your post actually is pretty normal. I know I certainly did that when I got out of architecture school last April (and as I'm sure you know, 6 years of architecture school is brutal). Most places typically  won't hold that short a time against you, particularly knowing you just got through a lot of schooling. 

What myself and a number of my friends from school actually did was applied for jobs and got job offers in our final spring semester, and then negotiated our starting dates so we could get a couple months off. My employer actually told me they'd hold my job until fall if I wanted more time to travel and the like, but I chose two months just knowing how easily I fall into habits and how I'd go stir crazy at a certain point (plus, I'd be home and my girlfriend was in the city I'd be working). But some people were taking the summer to do traveling across the country or overseas, and I know one girl started in October because she wanted to get her scuba certification over the summer. 

It's actually pretty negotiable if you're not asking for some absurd amount of time off, so apply for jobs and ask anywhere that gives you an offer (or simply during an interview) what their hiring schedule is. A lot of places are very amenable to recent grads wanting to travel, particularly since summer tends to be pretty quiet for a lot of offices. Remember- the people hiring you are human too, and once were in your position. Many will work with you so long as you're not making an outlandish request."
5931,"Well, here’s my story.

I graduated university in 2018, in a degree that’s fairly technical (information systems). At the time, I was 20 years old. 

For some reason, I just expected myself to roll right into a job. That it’d easy. Not much work involved. Fast forward 6 months, no job offers. 

Had to work a part time job, which I did enjoy. But, overall, I was lost. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. 

I had my life planned out since the time I was 12. I thought I was going to ace high school, go to a superb college, and be on the top while I work. 

Instead, I spent two years trying to figure out what I wanted to do, and was horrified of the future in front of me. 

My family moved to another state. For the first time, I felt really alone. My brother left for college. As did my sister. 

Yeah I traveled, Germany, Austria, Italy, SF, Chicago, LA in those two years. 

But man, those two years were rough. 

So all this is to say is don’t worry about it. Life has a way of sorting itself out. It’s fucking tough at times, but you’ll figure it out. Trust yourself to make the right decision, and don’t let the pressure of other people telling you what you should do, cloud your personal judgement. 

Everyone has their own timeline. Take a break. Enjoy yourself. Not every day is guaranteed to be like that."
5932,Glad someone asked this because im in the same boat. Ive decided to bartend at the beach for the summer where I know Ill be happy before I start my career that Ill be working in for the rest of my life. I just know future me wont be upset at present me for doing that. Im excited for a stress free summer! :)
5933,"The mental state is really what hits you. In the past 2 years the stress that has piled up has caused me to change in ways that have become unlike myself and just unattractive (not necessarily in the terms of relationships, but just in general).

I belted out a lot to those around me, became gloomy all the time, and had a negative approach on life and was petty about everything. It's such a horrible feeling and I feel so unlike myself. 

Thanks for sharing your story man. Here's to getting better day by day. Reading everyone elses stories reminds me im not alone in this and life is only shitty for a while. I'm getting better these days and I hope you're doing awesome too. Cheers"
5934,"How did you negotiate the 9 month start date? And if it was you that negotiated it, how was their initial response/outward reaction? I would imagine companies wouldn't be super keen on such a late start, though (as mentioned above) companies are apparently becoming much more lenient to starting later/taking breaks."
5935,"While I was finishing up grad school and after I had already secured a few offers I told each employer that I wanted 6 months off before I started. 2 were cool with it, 3 weren’t, so I signed with one of the companies that was and I’m very glad I put my foot down. I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and it was the best time of my life. Plus, since I chose wisely with a company that would be ok with that type of thing, I asked for another 6 month (unpaid) sabbatical this summer and they were totally cool with it, so I’ll be able to travel again and go back to a job when I’m done with no gap in my resume. Depending on how in demand your major is there’s a good chance you’ll be able to negotiate something similar, you just have to ask. I highly recommend it; the corporate world sucks, so take every chance to remind yourself what you’re working for!"
5936,What did you study to be able to enter a career so quickly?
5937,"I just graduated in December and my job starts at the beginning of March, so I’m basically getting two months off. I spent January in the city where I went to school and worked 20 hours per week for a research project that I’d previously worked for. The rest of my time was spent on relaxing (reading an absurd number of books and seeing friends) and also prepping for my move-out. I had to basically resolve everything that I had going on in that city, like I saw my therapist for the last time and got my last haircut at the barber shop I frequent and so on. I knew that leaving would be really tough, and it was.  

Now I’m back home with my parents in the suburbs/almost countryside and I feel like I’m going crazy. I went to school in a really cosmopolitan and lively city (with great public transit!) for the past 3.5 years and I grew to be so independent and social (compared to high school) while I was there. Being back home feels like regressing in a way. There is no one here in town my age and the nearest city with anything close to the social and entertainment opportunities I’m used to is over a half hour drive away without traffic. I also don’t have my own car because my younger sister brought it to school with her. I spend 75% of my time at home and I mainly go out to go to the gym and accompany my parents on grocery trips. Our internet is also out right now so most of the day I’m playing offline video games (haven’t played anything in years), reading, doing chores, taking care of our dogs, etc.

I’m excited to start my job because it has a large number of new grads and even though I’ve only been away from my friends for about a week and a half, I’m desperate to see young people again. I’ll also be living within walking distance of a train that can take me into the city so that’s a huge plus for me. I also don’t have so much money saved up that I can go on crazy trips, but I also don’t know where I’d go on a trip or who I’d go with or whether I’d even enjoy it. 

I probably do need more of a break after school but I’ve been so single-minded about school for so long that I don’t even know what a break looks like or how I can develop myself further."
5938,"Yeah unfortunately in my experience the work you did in school really only gets you a job. It’s actually something I am struggling with since I am 1.5 years into my first job. I busted my ass in school, studied super hard got a masters in environmental engineering but all I do at work is sit in a pick up truck or play office assistant. 

It’s really been depressing me that I worked so hard in school and then my education has only been used by my employer to justify billing clients more for my time because of my education. However I don’t use any of my education and do the same job as people with bachelors in geology.  Sorry to lay out my problems in this thread. 

Just my two cents but government work pays less but you actually use your degree. For environmental type work in the government setting your concern is how do we make our limited budget do the most amount of good work this year. Private industry pays more but you don’t really use your degree and turn more into a business person. Plus private industry in environmental work is more about how do we squeeze in our client, typically the government, for as much money as possible while doing the bare minimum work and pocket the rest of the money. 

The only thing I would study is once you get a job interview become familiar with the type of work they do and then study the, “buzz words.” It’s not really what you know, it’s that you sound confident and can give an answer to any of their questions in the interview."
5939,"Honestly, I felt a lot of pressure to have a job lined up as soon as I graduated so I could impress my family and friends, which is exactly how I ended up in a career path I loathed. I was at that job for 2 years before I ended up switching careers. I learned a lot and look back on that time fondly, but if I could go back and give myself advice it would be to hold off on applications and enjoy a couple months to myself, maybe work a part-time job while I figure things out. I graduated 5 years ago - anyone I know who took some time to themselves after graduating seems to be doing just as well as those who started employment immediately. The job market is competitive but it’s not going anywhere, end of summer is usually when companies have a hiring surge anyways. Best of luck & congratulations on graduating soon!"
5940,"I didn't (graduated may 2019 and got full time position the next month). In some ways I regret it; didn't get to travel as much as I wanted to, and I can say that I've honestly been stressed more. I worked all throughout college, starting the second semester of my first year. 

However, I look at it another way as well: if I would have taken off 6 months post-grad, I don't know how different my life would be right now. I have a pretty good job for my area, a newer car, a nice apartment. Most likely if I would have taken 6 months off, I would have to move back home in an area that is less economically productive (probably not the right verbiage). I'm from West Virginia, and moving from the area I am in now to back home would damage me and my career prospects.

YMMV obviously, but for me, 6 months wasn't feasible."
5941,"You could consider working a part-time job that you enjoy, it might take some of the financial strain off."
5942,My whole college career was a haitus
5943,I’m on the same page as you OP. except my hiatus comes in a form of compulsory 2 year Army draft.well anything helps I guess
5944,"Thank you, yes, I definitely plan to look into filing for unemployment (never had to do that before!)"

5948,"Get your constructive narrative to describe your situation dialed in, attend networking events- especially ones related to your field or where you think prospective jobs might be lurking.  Talk to everyone, and start applying everywhere asap, with the priority on volume not quality, at least until you get a reasonable number of them sent out."
5949,"Sure is, blargh- luckily, moving in with my fiance would make it cheaper as we'd be splitting the cost of an apartment, even if it costs a little more because it's bigger."
5950,"Absolutely! I'd love another design job that aligns with my interests, but I'd settle for a design job that wasn't within my interests, and if all else fails I hear Starbucks has good benefits."
5951,"It’s been a godsend for me. I was in a similar situation to you, I’m a writer. Unemployment has literally saved me from losing my living space while I looked for a new job, and now I only have a part-time but it still lets me take a portion of the allowance while i look for something more. Do it ASAP, there may be a waiting period."
5952,"There’s great advice already posted here. All I would add is that you try to stay calm and focused while tackling one issue at a time (job/housing/relationships/tasks). Stay in the present. 

As soon as stress (anxiety/depression/despair/etc) starts to kick in this all gets harder. It doesn’t have to be hard. It’s just life, which is full of exciting challenges like this one. You’ll get through this and be better for it because of what you learn along the way.

5954,"Thank you so much for sharing your story- my company's struggle was visible but things had always been painted in such a positive ""we have x months of financial runway even if we're not getting any income"" frame that I was unfortunately blindsided by the layoff.

I'm going to look into unemployment of course, but also start looking at community programs in my area- my pride will gladly take the hit if it helps keep costs down.

I'm in the States, but I'll look into your link when I'm back on my laptop, thank you. I'm taking the weekend to gather myself (I'm on a little mini-vacation and this layoff totally ruined my mood but oh well) and I'm going to take any inkling of impending breakdown and channel it into networking and job searching and fixing up my portfolio."
5955,"yes! I'm on hormones that actually make it harder to experience the full range of emotion I'm used to, so the apathy is currently just present enough that I haven't come close to hyperventilating or crying or breaking down- instead I'm like ""well, this sucks, but it won't be like this forever, so for now all I can do is get my sh** together""-  and keep my wits about me so I don't freak my partner out, because he's leaving today for a week-long vacation and starting a new job next month."

5958,"Right there with you. I crawled through mounds of shit for months (9 months to be exact) to get a single written job offer........and now this happened. Not sure if I even have the job at this point, because no one has gotten back to me with anything. 

It's all a joke. I'm sick of employers undermining college graduates because of lack of experience or w/e. Hiring needs a major restructure, but that's just wishful thinking."
5959,"It ain't easy. Yeah there's an abundance of jobs, but i hate how today now you need to have connections to the job for example you apply to one place and you are very qualified for the job, but you will get passed up because the Boss's Best friends neighbor also applies to the same job and they have better connections and they will get the job over you, nowadays it isn't what you know but who you know."
5960,Yeah me. I graduated in 2014 and got B.S. in Biology. Ended up working in retail and eventually ended up as supervisor. I quit and went back to school and got an MBA and finished two weeks ago. I've applied everywhere even as a lab tech that only needs a high school degree. I got rejected because i dont satisfy the criteria. I just dont want to go back to working in retail :(
5961,"I graduated last May and I got hired right before everything went downhill. This was a written offer too, not just another (failed) interview. I did the drug screen, background check, the whole nine yards.

This job doesn't even pay a livable wage in my area. 9 months of crawling through mounds of shit, dealing with brainless recruiters, shitty, rude interviewers, making a million and one accounts (I think at some point my email will just explode from all of the accounts I've made for companies) and now this happens. I know I'm whining but I mean fuck, everything seems impossible. I've tailored my resume a million times, gone to job fairs (which are useless, they all just tell me to apply online), been told contradicting advice from a million people about what to say during interviews, how to write a shitty ass cover letter no one will read anyway, etc.

Who knows when I'll move out, let alone get another interview anytime soon. At this point I'm threw with it all. I've considered going to get my CDL at my local community college or something. But fuck me, this makes me sick. Having to scramble to find a career because I literally can't get hired anywhere.

What the hell is the point anymore."
5962,Yeah it’s like I constantly have to remind myself not to compare myself to others who have jobs but are in a completely different field.
5963,"- Preparation. Being able to speak comfortably about basic things, like your employment experience or academic research. If something is on your resume, it’s fair game to ask about.
- I’ve done a number of phone interviews where I swear candidates sounded like they just woke up. Not saying that in itself is bad, but they don’t sound focused on the task at hand, which is bad.
- I hate the “why do you want this job” question, but if you’re asked it, try to reframe it as “what do you hope to learn from this job?”
- I can usually tell when someone is overselling their strengths. Share concrete examples using the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result.
- Let your personality show. If I’m interviewing someone, it means I’m interested and will hire whichever candidate is the best fit. I think someone being able to gel with the team is an important qualification for the type of work that I do — I’m more likely to hire if I feel like someone is being him/herself during the interview.
- In my opinion, the most important thing a candidate can show me is the ability to identify a misstep, redirect and change course. If they can do that, I’m sold. One of my recent hires just left for another job, but he always joked that making a few mistakes on a work project isn’t the worst thing in the world, because they make good interview answers later.
- This will depend on the type of job you’re interviewing for, but I always appreciate it if someone can nerd out with me a bit about the subject matter. Being able to engage by asking thoughtful questions about the work we do shows your interest in the role."

5968,"I have no idea if this applies to you, but I hire entry level people and I’m always shocked at at how poor their interview skills are and at how many of them have never had an actual job before. 

I don’t think a degree (or even a Master’s — I was interviewing graduating Master’s students) proves that I want someone working for me. I think there are certain skills you can only learn in the workplace, and I’d much rather hire someone who learned those skills through some sort of retail/fast food/manual labour job than someone who’s going to have to learn all that on my team, where the stakes are much higher. I’ve seen too many hiring managers get burned before and I will not hire someone with just a degree and no actual work experience.

So, I guess I disagree — I don’t think a degree is (or should be) enough to break into the professional world. Tons of people have degrees. You need to have something more to offer.

Again, this may not apply to you at all, but I wanted to respond to your last sentence. Best of luck with the job search!"

5976,"I feel you dude. After I finished school I felt like my life was over. I had a degree – but that turned out to be pretty much useless – I had a pretty okay resume for someone just getting out of college (i.e. working retail, manual labour, etc,...), and I had some good personal references – and I got practically nothing. I couldn't even get a job at Target that was full time. I ended up living with my parents for a while and teaching guitar lessons at a music school 10 hours a week. But then my girlfriend decided to go get her PhD at a university half way across the country so we got married and moved to a whole different state where we know literally no one. Fortunately, my wife had saved up a little money and her PhD program paid her a stipend that covered the bills. We were okay for a little while but I could not get a job other than selling my ass on the corner. I sat at home all day everyday and just applied for jobs online and made phone calls. I may have gotten a half a dozen responses to the several hundred inquiries I made. It took 2 months before I even got an offer (it was from TruGreen – a lawn care company) and then another 2 weeks before I finally got a job. 

I had really high hopes coming out of college. I thought I would do something meaningful with my life. Now I work as the inspector for a painting company going through everyday pretending that I know anything about paint... or that I even care. It's been 9 months and they haven't fired me for not knowing what I'm doing yet so I guess that's good. I feel like a total disappointment. My parents had really high expectations for me when I graduated high school, I was supposed to do great things and be someone, now I'm just the stereotypical Mexican guy working for a contractor.

I don't want to hate what I do for work. I want to enjoy my life and do something meaningful. I'm a musician at heart and I want to do that but there's no real money in teaching and I have my little family to support. I can't afford to go back to school to study music or get the relevant qualifications for a job in the music business (I live pretty close to Los Angeles so there's plenty of music around here) and right now the only ""professional experience"" I have is working at this painting company for the last 9 months.

I don't know what you should do dude. Sorry I went off on a tangent and told my whole life story but if you want some kind of TL;DR then just don't settle for less than you want. Even if it takes a long time, just keep trying to find the meaning. It's fucking hard to find your way back once you get trapped in the daily grind. Do what you love. I'm trying to keep myself from falling into the trap right now. I started a hard rock band and I'm going to pursue my dream and I'm going to use my Joe-job to finance my goal. You might have to do that for a while but never lose sight of the real goal. I wish you the best homie, good luck finding your job."
5977,"I feel the same. And I have a healthcare degree. I feel so annoyed how everyone throughout college said ""oh you'll get a job right away everyone is going to be begging for you!!"" and now I can't even get secretary work. Meanwhile, I feel like I'm seeing people in liberal arts degrees that never did any internships/no strict GPA requirements getting good business management gigs right away."
5978,"It’s a real maze out there, just keep at it and make connections wherever you can!"
5979,"Don't. 

Also, don't have such an expectation that your degree is gonna pay off immediately. I'm certain you worked hard and made the right choices, you want to follow your dreams just like you always have, be the best you can be and all that other bullshit adults sold to us when you and I were children. It's horseshit. Here's the truth:

*Principles don't pay bills. If you want to pay for yourself, you're gonna have to get in the mud.*

I work in the field in which I studied in college. When I got this job, my degree was a single bulletpoint on the bottom half of my resume. This was at 30 years old, nearly a *decade* after I graduated.

My first job after my graduation was literally cold calls @ $10/hr. Telesales. Did that for nearly a year. Then moved on to the magical world of data entry. Literally typing bullshit stats into a computer all day every day. That was like $12.5/hr. Then I was a mover for like a year for $15/hr. Picking up and moving the purchases of those people who told me my college degree was the FastTrack to success. 

Someone has to be the bottom rung on the ladder. Now that the world is saturated with college graduates, you can't pretend that it's the ""head start"" they told you it was in middle school.

You wanna work, there is work. It just isn't what you want it to be right now, and it isn't gonna pay off the way you were told that it would."
5980,"I said fuck it and became a plumber, best decision of my life. It seems daunting to start over in a field that is in demand but the longer you wait, the more daunting it becomes. White-collar workforce is beyond saturated, don’t fall victim to the sunken cost fallacy."
5981,"Too true. Tradesmen will never go out of business. Electricians, plumbers, etc. are as guaranteed a career as anyone can hope for."
5982,A lot of businesses see liberal arts degrees as a plus as the students tend to be well rounded and good writers
5983,Thank you so much! The STAR method is the one thing I consistently hear from anyone I ask. It’s nice to know I’m a couple steps ahead already just by being prepared and not sounding like I’m half asleep haha!
5984,Sadly in science especially a degree is not enough and extensive lab experience is usually required.
5985,"But how do some of them even get these jobs? When I look at the job requirements it’ll say something like “5 years of management experience with skills a,b,c” that weren’t exactly available in college. 
It may be understandable if someone commutes to school and maybe worked full time throughout and took classes at night or on a part time basis. But for the traditional party school kid idk how they get these jobs if it wasn’t for a good family connection. Or maybe I just need to b.s my resume better."
5986,"Besides family connections, people get jobs right out of college with experience from internships. Or if you’re in a research focused area, research experience. It sucks that they don’t emphasize this more, but for getting hired after school what you do besides classes is by far the most important. In my opinion, you should be looking for entry level jobs with 1-2 year experience requirements. You don’t always actually need everything they require, within reason."
5987,This is the best response. Definitely look at other positions.
5988,"Is there seasonal work in the area? I had a 4 month break in between jobs and ended up working at a plant nursery for their spring rush. Worked less than 40 hours a week, met new people, and it kept me sane for those months."
5989,"Travel!!! Forget about online learning. Just head to southeast Asia, Europe, or South America and hostel it up. Enjoy these months and learn new things about the world rather than just learning new professional skills. Much more valuable imo, the professional stuff can wait a few months. 

What are your savings like at the moment? I can help you out and make you a vague itinerary with hostel recommendations. You'll make so many new friends.

-24m world traveler on a budget. Traveling is also cheaper IMO than moving to your new city early."
5990,"PLEASE GO TRAVEL!!!!!!!

I backpacked by myself for 6 months in asia and the Middle East and I spent around $8000. It’s really affordable and much much cheaper than rent in a big city. It’ll change your life and you’ll come into your job with a new perspective. PM me if you want to know more details I would love to help."
5991,"Travel travel travel travel. 

I can’t recommend this more. You won’t have much chance to tick off things on your bucket list when you’re working full time so pick somewhere that you’ve always wanted to visit and go! I was in the same situation and I went to South East Asia for 3 months and it was incredible and very cheap.

If you’re into skiing or snowboarding I can also wholeheartedly recommend a seasonal job at a snow resort for the winter. It’s an amazing chance to spend time on the slopes, meet new people and have a great time while earning a bit of cash."
5992,"thank you for the advice! I would love to visit more places. I already travelled a bit with my roommate after graduation, so I feel like an extra trip might be too frivolous. I haven’t travelled much growing up and I’m not used to spending a lot of money out of the blue (the grad trip took months to save up for)."
5993,"I can definitely afford a trip abroad (on a budget of course) with extra money to spare. This summer I stayed at a hostel in Southeast Asia, and would love some recommendations on places to stay in the area (or Asia in general)—I’d love to go back, since the food was amazing!"
5994,Do too have any recommendations on resorts to work at? I’m considering working at one next winter
5995,[deleted]
5996,Yeah. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders compared to most people and this company is a good fit but also lacks demand for you. I’d go with the looking at other jobs option purely because this company that wishes to take you on has in a sense disregarded your time has asked you to wait an obscene amount of time. If the other jobs don’t pan out then yeah find a small retail job or a waiter job at home. Better times are to come and if you can prove to yourself that you can tough it out in the slow/hard times you will thrive in the busy/good times. :) keep it up and stay positive
5997,"Fellow consulting analyst here who just started work in October after graduating in May, so I was in a similar predicament. 

My advice to you is to move to and explore your new city, since it sounds like that’s what you want to do the most. Almost all consulting gigs provide a signing bonus, so if you haven’t blown that yet I would use that to live/eat/pay rent with over the coming months. If your job is like mine tho and you don’t get it until the first paycheck, you can take out a loan/use a credit card/borrow money from friends/family since you know you’ll be able to pay them back in full soon.

With regards to time though, use it to explore the city and meet people! I know you’re aware of consulting hours but it’s rough at times. I work 8-8 usually and barely have time to go to the gym let alone hang with friends, especially when you’re on the road. What I did was use my time to do things in the city I know I wanted to do and wouldn’t have time for later, and to do personal development stuff like excel practice and reading. Hang out with friends, go out for drinks, exercise, go to the movies, meet new people - just soak in the city. You’re gonna be a slave to your email soon enough. Hope this helped."
5998,Travel in Asia it’s extremely cheap to do so or if you’re interested in traveling Australia or New Zealand I’m a travel agent here and can find cheap(er) trips for you but your money will go a LOT farther in Asia and you’ll have more fun. If I were you I’d be on the first flight after Christmas but that’s just me.
5999,"I did several seasons in resorts in BC and Alberta in Canada (Whistler, Lake Louise, Banff) which I would highly recommend. There’s also lots of fantastic resorts in Europe. Several of my friends have also done seasons in Japan, New Zealand and Australia. I haven’t been to any resorts in the US (I assume this is where you’d want to be?) but I’m sure there are plenty of websites or even subs that could help you make a good choice."
6000,Take it from someone who was in a similar situation. Travel and enjoy the time off (maybe hit the gym and get healthier). When you start that full time job you’re going to wish for free time and wished you explored the world more. Consulting hours are more than your average 9-5. Just enjoy and relax for now. You just finished your degree which I’m assuming was non-stop work as well. Take this nice little break before you start your full time position.
6001,"Honestly, travel. I just graduated too, I’m super jealous and wish I had the time off before my job starts!"
6002,"Not sure where you are or what your hobbies are, but winter seasonal work can be really fun!  
I've worked at a ski resort as an instructor and it's the life. Your break from December to late spring lines up perfectly with when resorts need work too. I got so much better at skiing being on the mountain everyday and had a blast living in the resort town. There's plenty of mountains near SF at Lake Tahoe that I'm sure are always looking for seasonal employees."
6003,TRAVEL! Now is the time because once you start working it will be more difficult to take extended vacations!
6004,"It'd be cheap for you to travel to places like Asia. I, on the other hand, couldn't do much traveling because my currency is sh*t. I think it'd be cool to travel for a bit because free time is a luxury once you start working. Or move to that city after you find some part time job? Anything except for staying at home."
6005,"Travel!!! Learn something new— language, instrument, sport"
6006,Get swole
6007,"Your experience really helped a lot!

It’ll be the exact same case for me, regarding the bonus. It’s more than enough to help for rent. Upon your suggestion, I talked to my parents and fortunately they are willing to help me with part of the living expenses until my first paycheck.

There are plenty of experiences and networking events in the area that I’m looking forward to going to when I move there. It’ll definitely be good to do that before I start working. Thank you!"
6008,Lol I cancelled my gym membership to save money. It may not have been the wisest choice haha

6011,"Nah. Body weight workouts and running are really all you need. You can get a single kettlebell at academy for like $30 and do all kinds of workouts that enhance functional strength. 

Imagine showing up to your new job in great shape and feeling just that much more confident."
6012,Do you mind saying what firm you're starting at? The spot you're in seems a lot like the process that my firm uses for onboarding fresh college grads in waves. Sounds like they were going to put you in the January group and it filled up or something so they scheduled you for the next wave.
6013,Yeah I’m in the US so that would be ideal. I assume I would have to get a work visa to go to Canada.
6014,By any chance are you going to work for Manhattan?
6015,TRAVEL!
6016,"Hi mate, are you in the UK/London? If so, I can suggest a great way of making a decent living for an interim period. It’s zero hours so work as much or as little as you want, it’s fun, easy and decently paid"
6017,"did you graduate very recently? when?

i found that for several months right after graduation, I was starting with a net worth in the negatives bc of student loans. as soon as I could save up enough for a little emergency fund buffer and aggressively paid off my student loans, constantly thinking about money became a lot smaller of a problem. i still think about it because now I want to try and buy a condo but it's no where near the obsession before.

so my advice is just be patient and tell yourself that you can't expect to be fresh faced out of school with 100k in the bank. just be patient.

also, the stocks thing is a lot more volatile than other investments. i would suggest looking into something more passive so that it doesn't completely consume your attention"
6018,I live at home with my parents too and i’m also trying to apply to school. I have the same issue. I’m always worried about money and I made this like insanely detailed budget but it still didn’t really make me feel better. It just feels like this thing i’ll never get under control or feel any relief. I wish i could move out but the money anxiety would get even worse then.
6019,"I actually did move out for a year before coming back to my family due to the pandemic. I had to move to another city due to work and it did feel nice to be independent. Strangely enough I think the responsibilities I had to keep myself healthy were enough to drown out all the financial worries. Thinking back, it didn’t make much sense since I had so many expenses, my bank never went past more than a few thousand, but I didn’t really care at that time. But it was awfully lonely moving to a new city."
6020,"Tbh if you are earning barely over minimum wage then to a certain degree you should be worried about money. I focus on it a lot and am pretty good at making money, funny you mention GME, that paid for my new car. But individual stock money is yolo money that you shouldn’t worry about losing, it’s different than actual investing. My advice wouldn’t be doubling down on education at this point, if a bachelors is only netting you just above minimum wage then honestly you would be better served just spamming your resume to every white collar job you can for the next year instead of spending more money and time trying to buy your way out of poverty."
6021,"Man, I’m probably around your age as well and I completely know what you mean. I’m still in school but I barely earn enough to pay all my expenses every month. I have one more yea run my program and after that I should be set up in a pretty decent career path but it’s always *all* been about money.

I was raised very poor and luckily my family did everything they could to help provide me with a “normal” life but a lot of that struggling I’ve seen in my life has just made me want more money so I can be comfortable. Right now I’m struggling trying to outfit my new apartment with a few things I *want* but don’t need, like a new bookshelf, kitchen island, and a few other things and it just fucking sucks to not be able to not worry about planning and saving up just to buy something worth $100 or $200. 

But on the flip side I have a buddy who combined with his girl make probably $150k a year and they still have to worry about money because they are spending more on unnecessary stuff constantly."
6022,"I graduated 2 years ago and have been able to pay off my loans with help from my parents. 

I am trying to save up towards a home but rising housing prices in my area make that difficult, and I can’t move too far from my family.

Any suggestions for more passive income sources?"
6023,"I did the same thing, and was across the country for a temporary job. I came home because my whole support system wasn’t there. The responsibility at least made me feel a little more in control too."
6024,"I’m in the same position and I’d say that you should forget about the stocks and just open an investment account that just puts money into a fund with a risk level that reflects when you’d like to use the money. I made a Roth IRA and it makes me feel a little better that at least I have gotten something growing compound interest even though it’s literally peanuts. Regardless, its an oppressive cloud that hangs over my emotional state a lot. Planning & patience helps."
6025,"Save for an an ‘emergency fund’ and then a ‘house’ fund. Decided where you want to keep it (savings or invested or a mix) and then just keep doing that. 

I graduated almost 6yrs ago and I didn’t feel financially secure until maybe 2yrs ago? So it takes awhile. I still have student loan debt and ive not lived with my parents so you have that advantage, take it and save as much as you can!"
6026,"Bro you're being unreasonably woeful, paying off your student loans sincerely isn't that difficult, you just have to be okay with being homeless and eating two bean burritos a day for 5-10 years after graduating. That simple."
6027,"I feel you, man.  When I graduated college and had a ""ok"" paying job, I *still* worried about money constantly.  So, don't beat yourself up about it.  Financial security is a really important thing.  My best advice would be to save a bit of money.  Having a financial cushion can really take the burden off of your mind.  Granted, since you're not making much more than minimum, this may be difficult.

I'm not sure where you're located, but post-secondary could make things worse if it saddles you with even more debt.  Debt is the enemy of financial freedom.  Do research and be careful that you'll be able to get a better-paying job afterwards."

6033,"Welcome to the desk monkey club. Get a gym membership or you'll regret it. How do people move into their own place without family support?

I graduated with a CIS degree, which is basically the same as CS."
6036,[deleted]
6037,"I wouldn’t say people can’t move into their own place alone. It all depends on the COL in the area and the type of job/pay you can get. It also depends on other expenses you have. I have a phone interview tomorrow for a job that pays between 40-50k. I could find a halfway decent apartment for around $900/month and still have $1400 left. It would be tight but manageable. 

Of course OP is around NYC so prices are different but salaries are also different. It’s a cynical view to say anyone who says they can do it is lying. It’s tough but not impossible."
6038,I appreciate the advice! I'll try and expand my search to those types of jobs as well. I had a great internship for a year but the week after I got hired the company went under.
6039,"\> 1.5 hour commute into the city made me quit my first job after a month to save my mental health.

&#x200B;

Commuting sucks. How you're commute made you have a mental breakdown probably means you have a bigger issue besides a career you should address. Assuming that is mitigated or solved.

Pre-commute:

* Dry run a commute and calculate roughly timing, I do this with in person interviews. Google maps and some awareness go hand in hand. Really no excuse with NYC subs because google maps does it really really good.
* Dry run getting up in the morning to gauge how much time you need to get ready.
* Prepare everything for the next day. I think this is the hardest part for people is having routine commute, irregularities can make it hellish. This is what I do. 
   * Keep things you need to leave for work with by exit. Breakfast snack, work bag, keys, metro card, etc.
   * Valet tray for pocket essentials (could be literally a plate) so you put everything there. You don't lose things that have their own place. Make it so that your essentials are the same.
   * Build outfit with layers, dress in mind that the temperature will fluctuate \~5-10 degrees based on how much you move. Less movement, more layers, vice versa etc. 
   * Phone is plugged into charger
   * Get a watch, really helps calculating a commute and keeping on schedule. 
* Traffic is like waves. You just have to ride it when no one else is. I see it that come nice weather, people come in early and leave early to spend more time outside. People come in late and leave late in bad weather because it is harder to get up and come end of year more work. Find a groove and the commute will be slightly shorter. 

&#x200B;

\> are there any business jobs I can do that don’t require being chained to a desk all day?

You're not going to. It's like aids, but you take meds to lower the symptoms and it doesn't come up on tests. But it is still there! 

* You will have to do work there anyway. Develop good ergonomics into your work environment and you'll feel less shitty.
   * Top of monitor eye level
   * Feet should be flat with the ground 
   * \[More information on ergos\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8\_ME4VwTiw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_ME4VwTiw))
* Different companies have different modes, most big companies realize that if they are toxic no one will want to really work for them. Mostly comes down to industry, but hey interviews are a two way communication street so inquiring about it never hurts and probably encouraged. 
   * Don't forget work from home! Ask about that, they are starting to add a day or two offsite!
* Find a different line of work. Recruiting, consulting, HR, etc. Something interpersonal that you have to move around to meet other people. Most jobs build up to be like that though to some extent, but entry level will probably be relegated onto smaller projects and such where you are working solo.

\> How do people start their lives after graduation and move into their own place without family support??

Figment of imagination. NJ and NY have are some of the highest states with millennials living with their parents. In the case of NJ.

\> Any north jersey areas with a lot of jobs?

&#x200B;

There are a lot of offices that are headquartered in NYC, but have offices in NJ. Just a matter of finding those companies."
6040,Are you working now? Can I ask what type of job? Life honestly sucks ugh 😑
6041,Or be in a/move to a LCOL area and take the first temp or perm job that you can get to pay for it. I worked 15-30 hour weeks all of my last semester to save up enough to move across the country with no job or family support and got a temp position to tie me over. Self made is rarely glamorous or in the “nice” cities.
6042,This isn't helpful in the least
6043,Everyone is finding their own direction. Knowing what you dislike is the first step towards finding it.
6044,"I can't speak personally about business or business-related jobs, but I know a lot of folks that ended up working in Morristown, including myself. It's a nice area and a relatively decent number of jobs. Morristown is expensive to live in, but some of the towns around it are less so.

The jump from college to that first job is always a brutal one. The job hunt feels like a total lottery and even if you end up in a good, salaried position, I think everyone has a moment of *Fuck... is this really what the rest of my life is going to be like?* College really doesn't prepare you for that. I felt that HARD pretty much my first day of work after school :/

How I coped was trying to find work at places that wasn't trying to squeeze the soul out of me. Eventually I found work at a small company that really valued work-life balance and that was great for my mental health. I gladly traded a decrease in pay to have an easier transition from school to working life.  As you probably already know,  most entry-level, white collar work is going to involve a lot of sitting at a desk and working on a computer. How I'm making it through is making sure that I do things outside of the office - as soon as it hits 5, I'm out of there and I go for a walk (esp. since it's summer), go to the gym, hang out with friends, etc. 

TL;DR A lot of entry level work is going to be drudgery. What you can do about it is finding a company that respects you as a person, and barring that, finding things to do outside of work so that as soon as you finish your 8 hours at the office you can immediately leave and do something actually fulfilling. Once you have a survived a few years and have a better idea of what you like/dislike, you can apply for jobs that are intrinsically more fulfilling to you and the cycle continues. It's a slow process but it does get better."
6045,"Honestly not a bad recommendation. PM certification can open a lot of doors to different fields. It takes time to study, but it’s definitely possible and could give you an edge, OP."

Piggy-backing off of these comments to second that.  At the risk of sounding like my parents and grandparents (I'm only 33), I feel like it's necessary to reiterate that you're almost certainly not going to land the perfect job at 22.  It's important to remember that - just like our parents, and grandparents, and *their* parents before them - sometimes we have to take a tough, hard, unpleasant job to survive for a period of time because that's just the way it is.  There shouldn't be an illusion that a few of your early jobs aren't going to be boring, or difficult, or thankless, or have a grueling commute.  I live in the NYC area as well, and sometimes hate my 1 hour commute, cram-packed, shoulder-to-shoulder with hundreds of other people.  But whenever I start to get super agitated about it, I remember that my father used to *drive* TWO hours each way to work each day for his truck*driving* job, during which he'd drive another 12 hours.  He did that nearly every day for many years.  Yeah, suddenly my commute isn't so bad anymore.  

I say all this as a preface to saying there is light at the end of the tunnel!  We're fortunate enough to be working in an era with far more opportunities than most of our parents had.  We actually can do crazy things, like worry about what kinds of jobs we *want*, how much time we want to spend at the office versus offsite, how much traveling we want to do, etc.  It almost certainly won't be at your first job, but use your early jobs to network around and truly discover roles you are more interested in.  Make good connections.  Most companies, especially in the NYC area, tend to have high turnover.  Building a solid relationship with someone from your current job often leads to new opportunities at other companies that they move on to.  

I've been fortunate enough to be in that position.  Just 5 years ago (I was 28), after years of feeling stuck, I got a small opportunity to do something that had absolutely nothing to do with my degree in a new state (Connecticut) for the shitty salary of $31k per year.  I took it. I packed up all my stuff and moved to a new state for a $31k/yr job in a fairly expensive region.  I didn't care, needed something new.  

I was a sponge at this new job, helping with anything and everything I could, learning a ton, focusing on things that I was naturally good at (numbers, logic, models).  My job gradually transitioned from project management type work, to data administration, to assisting in modeling that data into financial forecasts for each team, to a new role in sales operations and, ultimately, finance.  The important takeaways from this period are the following: 

1) I learned that I can do it.  I can succeed in a professional environment.  
2) I learned what I enjoyed doing in said professional environment. 
3) I forged a few strong relationships. 

The company I worked at rewarded me as much as they could given my low starting point.  They bumped me up to the $50k range and allowed me to flexibly work out of either the CT office or an NYC office to be closer to my girlfriend who had moved into the city.  Eventually I transitioned 100% to the NYC office.  Despite everything, there's only so much growing you can do in one company sometimes.  I felt I had plateaued in my role, both in skill growth and in terms of salary, again given my low starting point.  So when one of my former co-workers called me up saying they had a role that I'd be perfect for at their new company, I jumped at the opportunity.  I got the job, made the switch, have learned an additional metric *ton* of new skills that will surely aid me in my next endeavor, and am now in the 6-figure salary range after a few years of raises.  

I say all that not as a humble-brag in any way, but rather to say that if I can do it, then literally anyone can.  Did I mention that I literally cut grass and worked as a part time bank teller for 5 years to survive before all this?  

I love the advice from the poster above me that says an interview is a two-way street.  This is so true.  So is the job itself.  Throughout your time during your initial jobs, you should constantly be interviewing the roles and your coworkers.  You're looking for the right fit for you.  Maybe it's not the role you were hired for, but maybe there's something else that will be super interesting to you there that you won't even know exists until you're exposed to it.  As soon as you find something like that, see what opportunities there are for you to get involved in it.  

Aside from that, the culture of the company you work for is so important, as is that of your specific team.  I'm still working under my old co-worker, who I now consider to be one of my best friends.  I know he's got my back; and I, in turn, have the back of the employees under me.  I know how much an NYC commute can suck, so we're totally flexible with work from home days.  We try to all take at least 1 every other week, if not more, in addition to alternating summer fridays.  On top of that, we only loosely track vacation/sick days.  As far as I'm concerned, if your friends are taking a week long European backpack trip later this summer and you're working under me, you're going to goddamn join them on that trip.  You're not missing an awesome opportunity like that.  As long as you're working hard when you're on and all of your work is getting done, you've earned it, as far as I'm concerned.  We work so that we can enjoy the rest of our lives.

My girlfriend travels for work, and just this past year I've been able to join her on trips to Seattle, San Francisco, London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Paris, and Singapore.  Freaking *Singapore!*  Half the time on those trips I was working remotely to stay on top of my work as needed, but I didn't mind.  The flexibility of even being able to go on those trips was amazing.  

Anyway, I know that turned into a super long life story, but hopefully it provided a few tidbits of tips and advice."
6047,"Okay but so many internships tend to be unpaid or the pay is extremely low, so it’s a bit unfair to just assume everyone has the family support/ means to do one of those."
6048,"I probably should begin to expand my search past my two hour radius, I keep holding on hoping something will come up, but it's almost August so I should probably search any/everywhere at this point."
6049,"Consider a complete change. Drive across country and look at some other places to live and work. Give yourself a fresh start. Even if you do not find something different that you like, for me at least, a road trip does wonders for my mental health. All the best."
6050,"Maybe sounds a bit stupid or obvious, but why not looking at a consultancy company? Even if their office is in the center of NYC, chances are you get to travel far from it, where the clients reside."
6051,"I am, but if you read my latest post you can kind of see my struggle haha. I’ve been considering quitting and going home,  but am worried it would make me super isolated (like how it sounds you feel...)"
6052,"You can do it my friend. I would also recommend looking at jobs that have to do with CS but might not be exactly what you wanted. I wanted a web developer job, but then applied for a software developer position because there weren’t any web dev jobs in Calgary at the time. I found out that I really enjoy it and I’m glad that I took the leap."
6053,Not everyone can move to California.
6054,Lmao maybe if you’re in engineering. Many areas of STEM are oversaturated at the moment. As someone looking to go into research (biomedical) it’s not something that pays very well.
6055,Is it possible that what you observe in your immediate area doesn't apply to everyone universally?
6056,"Maybe don't live in NYC? Long commutes and high rents can be soul crushing, even if you ""make less"" out of the city you'll probably have more money due to cost of living going down."
6057,It does suck :( where do u live?
6058,"Unless it’s a small boutique firm, you usually have to attend a top business school on top of having had some pretty prestigious internships to land a job as a consultant. Even then, consultants usually work insane hours, and the new guys are on excel/powerpoint almost all day, so it probably wouldn’t be a good fit for OP."
6059,"Same on the commute.  Podcasts and Kindle are god-sends.  Assuming normal conditions (ie. not waiting 20 minutes for a train in a 115 degree subway terminal), my commute actually becomes some valuable ""me time.""  I don't always opt to listen to podcasts or read during my true free time at home; I'm more liable to play some video games or Netflix & chill.  But during the commute, those 2 things become prime activities.  As a bonus, they're both fun *and* extremely beneficial!  Seriously, I've learned so many things that I'd otherwise know absolutely nothing about and probably wouldn't have had the discipline to learn about if not for my otherwise boring commute time. 

Also, I've mixed up my commute routine by bypassing the bus portion of it and turning it into a morning bike ride.  I actually *look forward* to that first leg of my commute each day.  In NYC, pedestrians suck, subways suck, buses suck, driving definitely sucks; but riding a bike feels amazing.  It turns something that is otherwise stressful to me into something that is actually stress-relieving.  Also, Citibike is an amazing deal in NYC - $150 to use their bikes for a full year.  Some employers' insurance companies even have deals with Citibike that allow you to get a year membership for free."
6060,"Dang. Must be nice. The original field I wanted to go into, nonpaid internships can be pretty competitive. It sucks. (From New England, for perspective)."
6061,Congrats on landing two interviews though!
6062,"stupid shit. not everyone is gonna get a dream job at google or sth like that. reality is that life is a competition and if you lose out youre gonna be left behind in a shitty job no one else wanted and thats gonna be your entire life.

theres no fucking happy end im so tired of this sugarcoating, i think this is the main reason why im (and probably many many other young people are) super disillusioned about entering adult life"
6063,Lol thanks
6064,"I have plenty of research experience under my belt, but in order to continue to be a researcher most labs require a PhD. Very few require a master’s at least."
6065,Why do you need a masters for molecular biology? I'm sure there are plently of private labs that would be interested in you with just a bachelors degree. It also helps to have experience with internships or research.
6066,I got a Bachelors in biochem in 2018 and didn’t get a job until January this year. I worked my ass off and just got a promotion from lab tech to specialist where I do more actual experimentation with JNJ scientists instead of just creating chemicals. With a Bachelors and a couple years experience you can become an associate scientist and continue to work up from there if you take the right path. There are opportunities in leading projects and such that you won’t get without an advanced degree but you can go up the ladder with a Bachelors if you get experience under you belt. My friend doesn’t even have a Bachelors but he’s a Scientist III with Eurofins because he has 15 years experience. Just something to think about
6067,"I would recommend only doing a PhD if you find a passion project. Grad school is very gruelling and often feels like a waste of time given the unclear future opportunities. Only a very small proportion of PhD students actually make it to the professor stage, and many end up going into the industry route, which you would be just as qualified for with a masters.

I have friends that ended up doing teaching after their masters for the same reason you mention. I think there’s more guarantee that you’ll end up teaching if that’s the kind of fulfilment you’re looking for."
6068,There’s a huge spectrum of labs out there too. So if you don’t like one then don’t be afraid to bounce. I worked in a fish lab my 1st year in college that I absolutely hated and then spent 3 in a yeast lab and enjoyed every moment lol. You never know what you’ll like
6069,lol I said the same thing about Academia. Low pay and longer hours
6070,"And don’t divide it up into high school teaching vs PhD. You can always try to be a higher up educator if you want to do that route. However, almost all major universities will only hire PhDs for teaching nowadays"
6071,Just thought I'd mention that you don't need to feel like you're not living up to your potential if you become a teacher. They're just as important as any other part of the scientific field. It's more about whether you're fine with the 'teacher' part I guess
6072,So whatever makes you happier. Sounds like teaching is it
6073,I’m having the exact same dilemma but with a different field vs teaching and immediate impact. I really feel ur pain and I think at least trying things out in the meantime is helping me decide what I want to do longterm
6074,"Just out of curiosity, which field in philosophy do you find the most intriguing?"
6075,"Ugh. I am aware of this but I’m really against working for an industry lol 
EDIT: just not where i would be happy"
6076,What about looking into a PhD in bioethics and health policy? That seems to be a way to combine those three interests.
6077,"Hello! PhD student here. Ultimately you’ll have to decide what works for you, but here’s a few things to keep in mind while you figure it out!

1.) Give teaching a try! Being in a PhD program doesn’t mean you can’t teach. I volunteer with a group that teaches elementary kiddos how to program robots. You can try both out and see what really speaks to you

2.) PhD pays you. Probably not what a *good* PhD student would say, but I had no clue what I wanted to do after college, and I did know I didn’t want to incur any more debt (and I did enjoy research while in undergrad lol). PhD offers some job security if you can find the right labs/projects, and it provides some solid insight into what academia looks like (if you for example were curious about teaching college age students)

3.) Masters along the way. Because I definitely struggle with doubt, it was important to me to find a program that allowed me to pick up a masters along the way, in case I decided the program wasn’t for me. 

There’s a lot of overlap between the two, and there isn’t really a “deadline” for them I think. You might as well give both a shot if that’s realistic for you, but you’re not permanently locking yourself out of one option if you decide to just pursue one path for now"
6078,Do you want to be in academia? Cuz you can still do research in the industry with a masters
6079,"Thank you for this! I actually did end up deciding to become a teacher because i absolutely do not have the attention span or the passion for research that i would need for a phd. Im much more passionate about educating young people, and everyone ive talked to has said that i would be a great teacher. im much happier after making this decision, now i just need to pay for my masters in education haha"
6080,"Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT enter into a PhD program if your only reason is because you don’t know what else to do. It will not get you a better job. It will not net you more money, especially when accounting for the opportunity cost. You love to teach? Horrible reason. There is only one reason to get a PhD and that’s because you just can’t imagine going the rest of your life not spending all of your time researching and publishing on this one niche topic that you are interested in. A PhD is a vocational program. It is teaching you how to research and publish in your field. That’s it. So if you want to spend the rest of your days doing that, congrats. You will enjoy a PhD program. But it goes without saying that you are guaranteed to come out of graduate school with one of two things, sometimes both things, but at least one: mental illness and a degree. Family, professors, friends, the media will all tell you your degree is useless and you have to go to graduate school. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. I don’t care what field it is. I heard the same thing about my field. Well guess what? The overwhelming majority of my coworkers have a bachelors. That’s it. And many of them are making 6 figures easily. Go on indeed and look at jobs you want to do. How many of them require a PhD or masters? Look at how many of them say “experience can substitute for degree on a year by year basis.” If you want to be a pool cleaner with a PhD definitely go to grad school. If you want to work a good job outside academia, get your foot in the door and work towards it. I’m a big proponent of not going to graduate school until you 100% can no longer progress in your career without one or you decide you absolutely want to research as I said. Also no one will tell you this, but there is such a thing as PhD by publication. It’s popular in Europe and Australia and is catching on in the US. Essentially you write and publish your own research and then present it for review by a school. If approved, you are awarded a PhD without the hassle of a classroom. Plus you get to keep your day job. I just let go of the idea of traditional academia last week. I tried taking classes again to apply to grad school. Finally realized I hate school and college. I love to learn and I will teach myself and save my money and happiness."
6081,thank you for this!
6082,"If I'm being honest with myself, yeah I kinda am. Maybe not in this post but I've definitely been having a victim complex with my situation here"
6083,This is awesome advice
6084,Definitely agree with going to the gym right after work. I pack my gym bag at night and keep it in my car so I can just go straight to the gym after I clock out. It also gives me something to look forward to and helps me get through the day much easier. Plus once you’ve gotten a few good workouts in you really start noticing your energy levels are higher during the work day.
6085,"Portion control. I didn't have to change my diet at all, I just got a handle on how much I ate per meal. Yes, I can crush an entire pizza, but I don't. 

I lost 20 lbs just by paying attention to how much I was eating. Also water."
6086,To piggy back on what you’re saying r/MealPrepSunday is a wonderful resource. I’m soon to graduate but was working 40 hours a week in the summer and meal prepped the whole summer. It makes a world of difference being able to grab my lunch of the way out the door every morning. Meal prepping breakfast is also super easy if you like oatmeal and you can do overnight oats.
6087,"I would like to point out that whether it's ""very manageable"" depends on your job, and the mental strain it can cause. Yes, some jobs can be very easy to deal with, especially if you dont bring home any baggage; that baggage can come in many forms. It could be more work, it could be stress, it could be just an emotionally taxing day where your brain just wants to shut off. Not all 40-hour days are the same and it's important to recognize that.

Meal prep is a great way to start, and if you aren't dealing with someone else's schedule on top of your own, perhaps working out in the morning so when you're done work you can just go home. However, this requires you to be able to choose your bedtime in order to get up for that, and again, different lives can make that easier and others can make it harder.

The important thing is that if you try something and it doesn't stick, try again or try something new. Your life is different than others' and no one can tell you what's gonna be the 'right way.'  Try these suggestions, but don't get discouraged if one person's way doesn't work for you. Keep going."
6088,"Oh my bad- as I was reading it, it seemed like you were just sharing your experiences and even hinted that you were happier now, and realized you would deal with the issue at some point. Either way, you’ve analyzed and owned the problem as yours which is basically the first half to fixing it :)"
6089,"I'm not saying make excuses, I'm saying find the time of day that works best and don't get discouraged if it doesn't work as well as someone elses' day. I'm saying keep going, don't stop. I think you read into some things without looking at the message as a whole.

Also not everyone feels better after working out. Some do, some don't. It's another example of people not knowing everything about one's personal routine. The OP even said he never particularly enjoyed it when he was working out routinely."
6090,"Once you get fit and exercise regularly DOMS almost completely goes away (until you try a new form of exercise or go super hard one day). I workout and/or run everyday and the soreness never gets beyond the level where you remember which part was worked, ha. 

It’s great you found mental happiness, just think of how much better you’ll feel when your body is as strong. Fitness is more than looking nice, it is strengthening your body. If I can get a philosophical, the body is the only tool the mind has to interact with the world. Empowering the body gives you more power over the world.

Good luck"
6091,"I'm leaving my own story here. It's quite long but the reason I write this is because your story gives me some level of hope and a whole lot of reflection of my own that I want to share.

I'm graduating in May and wanted to share my own experience- it's actually quite opposite compared to yours. Since starting university I've lost 20 pounds due to stress, lack of sleep and other personal problems. During that time, my mental health suffered dramatically and is the largest and leading factor for that decline in my own physical wellbeing.

I relate quite a bit to you- I absolutely hate exercising and have no compelling desires to work out. I'm known to others as a bookworm and would rather spend time studying inside than go out for a run, and I still bring up excuses to avoid physical exercise: ""I'm too busy,"" ""there's a test tomorrow,"" ""I'm just tired.""

I'll be 20 years old in June. I look sickly, my friends and family are all worried about me; some of my friends are genuinely worried for my health and my mother is just worried sick. I have a poor relationship with food and find it difficult to gain weight/eat food in general, and my body rejects most of the food I eat in times of major stress/periods of negativity.

But there's a certain a point where I looked at myself in the mirror and was just freaked out by the image reflecting back. Thin, pale with bags under my eyes and poor posture- I didn't only feel bad, I looked horrible. And I thought, ""dude, you're 19. This is supposed to be the leading times of your life. The times when you can buckle down 6 beers and an entire pizza, ready to wake up and do it again the next day and you're sitting here barely able to meet the average daily calorie count for most adults.""

""You're unhappy with yourself right now but goddamn it you're going to be unhappy with yourself if you don't do anything about it. Time will flow and life will keep moving whether you choose to get off your ass or not.""

So I've taken the liberty to try exercising. I've started doing the 30 day pushup challenge and gone for runs every day. I still find it difficult to go to the gym because of my time schedule (I've currently got 6 courses and go to school 5 days a week) but I'm slowly pushing myself to try.) This was back in the beginning of the year (riding that new year new me bullshit)

Have I made quantifiable progress? Fuck no. But goddamn it, I feel WAY better. I feel alive. I feel like I actually have energy and the motivation to do things. I feel better about eating food and am slowly building myself up to regain an appetite.

The reason I'm telling you this is because I hope you read my story and take some time to reflect. I don't write this to tell you to change your life, or to shame you for not doing anything or feeling this way, or to make you feel poor because you're complaining about gaining weight when it's so difficult for me.

The reason I'm writing this is so you can just reflect. Everyone has been through tough times but I truly believe we feel better even hearing other people's stories because it reminds us that we are not alone in this fight, and that people you see every day may be going through the same issues.

Others will offer you better advice, like actually quantifiable ways to meet your goals or actual lifestyle changes you can apply right now to begin. I don't have that. I've just barely begun figuring out and re-configuring my own life. But I am here to offer just my own two cents and my own emotion and story.

You have to reflect on what you want in life and what amount of effort you're going to put in to get a reflected quality of life from that effort. When you come to terms with that, put in the effort, day by day.

Good luck man. Here's to happier, healthier lives.

Edit: before anyone calls bullshit on me graduating university at 20 years old, I'm taking a 2-year diploma program. joined school right at 18 out of high school."
6092,"It's difficult to find the motivation to exercise after a long tiring day at work. I think something that helped me was by joining team sports. That way it was more social and fun and doing exercise, rather than just alone and in a gym :) just a suggestion"
6093,"I started eating virtually the exact same things at the exact same times every working day, with virtually no variation, and I always decline all free office food.

Having my eating tied to a time really helps me.

Also, others mentioned bringing a gym bag to work and going immediately afterwards, and that is fantastic advice. I’ll go a step further and say that you should find a gym as close to your office as possible so you can jet right over after work.

I live 30 minutes away from work and found a gym just 5 minutes drive from my office, it’s extremely helpful to not even think about it and just go right over after work."
6094,"I have a sort of similar experience, in 5’7” and went into college at around 170lbs and was insecure and always felt overweight and unattractive due to comments I received at home (that’s a totally different rabbit hole to go down) so I didn’t notice it happening until suddenly I actually was overweight and unattractive and not by a small margin. I maintained that weight for a little while, then got up to 200 in college, then went down to almost 170 when I was stressed out and doing school work all the time during some of my most difficult classes, then in my last year of school I ballooned all the way to 235. 

Then when I got out of school I took a part time job that involved a lot of walking and started eating better while searching for a job in my field and got down to 190 and felt really good about that until I got a job in my field where I sit at a desk all day and now I’m back up to 205 and feel like I’m having to go so far out of my way to fix that compared to any other time and I have trouble getting that motivation even though I know that looking healthy and making yourself as attractive as you can be is a huge help in the job market even though it seems shallow

I wish I had some advice, but I can just say I totally understand where you’re coming from and I wish I knew a good answer"
6095,"40 hours isnt a lot... but anyways exercise, healthy food and not creeping reddit till 12am works wonders :) hope you get better soon"
6096,"I’m not disagreeing with you by any means, I just wanted to add some context about how commutes really change how the 40 hour week feels. 

I wake up at 6am every day to leave at 6:30 and get to work at 7:30. I work 7:30-4 instead of 8:30 to 5 because that’s the only way to keep my commute down to an hour each way since traffic grows exponentially from that time, and on fridays it’s already bad when I leave work. 

So I get home between 5 and 5:15 every day as long as there’s no accidents causing extra traffic. Right now the only exercise I get is walking my dog for about 20 mins as soon as I get home until it starts getting dark, then cook dinner, and but the time I’m done eating it’s probably 6:30. I value my sleep and try to make sure I get 8 full hours so I go to bed at 9:30 so that I’ll for sure be asleep by 10. So I get everything ready for the next day at about 9. 

That leaves me about 2.5 hours to myself each week day for anything else I need to get done.

I just kinda rambled on there but it’s actually something I had looked into a few days ago because I realized that cutting my commute in half would add more free time than just the hour I took out of my commute since I’d be getting home at 4:30 and still have some time before traffic gets too bad so doing something after work wouldn’t take as long and also I wouldn’t have to go to bed as early since I wouldn’t be leaving as early"
6097,"Lol, I didn’t even know about that subreddit. I am going down the rabbit hole as I type this 😬"
6098,Don’t forget r/mealprepsundayrecipes also a must! Although not nearly as active sometimes has some good ones!
6099,"What I’ve been doing lately is riding my bike to work. I’m not the biggest fan of exercise, and I thought biking is the perfect combination of exercise and commuting. That way I don’t have to waste time after work going to the gym. 

This may not be entirely possible for you though. 

I agree with everyone else saying cooking meals at home and prepping them for the week with portion control is great."
6100,"I know 40 hours a week feels like a lot, but it really isn’t that dominant. Assuming you sleep 8 hours a night, that leaves you 8 full hours outside of work per day for whatever you want. 

That’s 40 hours per work-week other than work that you could be using for something else. Putting even just 3 of those into exercise and cooking would be a good head start.

Putting one hour a day in is reasonable for most people’s schedules. It’s just a matter of making yourself do it.

But it’s important to note too that while exercise is important, it’s not the best source of addressing your weight. The thing you need to focus on is diet, and, lucky you, specifically eating less. You’ll be *saving* time by eating fewer calories. Time isn’t much of an excuse for exercise, but it certainly isn’t one at all for diet."
6101,"I think finding a fun way to work out is the best way to find consistency. I also work 40+ hours a week but because I do things like climb, Jiujitsu, and Muay Thai to work out it doesn’t feel like a chore. It feels like I’m going to do something fun."
6102,It's easy to put on weight without realizing it. Start working on it now.
6103,"Meal prep or even meal services can be helpful/a lil cheaper for lunches and dinners. Diet may be enough, as well as walking around and just getting up to stretch a couple times in the day."
6104,He isn’t complaining though.....
6105,"Came here to say this. I go through phases of working out frequently and less frequently, and it’s always satisfying when the DOMS goes away. Let’s me know that I’m on my way back into shape. Kind of like the feeling after you’ve been training distance running for the first time in a while and you hit that run where you feel your stride and feel like you have a ton of stamina all of the sudden!"
6106,"Forreal, I’m not trying to play the one up game but I’d kill for a 40 hour work week sometimes lol"
6107,Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness - the pain and feeling of soreness you feel in a particular muscle area (or your whole body lmao) after an intense workout. It results from the muscle fibers healing after being ripped during a workout (under the condition you put enough strenuous effort in to rip them in the first place).
6108,"I frankly disagree. I get that some days are stressful and are mentally straining, and I also have those days, and those are the days I enjoy the gym the most. I like to shut off my brain and just lift weights or exercise. I never feel worse after the gym, so if I have a bad day, it only really helps. I get that this mindset takes a bit to get used to, but you shouldn’t go into working out already making excuses to get yourself out of it IMO"
6109,Wel shit I like that one even better
6110,Burn in hell lol
6111,Check out a channel called CICO and Loseit. Tbh I think these are some of the best channels regarding weight loss.
6112,"I'm already looking at the option of not coming back, but it really sucks. I made good friends there."
6113,"This is also something I struggled with going into my career. I started to go back on the weekends to stay connected but it wasn’t working. 

You can have those individual connections but it’s important to move on and understand you have grown away from them. Not them growing away from you. You’re starting your career and will be forming new connections. 

It doesn’t mean the crazy days of college are over. You can visit there and go out with new coworkers, but the partying is more far and in between now. I miss those days too. But the same will happen to those at college who you visit. Get into this new life. I know it’s hard but the only constant in life is change. It’s a hard pill to swallow after college and not something universities prepare us for. They make it seem like that culture will live on forever. It doesn’t. 

I take bits and pieces of people with me through life. You’ll be lucky if you walk through life with 5 good friends. You haven’t become boring, you’ve moved on."
6114,"Lol it’s over bud, not a bad thing but those years you will look back one day and just say...ah those where the good days."
6115,"Tbh, I don’t. But I didn’t have that much of a “social life” while I was in college either. I’m more trying to make my peace with it rather than “remedy” it. Whiiiich isn’t much in the way of advice.

You work full time. If there’s anyone there that seems half palatable, make an effort to be friendly with them?? If that doesn’t result in a friendship then at least you’ll have gotten practice “making friends” in the real world."
6116,It’s a weird feeling to realize the thing that’s changed is you.
6117,It's nostalgia. You know you aren't like that anymore.
6118,"Limit yourself to going out on the weekends. Every now and then but now that you graduated, you have more responsibilities than your undergrad peers. In college, you live close to your friends so it’s easy to communicate and meet up. It’s normal to feel disconnected, but it happens to everyone after graduation so you are not alone."
6119,"Probably a couple of different factors. A lot of friendships are based on seeing each other frequently and/or repeatedly in the same setting. It probably seems like you haven’t been away for very long, but I’m guessing a lot of your old friends are seeing each other on a time scale that is much shorter than that. You’re missing out on their regular face-to-face interaction.  

It was very much my experience that I drifted apart from many friends (both those that were still in school and that had graduated) once I entered the work force. I couldn’t commiserate with my college friends about shared experiences anymore. 

I only have 5-6 good friends now, and I’m 4 years out of college. It was hard coming to terms with the upending of my social sphere, but once you realize it’s not personal it becomes a little easier to accept the sad feelings as fondness for the time you shared together. And it’s actually been kind of fascinating seeing which friendships have flourished versus those that have drifted. I’m very close friends with some people now that I had “only” been friends/acquaintances with before in college."
6120,"I’ve gone through something similar, except I’m the one still at uni. My biggest piece of advice is - if you want to keep some of those friendships alive you **can**! But the days of you being a big group who share everything together might be behind you. I’ve kept friends from all different phases of my life, even though I’ve dropped out of the social circles I met them in."
6121,"Glad that i'm not the only one going through this; i recently visted my alma mater a few days ago, and had noticed a major disconnect, majority of the people that i knew or are friends with are not around as much and most of the newer generation at my school, i don't click with, i still am cool with lots of the seniors and juniors at my school and a few sophomores. It happens."
6122,"I'm living with parents, working part time (searching for something better) trying to save money to go back to University next year. I know how you feel because most of my friends are still studying.

Do you have any friends you've made via your career? It's great to keep in contact with university friends but to make yourself feel better about this situation it might be worth investing in your own new connections :)"
6123,"Nah man. The disconnect happens very fast. I graduated at 20. It really sucks. All of your close friends are still living the college life you no longer relate to. So now I'm the youngest at every workplace, too. I think part of it is that dissonance you experience once the octane of graduating is over."
6124,"Yea, the weird feeling was how we we're still the same people with the same interests and hobbies, but felt like we were talking two different languages with each other."
6125,"Surprisingly, I'm still very good friends with my high school pals here which is nice. Ive only been working for a few months so I haven't made any connections yet, I'm still the youngest guy at any job I apply to now."
6126,"Hey that's great. At least you have some social connections where you are.

How big is the age gap between you and work colleagues?"
6127,"I'm 21 going on 22, the next guy is 29 I think. I still have that party spirit in me :)."
6128,"It's not the places you are but the people you meet. Who you know, if you have friends in the city matters way more to me than the city itself"
6129,I feel like big cities are hard to find true friends. A lot come and go. It can actually be a very lonely place.
6130,"I’d say it depends if the cities you move to are within the same country or not. Countries share way more common ground than people think.


Also it depends wether you hate the place where you live or you just want to try new stuff. For the later, I’m afraid that you are the kind of person who doesn’t want to stay somewhere, and that “new place feeling” is going to wear sooner everytime."
6131,"I’ve lived in different cities and different countries, and I’ve found that changing what you do is the important thing, not so much where you live. (Except in cases where you have to deal with racism or homophobia—in those cases, get the hell out.). 
Some possible changes: 

Waking up earlier or later 
Exercise or don’t 
Hang out with new people
Classes
Meetup groups
Volunteer activities 
Write your novel / songs/poems
Perform for an audience

All of these will change your life more than moving to a new city and continuing your old habits."
6132,Big cities are all material and about going to do things. It’s not about the people you are with unfortunately.
6133,"good points, /u/bayfarm, and I also liked what /u/mrtimeric had to say. I came from a small city in upstate New York here in the US, and I only ever moved about 45-60 minutes from home. After I was done with school, though, I moved to San Francisco and lived there for a year. Then I moved to the Dallas area and lived there for a year. 

I obviously had never visited those places before moving there, I didn't have any friends there. So I made friends and dated a few women, but moving after that always felt like I was skipping out or ghosting people. Looking back, I see that I put my own desire to explore first, and I feel badly that it also meant curtailing some relationships.

Moving is easy when you're younger; you have more energy and fewer belongings, so you can just toss it in a suitcase and go. Now I'm 31 and I have cats, furniture, and a lot of other shit. Moving went from fun to scary awfully fast"
6134,I moved to Philadelphia for a year. I absolutely hated it and will NEVER go back.
6135,"This may be the most inaccurate description of denver ive ever seen

Sure it has some flaws but it’s not even close to the dirtiest or busiest and you must not have explored any actual hiking trails"
6136,"I disagree... I think it's way easier to make friends in a big city, simply because there's more people who could potentially be your friends."
6137,"Which decision do you think you'd regret doing (or not doing) more? How close are you with those old friends? Would you want to move closer home because you want to or for other reasons, or just because of friends?  

Maybe this is because I really don't have a lot of close friends right now, but I would do whatever you think is best for you personally.

If it were me I would probably move, but that's because I imagine relationships will come and go. You can't guarantee that you'll always be close with old friends and you can't guarantee that they'll always stay there with you either. Other people are probably not going to hold themselves back from moving if they need to."
6138,Just moved from my small upstate NY town a few weeks ago to Charlotte for school. I’ve lived there my whole life. I never want to look back :)
6139,Oh yea I guess. Philly is kind of big. There are a lot of... not the best areas.
6140,"I would think it's expected that the novelty wears off honestly. People get familiar, comfortable, and settled into their routines. At a certain point what once was ""new and exciting"" isn't anymore. I'm not sure this has anything to do with living in a city specifically, but just any place that you live. You'll eventually get used to it and it will become your new normal."
6141,"I'm still living in the same city I've lived in the majority of my life (twenty+ years now), and I'm kinda feeling the urge to move and try something different.  I can't say what the experience of moving to a new city is like, I've lived in one city, and two small towns, and that's it, all I know is that I feel a malaise from being stuck in the same place, and I wish I had moved years ago."
6142,"Yeah, for a while towards the end of and after college I thought that I just needed to find the best city to live in. Right after college I really thought that I needed to move to the west coast like all the cool kids in my profession did, and when I thankfully didn’t, I still had a lot of internal conflict about it. 

And naturally, every time I visit a new city, all I can think is “Man, this place is fucking amazing, I would love to live here”. And I still feel that, a lot. Half of it is fear of missing out, the other half is thinking that things are just going to be nicer somehow than my current situation (And some of them, like the weather, really might be...). The key is to try to remember that living there would be quite a bit different from traveling there. Thankfully, I think I’ve finally come to the realization that all cities are inevitably going to feel kinda the same. Like another poster said, a lot of how a place feels ultimately winds up coming from the inside. I’ve finally found a great team of awesome people that I really enjoy being around at work, even though it’s definitely one of the worst companies out there. Realizing how much I liked it even so made me realize that that’s kinda what matters more. I haven’t had a lot of friends since college except my amazing girlfriend, so that made a huge difference. A big plus is that their all close in age, and that age happens to be the age people start to settle down, so hopefully they’ll be around a while."
6143,Why
6144,"Oh trust me I’ve thought about both sides. For me, I’m huge on friends and family. And majority of my friends and family are in the same area back home with no signs of moving. 

I’m also in a position now in work for the next few years I could move around. So I could move back home, see how it goes, then if it’s not all I thought it would be I can move again. Or vice versa, move somewhere cool, if I dislike it, decide to move home. 

Quite honestly though, I’m already sick of moving"
6145,Doesn't Philly have a reputation for being rude?
6146,"100% yes they do, and they absolutely live up to it. I mean, when the Eagles won the super bowl, the speech said “no one likes us, we don’t care!” and that’s a valid representation of the whole city."
6147,"I'm from the greater-Detroit area so you'd think just about any other city would be more suitable for a life. lol no. We have money here.  
Oakland county is richer than Orange county.  
  
It makes it very hard to live or work anywhere else.  
I don't even like to hunt or fish. If you're a sportsman then this is paradise."
6148,"Maybe it's not the cities, but your hobbies. Try getting into something more interesting than sports/going out/eating. See if there's a local music scene, or art, or something unique about that city you can tap into."
6149,Sorry going to agree with another comment but more nicely. The problem is you. Try more hobbies. Outdoor hobbies are an easy path to never being bored again
6150,"I've lived in several major cities all of my life and now I have a job in the city, but I take a 25-30min commute for the peace of a much smaller town away. I would recommend definitely staying near a city for good work though.."
6151,"True, I think it can be said for almost anything."
6152,"I personally found Denver to be one of the best cities i've lived/worked in. well, i wasn't in downtown denver or anything... i was in littleton and lakewood. the mountains are great... the skiing... the cycling... everything outdoorsy.... the great sunny weather.... mild winters... rivers... beautiful scenery...i didn't notice any trash on the trails and i never witnessed the jam packed crowds you desdribed during hiking. somtimes it would be busy on trails on holidays but what do you expect when everyone wants to be outdoors in a city of 3 to 4 million. overall, compared to other big cities, denver ranks in the top 3."
6153,"The whole city is just... for lack of a better term, shitty. My particular neighborhood wasn’t completely awful when I had just moved in, but crime rates increased rapidly throughout just my one year there. The people were rude everywhere, too. I can’t attest to other cities because I personally haven’t done tons of traveling, but I can for sure say that I would never recommend for anyone to live in Philadelphia. Whenever I hear someone say that’s where they live or that’s where they’re from, my first reaction is, “I’m so sorry.”"
6154,"I think I was spot on with Denver. It’s trash. Colorado in general is beautiful, did most if not all of my studies there hiking in the most remote areas mapping contacts/faults etc.  But everyone wants to climb 14ers and those are just thousands of people and yes saw trash in a lot of the spots. 

The best hikes were the ones I found just driving 2-4 hours outside of Denver where no one was. Lake city, Colorado is probably one of my most favorite places in the world

Denver just gave me a fucking panic attack every time I went anywhere. Way too many people for me but I’m a Kansan so there’s that"
6155,Material? Do you mean materialistic?
6156,Wow we have very different opinions of the city. I fuckin love philly
6157,"Denver is literally a perfectly flat plain until you get to the mountains almost, no shit you had to drive somewhere to go on actual hikes. What, you went hiking through alleys and found them filled with trash? What a twist."
6158,"u/Xuemeipk, please if you’d like to, DM me. It’s an incredibly fulfilling journey."
6159,"In some places better, in some places VASTLY worse. Working a factory job in Germany for example would be more comfortable due to Germany’s high income driven by a history of colonial abundance, whereas one in Bangladesh is much less so. Part of this is down to geography, with many industrial areas in Germany being relatively comfortable compared to the increasingly vanishing river delta that is Bangladesh, but also due to the history of industrialism in the region. Rule by British India still has massive effects on the material conditions of workers there today. 

China is a medium income nation which has been moving towards the complete elimination of poverty (and they’re actually winning), and life doing a factory job there reflects that. There is room for improvement, but they’ve come very far from the days of royal tea plantations and opium pipe warehouses."

6173,You can always negotiate. You have the most bargaining power right before accepting an offer usually.
6174,"This here is the smart answer. Absolutely don't bring it up in the interview. Get the offer first and then negotiate. Shoot, with the economy so bad, I may accept the job first and then negotiate it later. But calling them out during a job interview is pretty risky."
6175,Second this. This is really great advice. Good luck at your interview!
6176,Don’t be shy about pushing for higher salaries. It’s how negotiations work! I’m hard nosed about it and it’s never affected my treatment in the workplace.
6177,"This 100%. Right now, most industries have a ridiculous amount of candidates to choose from. They have most, if not all, of the leverage.

Nothing wrong with negotiating once you get the offer, that's pretty standard, and at worst, reasonable companies will just say no. But to bring up the pay unsolicited during the interview? No way of knowing how they'll take that, so might as well not risk it."
6178,"This happens often man, I’d take the job"
6179,"They may be testing you. During my interview they kept asking what I would be comfortable with, I said $20/hr+ repeatedly and they said that’s about right. On the offer letter they listed $19, I just called and said I wanted $20 like I said and they changed it the next day. Just my one experience"
6180,"25 an hour is amazing for someone who just got a bachelors degree? Idk man. 

Push for what they listed for. It’s what they themselves said. It’s only fair"
6181,"I concur, but don't forget to factor in benefits.  It is common mistake that recent graduates make,  ignoring benefits.  When you get into the negotiation phase, factor in what the company is paying on your behalf (insurance, continuing education, etc).  Your base maybe $52k, but your total package is higher (that's the number used internally for budgeting)."
6182,"I wouldn’t say this is a red flag , this is very common now a days with online job postings. Unfortunately, there’s not much to negotiate on a first job offer straight out of school. I’d take it, work hard, and prove down the line that you are deserving of a raise! Good luck"
6183,"A few years ago I got hired by a company and during the phone interview and the posting it was a 60k salary. No other numbers at all. 

Yet when they emailed me the offer letter for me to sign it was 58k. Even though its such a small difference it was the principle of the matter and I told them I wouldnt sign it unless it was the communicated amount.  Luckily they caved and sent me another offer letter for 60k, but Im happy I stood up for myself in that situation"
6184,"It's a shitty position. Maybe the position was posted before some budget cuts happened, or maybe they are starting this business relationship off by trying to swindle a few thousand out of you for free. Both apply.

It sounds like its still an improvement over your current situation, principal is nice but that's undoubtedly a factor. Also remember, you don't have to stay there too, another offer could come up in a month if you interviewed elsewhere. Nothing about this relationship requires you to stay vs basically burn that bridge."
6185,"Take the job, start applying to new ones in 6 months"
6186,Good for you. It seems small but difference adds up.
6187,Idk what other offers in hand do you have?
6188,"How’d you discover it was a scam? That said, there are definitely a lot of scam jobs out there."
6189,"So there were way too many things just didn’t add up. And the biggest one was they wanted to conduct the interview through Google Hangout Chat. Not video call, but chat. I googled it and found so many articles saying that was a sign of a scam. 

Aside from that they had unprofessional email addresses, and the company did not even come up in a google search. And the pay was really high for the position (virtual assistant)."
6190,"When they ask for salary expectations, just say around $70k a year. Then they’ll give you an offer letter with a salary of $55k. Negotiate, ask for $70k. End up with a $60k offer."
6191,Can I ask what field are you in
6192,Can I ask what field are you in
6193,"Accept it, but politely ask for a 6-month review"
6194,"I’d maybe try to push for 58k. Bring up the fact that their listing said that, you did research on the market for similar job positions, and list your skills that align with the position. worse they will say is no! Even if you don’t get up to 58k you might be able to negotiate up to 55k or something!"
6195,"Id wait until you get to negotiation phase, first you should get an offer and nail the interview. Then you can start talking about the salary"
6196,Fight for 30 settle at 28
6197,Why is it a scam?
6198,This is the sound advice
6199,"This is sound advice, just change 6 to 0"
6200,"Huh. Google hangouts is pretty common for interviews in smaller startups and nonprofits, but if it’s a chat-only interview that’s definitely weird on its own. 

Intuition is definitely important. Sounds like you made the right call."
6201,it happens.
6202,"Because they are minors, I would say it is NOT worth it. In my own experience my college major was NOT a deciding factor in hiring me or not hiring me, it wasn't a deciding factor in whether grad school accepted me or rejected me. So I would say however many minors you have would be even less of a factor. Not worth the money."
6203,"Coming from an HR, hiring standpoint; it's not worth it, especially with your degree already being in Economics. We don't look for as many specific degrees, just if you have one or not. I couldn't tell you the last time I looked to see if anyone had a specific minor. The only way I would say it's worth it is if you personally would feel accomplished, then it is worth it! Also, I learned A LOT about myself in my 4th and final year of college, so think about that too."
6204,"In my experience, minors don’t mean anything unless you slept with one"
6205,/thread
6206,Hold up
6207,Absolutely not.
6208,"Yep, I would say literally the only possible reason for a minor in most cases is if you genuinely want to learn more. If you’re just looking for extra qualifications, GTFO of college after you get a degree and go start your career"
6209,"As someone who double minored, NO"
6210,"No because you’re in the business field and they don’t care about specifics, as long as you graduate and have taken the course that will prepare you for working in you’re field then you’ll be okay. I have a double minor and it really doesn’t mean anything just nice to let people know haha"
6211,Nobody looks at that shit.
6212,"It depends on a couple things, 1. Are these minors important to a job field that you can get into? Like having an opportunity to jump ahead in your career path or go into a specialty that interests you? Or 2. Is it important to you personally to get these minors? If it’s something that you like doing and can justify, then why not? But if you are going to hate it and have to drag yourself to do it, then I would say it’s probably not worth it if it won’t benefit you in any way. Minors are not like majors, they won’t make or break your career if you don’t have them."
6213,Jeffrey stop hiding man.
6214,lmao i'm glad i wasn't the only one that was really confused with the title without seeing the subreddit
6215,No. I have 2 minors and it’s never been a difference maker in my career. Hiring companies have never put any stock in it at all.
6216,r/nocontext
6217,"i stayed an extra year to get another bachelor in the same college/school thingy of my original bachelor, i feel like that is more worth it then doing a minor unless its in something you just generally want to learn more about"
6218,"The key thing here is they are minors. In my experience, minors only are a neat thing to have on a resume, but are also quick to fall off the resume for more relevant things. Unless you really want to take the classes, it’s not worth it moving forward. Your degree is fine, and that extra year to get experience in the field will be far more valuable than the minors. The best that can come from the minors is connections/ relationships/ internships, but you can get that with the year. Skip the school. Not worth it."
6219,What do you want to do afterwards?
6220,No
6221," No. Why? Coz no one, absolutely no one, cares about minors. No one even bats an eye on my major anymore after 2-3 years of working experience."
6222,"Yes, then you get to stay in school another year. Live it up!"
6223,I honestly have no clue what the purpose of a minor is.
6224,Nope
6225,"Just came to say since entering the job market literally no one has given any shits about my degree, it’s all about previous experience and who you know"
6226,"I might be the sole dissenting party, but I wouldn't outright say no. If you are paying for college with loans, then no, don't stay extra and swallow up more debt. That being said, if you or your family is wealthy enough to support additional time in University and you don't have a job lined up, that extra year is a good time to follow your passion, or flesh out your resume with additional leadership positions and internships. Minors are unlikely to make-or-break a hiring decision, unless you commit to a language minor, in which case it can work highly in your favor.



TLDR: for most people, don't stay extra"
6227,"Not worth it. In the business world, the degree doesn't matter. It's what you do with the knowledge that you have. Plus, nothing you learn in school will make you any more prepared for your job because every company trains you anyway. This is coming from a guy who just graduated with his master's in accounting and began working full-time two months ago."
6228,Oh fuck nah
6229,No unless you can’t get a job you want
6230,"After staying just an extra semester for an extra (third) major, I’d say definitely not. Wasn’t even worth it for a major.

Extra degrees very rarely mean anything. You’re better off getting out of school ASAP. You can always take extra classes later, much cheaper than as a full time student."
6231,"I don't even put my minor on my resume, so no."
6232,"Luck is the communion of opportunity and preparation, if you don’t do everything you can do to prepare- you’ll never be able to make use of your opportunities."
6233,"i remember the summer after i graduated, i saw a video from bon appetit showing how to make smash burgers. i (broke) decided to give myself a serotonin boost and went out, bought all the ingredients, and spent hours making them. i packed my lunch that night so i could just fly out the next day for work. at work, i bit into my burger, super excited because i felt useful and adult-ish for once. and the inside was raw—not rare, but raw. i projectile-launched the whole tupperware into the garbage can and punched back in, and that night, i completely lost it. i felt so useless and i thought that i was never going to find success with anything (and i wasted so much money).

sharing this because it sounds like your story. i realize that if that happened to me now, i’d laugh it off, but back then, i took every little negative thing that happened and allowed it to grow and take over me. what helped me to realize just how silly i was was really sitting down, and thinking about how i contemplated suicide over a hamburger. that’s ridiculous right? i almost let a burger ruin me and be the last straw. 

it’s tough to look at yourself without the shitty context of your situation (whatever that might be), but if you can really try, i hope you can see and amplify everything that is good, instead of focusing on the things that are bad."
6234,"You will soon realise that most of us don’t know what we are doing, and we are making educated guesses of what the “right” thing to do is. If it fails then you learn from the mistake. Every guess then should become more informed, and that logically should give you less variance on your expected outcome. However life likes to throw in curveballs sometimes so that’s where you learn (again), pick yourself up and move on. Yeah, basically lots of guessing, lots of mistakes, lots of picking yourself up and learning to thrive. It sounds scary but it is less scary when most people are in the same situation 😊"
6235,"There’s a saying: “two is one and one is none.” Life goes smoother when you build alternative branches to your goals and ambitions. A willingness to be open to other options and being good at pivoting when something goes wrong will be your best asset in adult life. Nothing is obligated to go according to plan and to be honest, it rarely does. Life happens along the way to any goal and the best of us can weave those misdirections into something beautiful."
6236,That’s not explicitly true things could always get worse too
6237,"Definitely isnt easy. The thing you gotta think about is that you graduated from college that means you got a degree that most people dont have the luxury. You already got an advantage over other people. Its still up to you to make a move. If things dont work out, then move on to the next. Just think positively. You'll get your shit together soon. Trust me. Been there."
6238,"I can try to address this pulling on my own experiences.

Think of college like a treadmill - you knew how it worked, you knew how to turn it up or down. You knew the deal...you get on and you walk/run. You know everything about the treadmill and so you could enjoy things a bit (except for F-in finals \*\*shudders\*\*)

&#x200B;

But, real life isn't like this. It doesn't really have a syllabus. No one tells you ""hey so, this is how your life will go and at the end you'll judge yourself to see if you had a good life, that'll be your FINAL Final"". Instead, these idiotic institutions push you out with mounds of debt and almost no real life skills. You can probably recite math formulas, write an amazing essay, debate a topic, maybe even do some coding...but you probably aren't truly familiar with things like 'Compound Interest' and buying assets overtime to become a millionaire in your life or the best way to get high paying salaries and negotiate higher salaries and positions.

&#x200B;

So, here's my advice: Treat life like an open world video game...which is TRULY open and has unlimited possibilities. Ok, so now think of yourself as a character in this world and you're in charge of BUILDING UP this character to higher levels. Each level includes (but isn't limited to)

&#x200B;

Player stats:

* Happiness level
* Physical fitness
* Mental toughness
* Relationships
* Career/Business
* Investments
* Net Worth

&#x200B;

The question is, how do you increase your stats in categories that matter to you? While you answer this question, I can tell you this for sure - Life is not easy.  Adulting/Living is not easy. We weren't prepared for this by Schools and Colleges (they failed) and many of us are not ready because we didn't have parents that got us ready. So, if you feel like ""life will be tougher after school/college"" - you're right, it will be tougher than any final you've taken. And unlike school, there's no ""end of semester"" - you simply get more and more and more things to do...without more time, without more appreciation, without more support.

&#x200B;

So, what's the solution? The solution is for you to take a deep breath and realize that what your senses are telling you is true. Trust your insight. And then, realize that there are some/many/most things that you can actually control in life. Yes, you can't directly control your emotional well being but you can work on your physical fitness for instance...you can work on your career...your net worth. Life is SO MUCH EASIER when you have resources. I started with a negative net worth in college...I didn't have much and no one taught me much...years later, I've got about 1.6M saved/invested and I lost my job recently during this year. It SHOULD BE a tough time, and it is...but at the same time, I am so thankful that I did the hard work and got myself career jobs, invested and got myself to this point because, I have enough money to ride out this crazy time until I find a new gig. Working on these things made me resilient. Life can suck in many ways but if you hustle and get things moving, life can be much more manageable and you can even get to a point where you're thinking more about how to enjoy it rather than be intimidated all the time.

&#x200B;

If you made it to all the way here; I made a [video](https://youtu.be/FVlxF5qaETw) sharing the top 5 tips that we absolutely should have learned after school/college...but didn't. It might be useful."
6239,yeah that's life pretty much
6240,Welcome to the shitshow.
6241,"That’s so awesome. You’re right these are tough times. More companies are talking about expenses and firing than anything else. What this proves is you’re REALLY talented and they REALLY like you. 

Good luck."
6242,That is great especially during this pandemic. We’re proud of you!
6243,Congratulations. Literally just accepted an offer after working for a company for about a year and half! Good to hear other people being able to secure a job at this time!
6244,Congrats dude!! You rock! :D
6245,"Yes sirrr, that’s how you build character."
6246,[deleted]
6247,Valid question! Would love to know as well
6248,I second this. Sounds like a scam.
6249,"I just did some Google research and yup, it mostly likely sounds like a scam. Plus theres that risk of them ""firing"" me so I cant get my security deposit back lol"
6250,I would say no. I’ve never heard of this. You will find something else that doesn’t require you to pay that.
6251,"That’s probably what the scam is.  They either get paid by the employer they connect you with and give you back the $700, or they find a way to fire you and keep the $700."
6252,"That's true, thanks for the tip!"
6253,"Definitely no. There are plenty of awesome recruiter and temp agencies out there. I had fantastic luck with one called Aerotek which led me to a permanent full time position at an amazing company. They helped with interview prep, fine tuning my resume, and followed up after the interview to give me more pointers for the next one. I have never heard of one asking you be paid, because they typically get paid by the companies they place you with."
6254,"**NEVER “WORK” FOR SOMEONE WHO MAKES YOU PAY THEM TO “WORK.”**

Shouldn’t have to say this. But keep it in mind."
6255,This is a pyramid scheme.
6256,Scam scam scam!
6257,Thanks!
6258,Sounds like a MLM. :(
6259,"Glad you learned this lesson the easy way. Some states allow employers to withhold some of your first paycheck for stuff like company cars, police radios/guns, those huge Disney costumes, etc., as a deposit, but I’d continue to be suspicious of anyone who wants cash up front."
6260,"This is a rule of thumb to follow when looking for jobs: if you have to pay, you’re the customer."
6261,"ABORT RN, this is a scam for sure. Find another temp agency. I'm working with one in my area right now that hasn't made me pay them a CENT."
6262,That makes no sense. Scam or pyramid scheme
6263,"This sounds weird, never heard of anything like this, either from a recruiter or a temp agency (sounds like this company is the latter).  Yellow flag.

What kind of jobs are you applying for?"
6264,"Avoid it man, dont do anything out of desperation the right job will come"
6265,No. Just no. No employer will EVER ask you to pay them ANYTHING for Any reason. Red flag. Run.
6266,100% a scam. My wife got so many scam attempts just like that when she was looking for a job after grad school. They prey upon desperate people.
6267,No legitimate job would ever ask YOU for money.
6268,100%
6269,I'm mostly applying to engineering/software jobs
6270,Report them to the FTC or your state AG? That sounds like it needs to be shut down.
6271,no job should ever make you pay them.  ever
6272,LOL WTF
6273,"Depending on your location that's usually an employee's market, zero reason to risk going with some sketchy recruiter.  

Dig around #1 below and see if you find any useful leads, and post your info in #2 for employers looking to hire: 

1. Who's hiring (Dec '19): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21683554

2. Who wants to be hired (Dec '19): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21683552"
6274,This sounds just like the Syrian  prince that needs your help bud.
6275,Yea anytime you have to pay to work somewhere it’s a scam
6276,"Unless you’re starting your own business, never pay for a job."
6277,They are still offering jobs and collecting deposits. What is FBI doing to bust such online scams?
6278,"Thank you, 

I guess I should have explained it a little better. After he told me, I let him know I would look into it and we would find a solution. I spent an hour or so coming up with a solution then let my manager know what happened and explained the solution I had and any potential risks and he told me to run with that. 

Wasn't exactly sweeping it under, but trying to find solutions before it gets brought up. 

Honestly, I was relieved he came and told me, I would have been really nervous telling my manager of something like that."
6279,"Be sure to tell the guy that you resolved the problem and build a relationship with him. If he’s good at what he does, the it’s worth having him around. Giving him the relief that his mistake wasnt fatal."
6280,"He knows now, part of the solution was me modifying the part that interfaces with the one with the mistake which he is making next, so he should know everything is good now since they are now both assembled and passed testing."
6281,">I decided to be the manager I would want to work under...

You already have the answer to your question!   
One of the best ways to gain respect from people is to use your power for the good of the team rather than using it to make yourself look good and it sounds like you're doing just that.   
Some people might push back because you're younger, but if you continue to be the kind of manager you'd want to work under it will be more and more clear that these people are operating on a basis of jealousy. If that persists you can take it to your supervisors.   
Be careful that you don't let your nerves in wanting to be liked make you a pushover, and you'll be fine :)"
6282,Well alright then. I hope you guys can build a good relationship to where you can depend on each if needed.
6283,"Don’t overthink it too much - you were put in that position for a reason. If anything, just keep in constant contact with the people that you’re most worried about (in this case, the older folks). As long as you make an effort to include them and value their input, I doubt they’ll have much negative feedback about your leadership. If you have some personal concerns, though, I would definitely talk to your superior/mentor for advice. Long story short, keep doing what you’re doing because evidently, it’s working."
6284,"I managed/supervised several individuals who were older than me. However, I worked hard and was promoted several times and the senior staff respected me for that. Being respectful and professional goes a long way from both ends."
6285,It’s weird having 50 +years people come up to me and ask questions as a 21 year old. I just try to be as helpful as I can and be honest with what I do and don’t know
6286,"You are fucking amazing. I know so many people who would have ratted them out at your level and thrown them under a bus but you handled it and made both of you look great. As 30yr old hopefully pursuing a new field soon, I hope more people are like you."
6287,"Do you still have access to counselors, maybe online or such? If not, you may just want to start looking at jobs and using their descriptions to see where you might fit. I’m sorry this happened to you, it sounds like a stressful time"
6288,"Strange times we're living in. Granted though, many people, yourself included, would be facing the issue of not knowing what to do, even in the booming economy we were in last year when I graduated. Might I ask what you got a degree in for a start? 

As far as jobs go, it is a tight market right now. I'd start with emailing the career department at your school and some former professors for advice. Besides that, brainstorm ways in which you think you can use your degree, and polish your resume for jobs in that particular category when the market inevitably is on the uptick again. In the interim, just hang tight until this thing blows over, read, pursue hobbies, do online courses, etc, and these can possibly help in finding a path you want to pursue. If nothing else, they'll be a welcome distraction and a much needed break after all the time you've spent in school.

All that aside though, while I'm not saying just do scattershot apply anywhere there is a job for the sake of having a job, I do think you should feel confident in taking a job and not necessarily knowing where it'll take you 5, 10 years from now. We grow through working and determine our path based on how our career organically develops- very few of us will walk in the door and force everything to fit into a 45 year timeline we developed for ourselves, with a very specific outcome of being an industry leader in some niche area of our field of study. Many people would like to think you need that degree of proscription in your life, just as there's the attitude that you need to know someone is ""the one"" before you marry them. But these really are toxic mindsets. Marriage and careers are both things you grow through through trying new things and embracing the unknown with an open minded growth mindset, not through trying to think out every step before acting. Think about your degree and how to leverage that into a career in generalities, not a hyper-specific trajectory."
6289,"I’m not OP, but I just wanted to tell you that you are a saint. 
When I was struggling to find a job it was people like you who grabbed me by the shoulders, steered me in the right direction, and helped me get out of my rut. I value those people dearly and have made it my mission to be like them for others now that I can do so. 
You never know how badly someone needs your help. It’s always worth doing, especially when it doesn’t take much effort on your part to help them. Anyways, keep being awesome :)"
6290,I’m assuming OP is a high school student? But I’m unsure. I’ve heard of high schools graduating kids early because of the pandemic but it sounds like most colleges/universities are just continuing online.
6291,"Hahha coming from someone who graduated last year, it doesn’t matter whether you graduated today or three months from now. You would still be feeling the same way eventually. What I have learned in this year is that everyone’s first year out is different. But take this time to figure out what you want out of life and go from there. Experience some things go out, meet new people, travel(after the virus ofcourse). Try small hand jobs make connections on the ground level before even looking at a career path. Enjoy life a little branch out and try new things you haven’t thought you would ever do because this year is really your first year of you. No commitments now, no class schedule, you are molding your days the way you want them. It’s all up to you now for the first time. Yes it is scary, and will be for a while but you’ll overcome and figure it all out. Life’s hard but it really doesn’t have to be. Don’t over complicate things and you’ll be fine. Good luck, see you in a year!!!"
6292,"Can you send them to me, as well? My employers reaction to this crisis has left me with a bad taste and I'm considering branching out as this was my first job after college"
6293,Omg what school?
6294,"Don’t ignore the idea of the military. Even with all the craziness in the world right now, We’re still getting paid on time and not having that added stress. It’s a rough life sometimes, but it’s well worth it."
6295,"Aww, thank you! 

I was a first generation minority transfer student and not once did I visit someone at the Career Center. I went for my masters (clinical mental health counseling) and was required to take a career counseling class and it opened my eyes to a lot about my own personal career path and decisions. During my internship I realized that mental health and career tie in together. If one is off balance, the other comes tumbling down within a period of time. Mental health got heavy so once I graduated I sought out career counseling positions to take a mini break. 

I love all of the students that come through those doors or speak with me virtually. For the same reason I loved mental health counseling. I enjoy students coming to me with their box of puzzle pieces, dumping them on my desk and asking me to help them figure out how to put the pieces together. My favorite facial expression is when someone has an epiphany or just realized something about themselves. Those deep, pensive moments that they emerge from are the moments that keep me going. 

I'm so glad that you had such a positive experience and that you vowed to pass on the positivity and guidance. Mentorship and kindness are so important :)"
6296,Hey! Sorry it’s taken me a second to respond. I’ll copy and paste what I sent OP :) let me know if you have questions
6297,high school?
6298,"Do a lot of research on jobs you find interesting! You can even try to talk to people in the types of jobs you’re considering.

I’m a recruiter in CA and while I probably can’t get you a job, I am happy to give career advice/resume tips to you and whoever wants it for free! I feel for you all class of 2020 :( DM me if you want to chat!"
6299,"It's hard to tell. I was assuming college- some of the schools where I live have been graduating their seniors a couple months early, particularly if you're in some medical related field (public health, pre-med like bio, etc.). Also, it sounded like a more long term view than ""oh, I'm going to go into the workforce from high school and then go to college when I know what I want to do."" But that much really is for OP to answer, and what I'm saying holds true either way."
6300,"To add on, the most important thing in your resume is to show the results of your work and not simply listing what you did. ie. rather than just saying “involved in planning and creating assets for a marketing campaign”, highlight the outcome of your efforts by including results such as “improved click-through rate from online ads by 8%”. 

And for cover letters, they have to essentially answer 3 primary questions: Why am I applying for this role? Why this company? What qualities make me a prime candidate?"
6301,All online class means that I won't have an excuse for not following some of these tips. Thank you!
6302,Also useful for everyone feeling concerned that their soft science degree may be an obstacle.
6303,"Thank you for this! I've been out of school since 2015. I landed my first job at the beginning of 2016 and been working there for 4 years. This is reaffirming because I've applied and been rejected so many, many times!"
6304,Also important: when you can start using it.
6305,"If it’s your first job out of school, and it’s been a struggle to secure, I’d just be happy about getting some experience and having a paycheck at all. 

As far as benefits go, that tends to vary company to company but everyone at a single company is subject to the 401k rules, same options for insurance, same PTO, etc. Generally they all get better the longer you stay (many companies make you “vest” into your benefits to incentivize staying longer, I.e. PTO per year increases, your employers contributions to your 401k vest so it’s not all your money until it’s 100% vested). These are things that are company policy so every employee that closes to work there is subject to it, and they must want to work there for a reason even if the benefits aren’t the best. 

For example, my company only matches a max of 3% for my 401k, but other benefits keep me wanting to work there. 

Best of luck, and congratulations!"
6306,"Non-compete agreements (if applicable)!!

I know many people who signed 2yr+ non-competes without knowing and it totally screwed them in several ways. Read and make sure you know what you’re signing👍🏼"
6307,"I chuckled to myself as I definitely read the time allotment as “seven hundred and fourteen million, three hundred and six thousand, and ninety days” notice. You’ll get vacation when you’re dead. 

All very good points though!!"
6308,I was just about to mention this! People unknowingly sign them all the time and then are stuck not able to get a job after they leave the company.
6309,"First off, congrats! As your first job, it tends to be a buyer's market as opposed to a seller's, so unless you have other job offers and are trying to negotiate, the main things on your mind should be your aforementioned salary, PTO, 401k, and the company's retention rates and mentorship for your own long term planning. See if people tend to stay there a long time out of school or jump after a couple years. Also, if you're in a field like mine that has professional licensure, see how well they follow up on getting you your license, whether they pay for test prep and materials.

Also, have you looked into their health and dental plans at all? Since you're covered until 26 under your parents' plan, you need to consider if it makes sense signing on to your company's plan or waiting. If you don't sign on, you can do what I did and see if they'll put the premium they would've paid for your plan into your paycheck instead. 

Really, at this point you just need to focus on building experience more than the benefits. Once you have some years under your belt you'll be in a better position to start looking at places based on what they offer."
6310,"Those are great things to know but not really things you can just outright ask your employer. Those will be answered about a month after taking the job, unless you’re buddy buddy with someone who has worked there."
6311,"The main benefits that are important are 401k matching, health/vision/dental insurance, PTO, and commuter benefits. You can also check Glassdoor to get an idea of company culture. 

List your actual benefits if you want to know where they’re “standard” or not"
6312,Important point yes!
6313,Same here haha!
6314,"As others have mentioned paid time off is a huge deal (how much, how is it accrued, and how do you have to use it. Ex:  does it roll over or do you have to use it before the year’s end)

401k (I mean anything is better than nothing) but do they match and how much and do they provide stock ownership depending on the type of business/company 

Last thing, if you’re under 26 it may or may not be an issue but some companies have a waiting period for health and other insurance benefits to kick it so just knowing that time frame before helps for planning."
6315,"Here’s a list of what they offered me...


·               3 weeks paid vacation (pro-rated in your first year, so by starting in June you would have 60 hours of vacation to use in 2020)

·               2 personal days per year

·               Full medical/dental health insurance offerings

·               Life insurance at 1x salary with the ability to purchase additional coverage

·               401K matching of 50% for the first 8% you contribute as well as a supplemental Core Contribution which would be between 4-8% dependent on age and years of service with the company

·               Stock purchase option after 3 months of service"
6316,I don’t think I would know that till I work. But that is definitely something I would consider
6317,"Depending on the industry you're in, you should look out for **IP(intellectual property) clauses** in your contract before signing. Basically intellectual property just means who can legally claim ownership (or any profit from) the thing things you create. Some companies have reasonable IP clauses, like, ""Anything you make during work hours belongs to us."" That's fair. They're paying you and you shouldn't be working on personal stuff during company time. Sometimes they'll say the same thing about anything made using a work-issued computer during *any* hour of the fay. I think that's dumb, but at least easily avoidable. But some companies can be greedy... I'm in software development, and I just got some contract work, and their contract stated that *anything* I make, including publications, songs, recipes, etc. made in the *duration of the contract* belonged to them. This can be taken to mean that if your contract is a week long and you write and publish a cool aong during that week, it's theirs. 


*Never* feel pressured to sign a contract for money if they have something like this in it. I called the contractor and told them that I really want to work for their company but not only do I have a fulltime job, but personal software projects that can be monetized, and I also run a tech blog. I don't wish for the things I make to belong to them. The contractor quickly apologized and we talked about what wording I'd prefer, and it was fixed within 10 minutes, so there was absolutely 0 issue. You don't want to work for *any* company that says, ""Oh, well that's just our policy."" It really, really isn't worth it."

6319,"All I’m going to say is nothing in life magically appears and what you want will not happen with out effort. 

College can be a great place to meet people, but you’re going to get no where choosing to sit in the restroom."
6320,"I was a loner since I was very young, wasn’t really rejected I just would rather do my own thing and not worry about others. I was fine with this all through elementary to most years in college, but now that I’m a college senior it’s like all those years of loneliness suddenly hit like a Mac truck. 

I still don’t know if I’m upset about being alone or upset that I think I shouldn’t be. Seems like I subconsciously feel that all those years spent on myself were for nothing and that I could have been the same as I am today, but with friends. 

The only concrete negative is that (I’m now realizing) I never developed social skills past politeness and appearance. I really struggle with conversation and sharing anything remotely personal, I don’t know how to just “hang out”, and I don’t know how to have fun with others. I went to a club after school exactly one time with some people I barely knew, and while it was exhilarating I just had no clue how to dance or anything. 

People think I look really good from the outside: I’m very fit, drive a new muscle car, wear designer clothes and am starting a business but I’ve actually been varying degrees of suicidal since high school with chronic depression and anxiety, and now I’m barely staying sane. 

I’ve always had the perspective of extreme delayed gratification where I thought abstaining from girls and friends to remain focused would help me, but now it just seems like I wasted my life unnecessarily."
6321,"This is my exact experience too! Also, I rely on my family for a lot of my socializing, and I’m okay with that."
6322,"I should start by saying those things generally don’t happen in college- you likely have a dorm you can scurry back to whenever you want. Otherwise, life after college is better. But what can only make it *even* better, I believe, is if someone was an introvert due to anxiety and depression gets treated for it immediately. Life after college can be scary and you may not graduate with a passion, much less a job afterwards. This stress can do some damage so I highly suggest working on treating any latent illness you may have. I should follow my own words but it’s just really hard."
6323,"Your frontal lobe matures, you become an adult and life normalizes."
6324,"Had no-one in high-school. Got good friends in college. Then afterwards found out they were only friends out of convenience. Since we no longer go to school together, they no longer care.

I'm now 24 and lost my last friend early this year. Not a great time tbh."
6325,"Awesome. I’m able to enjoy what I do at work for the most part, and when I come home there aren’t any expectations of me. If I’m feeling lonely I talk to the few friends I do have that are introverts like me, or hit up any of the gaming groups/meetups in the area that my mom could never drive me to or didn’t think it was important enough for me to spend money on. Now that I’m out of college especially, there’s more of a range between party animal and nerdy introvert, so it’s easier to meet people at my own pace."
6326,"150 lb is equivalent to the combined weight of 50.4 human brains

---

^^I'm ^^a ^^bot"
6327,"I think your last paragraph there really encompasses what a lot of people your age are feeling. I'm 25 and am still kind of figuring this out internally despite knowing it for quite some time. Holing yourself up and studying your ass off with no social life will get you a high paying job, and you will feel less anxious about retirement, rent, all of that stuff. But that stuff isn't going to mean much until you actually retire. We need to be able to live in the moment and have fun as well. It's kind of a delicate balance. Without good friends to bounce our feelings off of, we can drive ourselves insane over perfectly ordinary feelings like loneliness, anxiety, etc. We need to keep at least one foot in the present moment while the other drives towards our long term goals. Otherwise what's even the point?"
6328,"I’ve always been the hard to open up kind of kid. Consequently I made about 1 **good** friend a year (on average). Now having graduated, I have been left with about 4-5 good, for-life friends. However, I’ve moved for my job, so... now where I live I don’t have much local friends. So it sucks, but I always have people to text and call with.

Edit: graduated from uni"
6329,"I actually felt kinda at home in school. I didn't have anyone to be with, but college is way more lonely. In school, I at least felt like everyone cared about me."
6330,"This is my exact situation as well - I graduated college and moved near NYC so I can pursue my passion which is music, I went to school for performance on Trumpet and now am surrounded by so many like minded people on a day to day basis that it makes all the hardships I endured in high school/college a distant memory that I can even look back and reflect fondly on. That and a 150 lb weight loss definitely have me feeling much better in my own skin. While it may seem tough in the moment, just know that it’ll all make sense eventually even if it doesn’t early on. I can recall countless times I felt my life was whirling out of control and things seemed impossible, but I made it! Find your own personal success, because if you’re happy it makes all the sad/bad times growing up just funny memories where you can look back and reflect and realize just how lost you were, we were all there, now go out there and make your own success story! :) sending all my positive vibes your way, op!"
6331,"I was the kind of guy who really didn’t have friends but I hanged out with the lonely ones and  the “geeks” during High School and I avoid being in a clique. 

After High School, I found out that the ones I listened to and  helped supported became close friends with me and all of them went to pursue in the Business, Tech, Media or medical field.

My advice is to listen and support those who want someone there for them."
6332,"I'm doing as good as I thought I would. When I was young, I was very popular and always had friends, but when I hit middle school, I became very insecure, quiet, and self-aware (realized I was a shitty friend and decided cutting off people who were also shitty was the only way I was going to grow as a person), so from about 7th grade onward, I was very lonely. I ate in the bathroom frequently and left school at 16 because I had no friends anyways. I'm really glad I went through that even though it was unbearably lonely and hard because I got to do a lot of self-reflection and got really good at observing people. I knew I would be fine once I got to the ""real-world"" because I would no longer be forced to stay in an institution longer than I wanted to with people who only cared about superficial things. As an adult, you still encounter the same type of superficial people but I am able to tolerate and even get along well with them because being alone so long with my observations taught me not to trust or give much weight to their opinions or ideas."
6333,I am currently dealing with social anxiety and going to a therapist and starting taking antidepressants really helped. Makes the day to day life easier.
6334,"easier said than done but unsolicited internet stranger advice is use this big move to start fresh. Anyone you meet from now on gets the real you, the unfiltered you."
6335,"It’s so much better. When I was in high school, I probably only had about one friend at best. Then, in college, my social life started to blossom. After graduating from college, I realized that I have to make a much more conscious effort in staying in contact and keeping in touch with them. I no longer care about being “cool” or “popular”. Generally, when you’re in high school, you make friends based on proximity and social status. Once you are in college and reach adulthood, you tend to make more genuine friendships based on values, interests, and experiences."
6336,"your experience after college will be what you make it. it has been the same way since you were young but now you've got some experience under your belt and a stronger ability to pave your own path. The best part about life after school is there's much less pressure to be one of the ""cool"" kids. If you do you and work on not being ashamed of yourself for the things you find interesting, it's a new level of freedom and you'll attract likeminded people. The hard part about this is it won't happen for you if you stay inside and isolate yourself. You need to get excited about life because it's worth getting excited about. Just don't EVER expect things to fall in your lap. It feels better to earn it anyways."
6337,"I still sit alone at lunch (at work), but it doesn't really bother me any more, though I am still aware of it.  I still don't have any friends, but again, it doesn't particularly bother me.  I am also happily married, so loneliness isn't an issue."
6338,i hope i can relate to this in a few years! i’m glad things got better for you.
6339,Meanwhile I just bottled up my issues lmao
6340,Damn you must be really dumb now
6341,"Thank you for the kind words, I think I just need to trust in myself enough to not worry about becoming overly fixated on the first person I date. Having never done it though it just feels so risky."
6342,There’s always Cool Cat. He’s everyone’s friend
6343,"Taking online classes is the shit. But when I do have to go to college I'm usually to myself. And trust me when I say mostly everyone else is too. It's college everyone just wants to pass, there's no sitting alone at lunch because you can just go home. It does get better."

6345,"Just chipping in- This is a good way to start feeling better about yourself, but shouldnt be the end goal. Doing ""better"" than others will definitely give you an ego boost, but feeling good about yourself for your self's sake is the way to go. Comparison is the bane of happiness"
6346,"Well, there are two sides to this. Abstaining from girls and friends will absolutely help you remain focused on school work. The problem with this thinking is making it about girls and friends. Abstaining from video games will do the same thing. As will abstaning from sports or working out etc. What you will find is that people will use what they are most lacking in and use that to drive their focus.

What I mean by that is, someone who is not so good at sports will say, ""abstaining from playing sports helped me stay focused.""

Basically, you did a great job by lasering your focus on school, what you gave up doesnt matter. Drop that mindset and go do the things you couldnt do because you were focused on being successful"
6347,"Maybe the problem (I mean there are lots of issues, but still) is that I still don’t feel “successful” enough where I can risk doing those things."
6348,"Personally I don’t think you’re right about the “without any hope for a better future” part man. You need to reset yourself somehow. Now how to do that? Well, it’s different for everybody and I’m no professional. But if you want to go into further details I’m all ears. You can reply here or dm me anytime!!"
6349,"I'd say stagnation is normal for everyone to experience at some point in time regardless if you're in a relationship or not.

You two just graduated from college and still need time to figure out how to use your education. A lot of people come out with the knowledge but not the trade skills.

The idea that you would 'be in a better place' or 'winning' is the idea that  your parents, society or the college itself gave you. Life is hardly ever just consistently 'winning' or climbing. There will be periods where the water is calm and it's normal to feel like you have to go find something to do RIGHT now because that's what college instills in you.

Personally I would just give it some time. Ever heard of the saying? This isn't a sprint, it's a marathon?"
6350,"Great advice...never look at any aspect of life as a “roadmap”.  While a good plan (ready for adjustments) helps many of us move forward, life is too unpredictable and too humbling to think that there is. A”map” to follow. At 53yo, it makes me laugh to think of my “life expectations” back in my early 20,s!!!!!!  NOTHING has played out as I really envisioned....."
6351,This is hard to read cuz a similar thing happened with me(23M) and my gf and we drifted apart and broke up. Please tell him. Please tell him that you care and he matters and you believe in him. And that it matters. Early 20s it can feel like no one cares that you exist and that can be so demotivating and debilitating. Maybe its not quite the same but please say something.
6352,"It’s easy to get stuck in the job that you’re already in. If he doesn’t want stagnation, he should put in the effort and look for a better job. If you’re happy with your job, sounds like it’s on him."
6353,"Hey, I don’t really know anything about you & ur bf....but I can offer the thoughts of of a 53yo Grampa who has won & lost at “life”...many times over!
Gives your ages and what other bits of info you provided, it really sounds that this is the right time to take your relationship to a new level.  Given the fact things appear to be “stagnant”, why not go house shopping together (you don’t have to buy one right away), talk about marriage...talk about kids....get a dog....etc....
My point is that you can also look at this situation as an opportunity to “win at the game of love”! Right?  If you both have similar aspirations & visions, then your relationship will be intertwined in the “game” ...eventually.

I have had a lot of “stagnation” in many different areas of my/our lives over the years and have come to appreciate the good which can come from these times.  Seize the opportunity..."
6354,"Thanks a lot! Over the past year or so I've definitely come to understand that things change and to be fairly flexible about that. I guess it would be good to focus on other things for a change, let the career stuff go on ""autopilot"" for a bit."

6357,Oh no! I would hate for that to happen. I will tell him :)
6358,"A life takes a long time build. I found ""stagnation"" to actually just be slow development. Just because I wasnt taking giant leaps forward, it didn't mean I wasn't doing anything. I'm 33 now and my life pretty much kicks ass. I lived in my car when I was about 25 and out of school. Things take time. There is a reason the country club is full of old people. It's a slow process that can sometimes go so slow it feels like you aren't moving at all."

I didn't take learning seriously and now I feel like I don't know anything. I haven't reviewed any of my school material since graduating 2 years ago. I feel like I retained nothing. This is what I regret.

6367,"My personal theory is that it might have to do with the fact that many students of politics are interested in social problems (environmental politics, human rights etc.), but there is a disconnect between how those issues should be tackled vs. how they are in reality (i.e., through the old boys' club method)"

I majored in Aerospace Engineering at a top program. Which was way too god-damned hard. Like yeah, it sounds impressive to the casual crowd and has opened many doors for me, but I can't help but feel like I've would've done just fine with a CS or ME degree instead and had more fun in college."

And that’s just vacation, not including major holidays. Every busy season I wonder why i haven’t quit yet, every summer I remember.

Also I’m at a large multinational but not big 4 firm. It would be worse at the B4."
6391,"Ask about any Reno's, when the last time things like plumbing was replaced, etc. Ask if you can speak to previous or current tenants of the landlord (huge red flag if they say no or are avoidant after asking that one). 

In terms of roommates though, y'all need to sit down and have a hard adult conversation about the running of the place. Will you be sharing groceries, rotating chores, etc? And make it firm. No ""oh we'll figure it out, we're all friends!"" 9.9 times out of 10 that NEVER works (in my experience at least)."

6393,Get renters insurance for your things
6394,That's a great idea! Thanks
6395,Thank you!! I'm making a checklist and these will all be on there
6396,"8. Check for backed up toilets and bathtubs. Both were backed up on move in day at my place, had to call emergency maintenance. 

9. Can you only get internet/TV through the apartment complex (main office), or can you do it externally (call the company yourself).

10. Ask about what their plans are for if/when the power goes out. That was a major thing in the Midwest during the polar vortex last year. A lot of people were without power, and it got very cold very quickly inside."
6397,"Youre moving out this month and you havent even picked out a place or signed a lease? Uh....

When you sign a lease you have to put down a down payment/security deposit, and often have to pay the last month of rent, and you have to pay to turn on all your utilities, so this will probably be 2.5x your normal rent.

Also, you probably wont get your security deposit back. I actually consider getting it back to be a rare and abnormal case.

Make sure you and your roommates know that leases are legally binding contracts that make you obligated to pay for 3 months — year. I cannot tell you how many stories I’ve heard of college age kids signing leases and then changing their mind on a whim and acting as if it isnt a big deal 🤦‍♀️ 

Make sure your friends can and are dedicated to paying rent. Too many story of friends who move in but suddenly cant rent once they sign the lease. (I even saw one person who called his roomate abusive because she told him that if he didnt pay rent for the third time in a row then she would have to kick him out...) 

Beware of basements. They might seem cool but they tend to flood.

Be wary of carpet, especially if you are looking for housing in a college town or if one of your roomates is allergic to cats. Carpet is dirty and really difficult to clean, and if it is a college town they will probably be especially dirty. However it cant be avoided and isnt the end of the world.

Big downside of houses is that you will have to shovel it in the winter, rake leaves in the fall, and mow it every other season. Dont get a house if you and your roommates wont have the time, energy, or know-how to do it because you will get charged if you dont. 

Dishwashers are really important, especially since at this age you are still learning the skills and self discipline to live on your own. My sink would never be empty if it werent for having a dishwasher. Luckily most units have this. Paper plates really are useful for keeping dirty dishes low too. 

I also think my quality of life would be increased if I had an in-unit washer and dryer, but unfortunately i do not. But going to a laundromat isnt too bad."
6398,[deleted]
6399,Is it normal to knock on people's doors to ask about the place? How would I do that without interrupting their business?
6400,"Yeah, corners of the room where damp collects generally. It can happen when the apartment gets too cold too.

My friends can't afford heating in college so they have major mold issues. I keep telling them they're going to end up losing money paying for it to be removed anyway haha."
6401,"Normally I've just asked the landlord to connect me with previous tenants but if that's not how you wanted to do it, I'd leave them a note saying who you are and how best to contact you (email, messenger, whatever) and try that before knocking on their door."
6402,[deleted]
6403,Get a bed bug proof mattress protector and know what bed bugs look like. You gotta catch those suckers early and you do not want to get bedbugs.
6404,What are the worst places for mold? I'm assuming bathrooms and kitchens especially under sinks and toilets.
6405,"I mean, I'm beginning the process this month, probably within the next week depending on how our schedules line up. The date I actually move in is not that important.

I know about deposits, first/last months rent and all that. I have several thousand dollars saved exactly for that.

Good to know, is it because landlords make excuses as to why you don't get it back, or is it just not expected to be returned in any case?

Good point, I have been making sure they've been saving money and preparing for moving, and I'll make sure they know that it's legally binding and that they will be kicked out if they don't pay rent.

Good to know about the carpet and basements, I will try to avoid those.

And yeah that's exactly why I prefer an apartment, 99% chance it's gonna be an apartment

For sure lack of a dishwasher is a dealbreaker, and washer and dryer at least close if not in unit is pretty important

Thanks for the advice!!"

6408,"Thank you! You essentially confirmed what I was thinking, it's not gonna be perfect but it can work. And that's ok, I'm excited to be independent and it'll be a lot of fun and a lot of not fun as well.

And I do have an out, although that ""out"" is having money saved aside in case I have to take on extra rent while I'm finding a new roommate. The good news is I think it won't be hard to find a roommate, and if I have to pay 1/2 the rent instead of 1/3 for a few months it won't destroy me financially"
6409,"Another reason to lock your own door: one year I had two roommates who were complete knobs (yes I'm so clever 😅) and refused to keep the house locked. Well, surprise of all surprises, one day some rando just walked in and made off with all their stuff. Mine was the only room that didn't get ransacked. Moral of the story, don't trust your roomies' judgement even if they seem like decent people, 'cause ya never know."
6410,"Communicate with your roommates how bills will be paid, whose name will they be under? I had a roommate who didn’t pay the water for three months even though we gave him money, it sucked not being able to shower after the gym and having an interview."
6411,"As someone who is currently a ""property manager"" please please READ THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR LEASE. Ask for a sample lease before even applying anywhere. If they refuse to give you a sample lease to see, huge red flag and don't rent from them. If the lease is only one or two pages long that is also a read flag. No state has rental laws simple enough where everything can fit on less than 5 pages or so (IME). Check every line for anything that seems shady, especially any fine print and additional provisions.

Also, be sure to educate yourself on both your state and local real estate/rental laws. It will be a dense and hard read but worth every moment spent."
6412,Basement if you have one! Our landlord had to replace the entire wall of part of the basement we were in plus the carpet
6413,Just do ur best probing and researching. You’re eventually gonna get a bad place. Basement’s aren’t that bad unless you check
6414,"Check the insulation, seriously! 10 years I've been living in apartments, and my latest one is the first time I've ever had to learn this lesson. Lack of proper insulation measures in the windows and doors will usually generate three common problems with apartments - sound, temperature, and pests. 

It should not sound like the window or door is open when it is, in fact, not. Being able to hear people walk outside like there is no window between you and them is probably not something you want, especially if your bedroom window is facing a parking lot and some of your neighbors have obnoxiously loud trucks. Make sure your doors don't have terribly high gaps between itself and the wall/floor - that's gonna affect whether you can hear social gatherings in the living room behind closed doors. 

It should not *feel* like the window or door is open when it is, in fact, not. This is a little harder to tell from the room tours (especially if they aren't letting you see the actual apartment), but if your windows or doors aren't even protecting you from the chill of winter, then that's a serious indication that your electricity/heating/cooling bill is going to be pretty high. Try to be aware of whatever you're wearing when you check the apartments out - wearing a coat/jacket indoors is gonna mess with your sense of temperature, and so is coming straight from outside if you've got a pretty extreme temp difference between indoors and outdoors. Check apartment reviews, if you can, for complaints about high utility bills - that's going to indicate whether it's a common issue in the entire complex/building or just an individual issue. 

Ask about common pest problems and their pest control policies. Check reviews about said apartmental pest control. Bad insulation and poor pest control policies also means that bugs are likely to get in easier, and how the landlords respond to that is going to affect your sanity if you have any hygienic standards whatsoever. Research what kind of common bugs might show up in the area you're living in - you may be fine with the occasional cockroach, spider, or mosquito getting in, but maybe not 2-inch long wood or American cockroaches, venomous spiders that cause necrotic flesh damage, or even ladybug or centipede swarms.

Also, unless it's common where you're planning to move, just stay away from fireplaces. Not only is it yet another open hole where drafts and bugs can get in, it's a serious pain to deal with the firewood - cockroaches also can come with firewood, and if you leave it too long without burning it, then they'll come out and invade your apartment that way."
6415,check for thin walls. You shouldn’t be able to hear a conversation at normal volume through the walls lol. it would drive me absolutely insane and feel like I have zero privacy
6416,"I’ve lived in apartments with at least one dog (but mostly 2) for the last 10 years. There was a moment when I had 4 animals in a home, with my ex and there has been exactly twice I have not gotten back my full deposit - one place had a required $150 cleaning fee and another I walked out in mid lease for extenuating circumstances. Every other time, I’ve gotten my full deposit back some 20+ moves since I have rented."
6417,"I think I'm going to take on that responsibility, it'll help me sleep at night lol"
6418,"Yes, I don't wanna get screwed, in that way at least. Thank you!"
6419,Ok thanks!!
6420,"Renter's insurance might be a good idea depending on where you live. If you live in a place that is prone to natural disasters (hurricanes, flooding, etc.), it's definitely worth it. Or if you're apartment is a bit old and you think it may be prone to a fire caused by faulty/old wiring or a gas leak or something like that."
6421,"Hi! 22f winter graduate here in a similar situation (down to even regretting not pursuing music haha) to say you're not alone! I very much feel that I squandered the time I had in college both in academic and social aspects. I've been trying to get into the mindset of not dwelling too much on the past and missed opportunities because really, I think there's lots more life to live and to constantly beat yourself up for things you can't change now seems very unproductive and toxic for your mental wellbeing. You graduated with a 3.84, that's amazing!! Like seriously. And you sound like you have a lot of passions that are totally worth pursuing outside of an academic structure. I think being burned out is totally reasonable.  I've been graduated for like 5 months now and I still feel burned out from college haha. Take your time. There's still so much out there, and I feel like our generation for whatever reason puts so much pressure on the college experience to be ""the best time of our lives"". It's only 4 years. Now you get to discover who you are outside of academia. If you miss it theres always grad school hahaha.

Idk if that was helpful at all but please know you are not alone in your thoughts and that you shouldn't let past experiences or even lack thereof prevent you from finding something that appeals to you. I wish you the best OP, good luck!!"
6422,"Trade school, maybe. Although I don’t think you sound entitled, music does not sound like a reasonable fall back."
6423,"Believe it or not, taking risks when you’re young is one of the best things one can do. Especially if it’s something you believe in or are passionate about. There are risks with everything in life, and everyone should responsibly manage their risk, but taking no risks is certainly a wrong decision for youth, as taking the safest path possible is often disappointing."
6424,Contrast here!  I was in a relationship here my whole time in college and started dating a chick that was a couple years younger than me and I stayed in the small college town for her. She dumped me 2 months before she graduated. What a fucking waste.
6425,"Correct, I already graduated."
6426,"I felt the same way, I promise you this feeling will pass and the pleasant memories will remain as you get older. I’m 27 and just started a brand new career path that has nothing to do with my college major.

I also had mental health challenges that held me back in school. Just be easy on yourself and remember the best years are really yet to come. I’ve enjoyed age 25-27 far more than college"
6427,Correct me if im wrong but isnt it possible to just switch majors or chose another major? I know a lot of friends of mine who did for example 3 years dentistry and then switched to med school or 2 years chemistry and switched to engineering
6428,"Thanks for this response, I really appreciate it! I guess my generation does have unrealistic expectations for college. Probably because of all the marketing. I probably do have interests that I could pursue outside of academia, but whether I can put my mind to it is an entirely different issue."
6429,"Ofc! Its such a weird time to graduate college in general, a lot of people I know are having similar feelings as you. And like I said, I think it's okay to take your time to figure things out, leaving school is such a big mental adjustment and it's better in the long run if you can be kind and patient with yourself now and try to find ways to enjoy yourself in the process. You just graduated, try to enjoy what you've achieved and take the next steps when you're ready. And don't give up on music! If anything it's great stress relief haha. Anyways, you've got this!"
6430,"I graduated fall of 2019 thinking I was going to go on to graduate school for psychology, now I'm In a masters for accounting. It's totally normal to end up just changing what you went to school for honestly. Find out what skills you gained and just work towards doing something you enjoy!"
6431,I don't think many ppl do college like tv/ads have it
6432,"From reading your post, it sounds like you didn’t really think through your plan of attending college, what to study, etc. Now you’re sort of in a hole (hopefully not too much/any college debt) and you’ll need to play your cards carefully to bounce back. I wouldn’t recommend going back to any school. 

I do agree your degree does seem a bit useless or least would make it difficult to build a career out of. However, getting a job and starting a career is difficult for everyone, even people graduating from Ivy League schools with in-demand degrees struggle to find “good jobs.” I would look a job in a field I liked, whether that be retail, warehouse, etc. and work my way up from there. Focus on repaying debts first, possibly live at home to save money if you can. When you talk about your degree you can spin it in a way saying you did it to obtain a more robust education and make friends. Basically “sugarcoat” your degree, don’t ever admit to “not knowing why you did it” when applying for jobs or I doubt you’ll ever hear back from them."
6433,I feel the same.  Family pressure of finding a job and pursuing my degree does not help one bit
6434,"Whether because of Hollywood or conventions, our society romanticizes the idea of college being this incredible place where you make the best friends and have the best time. College is rarely what they told us. And believe it or not, your college experience probably isn't too bad. At least you got a good grade and had a few friends. The reality is that college is over. It's time to move on. 

As to finding motivation, you mentioned writing music. If you do have the musical talent and the passion, consider starting to write and create your own music again. BUT this should just be a side hobby for now. This path at the beginning will not pay you financially. Thus, you should find a job at the same time."
6435,I feel similarly
6436,"I’m in the same boat friend. I’ve always wanted to be an actor but my parents wanted me to go to college so I did that. A piece of advice I picked up might help you out. Instead of living up to everyone else’s expectations of who you are and what you should do with your life. Ask yourself who you want to be and what you want you want to do with your life. Honestly much easier then it sounds. Good luck friend, god speed👏"

6439,"Oh my God, I also am graduating Psych soon and I’m so lost… part of me really does want to go to graduate school (otherwise, I don’t think I can really do anything with my degree) as a pHD or simply for a Masters. I honestly just want to be a Therapist, so I’m also considering just going for a Masters in Social Work. But… ik being a researcher or a professor would help pay the bills…

Any advice from a fellow Psych Undergrad?"
6440,"Don’t feel too bad about it man. You seem to be either an intellect or a very hardworking person to graduate with a GPA like that. 

Let me share my story with you and hopefully it’ll give you some sense of relatability. Throughout high school, I was a very hardworking student who did nothing other than study immediately after school every single day. I didn’t have much of a social life outside of school. By the time I graduated and got automatically accepted into a reputable school (3.96 GPA), I was TOTALLY burned out. My first year of college was a catastrophe and I couldn’t find the motivation to push through with at least a half-decent GPA.

Long story short, here I am as a third year dropout (21 year old) who was supposed to graduate on this month of this year. However, I can confidently tell you that I’m in the best situation that I’ve ever been in. I have a decent “college” job that has allowed me to save a decent amount of money; I’ve met all sorts of people who have shaped my character and taught me many things in general, and I’ve recently established an LLC within a business field that I genuinely love.

What I’m getting to is, you shouldn’t blame yourself because you aren’t in an ideal situation yet. As cliché as it is, patience goes a long way. Keep doing what makes you happy. In terms of not knowing what your interests are, try new things every so often. I tried fly fishing on a whim one day, and it has easily become my favorite thing to do. Good luck to you!"
6441,Why do u feel the need to sticky this ? And flag as mod ?
6442,"For what it’s worth I don’t think *our generation* puts that pressure on it, I think it’s  something passed on from parents. Though for some people they definitely do have a blast in college and it lives up to the hype.

I feel like if you take out the romanticism of people in previous generations my expectation would just be more school/high school 2, which is pretty much what it is."

6444,"I'm nearly done with my accounting masters at this point, no regrets whatsoever on my transition for what it's worth. 

I did a mountain of research when I was getting ready to apply for clinical psych phds so I'll just go off that; if you just want to be a therapist I definitely would not get a PhD. I did a lot of undergrad research because i enjoyed it and wanted to do it, if you wanna be a therapist the immense amount of research you do in a doctorate program will drive you nuts.

Masters of Social Work was going to be a serious option for me because it gets you a license that let's you practice but also gives you an out if you want something slightly different. Absolutely is the more versatile option (and a few of my psych friends ended up going this route).

Ultimately, I was a bit lost and decided career stability and certainty was more important for me than my psych interests so I really can't speak on what a psych grad program ""looks"" like as i went a different route. I'll be honest, there isn't a ton of money to go around down the phd or masters route unless you end up operating your own practice. ""A lot"" is subjevtive though. Some people are cool with it, i wanted more personally. Its certainly enough to live on.  All I can say is really think about what you see yourself doing and how much money you see yourself making; my expectation vs reality is part of what threw me off the course."
6445,"You have no idea, but this is beyond helpful. Not many people I know or around my area really have a good grasp on the two different field’s pathways (can’t blame them, they’re quite niche areas of interest.)

6447,music has tended to have very poor payoffs
6448,A risk as big as another likely disappointing degree isn’t worth it
6449,And you think a music degree would change it? You sound entitled. Try something worth the investment. lmfao music
6450,Joke’s on you! I didn’t talk to anyone in high school...
6451,"Fuck no. The more I matured in highschool the more I realised they didn't treat me right at all, that being said I didn't leave them because there wasn't really any other people who I felt like would take me. (I ended up finding out there were plenty of people who liked hanging with me, but my self esteem was so mangled I really couldn't tell). I'm only a few months out the gate but im trying to unlearn any nastiness they may have taught me and to build back my self esteem. 

This isn't a pity party tho, I just wanna say to anyone who is considering no contact after highschool? Do it!"
6452,"Same here, have a solid friend group of 6 people and they’re the only ones from high school I’m still in contact with"
6453,"A fellow 2017 graduate? I still live with 2 friends from highschool and keep in touch with another. The old gang still has a group chat we talk regularly in, but never see eachother"
6454,friends?
6455,"Same here, my college friends seemed to fade away after college."
6456,Three in total. Two I met freshman year.
6457,[deleted]
6458,"I have about 3-4 I’ve kept in contact with. I have a lot of people who went to my high school that I became friends with in college, but I don’t know if that counts."
6459,"Similar experience here. Had a group of friends that started at the end of eighth grade and right after we graduated high school I really started to realize that I was always the expendable friend who was left out of things and I had been rationalizing it my whole high school experience because I didn’t have anyone else. I was at the height of depression and my self esteem was at an all time low for for most of high school so I didn’t see it, or didn’t want to see it. 

Once I finally cut them out I really started analyzing the things that would happen and I felt so stupid. The one whose house we’d always hang out at would say we weren’t going over to his place this weekend because his parents said he couldn’t have anyone over, but then I’d see the other friend over at his house because they’d both post snapchat stories where I could see him over at our friends house. I thought he “couldn’t have anyone over?” This would happen often, and I just didn’t care to do anything about it because I thought they were all I had. There were many more things and I could go on and on. 

When I told them how I felt, of course they made excuses. I was the one who just “drifted away” and that once I began to drift away it was easier for me to “think I was being treated as expendable.” What a joke."
6460,"Yup, we voice chat and play video games together on a fairly regular basis"
6461,Yep 2017. My group chat hasn’t been used in 2 years lol. Everyone went all over the country and just gained new friends
6462,"Yes , I have a total of 5 good friends . The rest are just people I used to know"
6463,"Nope.

Had two people near and dear to me in high school. Broke up with one (bf) when college started. I felt I had outgrown the second; our friendship just made me feel dragged down and not good anymore. I stopped meaningfully responding to messages and let things dissolve with time. I don’t regret it; it gave me the space to grow"
6464,shoulda made a poll
6465,"Graduated 2015, my high school friends are still my closest friends. I regularly keep in touch with 15+ of them"
6466,Still my best friends
6467,"I had a similar experience, I completely agree. The detriment to your mental health after dealing with toxic people for so long is something else. Then the healing journey afterwards when you cut them out is an experience. But it's a good experience"
6468,"I didn’t really make many friends from my hs, but I had friends outside of my hs. I’m still friends with a few people outside of my hs but lost contact with people I made friends with within school. I’m not sure if any of them are friends, more like acquaintances."
6469,"I graduated in 2012. Had tons of friends, partied so much, played lacrosse, just had a fucking great time. I was in the best shape of my life and didn’t have a worry in the world (probably due to smoking so much weed and drinking on the weekends). I miss those days every single day tbh because now I don’t keep up with anyone but one friend out of a big friend group. I miss smoking weed in a Walmart parking lot or at the lake and just learning everything the hard way because that’s life experience. I took a plunge after HS and got into some nasty drugs but I’m one year clean off opiates now. I miss the golden days. Now I’m just an anxiety riddled grapefruit 😩"
6470,How's the living/rent situation? I'm trying to get a place with friends and my cousin
6471,"I only *really* talk to two of them. One I’ve known my entire life, we grew up across the street from each other. The other I’ve known since I was probably 5 and we were roommates our senior year of college, but he went to another high school so I consider him more of a college friend I guess but we’ve always been tight. Still in a group chat with them and 4 other friends from high school. We’re all 25/26 now."
6472,"Yes, the first year after high school it was seldom, but as university went on I actually spoke to them more. Now, I actually talk with more of the high school friends than university friends, but that’s more a case of none of my university friends living anywhere near me (like I think the closest is technically 3 hours). So, in my case, I think it’s more because of proximity not actual desire. Although, I only say this as I feel as though I am growing apart from them but I have been feeling this for quite some time."
6473,Yup! All the time. Do you?
6474,"In the same position my friend. I still see them during summers like once but since HS I’ve learned that I’m a much better person w/o them. 

That being said, I have kept and got closer to some of them. 3 of them are no longer friends with the people I left and I love em. One still is but I hang with him without them"
6475,"Nope, lost contact almost immediately"
6476,Definitely!!! We stall have an active whatsapp group chat that we made together back in 2012 or so. We have so many old photos of us that we still use as memes in conversation. Best friends ill ever have.
6477,"God no. Hell I've only got one college friend left.

People come and go, you're only friends with them cause you go to the same school and it's convenient. As you mature and grow you'll drift apart in interests and time allocations."
6478,Very few.
6479,"I'm down to at least three, was in one's wedding just a few weeks ago. Some I talk to over Facebook, others I run into in town from time to time but we are all too busy living our own lives. Most friendships are drifting apart, now I'm losing some due to my position on current events. Most of my college friends were made through a girl I was dating through college. When that relationship ended, those ""friendships"" ended with it."
6480,Doing volunteer work and not going like once every few months or so but finding something you’re passionate about and regularly showing up to volunteer. The community is equally as strong as any church I’d say.
6481,"When you base your whole life around work by having your only friends there. You create a bond to your job. Which could come into play if your employer chooses not to give a raise or cut hours. Rather than quitting and moving on to something better, you stay cause ""it's family"".

Work is not family.

And when you finally do get let go, your ""family"" falls away real quick.

Source: lived it. Sucked. Boss made up accusations so they had a reason to fire me. Make the whole ""family"" turn against me and never speak to me again. Don't fall into this trap. Keep work professional only."
6482,"Church and my local non alcoholic kava bar.

6485,Don't make friends at work..?
6486,"Join something. It could be something to do with your religion,  or politics,  or volunteering or some sort of exercise or club. I remember right after high school I took a beginners adult yoga class and I noticed a lot of ppl became friends and would hangout outside of the class. I never did because I had my high school friends still so I didn't know how lonely adult life was going to be but if i had that opportunity now i would have definitely been friends with them."
6487,"I strongly disagree with the point about not making friends at work. 

Every friendship becomes what you make of it. If you only ever talk to people at work about work then yeah, you’re going to amplify your focus on work. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use your job as a way to meet potential friends with similarities beyond the jobs you share. In most places, jobs are filled with people asking this same question of “wait, where do I meet people?”

Take the initiative to make things more than a coworker friendship when it feels safe. Obviously use some intuition to gauge whether people are a good fit for opening up (and not actually a threat to your job). But man, going through work closed off to friendship sounds miserable. That’s how people burn out and become fucking spiteful. 

Your coworkers are people too who are probably just as desperate for friends as you are. Give it a shot. I was surprised by how similar work felt to college classes/organizations after graduation."
6488,"I'm not sure if I'm alone in feeling this way, but I feel a little dehumanized when women/girls are referred to as females. It feels sort of animal husbandry-like. I'm sure you meant no ill will though, you seem nice."
6489,do drugs fuck if i know
6490,"Yeah I totally understand because there isn't really an option like the word ""guy"". But generally either women or girls will work since most of reddit is young adults who will accept either. And I've heard many older women refer to themselves and each other as girls."
6491,"My aunt and uncle ran a board game thing every week at a pub near them before the world got corona'd, maybe look for something like that once we can go out again"
6492,"Clubs, gym, bars

I made some very good friends at my last job. It was office work with a lot of hours so you get pretty close."
6493,"If you look in to things around your hobbies you’ll definitely find some cool and like minded people. I joined a running club, I’m one of the youngest people in the club but the people are so friendly, and with many other clubs we have social events/gatherings at bars and restaurants after races and training"
6494,"I totally feel you here, after graduating University everyone dispersed to different areas of the country to work and I felt like the only one who couldn't move on into a new friendship circle.  I sat in major depression for nearly two years because I wasn't proactive about it and just expected people to come to me.

It honestly took a lot of patience and time, but you eventually fall into a group providing you're open minded to new and different people as well as being relatively forward in hanging with people you've met and click with (eg. Just biting the bullet and asking someone to grab a drink if you get on with them.). It feels a bit strange when you've grown up in a world where you're just kinda forced into a community through education and/or family...  But this is your chance to build your own community with people that make you feel good about yourself!  You can be selective and have no obligations to be around people you don't want to be.  This was a massive revelation to me and kinda 'set me free,' to put it bluntly. 

For me it was work.  I fell into this relatively shitty job following Uni, but the people were fun and made me feel liked as a person.  I went out of my way to arrange gettogethers with the ones I liked.  As a result of this I was introduced into their varying friendship circles and now I essentially feel like I have a small family of people here.  There's still moments of loneliness, but I'm always comforted by the excitement of knowing that there's still so many people out there for me to meet. It's just a matter of creating those opportunities for those people to be met."

6510,"Most jobs have starting bonuses.

A couple of my friends have received up to 30k in starting bonuses.

Depends on job etc.

But I think most importantly corona has shown us that not all students are equal, life is still life and some students are in a better position than others.

Doesn’t mean students don’t work their butt off to afford it."
6511,"I mean it all depends on the circumstances each person has. What major did you complete? What is your personal life like? And really what type of person are you? 

I graduated with an MSEE so pending a job offer, I would probably be able to relocate anywhere and afford it to live on my own; albeit better in some parts of the country than others. 

But my actual story is that I graduated college with a job offer in hand. I attended school within reach to silicon valley and my parents lived within commuting distance to silicon valley... I however, moved several hundred miles away for my job to a low COL area. So far it has been a great decision, but I didn’t do it alone. One month before graduating I got married and we moved away together. In retrospect, I’m not incredibly sure I would have moved away if I were alone. I would probably have stayed in silicon valley near my parents, but still rented an apartment on my own. I’m confident I would have been able to live on my own, but not too far away from the nest if I was totally on my own. 

It’s just a lot of variables that play into being able to do it. I mean moving away from the state we both lived in our wholes lives was not too easy a decision, but in my case being with him is what gave me the guts to do it. Other people even married wouldn’t leave, and others would do it alone. It a personality thing and also that not everyone is in great terms in with their immediate family."
6512,"I graduated college and then immediately moved \~1000 miles away to a new city. I had no financial help from my parents/family, and approximately $2000 in savings (from working year round since \~17, had to pay for my own college, took on some loans (only federal/part of fin-aid package). My job paid \~$12,000/year. I  lived in a less-nice apartment w/ two roommates and lived cheap (no guarantor, my parents aren't on a single financial thing I have). I've since got a better job and moved to a nicer apartment on my own. 

The key is what YOU have and what YOU'RE able to do. This worked for me - I was able to handle  living w/ roommates and living in a crappy apartment  (with a low standard of living), because that was worth it for me from a job/experience perspective. I wasn't miserable and it was fine - I knew it was short term. But at some point moving out and living on your own comes with tradeoffs (unless your parents are rich/support you) and you have to decide which tradeoffs are worth it to you!"
6513,Stayed in my college apt that is very cheap with all utilities included.
6514,"I find that my experience of being able to move out almost directly after college is VERY unique, it took most of my friends about a year and a half, and even then, many of them are still living at home with their parents two years later.

For me, it was the combination of luck, privilege, and working really hard.

Privilege, because I got a lot of scholarships for college that essentially landed me with no student debt, and a steady job the summer after graduation that gave me overtime almost every week.

Hard work, because I chose to work a job overtime almost every week, and saved up almost everything I made while living with my parents. I have been 100% financially independent since moving out.

Luck, because I managed to land a solid job four months after moving to a new city. I didn't have a job moving there, and didn't even get a regular job until I had been there for three months. This probably sounds utterly insane as well :-) P.S. I was a liberal arts major, so yes, it's possible.

Even then, I didn't move out of my parent's house until 4 months after graduation. It was also a personal lifelong goal for me to move to a city far from where I grew up, and I desperately wanted to achieve that.

Everyone's post-college experience is extremely different, it's so hard but try not to compare yourself with others. You won't be stuck at your parents' house forever. It will work out.

Congratulations on the job!"
6515,*looks at my contract* most jobs have a starting... what?
6516,"I commented elsewhere in this post, but this is essentially exactly what I did too!"
6517,"I got a starting bonus and a moving bonus but it took two pay checks to hit after I started. I had to let a bunch of stuff ride on a credit card so i could do first months rent and deposit out of savings. It all worked out though. 

I was very fortunate to have well paying internships and part time jobs related to my degree throughout school, so I had savings to begin with."
6518,"> Most jobs have starting bonuses

I’m sorry but this isn’t true."
6519,"I moved out immediately after college (due to the pandemic I just moved back home though, so take my advice with a grain of salt). I accepted an internship position that had housing provided so I didn’t have to worry about renting an apartment. The only people I know who were able to move straight into their own independent apartment/home after college either 1) had their parents act as a guarantor (basically they sign the lease and promise to pay if you don’t, which sometimes allows you to waive the income requirement or first/last rent), 2) moved in with a friend or significant other who already had an established job and income, or 3) had an employer that helped them with their living situation like I did."
6520,"I'm in the same situation as you and I really don't get it. I'm blessed with understanding parents and even if it's not socially acceptable to live with your parents at 25, I'd prefer to save 7,000+/year in rent for a year or two while I pay of student loans than to pay rent in a crappy apartment with no savings on top of everything else I have to worry about. You do you."
6521,"All great points. My new employer offered to cover moving expenses and were generous. I didn't need them because I already lived with my partner, which is worth mentioning. 

Having two people makes it considerably easier."
6522,"I moved out of my parents home at 18, moved to college.. I spent 90% of my college life living on campus.. I started applying to jobs all over the state, got hired nearly 10hrs from home.. in the oil patch. 

I paid 1,500 for a 2bd/2bath apt, had a roommate so I split the cost.. still was very expensive. I had to choose between food or rent.. I then moved up in my career, I moved to a less expensive town ($500.00 a month for a house). I saved some money. Hated my boss, awful and mentally I was taking a toll. 

I then moved a third time, this time closer to a city, housing was very expensive, I found a house (luck, pure luck, I rented for $900.00), when that sold I bought a house for 204,000. I still didn’t have savings. 

I now live on my own, I support myself, make my mortgage, my bills, and eat. I also have savings now. I’m also working for a better boss and mentally I’m way better.

I did this without any parental help, trust fund, or much in savings. My career doesn’t allow me to ask my bosses for help. 

I had a huge driving force with me. I didn’t want to live with my parents. They were very controlling and they lived in a very rural area and didn’t offer much job prospects. I ALMOST moved in when I hit my mental breaking point with my second job. But I worked very hard and managed to avoid that.

1. If you like your family and they live in an area which works for your future, stay and save money. If they don’t, look for a place that offers reasonable housing ( may need a roommate), and good job prospects. 

2. Don’t go into debt, it’s not worth it. 

3. Don’t be scared to leave the nest. You will struggle and you will fail, don’t let those missteps hinder you. Ask for help and guidance. The world isn’t getting cheaper. 

I’m 27 and I reflect on my choices sometimes. I wish I had gone to a trade school and made moves to make more money.. but I was foolish and head strong and didn’t. My degrees will help me but it’ll be awhile before I see return on them. 

Best of luck."
6523,i graduated last summer and moved out a month later - would have moved ASAP except i had to apartment hunt first! most of my friends did the same. i think the main factor was that we all stayed in the city we went to college in so it was easier to have connections for roommates and know the geography of the city. we all had savings for deposits and moving expenses banked up from working throughout college and paid internships (i don’t think i know any of my friends that didn’t have some sort of side gig for at least two years in college.) that was definitely my saving grace
6524,"I moved far from my hometown for a job right after I finished grad school. My move itself was financed by my employer, which meant they covered a house hunting trip, a moving company and some other incidentals. I had about $1200 from my part-time employer — they had to pay out my vacation and deferred profit sharing when I left.

As for living expenses, you gotta start small. I moved in with a couple who was renting out a room in their condo and stayed with them for a few months. Then I moved into a bigger apartment with a couple of roommates. I stayed there for about two years.

In the early years of your career, your earning increases often come quickly as you gain experience. After a couple years, I could afford my own place without sacrificing my lifestyle too much, so I made the leap.

I’m still at the same job four years later and things are good. You just can’t have it all at once."
6525,"I mean, if you're willing to have roommates, it's actually pretty common and doable. If we're talking moving out and being able to live alone, that's actually more of a rarity these days. All that said, I do live in one of the more expensive rental markets in the country and moved out immediately after finishing my degree into my own studio, so it clearly is possible. Really though, it depends on a number of factors, most of which are obvious but I'll list the main ones anyways:

* Your degree/profession
* Where you'll be living (both city/region and where within said place)
* Student debt load

Personally, I'm an architect, so for the highlights in the aforementioned categories:

* most of us are  making somewhere in the mid 50s to 60s starting salary, and the salary jumps up for us pretty significantly in your early years, with the biggest raise being when you finally complete all the licensure exams (which is usually 2 to 6 years after school).
* I stayed in my college town in the northeast since there were good job prospects here, and I got a good offer comparable to what I would in NYC (where I'm originally from), but things cost less up here, expensive though they might be. Thus I'm able to save and have a nicer apartment than if I moved back
* I have 0 debt. Based my education choices on finances- went to a private university on a full scholarship, over other higher ranked but more expensive schools. And this was on top of having worked since high school and throughout college, so I actually came out of school with enough saved that I could make a down payment on my own place if I so chose, since every cent I earned after taxes went into the bank and I've always been a conservative spender

Probably the biggest factor in being able to move out was the lack of student debt. On top of that, I'm in a profession with high demand for new workers (at least pre-COVID) due to a lack of people going into it after the recession, so I started out making more than a random bachelors usually makes, although not by some absurd amount like if I got a computer science degree. And finally, as I said, I'm not some extravagant spender- I cook most of the time (have done so for years and enjoy it), don't really spend on personal items that much, my hobbies like hiking, running, weight lifting are pretty cheap to do, which frees up money to save or sink into housing.

So yeah, while my situation certainly isn't the norm, being free of debt (or having it under control) is totally doable, as is being conservative with your spending. If you have those two things taken care of, and aren't making peanuts at your job, moving out is completely doable. It's even more doable if you're willing to live with a roommate (which many people do) or if you're willing to relocate to a cheaper city or cheaper part of the city. That said, don't feel pressured to move out from your parents' house- it's common enough at this point that people won't think any the worse of you, and it is nice to have family close by at times."
6526,"So it really depends. There certainly are jobs that pay well enough to live comfortably on your own that are attainable for students immediately out of undergrad, even in places like SF, NYC, Boston, etc. Similarly, moving across the country or the world for a job isn't really different than doing that for school which a lot of people do. I'm actually kind of surprised that this part seems strange to you, by 21 most people feel comfortable enough to live on their own in my experience.

I finished undergrad in 2019, the only people I know who even stayed in their hometown were either taking a gap year before grad school or lived in NYC, Chicago or LA. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by some of the opportunities that are out there for students right out of school and how quickly you can adjust to life on your own with all the responsibilities of having your own place. Best of luck to you!"
6527,"I would say income and parental support (or lack thereof) are the biggest factors in determining if someone moves right after college or not. 

The only reason I was able to move out after college (not directly after, but a few months after) was because I got a job offer that paid enough to support my cost of living. With regards to the move or my living expenses, I didn't receive any financial help from my parents. I was able to afford it on my own. If you have the option to stay at home / move back home, I would take that if your job doesn't pay enough to support you moving out comfortably (or if you don't have a job at all). You need a job that pays enough first. Especially if you're considering moving states or cities - I would not recommend moving anywhere without securing a job. 

I moved states because my job was in another city. I liked the prospects of my job and had no other options. I had no choice. I had a few thousand in savings but not a lot. I was terrified, but moving and starting a job in the city was also a lot more exciting and appealing to me then staying in my hometown. My life would have likely been a lot more dull, and both my professional and personal growth stunted, if I stayed there. 

So I went. I was fortunately able to stay with a friend for the first couple of weeks (with a very long commute, but you do what you have to do) until I was able to secure an apartment in the city where my job was located. And the rest is history. 

It's a risk, yes, but everything in life is a risk. I had a strong feeling the job would work out, but if it didn't, I would have just moved back home, or started looking for another job in the area. As long as you're not living paycheck to paycheck, you should ideally be putting away money in savings so that if you were to lose your job, you would be able to support yourself until you get another. The risks haven't been as high for me because I would just move back with family if I absolutely had to. So taking risks didn't seem that bad because worst case scenario, I just move back. 

Now... my living situation hasn't been glamorous. You take what you can get and you make do with it. I lived in an incredibly small apartment. The majority of my friends and people I know around my age either live with their parents, live with friends, or with significant others. I would imagine the majority of young adults who have moved out need to have roommates to lower costs. You also have to manage your money well and live within your means. This may mean living pretty frugally for some people. 

> I guess I'm somewhat afraid of doing all of this - I think I need to take the best foot forward in some cases.

Acknowledge the fear and keep going. Sometimes I think being afraid of something tells us that we should be doing it. If you're afraid, and you do it anyway, you will learn and grow and overcome. You will be in a better place than you would be if you let the fear prevent you from moving forward.

Don't let fear hold you back. Don't let fear be the only reason you don't do something. You wouldn't want to look back on this time in your life and have any major regrets. Live your life. Experience all that it has to offer. Be along for the journey. You never know where it will take you."
6528,"For me, I did engineering co-ops all through college so I afforded my off-campus housing myself for the last three and a half years of school (get kicked out of dorms after 1 year at my Alma mater). I only lived at home the summer after freshman year. Then I took a job at the place I did my internship so I stayed in my college town and got a new, non-student based apartment. 

Got lucky with a low cost of living (relative to other cities) area and a high paying entry level job. Doesn’t always work out like that"

6530,"Signing bonus, and relocation reimbursement when I arrived.

It’s called the art of the negotiation."
6531,"I moved out almost immediately after college after getting a decent paying job. I had some money saved up but a big thing is I had no student loans or car payments. Other than rent and living expenses, I have no major expenses. I have roommates so that saves some money."
6532,"Saved throughout college and landed a good job right away, enough to pay rent, debt, etc. (No assistance from family or parents as well)"
6533,[deleted]
6534,"When I started going to college I purposely took summer courses. Because of this, I found a way to kind of establish my own “home”. That home had 2-3 roommates and was an apartment, but it felt like a home. I love my family, but personally think our relationships are much healthier when we don’t live together. I was able to save some money during that time, which helped some now. When I graduated in December, my (then) fiancé graduated too. We moved into a small apartment together soon after when we married. I’d say I was able to do it because I got married right away and having us both work several jobs made it possible. I couldn’t have done it if it was just me though. Also, we love in a very small and pretty old apartment complex still near the university we graduated from. Trying to relocate this summer. 

We are still looking for jobs with insurance that are full time. But, between the two of us and three jobs it’s enough to pay rent/food/gas. Our families were both gracious and allowed us to stay on their insurance for the year so we had time to find a job that provided it. (I have a few minor health issues that require insurance to take care of.) But, we admittedly had a good deal of help, especially in January. We got engaged, graduated, and had a full wedding in about two weeks. So figuring things out was pretty fast and we were lucky to have a few family members that were generous and wanted us to get on our feet. 

I’m not sure how anyone just out of college does it living alone (unless they get a great job, which is awesome for them, but I’ve had a hard time finding), but in my experience roommates help a lot with all the bills (rent, internet, utilities, etc) except insurance."
6535,"The college experience is worth it to me. When I finish school, I'll only have 15k in debt. Worth it."
6536,You're right! I forgot but yeah definitely people move in with their significant others after college which makes the transition easier financially if they both have income.
6537,"I’m in college and have already been paying for off campus housing anyway, so not much will change after I graduate. I’ll just continue to rent an apartment. 

Also, a good amount of people are fortunate enough to have $50K+ starting salaries, and paying for your living expenses is fairly easy in those circumstances. 

But for what it’s worth, I would love to be able to live at home and save my money if I had that option."
6538,"I moved out immediately after graduating. Took a short trip before starting my job in a totally different city. My salary and low cost of living enabled that. Some friends have parents that will help pay rent in very high CoL situations, most from my highschool live at home, and most of my college friends moved out. I’m jealous of those living from home. You save a lot that way, and time investing that cash or working on you is valuable."
6539,"I took out extra student loans since the most likely jobs were in a very high cost of living area or require an expensive move. 10k of my debt was in the form of a large savings fund and moving costs. When doing the math, I figured that even a few thousand in extra interest payments more than offset the costs of additional moves or staying put for up to a year at a much lower pay, or otherwise be stuck in a bad situation. 

The rainy day savings saved my butt. It wasn't a bad job, but they needed me less than I expected so fewer hours. It went under within 5 months and it took 2 months to land another. My rainy day fund bailed me out since I could live on it for the duration to find a new job.

A few other friends ended up in very bad situations since they made the jump without a rainy day fund. One made a large move, got fired in weeks, ended up moving to the next job that hired him. It was a town with a thousand people hours from anything and ended up stuck there for several years. Many others came back home eventually when things didn't work and took a few years to leave again."
6540,It’s a lot of fun and the sign up process was surprisingly easy. I’ve even been able to professionally network...you never know who’s gonna sit in your back seat ubering.
6541,"If you had to estimate, how much do you have extra per month or per week to put towards travel expenses?

Are you only limiting yourself to those two areas or are you willing to move further from home?

Spouse/ significant other involved?

Do you have your own transportation available?

Currently living at home, or do you have rental history?

Any savings built up?

6542,That totally sounds like something up my alley!
6543,"I'm in a similar situation, so I upvoted your post in hopes to find some helpful advice from one of our Reddit buddies. I made a similar post in r/Adulting"
6544,"Alright, lemme answer your chunks in my own chunks. 
I'll be responding back as you first said them, and as honestly as I can. 

• I currently have nothing put towards travel expenses 
• I'd like to limit myself to those two areas as I have a lot of friends and family in the DMV area, let alone VA 
• Yes, my S/O lives in Stafford, VA currently w/ no sign of moving away anytime soon (for the next 5 years or so) 
• I do. Ford Focus. 
• Living at home. No rental history. 
• Kindasorta. Have a checking account that I don't often pull from except for the bulk stuff (bills, groceries) and so have a bit in it. LMAO 
• Well, I just put this post over to them, too."
6545,I do Wag. It’s a dog walking service. I’m not sure how it is in smaller towns but I make some solid extra money off of it.
6546,Uber isn’t worth doing - in the long run you make very little money and rack up miles quickly on your car
6547,"As others have already suggested, I believe in order to move as you are suggesting, you need to restructure your financial situation and possibly pick up another source of income. Serving, Uber, or even looking for odd jobs in the paper can be a good place to start.

Either way, focus on cutting out any unnecessary expenditures and start saving up for a security deposit on an apartment or whatever you decide to move into. You can find 1 bedroom apartments in both of those areas for around $700, but keep in mind once you commit, thats another bill you need to take care of that you haven’t before.

Simply taking the time to plan out what you are going to buy at the grocery store, canceling a Netflix subscription, taking your bike to work, or not eating out as much can all aid in the process of saving up in the long run.

Hopefully this gets you in the right mindset at least. Don’t give up either! It might take a little longer than you expected, but it is definitely attainable. 

Best of luck to you!"

6554,Find a temp agency in the town you want to work at and hit them up to find you a job.
6555,Why not Richmond? I think you might like it there. I definitely came to appreciate it after living in other cities for months.
6556,"Virginia Beach will be much easier to move out into than Ffx County or most of NOVA. I live in Arlington and work in Fairfax, really tough finding housing for under $1000 a month. Would check out basement apartments or group houses with younger recent grads to cut down on rent. I think a lot of people are giving responses without knowing the cost of living in Northern Virginia. I’ve heard it’s a 40k salary minimum to live somewhere and also afford to eat."
6557,"Hey there, I think moving out of your hometown is a totally possible goal, but like people have said, you'll need to save up some money for the move. I teach English online to kids in China, and since you're already a substitute teacher it could be a good fit for you too. You've got a BA and you're American so you fit the requirements for the job. I make around $20 per hour, and can work on my own schedule, as much or as little as I want.

If there's limited job prospects in your area, this could be a good fit. Classes are in the early AM or at night because of China time, so you could continue being a substitute teacher, and teach English online. Save up some money, and then when you do move somewhere else, you could keep teaching online while you get yourself established with a local job.

The company I work for is called VIPKid. I highly recommend them, I've really enjoyed working for them the past 6 months. If you want to know more about it check out [this post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/dsi205/my_review_after_several_months_teaching_english/) or feel free to PM me if you have any questions. If VIPKid isn't your jam, I encourage you to look into the other online teaching companies. There's a handful of good ones! Feel free to comment or PM me about that too and I can try to lead you in the right direction."
6558,R/personalfinance can offer good tips on this. Make some money and then plan the move. Do something like Lyft or Uber if you have to
6559,"Sounds like you need to buckle down and save up some money. I would recommend saving up 3 months worth of rent/living expenses, then moving to a place that looks good to you. 

Where did you go to college? Many college towns would have good income opportunities for Uber/Lyft or food service, as well as long term opportunities for yourself. These towns also have low rent opportunities if you know where to look (think roommates, shitty houses, and areas where you have to drive 15 minutes to campus) 

It also sounds like you don’t have an extremely marketable degree, so you may want to consider getting a good masters degree, like in teaching or business.

Also I do know that some southern states with lower numbers of teachers allow just about anyone with a college degree to become a teacher, particularly in understaffed counties or school districts. 

Teaching is not a glorious gig, but you get great vacation opportunities and will provide a fat pension if you stick it out for a long time. I also guessing you are a straight male, so consider that a male teacher has many female teachers to pick from.

Furthermore, if you know some languages, you are a very valuable asset to the military!"
6560,"I floated around the idea, for quite some time now, of going back to college to get a degree in marketing, but people seem to warn me against it. I currently have a BA in German, so should I work towards an MA now?"
6561,"Depends on a. Jobs available b. Your skills. c. What temp agency you apply through d. What jobs you tell them to look for 

C and D are the most important. I applied to like 4 temp agencies, natural selection found the right one. 

Check out Robert Half."
6562,"First off, I was completely pressured into going to uni. Secondly, I didn't get just any ol' ""gender studies degree"" before you pull that Shapiro card on me. Heck, I know people who've gotten computer-based degrees (like IT) and still couldn't find a job outta college."
6563,"It really depends on your life and family goals. Are you more career or family orientated? 

Do you want to go in more debt? 

What are your current job prospects? 

Are you engaged/married? 

No offense: but I bachelors in German doesn’t really give you a lot of options other than applying for PhD programs. If you want to go to school again, go straight for the PhD. You sell your soul to the school, but you don’t have to pay for the PhD at all, which is great. 

If your heart is not in your German studies, then it might be good to go grab a MBA or something similar."

Apply there and several other schools! In the meantime I would work your ass off making as much money as possible. Get a job as a waiter or something like that at a decent restaurant, you’ll make good money that you can use as spending money while in school. 

In terms your relationship: you gotta figure out if this lady is serious and if you are. 

Don’t settle (or don’t miss out on an opportunity) for less than you want for someone else unless being with them is not settling :)

I’m 26 and I’m still fighting it lol this covid shit fucked up my ez pz job of cleaning a hospital and now I’m jobless. Always gotta know it can get worse. Life’s that 9-5 , 5 days a week with two weeks off a year for yourself."
6571,">Life’s that 9-5 , 5 days a week with two weeks off a year for yourself.

**lol**, no it isn't 

life's life, and ghouls would *love* for you to believe that you need to produce profit for them for 90% of your waking life. the sooner everyone realizes how much of a scam it is, the sooner we fix it. having less than 4 weeks of PTO isn't even true for europeans, and countries like france have a 35 hour work week. quit settling and especially quit telling other people to settle.

OP has every right to be miserable."
6572,"For some people (myself included) there is nothing more depressing than the 9-5. The fact that I have to be in an office for 8 hours a day EVERY DAY is beyond me. I got a job right after college (a good job in marketing) I lasted 9 months. I was so depressed by the end of it that I almost had to move back home. I quit and got a job somewhere else - same shit - 10 months in, wanted to bash my head in, hated coming into work.

It was like that on and off for YEARS until I finally realized that no, it doesn't have to be like this. I started freelancing (took a long ass time to make it work but it was SO SO SO worth it). Now I have complete control over my schedule, I can do what I want when I want.

Basically just trying to say that for me the 9-5 office life was/is a complete no-no, I physically and emotionally cannot stand it. Maybe you'll adapt like others do and that's awesome, but if you don't, do not worry because there are other options out there. :)"
6573,"I did 9-5 + my masters and it is not easy, you are going to make some sacrifices, but this shouldn’t mean you should quit doing activities you love. There are plenty of ways to get back to all your activities while working. It is going to take some time and patience."

6575,"I used to work like 50+ hours a week plus some weekends/evenings. I kept hopping jobs, finding places with better balance, and now I work basically 8-4 most days, and zero off hours. The other bonus was cutting my commute to under 30 minutes each way. You should look around and just find something that hopefully cuts commute time down or offers maybe going in earlier in exchange for leaving earlier in the evening. Getting home around 4:30pm versus say 6pm made a massive difference in my life even without the shorter hours generally"
6576,"It was hard for me to adjust to as well when I first got out of college, you get used to it over time. What I’ve done is plan things to do with friends during the week when you can. It helps break the week up and keeps it interesting. Also I feel better if I pick up a hobby that I can work on during the week instead of endless scrolling or netflix."
6577,"It's not that much about being tired, but during the week I straight up just don't have time. I need some time to wind down when I get home, make some food. And it's suddenly 3 hours before bed time. Go to the gym, read a few pages and the day's over. And that's if I don't have any  errands to do. 

&#x200B;

Weekends, Saturdays mornings are spent cleaning up the place. Then it's doing shit around the house. Saturday evenings are usually the only days where I feel really comfortable and I get to do enjoy things. Sundays are usually for rest. So I read a lot, watch a movie, play video games. 

&#x200B;

The main problem in all of this is just how I enjoy things. I start getting immersed into a book, I wanna read it for entire days, until I'm done. I start up a new coding project I wanna spend all my waking hours on it. I wanna fix up my garage or generally do field work outside? I wanna do that non-stop for days on end, until I get tired or the job is done. But having a job drives a wedge through this. I can only read 1-2hrs a day. A big batch of errands come up and I gotta schedule them one by one, around sundown. I feel inspired to clean up my garage or go for a drive? Gotta save it for Saturday, because the rest of the week is too busy."
6578,"The main reason I took this job was because it was in the legal field (trying to figure out if I want to attend law school down the road), but finance was obviously another reason. I actually make quite enough to be comfortable with living and putting a decent amount into savings each month, but I really do appreciate all this advice. This is definitely something I’ll keep in the back of my mind the next few months as I get into a routine and get a steady flow of income to see how much I am actually spending/saving on a monthly basis. Thank you so much for your encouragement. I really appreciate it."
6579,That’s how it’s been for decades lol what’s your advice? Don’t be miserable lol yeah dude that works I never thought of that
6580,It gets easier. Especially with the activities you mentioned liking doing. If you had mostly outside hobbies it'd probably be harder with how early it gets dark.
6581,this is exactly what i fear most
6582,"Thank you so much! It’s definitely a period of adjustment and transition. Honestly, everything has happened so quickly this is the first time I’ve been able to come home and sit down and breathe. I think that was overwhelming, because for so long my goal was “get a job in a new city, move out, be on my own”—well, here I am now. Time to start a new goal! Thanks again. I really appreciate your support."
6583,"Didn't get easier for me, after 2 years. I'd say it's slowly getting worse. Having to budget time when doing things that i like, but wasting just shy of 50 hrs/week for work. And i like my job. Flexible work hours, challenging enough, fun coworkers. And I'm slowly just losing interest in hobbies, because i don't get to do them when I'm inspired to. My friends are also getting jobs and it takes weeks to coordinate a drink."

6588,True! I am working on trying to get up by 7 and be at work by 8:30 so I can be home by 4:30. I definitely agree that getting home at 4:30 versus 6 is a total game changer. Thank you for your advice!

Also be sure to take a few 3 day weekends every now and then. The stretch from Presidents’ Day (mid Feb) to Memorial Day (end of May) is brutal without a day off. Memorial to July 4th isn’t that bad. July 4th to Labor Day can be tough. Labor Day to Thanksgiving is rough and I decided to take a 3 day weekend for camping in end of October."

6592,Is it because you're tired? What about weekends? What do you do before/after work?
6593,"Yeah, I get what you mean. My personal solution to that has just been to break it all up. I know it's tempting to do it all at once but that's what works for me. Even without work, I have to sleep which can break my flow of activities I enjoy that may take a lot of time. I've made sleeping a necessity for health, memory (for learning Spanish), brainstorming (for coding projects), and taking time to slow down and process and review information (for reading). Some of those things happen while I'm falling asleep. Others while sleeping."

Then I stopped school and social gatherings to take care of my dad with early onset dementia. All those new people left me in the dust, this cost a few years and I don’t remember them well. 

After that, I returned and finished school at 26. From here I found a job, relearned how to be social, discovered dancing and met friends and inspirations through the art. As this was working in progress Covid happened and stopped all that progress I had made.

Showed up at the Cleveland Museum of Art in a suit (or as it’s known in the film, the atrium of Shield Headquaters). Just reacted to some [breaking glass at the end of this scene](https://youtu.be/jqIBGEcKhGs). In the film Chris Evans is there, but he was not there when I shot it. They combined some shots/used some editing to show him hitting the ground, I think.

6616,"graduated college last year at 22 (went abroad twice in college). worked a restaurant job till december 2019, then went to new zealand for 3 months but had to return to the states in late march due to covid. now i’m living with my parents with a shitty gift shop job in my hometown. i go hiking often, probably about 3 times a week on average. it gives me more joy than anything else. really hoping to get a job in my field of interest (environmental studies / ecology) and move to oregon at some point, and also to travel extensively after the pandemic is under control & restrictions are lifted. 

my goals include; a multi-month eastern europe trip, a multi-month south-eastern asia trip, teaching english abroad (probably in france, as french is my second language), obtaining a research-based job, moving to either oregon or washington & more"

6624,"I was in a rural village teaching english. But like many other peace corps volunteers I ended up doing a couple of odd projects which for me varied from helping out with a judo class to helping build a startup. 

The village and its people were wonderful but hey the material realities were hard, the political situation was hard, the dynamics within the peace corps too are hard. Learning a new language and culture is hard and frustrating for all involved. I feel bad for the school I initially worked at since I was definitely more trouble than I was worth initially."
6625,Basically the exact truth. 40 Hour workweek vs 20-30 hour schoolweek.
6626,"Lol I was an art history major. Also a lot of work, which people don't realise, but I was working 35 hours a week on top of that."
6627,Anyone got any tips for having more time after school?

As far as money, yeah I have a larger income now. But in college I had a scholarship that was covering everything, so I pocketed every cent that didn't go to taxes. Now rent is a thing..."
6634,"Plus organizations and part time work which is basically needed for most students for money and looking good for full time jobs. Possibly more hours depending on how hard or time consuming course work is.

After college if you’re not making enough or depending on career path the additional job(s) is necessary. Organizations would be like a hobby imo in addition to actual hobbies."
6635,"Gotta be efficient with unavoidable stuff like errands. I usually cook half a weeks worth of meals in my crock pot on Sunday evening so I don’t have to worry about getting home every night to start cooking; I just heat up a plate I made. If traffic is bad where you live and your commute is long, see if your company is ok with you maybe starting half an hour earlier and leaving half an hour later so you can miss a little bit of that traffic. Honestly, also using amazon to buy stuff really cuts down on the time on weekends/evenings that I have to make trips to various stores"
6636,"Eh, when I didn't have to work full time in school, I had plenty of time to screw around and still had decent grades while studying mechanical engineering."
6637,"I have an engineering degree, and I'm with OP.  When I was in school, I had time to hang out with friends, go rock climbing, chill out at home, and do other stuff I actually wanted to do.  When I entered the world of work, there went all my free time.  I had pretty much no time during the week to do anything, and then when the weekend came around, I was too damn tired to do anything except rest.  That's another thing to, in college I actually had energy, working a desk job where you stare into a computer all day seriously wears you out like nothing else."
6638,Yea I think some ppl are born naturally good at math problems
6639,It’s been the exact opposite for me. In college I probably do 80 hours of school+work each week. During summer internships I had SO much free time.
6640,"Mine is more like:

College: no money, more time

After college: no money, no time 😞

After adding in living expenses it is exactly like that..."

6642,"I'm out of work at the moment, but at my last job I worked 40 hrs, I worked for a company that was a private contractor for the government, so they couldn't work us more than 40 hrs, but I had a 1 hour commute both ways.  Prior to that I was working at a place that was closer to where I lived, but I typically worked 50-60 hours per week.  But even working 40 hours per week with a short commute, I feel like I have no time to do anything but work.  It's especially bad if you want to have any kind of workout routine, because it feels like all you have time to do outside of work is one thing.  I just don't get how people work full time, do chores around the house, cook meals, etc, and still have time to do things outside of work.  I just don't feel like I can enjoy life doing the 9-5 thing, I'm either at work (which was more boring than watching paint dry), or I'm too tired to do anything else.  Yeah, as an engineering major I had a lot of work I had to do outside of class, but there was at least flexibility on when I could get it done, and I could manage my time and do things I wanted to do (plus it was actually an intellectual challenge, unlike my jobs)."

6645,how many hours/wk do you work?
6646,"I know this wasn't the main point of your post, but in response to your edit, if your therapist isn't helping, get a different therapist. I've had a couple different therapists myself and am in training to be one as well, and to me it sounds like whoever you're seeing is not particularly effective in their job. They should be helping you analyze your thought process and teaching you coping strategies or something along those lines. If they're not doing that, find someone else."
6647,"I usually speak to them at least once a day I’m some fashion, usually a family group chat. Call them when I want and when we’re all able to. I do try to get a schedule made of the visits, but we don’t always know how far ahead of time we’ll all know. So it can be a few weeks without a set date"
6648,"I had a similar situation. Had an incredible job lined up in a new city as I was graduating. I experienced the same things you are currently experiencing.

After a year I left. Moved back home, got a job, and am saving thousands upon thousands every few months. I ski all the time. Friends are here. I’m happy again. 

That’s the route I took. It’s not the end of the world if you leave your job."
6649,">	They should be helping you analyze your thought process and teaching you coping strategies

My current one does seem to try, but I feel like someone can do it better. Not 100% sure since this person has been my only therapist since college. My next appointment isn’t until after the new year, so I’ll try and ask then. Not sure how, or how they’ll take it, but I think it’s worth a shot."
6650,"you're not dim, please don't think that. i left it quite vague on purpose.

by realigning, i mean looking at your values and seeing what really matters. take that as you will."
6651,"You are ultimately responsible for your own happiness so you need to figure out what makes you happy. If you’re unhappy you need to figure out why that is and what you can do to change it. I don’t mean to sound unempathetic, have faith in yourself to take your life where you want and that there’s no rush. You’re creating your own problems without realizing it, the good news is that you have the power to change it. You just don’t realize it yet."
6652,"I'm sorry to hear that man. I graduated last April, and also moved right near my alma mater, both because I had a job lined up doing quite literally what I wanted to do when I went to school and because my girlfriend lives in the city (we met while I was doing my thesis). There are plenty of times when I question if I should've moved back home, since I like NYC better than the city I moved to, and while I was in college I was always waiting to go back. But, I always try to look at the silver lining. I'm doing what I wanted to when I went to school for a living, my apartment is nicer and my dollar goes farther here than back in NYC (amazingly), and admittedly, every time I visit home friends are moving away, and those who stay seem not to be doing to great and in some respects are just trying to perpetuate our high school existence. Part of me has grown to feel it was the right thing for me to leave home; I might not be in the right city to do that, and certainly have no intentions of living here indefinitely, but being away from home, now on a more permanent basis, certainly has felt like a growing experience. 

Also, I've dealt with the anxiety and your thoughts about quitting constantly while I was in college, because I was absolutely miserable for a good chunk of school, and wound up in therapy because of it. I just wouldn't sleep for days on end due to insomnia (on top of the sleepless nights demanded by my degree), had no interest in seeing people, skipping meals because I just wasn't hungry or felt like I couldn't hold much food down. You need to remember that therapists are people too, and therapy takes a long time and isn't a panacea for everything. I switched therapists because the reality is that not every therapist is a good one (from an objective standpoint), or, more specifically, a good match. Switching helped, and the other big thing I found was making substantial enough changes in my life where I had to focus at the task at hand instead of whatever was troubling me really got me out of my funk, which lasted a few years and was existentially driven with this feeling I had no way out and was being worked to death. For me, it was going overseas to study, since just the strangeness of being in a new environment and learning to cope forced me out of my gloom. Too much on a day to day basis to focus on for me to think about homesickness and the like. 

In your shoes, maybe the fact that you're where you went to school and in a familiar environment is driving this. You don't have to focus on building a new life and new connections as much, which gives you more time to dwell on homesickness. Aside from therapy, have you considered maybe finding an apartment in a new area of the city (assuming your job is set in stone)? It would be a compromise with. your girlfriend, let you keep your job, and might be just enough of a break mentally to get you thinking differently. I know once I graduated, I tried finding a part of the city devoid of students but close to work; if I'm going to be here, I want at least some change in life experience. Then I kinda used it as a base camp, and with my girlfriend's help, forced myself to do things I never had the chance to experience because of my workload in school. If you're unable to change your environment, at least try to see it in a different light so it doesn't feel so much like a prison, but rather a new chapter in your life, ready for exploration and learning. Getting new sensory input for me is what keeps me from getting too homesick and from receding into the realm where I'm trapped with my own thoughts and start getting that sinking feeling."
6653,"If it's an issue of being away from your emotionally-closest social circle, what do accomplishments matter?"
6654,"I have strongly considered leaving my current one in attempts to find something closer to all of my family (even though leaving the job before 2 years are over means I have to pay back my signing bonus (which I refuse to spend until that time is up just in case something happens)). But with my girlfriend, it’s near impossible to consider that option because I have to also consider her in that. It’s difficult and almost always shot down when I mention it"
6655,"I’m only about 40 minutes from my Alma mater. But that I turn is about 3.5 hours from them. So not really any further than it was for the past 4 years. 

And I’ll look at meetup and others like it. Despite still being near a lot of my friends, I do tend to feel like I don’t have any sometimes."
6656,What’s your job? Can you identify the source of your anxiety attacks?
6657,"Same boat here man, same boat."
6658,"Ah your post sums up exactly where I was 10 years ago. I stayed around my alma mater and was with a boyfriend at the time, but feeling really isolated from my family who were 500 miles away and also dreading my work life. After Christmas vacation visiting my fam, I cried all the way back home. In the end, I moved back to my hometown and felt immense relief for a while having my support system back. But I still wonder if I could have made it work there somehow. In your situation, having a girlfriend who cannot move is probably the hardest part to figure out. I personally don’t think there is anything wrong with needing your family around you at certain points in your life. 

It could be that you feel disconnected from your work and not sure that you are on the right path professionally as well; that can take a huge toll on your mental health. 

Even if you were somehow able to take a few weeks to see your fam and recharge, maybe figure out what you want the most. 

Mainly just know that you are probably in the hardest stage/ transition for many people, including myself. And that there is no shame in needing your support system right now outside of your significant other."
6659,"Honestly this is what I’m most worried about after school, so your emotions are completely understandable. I hope you find a way to overcome this, it sounds difficult, but I guarantee you there is a way. Transitions have always fucked me up emotionally but in the end things always settle in nicely. You have someone you love nearby in your life and that is an amazing thing. I hope I can preserve that once school ends."
6660,"Thank you. My girlfriend says the same thing; to look at the good and focus on that more instead of the negatives. 

I tend to be a little dim sometimes. What do you mean by realigning?"
6661,"That’s all incredible advice. I do try my best to think about everything as new chapter, and it certainly helps and makes me optimistic. There are days where it’s harder than others, but I still try. My girlfriend and I were looking at moving somewhere closer to my work, and consequently closer to most of our friends in the city, which could be a nice change of scenery. I’m still trying to find new things to broaden my horizons, hobbies and such. No idea where to really start, but I definitely want to try and do that to help fill some time."
6662,"I work as a software engineer. Mostly under the scene type work, being moved into DevOps style tasks (even though I’m not a huge fan of it lol). 

As for a source, I can’t really be sure. My initial gut thought is that I just want to live with them again. Life is easy with them. I don’t have to worry about the stresses of work or bills or any of that stuff life throws at you. It sounds like I’m just lazy and don’t want to “do life,” so I hate giving that answer. But with that, I understand they still work, so it’s not the same as visiting during. And moving closer may not be the answer either. 

It could also be that I miss and enjoy just being around people and my family in general. For the introvert that I am, I miss socializing with people at college and home and I don’t really get to do that at work with the position I’m currently in (nor do I see how my career path of CS can lead to something like that)"
6663,">	What do you already like doing? That's a good start for you to go from.

I personally like games, video and board, and absolutely love building things. Woodworking, electronics, and what not. I also want to try new things that might help keep me active. But I honestly have no idea where to start; where to find these meetups. Are they usually posted to Facebook publicly? That seems sensible, but I don’t really know how to search for these specific public events on Facebook.

Someone said meetup itself is actually a site/service. I take it that’s what you mean?"
6664,"Oh nice. I'm an architect so I tend to do similar things like woodworking and crafting, aside from also being into gaming. 

I do literally mean the site ""meetup."" I also do find those kinds of events posted on Facebook all the time. I know the city I live in has some events calendars you can subscribe to, some which are specific to millennials. For the gaming, there are a number of arcade and board game bars where I live where you can join weekly things, kinda their equivalent to ""bar trivia"" if you're looking to play Smash Bros, Catan, or Risk with a group of people. Another good place is if there are local universities, you can usually find stuff going on through them that's open to the public. Being in a big college town, I'm able to go to lectures and museums whenever I like. And since you're where your alma mater is, also subscribe to some of the alumni events; my uni's held bowling nights, aquarium nights, and movie nights for recent alumni of my year or my program for those of us that ultimately stayed in the city. I also still get access to the architecture school's shop with all its saws and lathing equipment if I feel like going and doing projects; I know my school, and several others in the area, allow the general public to get memberships to use their facilities or take crafting classes as a ""cap and gown"" courtesy. Try tapping into any institutional resources you can find where you live- universities, museums, adult centers, public library system, gyms. Those are the easiest ways of getting connected."
6665,"Wow, interesting. I'm in school and i dream of moving far away from everyone for a clean start."
6666,"Hmm I don’t relate to how you feel, I’m literally the complete opposite. I see my parents 2 times a year and any more than that would drive me nuts. I’ve been living in large cities with my college friends ever since graduation and it’s been great. I think you just have to find a new support system and make new friends in your local area. Career/life will take you to many places and you’re not going to grow if you just stay by family all the time."
6667,"My girlfriend is like this. While she changes her mind frequently, she wants to move far away from her family depending on what's been happening with them. I guess it's all a matter of how people are raised and their environment."
6668,They are a professional and should be used to this. Psychology is complex and sometimes the client doesn't do well with a certain therapist. It is just the way things are!
6669,"I think the ""finding new things"" part has been the most difficult for me. Without my girlfriend, I'd pretty quickly fall into routine of going to the same places, do the same things, have the same people around, etc.., until I suddenly get to that point where I feel I need a shake up, and then would do something radically different like try moving to a different state (or country as was the case in college). And much as it is good to have some sense of stability, constantly bombarding yourself with new experiences, even if they're small, breaks up the monotony and that dread you have when you're like ""this is going to be my entire life.""

 What do you already like doing? That's a good start for you to go from. I know in my life there are meetups if I want to play multi player video games in my city, and since I'm really into running and weight lifting, one of my girlfriend's friends was bugging me about joining running clubs with her. Plenty of hiking clubs too where I live. Try what you already like as a jumping off point, and just doing it with other people. It helps make friends, and they gradually get you out and about doing other things."
6670,"From your post, did you move far from family? It sounds like you need a stronger support system. There are sites like meetup where you could meet people and form new bonds and friendships."
6671,"Don't heat the air, heat yourself. Get an electric blanket, wrap yourself when cold, lay it on a chair to make any seat heated.

~1500w for a space heater on high

~40-50w for an electric blanket on high."
6672,"Oh man, here is a horror story: we lived in Dubai for 15 months *without* AC, and as we were quite broke, we couldn't afford getting the motor replaced while the apartment we were in was changing owners (the old landlord of course didn't want to pay for it as they were on their way out). 

Trust me, a summer where the lowest it got was 36 (96 F) degrees at night with 100% humidity and days with 55 (131 F) degrees without AC is not something you want to ever experience."
6673,I grew up in Dubai: oh I really fucking know hahaha
6674,"Obviously it’s summer now so it isn’t important for a few months, but it’s also really easy to save on your heating costs by making sure your doors and windows are sealed well! You can seal them off with tape or plastic in the windows to block those pesky drafts. Additionally, keep your thermostat at a consistent moderate temp - it actually saves more money than constantly turning it on and off. Leave it at sweater weather in the house all the time."
6675,I would definitely expire without it.
6676,"I thought I had mastered the art of being a cheapskate, but I see I still have much to learn."
6677,I have problems believing that you didn’t melt.
6678,"This.

I also choose to bake more in the winter, and when I turn the oven off, I leave the door open"
6679,"Yeah, I remember when I first got my own apartment I left for work a few times in the middle of the Boston winter and forgot to turn off my heater. It was lovely coming home to a toasty apartment, but the bill- oy!

My girlfriend and I migrate between our apartments depending on the season these days- her's faces the south and is pretty much a greenhouse so it's great for the winter. I have a deck and am north facing and shaded, so I'm comfortable just cracking open a window or turning on a fan in the middle of summer."
6680,Remember to turn them off though. Those things are fire hazards.
6681,"Lol, nice 👍"
6682,Wait what? Nearly every house in Southern Ontario has air conditioning. How did that give it away? Haha. Everyone I know runs AC. It gets over 100 degrees here often in our summers.
6683,"How the heck does every house in southern ON have AC but most of SoCal doesnt?

The world continues to amaze me"
6684,Can always put more layers on.  Have to stop taking layers off at some point.
6685,"AC is a must, but during the day I can live in 78-80 degrees, but at night that shit needs to go down to 76."
6686,"Haha I’m not sure! I guess it’s unfair of me to say an absolute statement like that. However, I will say that nearly every house I pass has an AC unit of some sorts in my city when I drive by or go on my walks. Maybe I’m just in my own little bubble here but it seems like nearly everyone has it!"
6687,"Yep, this is why I only ran the A/C in limited time blocks on hot days that the fans couldn't overcome.  A/C easily doubles or more your electric bill if you run it constantly."
6688,"I do have to ask where you went to school. BS Economics degrees aren't really useless, provided you have a plan for them. People often use them as a launch point for going into finance or accounting (usually getting MBAs or getting a CPA at some point), for law school, or for PhDs and research masters if they want to work for a think tank or in academia. My girlfriend got hers from one of the seven sisters, and actually does very well at a big finance firm these days (she did a dual degree with psychology, although the value of that degree is questionable). Now if you went to some no name school with a 95% acceptance rate, well yeah, then that might be useless, but even then, as I said, you need a plan.

And yes, it is a tough job market (now more than ever), compounding what has been the case for a while for many millennials. Most of us unfortunately aren't using our degrees, and ultimately just settle for jobs outside our field. In your shoes I would've settled for just a job to pay the bills a while ago and then kept up the job search for an opportunity in my field.

With this, where are you applying for work? I know many of my peers when we graduated architecture school were insistent upon only working for top firms with big name recognition- well yes, that's all high and mighty, but what do you have to show for yourself? We went to a good school, but pulling B's throughout it and then expecting good money at a top workplace is just stupid. And big surprise, said folks are unemployed right now. Even with folks who graduate from the Ivies since I deal with a lot of them where I live- one of my professors would always say, ""look, 200 people graduate from Harvard's program every year. And under good hiring circumstances there are far fewer than 200 entry level jobs in academia and the top 20 firms in our region combined. And no, just having a degree from there doesn't put you first in line if you were struggling to graduate."" You do need realistic expectations for where you can work, given a frank assessment of your skills. Not saying this is your issue, but can't tell since I don't know you.

Finally, how do you interview? For all I know, you just don't interview particularly well. Have you been asking your interviewers about how you interviewed, in such cases as they turned you down? Many will try helping you out with a frank perspective on it- recruiters are still human, and people in the same industry build camaraderie. I've had interviews where the interviewer would tell me my goals were misaligned with the office and to think about that, but that they do know offices that I'd probably like and they could connect me to given what I was saying. Don't view your interviewer as a separate class of person- it takes the pressure off of you and will help you in soliciting feedback."
6689,"Yeah, that's what I'll have to do. The only thing keeping me afloat right now is my little nest egg I accumulated working my old after college. I guess I could try contacting  my old job, but they've had to let people go."
6690,"Alright so I'd rather not say, but like you said - the college I went to is a rather ""generic"" college (I guess you could say?) with a high acceptance rate. Not a horrible school but not a really prestigious one either.

I've been applying to banks, marketing firms, and really, anything I feel as though I'm capable of doing. Personal bankers, logistic coordinators, sourcing coordinators, etc.  There are a variety of fields that interest me - logistics, import/export, banking, sourcing, etc. I've had a few interviews with logistic firms and banks, but in the end I believe I'm shot down due to my lack of experience. I've been practicing mock interviewing for months, I've also made a word document of possible interview questions (I'm thinking around 4 dozen?), so I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place."
6691,"The only thing that stands out to me as a red flag is your reluctance to accept temp jobs. Don't you realize that this is a way to get experience? Any office/admin would be a great way to get started and should be fairly easy to get in normal circumstances. 

Also, you said in another comment you are applying to bank jobs, but have you considered applying to be a bank teller? It's not a glamorous job but hello, it gets you pretty relevant experience and an in with a bank. You could progress from there. At least it's better than being unemployed I would think.

I'm graduating soon and planning on taking anything I can get my hands on, temp or even voluntary, and hoping that I can get something full-time within 3-6 months (if I'm lucky)."
6692,"Eh, I mean it depends. Not knowing the school, I really have no clue. Some schools have higher acceptance rates and are modest, but are regional hubs for recruitment. Like how I grew up in NYC- I knew plenty of people who were going to SUNY Oneonta, SUNY Fredonia, etc. They're not super well known outside NY state, and have high acceptance rates. People wound eventually find jobs though- it's not like you'd look at them and be like, ""your future is over."" I'm guessing you're in a similar boat to them. What I mean with the horrible schools is if you went to a for profit college or some private school with 95% acceptance rates- lots of money but no payoff. 

As far as where you're applying, that's a pretty wide scope. It doesn't sound like you're all that targeted in your approach, which counts against you in an interview. Like when I applied for jobs, I specifically looked for places that do infrastructure type work, because that's my passion. Other people would apply only to places that do housing. I can understand a ""beggars can't be choosers"" type mentality, but offices do like a sense of purpose/focus. You're not expected to come out of school as a fully formed human and have a super linear career path, but places will expect you to have something more comprehensive than, ""oh, I took a class and we had some tasks that were similar to what I think I'll do."" Your areas of interest are a good start- it sounds like you're into more supply chain management type stuff with import/export, sourcing. Yes, lack of experience can play against you, but everything I've known from finance people (and while I'm not one, because of my gf I do spend a lot of time around those folks) is that there are low barriers to entry, and you're more so trained on the job. Interest and a desire to learn, plus good references and reasonable academics are more important than experience at entry level. 

With the interview prep, I really would suggest having someone else prep you, and soliciting outside feedback. You have no idea how many cracks you can't see when you're only doing soliloquy. It's a lot easier for people to see how you come off from an outsider's perspective. Us humans in general are terrible at introspection and accurately gauging ourselves. So no, I don't think it's ""stuck between a rock and a hard place."" Some people even go to cognitive behavioral therapy because they're having trouble with interviews for social reasons, and it never would have dawned on them had they not tried it. You really have nothing to lose it getting outside feedback on the interview part."
6693,"Hey it’s not hopeless it’s just a shit show right now, it was hard to get a good job right out of college before Spanish flu 2.0 so it’s understandable that it’s hard now. 

My previous situation doesn’t compare to yours but I was in a similar funk out of college a few years back. For one hopelessness is the enemy right now along side bitterness. When I was shit out of luck and every job app I applied to felt futile, that’s when I felt myself spiraling. You gotta keep on going because really there’s no other choice. I’d say it’s helpful to express that life is difficult, stressful, and feels hopeless because that in itself expresses that there is still some hope. Because why else express it. 

All I can say right now is that most likely you’ll one day look back at this time as some of your most defining moments. It’s in our trials in life that we figure out who we really are and what we are capable of. 

On a more practical side balance the job apps with projects, volunteer work, or blogging to show off more to companies. At worst it keeps you sane, at best when this all blows over you’ll have something to show off for what you did during this crisis while a whole lot of people will just have more Netflix shows watched."

6697,"It's decent, not really anything special tbh."
6698,"I’d like to chime in. Everything this person said is spot on. I just want to add that whoever is hiring you is worried about 1) how much value you bring to the company 2) if you fit with their company culture 3) you’re qualified for the position or at least have enough competence to learn on the job 4) is committed to the job, are u going to leave 6 months after they invested time and money into training again 5) if you’re aligned with the company’s vision/morales. 

Most of the time it’s not personal. The hiring managers are looking at tons of people. And sure, having ways to distinguish urself is a must. But at the end of the day, if u fulfill the above criteria, you’re going to be considered most of the time."
6699,"Thank you for the comment, I appreciate it. My problem is that I've always been a rather impatient person, so I suppose this whole journey is really testing it...

I'll keep trucking along. It's painful, but like you said, it has to be done."

6701,"What’s it like in other places? I have a bs in economics and had a similar story to OP. I ended up going to a coding bootcamp. Entry level jobs aren’t entry level and internships are for undergraduate students. It feels like this weird middle ground where people get trapped. Not being able to start anywhere because the barrier to entry is too high. 

Idk how people do it"
6702,Where do you live?
6703,"Jobs right now are stagnant and the economy is closed because of the CorollaVirus(not saying the real name). You are worth more than a stupid job right out of college, i'm right there with you, the sad thing is that when the job market got great, this all happened. Remember to not give into the negativity, i know it's soo easy to become negative, melancholic, hate life, give into Roping yourself, thinking that your degree is worthless, during unemployment. 

Try to remain positive even though it's difficult, remember that you are one of the lucky ones, you have a college degree. I do think that you should take a temp job, only if you need too, but you should find something small with your field of work. Remember certain things in life are temporary, it's not forever, and you graduated college, you are only 22-24, It's okay to not have life figured out by 25."
6704,Where can admin roles take you
6705,"Thank you. I'll try and find more things to do with my time, because I'm finding cabin fever is also eating me alive as well.."
6706,I'm sorry to hear that man. Even though I'm feeling completely rundown I always reel myself back in and realize many more are in worse situations.
6707,[deleted]
6708,"Honestly, anywhere depending on what you wanna do. Ive seen admins grow into data and business analysts, hop to marketing or sales, or into recruiting. It depends on how involved you get in the business, where the role is at, and how you market yourself. The key is to not stay in the role for too long. Give yourself a deadline to move into a different role. 

An admin role sure looks better on a resume than being unemployed for a year or working retail."

6710,Sadly this isn’t an option for me
6711,[deleted]
6712,"There are a few different layers/flavors here, so I'm only going to focus on the ones I feel like I can help with. 

I'd say you should absolutely give temp work a shot if there are options available for your field. I had a slump of underemployment for a bit, and temp work in my field was huge in getting me back to stable, full-time employment. It wasn't perfect, but it gave me some consistency, some connections and just the right amount of hope for finding something in the future. If nothing else, connections will be helpful. 

Secondly, is there anyone that can help you practice interviewing? Or anyone you'd be willing to do mock interviews with? It would be good to get some safe insight into what your strengths/challenges are with interviewing, whether that's potential nervousness or something else you're unaware of. 

Lastly, I agree with the person who mentioned finding the right balance of applying and working on your own projects. Hell, even finding a balance that gives you time to do something you love. Applying for jobs is a number games, sure. But quantity starts to wear you down—and that affects _everything_. Take care of yourself. Find ways to volunteer. Create a blog where you talk about topics related to your industry. Create a blog for something totally random that you care about. Keep yourself going in a way that can still look positive to people reviewing your file. 

Actually, one more thing: 14 phone screens and 7 in-person interviews actually reads as a positive to me, especially if you're applying to THAT many roles. I'd say you've got the on-paper side of this thing in a pretty solid place from that alone."
6713,"I was in a very similar position. Didn’t look for jobs before graduation, spent the next 6 months applying hundreds of positions in two countries without success etc. Luckily I got hired for a contract job in a big, decent firm, albeit with a lower salary than my peers. And that was after the <you know what> happened too, so I was pleasantly surprised.

Not sure what advice I could give you since I was just being lucky, except that you mustn’t give in to depression. It might seem hopeless, but you have to keep trying and applying. Also, have you considered temporary/contract jobs like interns and trainees? They might pay less, but they probably have a lower requirement and would still look much better on your resume than nothing."
6714,"Hey, I just want to say keep your head up. I kept a spreadsheet of all the jobs I applied to and their status whether it was pending/offered an interview/rejected. I applied to over 300 jobs. Like you I did not have an internship. It took me a long time (8 months after graduation) but I finally landed a position that i LOVE with a small company. THERE IS A JOB OUT THERE FOR YOU. i know the constant rejection hurts, especially when you’re already doing everything that people tell you to do like tailoring your applications, networking, attending job fairs. Instead of focusing on your lack of an internship, focus on the experience you DO have. I had work experience and research experience coming out of college and I focused on skills and examples from those that could translate to the workplace. The most important thing is do not give up. I went back to working retail while job searching and would come home crying because it felt like  that would be my life forever. Just keep going, keep applying, and be confident in yourself and your skills and what you can bring to a company."

If you wanna learn a new language without going to school; check LinkedIn Learning, books, or other resources to give you a base/introduction. Don't give up!"
6731,"Work on your attitude man, you can get a job with a computer engineering degree. I graduated with a few friends with that degree, none of them model students, and they found work. Look around Houston for oil and gas jobs, you’ll probably find some company that is hiring.


Don’t have a defeatist attitude, it won’t help. I understand how hard it is to find work, I’m not belittling how discouraging it is. But it is doable, you just have to apply like crazy. I had a spreadsheet my last semester (Ocean Engineering, spring 2017) of college that kept track of all the jobs I applied to. I had around 110 applications that semester. Of all that I got 3 interviews and 1 offer. It takes a lot of work but you can do it."
6732,"As great as volunteering is, if you're in a financial struggle, it will be tough to make ends meet"
6733,"I agree with your sentiment about losing the defeatist attitude, accepting the difficulty in this modern society we were placed in, and pushing onwards. I will say the fact you got only 4 positive responses (maybe not fully correct) out of 110 applications which means an engagement rate of 3.63%. 

This is what needs discussion, it’s obscene to expect humans to happily apply for roles (that consume 1/2 of your weekday waking hours) without any mandates for responses by employers. Let’s assume humans have no emotional attachment to their work and finances, which is of course false completely but removes the psychological battle associated with finding work. Each application can take approx a bare minimum 1 hour of work. Each application wants a personalized and informed cover letter which means research into the company’s mission, hiring staff, and the position itself. This means giving loyalty and devotion to an entity which does not guarantee acknowledgement of your efforts. If they chose to respond (at all) you are then given extra (unpaid) tasks. You must interview, continue researching and improving  work related skills  for that job to show your aptitude in interviews. After that (if they chose to continue contact) there must be a negotiation on your desired pay. Unfortunately if you don’t continue to act disloyal to the company that is giving you the time of day, you will be at a disadvantage in the negotiation. What this means is you must still be applying for other jobs even while in the process of being offered one. Otherwise if the company gives a lowball salary offer, you have no other offers that you can use to leverage your desired wages. Of course if you successfully negotiate without another offer, the job will be yours. Also during the interviews you have to continue researching the company culture to determine what your company-specific expectations for this role are such as regular overtime requirements, paid time off, work related expenses, etc. Some of those hidden details of the role are not displayed on job postings because once you’ve given them some loyalty, they will count on it to motivate you to perform any task you’re given in the future. 

All of this is of course assuming you got a response from an employer at all since roughly 4% will give at least positive contact.  96% of your time spent distributing monologue cover letters and a resume that is sorted into various application pools based on what artificial intelligence thinks of it. 

To OP, try to find a job a different way. Networking and well-developed social skills will get you anything you need in life. Try to meet people in the field that most interests you. If you font have the specific education to pursue something outside of your major, try applying to interdisciplinary roles. You would need a more diverse skill set but in general those types of projects/jobs are more open to hiring someone with technical aptitude in a variety of areas. Also if you’re unsatisfied with your major choice, maybe look into a masters for a different(but related field) or just maybe try learning your desired skill set online and working on projects related to it at home. Then you can make a portfolio or CV and show the employers exactly just what you are capable of. Good luck friend and Happy hunting!!"
6734,"Don’t give up hope. That degree is a great one to have because it shows you’re technically capable. 

Now build up specific dev skills. You want to be a java dev (me, mostly) then dive deep I to modern java from version 8 (super important) on. Learn spring boot. Etc. 

Wanna do front end? Learn react/angular/vue and read the ebook series “You Don’t Know JavaScript.”  

Data? Sql or another tech. 

There are many options to go from here. 

In any case, build specific skills and a collection of working code you can talk about or share (github). 

I’m a philosophy undergrad with 7 years of development experience. It was a bitch to get in. If I’d have had your degree I would have been a lot more confident then. Message me if you have more questions."

C++ is incredibly complex.  
Unless you are coding on your own and have thousands of hours coding in it and have read all the must-read books, e.g. Effective C++, you will get destroyed in interviews.  
Most embedded work is in C.  
CE work is stuff like OrCAD and VHDL.

6736,"Does your University team up with a company like Handshake? A lot of schools have deals with special job-finding programs/teams that are way better than GoDaddy etc. For instance, when I graduated from UW, they gave everyone the ability to use Handshake for 12 months after college. It showed me crazy opportunities in fields and positions I had never imagined, not to mention other places including overseas. I bet your University has given you access to something along those lines. I also wouldn't be surprised if an old professor or two volunteered to help you if you asked.


Keep your scope broad. Don't get too picky. A lot of places just want the degree, but they're hidden. Good luck! I know you can find something! People with your kind of degree tend to be super smart in my experience. 


Edit: Your post really resonates with me. My fiance also *just* got a job and she's *also* a computer engineer so I know you can do it!"
6737,"Search outside your immediate area. Maybe moving for a job that will give you some experience is worth it. I spent 2 years living in Orlando early in my career just working and gaining experience to put on my resume. It does get much easier after you have some experience. The key is just getting those first few jobs so you can prove yourself. Try to stay in your first job for at least 2 years unless something much better comes up. If you still cannot find anything, look into getting certs for for your area of expertise"

That's a load of bullshit and you know it."
6739,You could always do some cheap/quick/easy freelance work or create something on your own to show employers. When I went to college it was pounded into all the Dev students to create a product that can show off the kind of skills you have. This was on top of having internships.
6740,"Look into defense and simulation companies. They all love computer engineers because they need C++ for their real time applications. 

And I know this is a very daunting time for you but don’t give up and stop comparing yourself to others. Once you land that entry level job, no one cares what you did in the past. Finish that project, and keep applying to as many companies in whatever locations as possible and I know you’ll definitely land something."
6741,"I have felt every single one of these feelings since May.

That feeling that, all of a sudden, thrown into the 'real world,' we are totally incompetent and have no chance to make it against all of these super dedicated, career-driven, badass people is a very real, very powerful feeling. However, it is just that; a feeling.

There is no magic bullet. You just have to keep applying to job openings that you are qualified or almost qualified for. Focus on your strengths and how they specifically apply to that specific job you are applying for. 

Know that it will be over. I JUST got a job that starts in December 2nd.

Of course it's harder for me because I'm deaf and disabled, so my situation might be a little more dramatic.

Build a good resume, you don't need a gimmicky one with all those like meter bars and icons and everything, a simple nice looking one that a recruiter can quickly figure out what your main skills are is a great resume. Last thing, if you live in an area with a lack of SWE jobs, you're going to have to look at different cities. There is a huge demand for SWE jobs, you won't have too hard of a time."
6755,I applied for over 500 jobs after college and after the run around from every single one I finally went to a temp agency. It’s a foot in the door to some great companies.
6756,"u/Wlpxx7 has a point. I'm going to lay out how I did it so that everyone (plus the OP u/N7ASWCC) can benefit. 

I finished college with a History BA (I'm US-based) in May 2010. Long time ago! I worked at a grocery store for a week before landing an internship that paid $20 per hour. (It was an art museum connected to a re-enactment museum. Two entities, one staff. So one museum paid me $10/hour and the other followed suit. Nonprofits are....weird.)

Lived at home and saved money. Finally moved out January 2011. Landed a job working 4:30-9 PM three days a week and 9 AM-noon every other Saturday. Started volunteering with a soup kitchen every Sunday. 

This was nice because this soup kitchen made everything fresh and it was all vegetarian. We volunteers ate alongside the guests. Sometimes we could take food home too. Really helped cut down my food costs. 

Made friends there too, both among the volunteers and among the guests. You see someone homeless on the street and you might think ""they are different from me, I could never be like that."" Frankly homelessness can happen to anyone. Helped open my eyes. 

Some other volunteers were LGBT and they traveled to the New York state capitol to campaign for marriage equality. I was invited along because I'm a cranky progressive who speaks well. The bill passed and I made friends with a local politician from the city I was living in. He eventually wrote me a recommendation for grad school. 

Few months after that my workplace flooded and the building got condemned. No more work for me! Eventually took a manual labor job doing flood cleanup, then got into a full-time receptionist position. Still had my Sundays free for the soup kitchen but I did have to cut back on my LGBT/sex education volunteering. 

Overall it took about 16-18 months, but between steady-ish pay, references from my college professors and that city councilman, and a resume bolstered by my volunteering (eventually started to run the soup kitchen and did some long-term planning) I got into grad school. 

Looking back I am thankful. I'm a white man, straight, cisgender. Before I left home I could count the black people I knew on one hand and still had fingers left over for the LGBT people I knew. Had never been to a protest. That all changed in those 18 months and I'm better for it."
6757,"I think I’d find it more enjoyable if my company wasn’t complete garbage. They outsource and fire without warning and have been know to scam customers. But it’s completely easy and I watch YouTube all day. In some ways it’s almost too good. There’s no challenge and I’m not growing, but I have no skills right out of college so I’m basically stuck doing this or going back to being a barista. And my god I don’t wanna go back to that shit, so I stay working at this awful company doing meaningless soul sucking work"
6758,"I love my job and I love doing my job. You need to find a job you like. If you’re hoping to be sick so you don’t have to go in every day, then you need to find a new job."
6759,"Not even a little bit. Work fucking sucks. People who claim they love it are actually tricking themselves. It might be tolerable if we lived under a system where the workers who make all the profit for the people up top were actually cared for even a tiny bit but no we can’t even have that. Fuck work, this shit sucks."
6760,"Truth be told, I hate working, with a passion.


You can go on with that energy, and get more bitter, but my alternative has been pursuing passions.


I get to travel (not lately but I mean...), I build models, hike, trivia. My money goes back to enjoying those things. Doing that keeps me sane.


Find your passion, and the work becomes less of a hassle."
6761,I think these things take time. We can’t have everything we want all at once. Entry level positions are all paper pushing roles. You’ll keep working with new people and making friends in the industry and working your way up with time.
6762,"OP, be careful with this. While this person has found a job that they’d do for free, it is not common, and people can waste decades if not a lifetime bouncing around trying to find a job they love only to realize there may not be one. For a ton of people, work sucks. The game is figuring out how to navigate that. Usually it’s a combination of things. Find something *less sucky*; try many hobbies, travel, tend relationships, or even suffer and save enough to retire early. 

Point is, if you are like most people, you probably won’t be able to get paid for your passion. But that doesn’t mean you have to quit. Passion can be developed. It gets better but it never gets perfect."
6763,"It really depends on geography. Move to a large city and the non profit jobs will open up more. Move to DC or New York and you’ll find whole job boards for non profit work. My advice, live where the jobs are and you’ll find opportunities. There’s never a good time to jump in, so start applying. My friend went from college to walmart(pandemic) to federal work just by living in DC. Now the transition to nonprofit work would be easy for her if she wanted."
6764,I don’t know one person in my life who genuinely enjoys their job. I honestly am pretty sure you’re supposed to spend at least 40 hours a week hating your existence.
6765,"You don’t have to passionate about your job to not hate it. If you can find a job that you enjoy and don’t want to ditch all the time, I’d stick with it. You should always have healthy boundaries when it comes to your job. And I wouldn’t do my job for free. I’m not working without pay."
6766,"No. It’s for money. How could I afford steam games, cute clothes and partying otherwise?"
6767,"Depends on what you do, the company you work for, and your relationship with your coworkers, can make a job great."

6770,Yes.
6771,Completely agree. One of the things I wish I’d known a lot sooner was to have better expectations for job satisfaction. Doesn’t have to be hell but it will never be heaven. And some people just don’t want to work in the traditional sense. They’re not lazy—“work” just doesn’t work for everyone. It sucks. So it’s a game of finding the best set of compromises we can.

6778,I like working a lot but have a very flexible schedule and I like working because I have flexibility to do other things too

6780,I love my job but I hate what I do. I work with awesome people that makes everything worth while. Also it's a government job so I don't have a boss breathing down my neck.
6781,Yes
6782,Work is just a means to money so you can do things you like.
6783,You need to find a job that does good for yourself and others. That purpose will drive you since you stay connected with how doing that job helps others.
6784,"I liked my job before I got forced to work from home due to Covid. I didn’t always like everything about it, but I love my coworkers and enjoy the analytical aspects of my work enough to overcompensate for the rest. For better or for worse (worse usually lately) I’ve always had that Protestant work ethic influence that also just leads me to derive a lot of satisfaction from putting forth an honest effort to produce something."
6785,I too hate working but I also feel unfulfilled in my current job so that doesn’t help haha
6786,"I’ve been out of college and working for 8 years now. I’m not sure how people continue the grind day in and day out until age 65. No thank you. I recommend checking out “Your Money or Your Life”. It has put me on the path for FIRE, 6 more years to go!"
6787,"Um your body is telling you it can’t handle what you’re trying to force on it. You might have adrenal fatigue or other hormonal issues or even depression (even if you don’t consciously recognize it). Our body runs off sleep, healthy eating/nutrients, moderate exercise, and water. Cut back on the studying, take more time for yourself, and shift your routine. The way you want to do things isn’t sustainable or healthy."

6789,"I graduated in May and was burning the candle at both ends my entire college career, juggling a full time job with full time school, plus I had a drinking problem that occupied any free time I got. When I graduated, I was just working full time, really crappy hours because I was bartending. I’d get home from work at 4am and be up til sunrise, sleep til 3pm, repeat. It was so unhealthy. I quit drinking and got out of the bartending scene. Now I’m just focusing on moving forward with my degree, but my sleep is still messed up. I can’t seem to wake up before 8am no matter how early I fall asleep. It’s going to take some adjustment. The older I get the harder it is. I’m trying to train myself now before it becomes a serious problem. Best of luck to you"
6790,"I feel this. I just graduated, MBA, perfect 4.0, I got 100% on everything I did, 🥵. I used to do the same thing and ended up the same way. Adrenal fatigue is a real thing. You’re doing the right thing by asking for help! 

You need to learn how to boundary set within yourself for moderation, you need a vacation, and you need to get a therapist to discuss schedule making with/life goals/long term sustainability! 

I didn’t know boundaries around myself, and am used to learning, working, achieving nonstop. 
Learning that people actually use calendars and tools to help them succeed and not remember everything all the time was crazy to me. 
I used to always have a constant schedule running where should I be, what should I be doing. 

Instead, now I’m much more capable of being in the moment, less constant planning and more focused because of it. 
It super makes a difference!! 

Your life will be back to happiness and you will feel a comfortable maintainable constant achievable success. 

Sooo doing therapy and learning how to deal with these things much like we learned how to do everything else in life is much more sustainable. 
Look at learning yourself like a fun little project. 
It takes a lot of work to realize you’re human, but you are. Take care of you and stop being so hard on yourself. Look at your accomplishments and be proud of who you are. Take one step at a time! You got this."
6791,"I personally found it easier to manage doing lots of work in school because for one, I’m going to class and learning things I enjoy learning, working towards something that I am passionate about. You also get to decide when you want to work on what and spend the time you want to do so. 

I find that working at a job really burns you out. One reason is because you’re on someone else’s schedule, not your own. You don’t have the freedom to do what you’d like when you’d like to, so you end up tired and unsatisfied. At a job you aren’t learning as much information, especially after you’re trained and get used to the job. 

I’m in the same place right now, trying to study for the GRE but work just drains me, making it difficult. Try to think bigger and more positively realize all that can come out of that. You also have to give yourself time to rest and relax and remember why it is you’re doing all of this in the first place.

I wish you luck!"

6793,"Thank you for the reply. Any advice for finding things that one enjoys? In college, I ostensibly did volunteer things that could have appeared to be fun, but I did it for a med school app and didn’t actually enjoy any of it. 

I genuinely used to enjoy late nights in the library, when everything slowly goes quiet, and the nicest cubicles became available and as the hours go on one somehow never gets tired."
6794,Answered your own question there buddy. Best of luck.
6795,Any tips as to how to get unburned?
6796,"Trial and error. Maybe reading is the thing you like. Try going the park, library, etc and hanging out and reading. 

Try going to the gym. Get classpass and try a bunch of new gyms. 

Try something creative.

6798,"It tends to be the rule rather than the exception that people in their 20s and even 30s really don't know what to do. I'm grateful in that I focused in on a professional career path in my teens and was able to go straight for masters and get a job in exactly the speciality I wanted in my field, but even then, I still have no clue what the future holds for me and what my 30s will look like.

What I can say in cases like this though is that it's good to have someone significantly older- a family member, older colleague, former professor, etc. to mentor you or simply talk to you and help you find what path seems desirable and how to execute it. A third person perspective is always useful, and someone who has intimate knowledge of your trajectory can often give you insights you wouldn't find otherwise. There is something to be said for being deferential and seeking out the advice of those wiser and older than ourselves. Find someone in that category whom you trust and can talk to as a start"

6800,I’m 30. Lol yeah dude I don’t really have a “life’s purpose” much beyond my accumulation of wealth  and enjoying a cushy middle class lifestyle. That’s been working out for me.
6801,Good post.  I needed that.
6802,Does anyone? It feels like people just settle down and focus on other matters. Life gives so many potential choices that I doubt I’ll ever know.

6805,I mean we should probably know what you've been doing since graduating 4 years ago before we answer lol
6806,Haven't you heard? That's the norm. Jokes aside you're just early in the process of figuring it out. You'll find it by trying  new things. For now you must embrace the uncertainty.

6810,"Your opinion is valid, but I have to say fuck that. Work friends are your friends because they have to be. Sometimes it’s great but sometimes you have nothing in common except that neither of you can stand the sound of Janice in accounting chewing her food with her mouth open. Work friends are your friends until you stop working together. 

Find a hobby you enjoy, and go do that thing. All the people you see around you are people who have at least 1 mutual interest. It’s pretty easy to talk to people while you are doing something that makes you happy. Don’t have a hobby where this works? Try rock climbing, painting, cooking class, social dancing, sewing, yoga (sometimes), etc."
6811,[removed]
6812,"i mean, your work friends might have one of those mutual interests.

i just don't necessarily want work friends because i want to keep my personal life separate from work. but one could argue that our personal lives have always blended with our work lives and this has been happening increasingly more."
6813,"I disagree. I think people are turned off if you try too hard to be their friend. Instead, just be friendly and approachable. The two most important factors that will determine whether you will be friends with someone or not is 1) proximity and 2) similar interests and values. You will make friends with people most likely at your job, through meeting friends of friends, or doing a hobby you enjoy"
6814,This is a really good point. Thanks for this dose of wisdom
6815,"1st of all, you stated a very interesting point, secondly, as my twenties journey started, most of friendships when it comes to youth come out as toxic, as for me, idk if it's wrong or not, but I classified people i meet into two categories ""Friends"", and ""Comrades"" (seems more like a communistic concept, but doesn't have anything to do with it), Friends basically include my true friends, that have always been with me and as i believe, they'll always be, only 4 people, and comrades consist of people i met at university or at associative activities and with whom i established good relations, i've no idea why i did that but works fine xD"
6816,I agree with you. I'd add that maintaining/keeping a friendship can take even more effort
6817,Ya I don't mean literally. I'm saying it takes effort.
6818,What did you do to make friends within your age group?
6819,The absolute key to this is have a job and make friends at work or join a group of some sort and make friends there. This pretty much will not work otherwise with true strangers.
6820,thank you king
6821,"Honestly I find this to be the case at uni too. I went to a uni where a lot of students came from the same high school. I befriended all types of people but groups already formed, I had no idea how and I was constantly being forgotten that it became exhausting to keep trying. I'm a minority so I feel that people don't give me a chance unless I'm talking to another person. Its never worked out for me in school even while taking it slow, doubt it will in the future."
6822,"Work friends are not real friends, don't make that mistake"
6823,"Not to sound like too much of a douchebag, but I think the most constructive advice is to practice real appreciation for the job you have, the fact that you can add value to society and be rewarded for it financially.  There is an enormous amount of privilege in just enjoying that, for example being born in this nation, having parents who raised you well,etc.  

If you are having trouble feeling gratitude on the daily, I would say the job is really not a good fit and in that case, maybe consider making changes so you are happier.  But the whole ""not content due to losing honeymoon phase"" doesn't sound like a real reason to leave a job to me.  And for goodness sakes, please make some friends.  Isolation is no way for a human to live."
6824,"It’s definitely an interesting problem that I haven’t dealt with before. School gave me this structure of constantly knowing what I needed to do and how I had to do it. Now there are no instructions and it’s just like, figure it out. Adulthood is tough lol....

This job isn’t necessarily a dead-end job in which I would have no problem leaving. It’s pretty involved and challenging at times where sometimes it’s really not that bad but often I feel like I don’t know my place. I also kinda just want to see what else is out there...

But I could also be an ungrateful millennial who thinks that things should be different and better when they might not really be elsewhere. Not sure..."
6825,"Mike Rowe did a little segment on fulfillment and jobs, you should give it a google."
6826,"I think there is a major thing that everyone is missing out on....

\> Entry level  engineer

\>   I couldn't see myself doing that for many years

Because you're not supposed to be doing entry level work for years.

\> 9 months

\>11 months

\>  pinpoint the cause of my dissatisfaction with all of these different roles

They are the same role, an entry level engineer. Little different tittles here and there, but it sounds like the roles pan out to be the same ole thing, being an entry level engineer.

Career is supposed to be a fulfilling life long journey, that includes the bad times. Entry work is not fulfilling, but it is not the last job you'll ever do.

You jumping around from place to place because you're ""dissatisfied"" with the work you were doing doesn't ring well with recruiters and management. It certainly does lend you to work on bigger projects, promotions, or better networks, but how can you say someone is your best anything if they only knew you for less than a year?

&#x200B;

So here's what you should do:

Let's break this down:

\>  I don't feel like there is much structure or maybe as much leadership as  I would like... I just dont feel like I have been given good enough  direction.

Well with recent developments in management training and certain careers, the best thing for management and leadership to do is just let workers do their work and not micro-manage. If you feel you lack leadership/structure, ask for it. Confirmations, preferred methods of communication, so forth.

\> I also don't feel as if I'm truly working as part of a  team. Maybe  Maybe I'm simply not good enough at my job yet to where I  feel like I can be effective and confidently give value.

That is a possibility. Hey, not all projects need every hand on deck and you might not have everything it takes to do a project with someone. Maybe you haven't garnered the trust of your coworkers to work on projects with them. Best thing is to again, ask. Chip in with a coworker that is bogged down with work and ask management for more impactful work.

&#x200B;

And hey, don't beat yourself up! If you weren't valuable, they wouldn't be paying you! Sounds like this steams from a communications issue that you could clear up easy with a cup of coffee with someone. Speaking of...

&#x200B;

What you should do from now on:

* Stay with the company, address the issues you're having and see what can be done.
* Network with your coworkers, that includes your boss. Building relationships and networking is not this fake ass Linkedin shit with business professional attire, conferences. and high stakes. All it takes is a lunch and a good first impression. Clearly you're able to do that cuz you got a job!
* A lot of stuff like socializing is pretty much destiny where all the things align because same school, class, interests, dorms, etc etc is all lined up. With life, everyone's got their own shit to take care of so socializing comes off hard. I know this because well commuting to college and constantly changing classes didn't lend itself to making close friends. Daunting as it seems, you got to get out their and forge yourself. I asked my girlfriend how she has friends all over and does all these fun things. Turns out she just goes to shit she finds on the internet. If you have a hard time with this **""HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE"" BY DALE CARNEGIE** is an important book to read. It will tell you how, but it won't do it for you. You mention city, so here are somethings to do to get out of the rut (based on US)
   * Zogg sports! 70 bucks gets you a shirt, a gym class like sport, and like minded individuals looking for a fun thing to do. People my age get intimidated by the older people (20s vs 30s-40s) because they feel like they don't relate to them. I find that bullshit because I talk to people on Discord where I have no idea what their ages are and still get along.
   * Eventbrite: For 75 dollars, I get to go to an all inclusive taco festival with an all you can eat taco stand and booze, a swag bag, luchador wrestling, chihuahua contest, and dumb people eat ghost peppers for 8 hours. I am certain you can find something interesting.
   * Bash /r/random until you find a hobby, do said hobby, and find like minded people interested in said hobby in your area. Chances are they will be similar to you as well.
* Move up or out phase begins. I want to say about 1-3 years down the line, based on performance, you should land yourself a promotion and move on to bigger and better things where you learn more and grow.
   * If no promo, no growth, leave. Don't leave unexpectedly, job hunting is a lot easier when you have a job to come back to in the morning.
   * If promo, but no growth, leave. That makes you a liability for being unskilled and outta job real quick
   * If promo and growth, stay. Look around for something if you want, but if treated right and always becoming better and paid to do it why leave?

That's all I got, just remember you are valuable, it is just the beginning, talk it out, everything is gonna be okay."
6827,"Yes, I have definitely contemplated the notion that I could just be thinking like an entitled/ungrateful millennial who thinks that the grass is greener on the other side when it very well might not be. I am very fortunate to be in the position that I am because I’m much better off than many people that I know. But at the same time I have this feeling in my gut that something needs to change.

I’ve said this to a different comment but probably a large part of why I feel this way is that my team tends to keep to themselves and does their own thing on a daily basis which creates very little camaraderie. 

I appreciate you’re input."
6828,I think I am lacking that to a major degree. This is probably a large portion of the issue the more I think about it. The group I work with generally doesn’t converse much on a daily basis and kinda does their own thing which doesn’t create any sort of camaraderie. I just don’t feel like I’m really apart of any sort of team working together to achieve a goal.
6829,"The most fulfilling jobs I’ve had are with good people I work with. If I connect with other people, I’m happy. But that might just be my personality."
6830,"I should start off by saying I don’t have any relevant experience with this (Having a job or engineering) . But to me it sounds like you’ve lost your passion or goal. Like other people here said, if your not learning and developing you should look for a new project/role/company. So maybe you should try to move up the ladder of the company and become a manager of your team or a team. Try your hand at fixing those problems you feel like are in leadership and team structure, if anything you could gain a more intimate understanding of your company, which I would consider learning and self improvement."
6831,"I do feel like I can continue learning in this position as new projects come up but it has been slow recently in getting those Which could be partly contributing. I’m realizing from a few of these comments that the issue might stem from the group I work with on a regular basis not being very social. If I don’t reach out and try to make conversation, I could go a whole day without saying anything to the people around me. I don’t like this at all. I need to enjoy being around the people I work with because then it’s not just like I’m putting in time...

Thanks for the input."
6832,"         “Building relationships and networking is not this fake ass Linkedin shit with business professional attire, conferences. and high stakes. All it takes is a lunch and a good first impression.”

Beautiful."
6833,"I’ve never actually realized that, but you’re absolutely right. I can relate to OP’s post. I think about my current role and why I’ve considered a change, despite it being the most cushy role I’ve had, and it leads to what you said - in previous roles, despite several issues with the job/company, I was lucky to be surrounded by people I enjoyed being around on a daily basis. Most people at my current company’s location either work from home or just aren’t too talkative. When you have a job where there are people you’re stoked about seeing on an almost daily basis, it’s adding a social (and sometimes fun) factor into that job. Sorry for long post, but you made me have a realization and I’m excited now. Thank you!"
6834,"Work culture is huge. If you do decide to switch companies- pay attention to the culture! My first role paid me more than any have to date, yet I quit it as soon as I did because my teammates were anti social drolls. My new team is lively, funny, and engaging. I actually see them as friends- which is huge! You're not entitled, you had enough perspective to consider such, you're young and looking for your place.  Good luck m8."
6835,"Your approach is healthier but, in my opinion, benefits less from hindsight. A lot of people burnout in the same major/position. Unlike multiple near misses, there isn’t a lot of guesswork to be done about their experience. You’ve noticed signs, thought on it, had enough courage to find a better fit. So other than some good ol’ fashion introspection. You could go the full mile, flip off the less cautious, and talk to someone. Many, many people have switched jobs far faster than you’ve done. Could be the honeymoon phases. Could be an underlying cause. It may be too soon for a layman to point out, definitively, why you’ve been feeling the way you are."
6836,I will investigate this. Thanks.
6837,"Thank you for putting in the time to write such an elaborate and helpful response. Not that it significantly matters but I do want to mention that after the first position I had, I did move past being classified as an ""entry-level"" engineer. Granted, until one has 3+ years under their belt, they're probably still classified as entry level. I agree that the first step is discussing with my manager my current thoughts about the job. We did have the conversation briefly during my last review on how I wanted more structure but nothing really changed so I'll have to reiterate that fact. 

I actually have read Dale Carnegie's book but it has been a while and I don't remember many of the concepts so perhaps it is worth revisiting.

I like your synopsis about promotions/growth and think that those are very good guidelines to navigate with. I do think for a long time the only sense of promotion will be raises/responsibility but not necessarily ascending the corporate structure because my current manager reports directly to the president of the company. Any other moves will be more lateral. That doesn't mean that I cannot grow within my position.

Again, thanks for the input, it give me much to think about."
6838,It sounds like that and definitely feels like it but probably more because I don’t feel like I’m apart of any team. Most of the people I work with tend to keep to themselves besides discussing work related things so there isn’t a strong connection. I can go a whole day without saying anything to anyone which I don’t like at all. I’m not super outgoing but I’m definitely not anti-social either so working like this is strange. This easily falls on my shoulders though because I can always be more outgoing but it’s tougher when you’re working with middle age people who have families while I’m a single 24 year old.
6839,">I’m realizing from a few of these comments that the issue might stem from the group I work with on a regular basis not being very social. If I don’t reach out and try to make conversation, I could go a whole day without saying anything to the people around me. I don’t like this at all.

I hear ya - this is one of the number one things I look for in my job search(es). Good luck."
6840,"Hi OP, 

I am going through this exact phase in my life. And everything, literally everything you posted – from moving cities to living alone and the work culture – we are going through the same thing in different parts of the world.

6841,"I’m a Pharmacist too, working over one year  for Inpatient Pharmacy, Honeymoon phase ended up right after the 1st week of my probation period, thanks to the employee responsible for my training and her supervisor, almost got a termination but the Inpatient Supervisor fought for me.

I’m sticking for a while before jumping ship though as I need some experience to build in order to follow the path that I want to take (Health Informatics)."
6842,"I like this, never thought of it like that"
6843,"College professors treat LinkedIn and ""networking"" like the second coming of Jesus Christ. Yes, it is important. But you should probably be more proactive with your student's networking efforts besides saying ""DiD YOu MaKEe A LInkeIN AccOUnt??"" or ""DiD YUo GOo To THe CaREEr FAir??"" and cold message recruiters for positions or something. Like I dunno, you got any cool coworkers that like the same shit as I do that could mentor me? Any cool places you used to work that you may know SOMEONE that could hook a student up? 

Don't get me wrong, LinkedIn is alright, I like the news run down. But it is just soooooo serious and it doesn't solve the problems of the modern job market and professors are like ""YuO'll FIguRE IT oUT, DOOO WAHt YUO LUVV"" 

&#x200B;

Fucking Boomers."
6844,"It what definitely hard for me to adjust to leaving high school. I know exactly how you feel. 

I can tell you that my friends for high school are still my best friends now that we are 30. We see each other often and have been able to grow up together and explore our twenties together. 

Nothing I can say will make this feeling go away, but rather than looking too far into the future maybe take it one day at a time. Don’t try to predict what will happen, just live now."
6845,Group Chat saved my friendship group. We talk all day everyday and when we get a chance we all go out. Money gives you more freedom to do things together. Keep motivating each other.
6846,"I’m 25, through high school, through college, and 3 years into the job life. Everything this guy just said could not be more true. Especially the fact that everyone moves at different paces after high school. That can be a real shakeup. I have old friends who got hit hard by life and are struggling. I have friends who are fucking killing it financially and with the girls at the same time. I have friends who got sick and never got better. I have friends who took 180 degree life changes at 24 years old and aren’t doing anything related to what they studied in college. I have friends who dance through life. I have friends who look happy on the outside and have confessed to me in private they can’t stand to be alive. 

You gotta love em all. If they don’t love you back, don’t give weight to what you think they think about you. It doesn’t matter."

6854,"Keep in touch with your friends. Invite them out fr coffee, cinema etc don’t leave it to the other person to always get in touch.  Take the lead . Speaking as a person who has a son who has just left school you just need a bit of encouragement. Good luck !!"

Tomorrow will be my first day of work and I'll try to look up to see the positive sides of it."
6859,"Yup, it's like that sometimes

Choose what's the most important. Be selective and territorial of your time. Gaurd and prioritize the things you value the most.

It's also totally reasonable to mourn the phase you're exiting. Yes, you want the new phase, but the old one was sweet and you'll only be able to return to it with nastalgia."
6860,In a similar situation. Planning on moving across the country and can’t cope with the fact that once I finally leave my childhood home it will no longer be my home.
6861,Welcome to adulthood
6862,"Congratulations on these awesome opportunities!!
Honestly that’s been my fear with moving into the next phase of life, since I graduated in August. 
Change is uncomfortable. 
I found my dream job in the DC metro area, but I didn’t even apply because I’m not ready to move. I actually went to college near DC, so I know I could do it, it’s just that life moves so fast near the city. I think I like the speed of where I live much better.

I found taking time for mindfulness helped a lot when I’ve moved to a new place. 
Focus on gratitude and making small adjustments into your new life. Don’t forget where you came from and make time to connect with family and friends from home. Old hobbies can be grounding too. I used to play guitar everyday my freshman year of college. It helped to balance all of the new things I was bringing into my life."
6863,"You're probably right ;-; I am excited, the city I get to be in is neat but yeah, change scary."
6864,You’ll only feel this way until you die
6865,Thank you so much
6866,"Thank you. I felt like mourning what I am leaving behind was almost selfish of me with how fortunate I am to have so many good things coming my way, but it is true. It really is like mourning."
6867,Yep. I guess it's time for us to make home where we go :/
6868,"Thanks for sharing your story and your way of handling this. 

I am heavily trying to focus on gratitude, because everything is lining up so perfectly for me right now. But I think it is the fact, too, that everything is lining up so well that also terrifies me. Hoping with time, some good friends and your advice of old hobbies will help me to feel more grounded in the meantime. Used to love making comics, so that may be what will help me."
6869,Lol pretty much
6870,"It is. And that's okay.

Writing, art, an altar, a ritual... Just whatever feels right. But it's reasonable to be sad when leaving one phase (even if it was awful) for a better one. Another way to think of it is practice in transitions, for the eventuality of death."
6871,"That is a huge blessing!! Congratulations! Every single day, I wish I had a full time job lined up after graduating. I wish I had my own place by now. It's been the biggest struggle for me and it doesn't seem like it'll be getting any easier. I'm gonna keep applying, but I'm so ready to get my life started."
6872,"I did the same thing when I was 26. I finished my masters, moved cities and started a new job within a month. I remember feeling really excited as it was happening but I was terrified the day I moved and super stressed out for that first week or so. But I adjusted quick, got settled in and I felt at home quickly. I made wonderful friends. It’s been five years and wouldn’t move back at this point. My life is here now.

Life begins when you leave your comfort zone. Explore your new city, put yourself out there, take the opportunity to try something new. This is a fresh start for you, a chance to build the kind of life you want. All in all, I loved that first year when I moved. Everything had a newness and a freshness to it that I miss."
6873,"Thanks. I feel so bad feeling the way I do because I know I am super duper lucky to start off in such a good spot and see many others are still struggling right now. Makes me feel like I'm not grateful. 

I hope you find that full time job and place you need soon. Don't give up, I'm rooting for you! 

Finding a job is so hard. I submitted tons and tons of applications for internships while I was still in school hoping to land AT LEAST some experience somewhere in my field. It was all I did in my spare time. It felt so hopeless the whole way through but I kept trudging. Tons of rejects later, I get an email and a phone call, then an internship, then an offer to come back. I still feel like I somehow cheated to get my way in, but I know I didn't haha."
6874,Yeah I’m in college right now and there are some *idiots* here... Common sense is the most important thing.
6875,"My friend is about my same age and makes ~30k more as a skilled tradesman (~60k vs ~90k). I’m an engineer. I just started a few years ago and will catch up, probably surpass (eventually). I’ve only been working this career for about 3 years and he’s been doing his for about 12. 

While we’re the same age, I took a less direct path in life. I don’t regret my decisions, but don’t ever think college is the only path. Skilled tradesmen are vital and in high demand right now. 

On another note, I left the military to go to school. Had I stayed in the military, I would be 5 years from retiring at the young age of 38.... or at least collecting a pension and only working for fun money, not because I NEED the money.

instead, I’m just starting my second career. For you young people, 38 may seem like it’s many, many years away, but it’s much closer than you think."
6876,"I’m attending college at the moment I didn’t know what to do, but college has helped me to choose the right path, now I have a better vision of what I want to pursue as a career, and I have educated myself with different classes that I founded interesting, college is optional but I’m reality I went because I just wanted to go and see were it gets me"
6877,I like to add on to this my father who graduated h.s at 16 and went to ucon but ultimately drop out his second semester became a garbage man and now make 140k a year
6878,"I beg to differ. “Lots of uneducated people are in reality, much more educated than educated people” a higher education teaches you a foundation that you can’t get anywhere else. I’m not one to say that a higher education is the way to go, but someone with a degree is much more valuable than someone without one. No matter what, school is important. I have friends who dropped out and now have kids and although they believe school is not important, they want their kids to get a higher education. Lol #finishschoolkids"
6879,"Not just the school of life, but in the internet age in which we live, you have access to all the same materials you’re taught in higher education. People act like learning in a college or university puts you in some arbitrary country club of intellectual hierarchy."
6880,"Like I said, he thinks he’s part of an intellectual hierarchy because he overpayed an institution to teach him things he could’ve learned on his own. It’s an ego thing for him."
6881,"Forcing college (and student loans) on everyone is stupid, on so many levels."
6882,"I hope you’re not insinuating that someone who doesn’t attend ‘higher education’ can’t be educated to the same degree as someone who did. That’s just not true. Lots of “uneducated” people are, in reality, much more educated than “educated” people."
6883,For sure. As a massage therapist I still have to have 24 Continuing Education Hours every two years to stay licensed. And honestly I can’t wait to start looking for courses to hone and specialize my craft.
6884,"You’re mostly right, in a sense, but I just need to add that college really isn’t for most people.  People need to be at least above average in intelligence, in order to excel at their college and their career.  

They also need to know exactly what they want to do in life, and they need to thoroughly map out exactly how they’re going to get there, via college.  

They also need to make sure that this career pays well, and will still be a viable career in 20-30 years.  

Honestly, how many 18 year olds in this general population can check those boxes off, and are smart enough to get all the way there??  Not very many.  

The vast majority of people in college, right now, are just wasting their money on student loans, and are lining the government’s pockets.  

If you’re just going to go to college to party, take random courses/degrees, and drift through college, then it’s not for you.  

Also, when it comes to girls in college....do you plan on having a family, and being a stay-at-home mom (as most moms really should be)?  

If so, why are you going to waste $120 THOUSAND dollars to go to college, work for a while, and then drop out of the workforce — most likely, indefinitely?

In reality, only about 25% of the population has any real business in college.  Just the cold hard reality."
6885,the school of life!
6886,Ime the percentage of idiots in college was equivocal to that of the general population.
6887,More valuable in what respect?
6888,"Yes, as long as you are always learning somethings new and helpful along your way. There are many ways to absorb knowledge and college is just one way of doing it."
6889,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

6890,"You sure? Because everyone and their mother is telling that if I don't have one, I better be pretty exceptional at whatever I do to get anywhere. I guess the crippling depression doesn't convince them that I'll be anything."
6891,"Here’s my 2 cents.  If you want to be a skilled tradesman, that’s awesome.  You’ll be comfortably middle class and if you don’t drink/smoke yourself stupid you can be the top in your field.  If you’re skilled and smart, you can run crews, or start your own business.  

If you’re good with your hands and like cars there is a MASSIVE shortage of GOOD auto body technicians.  Plumbers are always in demand as well as electricians.  *skilled* trades seem to be safe.  Skilled trades are easier for guys but I know a few female auto body techs (mostly painters as women see color better than men) I would also say something like cosmetology or hairdressing/barber/piecer etc to be skilled. 

Skilled is the key word

... but here’s the kicker.  To surpass middle class I believe college (and if you’re lucky enough, smart enough, or your parents pay enough, to get into TOP school) opens doors.  College allows an 18 year old kid to *learn* how to be an adult.  If you move out at 20 and live alone/with a girlfriend, etc... you’ll never expand past your close group of friends and probably never live more than 10 miles from your childhood home 

To be successful you need social skills AND connections.  When you go to college your connections are far more reaching.  You have a better foundation socially and in your field.

Again,  not to belittle tradesman,  I know many and are close friends with a lot of them, and they are hard working, family folk. Most important they are HAPPY.  I have *tremendous* respect for them.  Skilled trades take talent.  

The bottom line is I also know a lot of college graduates and after 25 years (I’m 48) people who went to college are doing better financially basically 99 percent of the time.  It comes down to where you want to be in life."
6892,"That’s awesome!!!! I think I was very lucky to have lots of opportunities to explore passions and interests during high school, so I had at least a broad idea of what I might like to do when I graduated. If you can afford it or don’t mind the debt and want to experiment with different potential career paths in college, by all means do it! I’m really glad it worked out for you!"
6893,"> Also, when it comes to girls in college....do you plan on having a family, and being a stay-at-home mom (as most moms really should be)?

>If so, why are you going to waste $120 THOUSAND dollars to go to college, work for a while, and then drop out of the workforce — most likely, indefinitely?

This is another big reason I really didn’t want to go to college. My main goal honestly is to start a family some day and for the most part hopefully be a stay at home mom. If I’m gonna go in debt for something I want it to be something i’m actually gonna use.🤷‍♀️"
6894,"> a higher education teaches you a foundation that you can’t get anywhere else.


You’re objectively wrong. Like I said, anything you learn in school you have the ability and opportunity to learn without school. And for a lot less money too.


> but someone with a degree is much more valuable than someone without one


Wow lol. I don’t even know how to respond.


> No matter what, school is important. I have friends who dropped out and now have kids and although they believe school is not important, they want their kids to get a higher education. Lol


Again, there’s so much ignorance happening here I really have no idea where to start..

Please go back to Instagram or twitter or wherever you came from."
6895,Never have I been the type to argue with anyone online and I’m not about to start. Not today Satan! Not today! Be bless my friend 😊
6896,"Id recommend you work on yourself first. Women come flooding in when you least expect it and when you yourself are happy living life and being yourself. 

Workout and build confidence from looking and feeling good. Changing up your diet to feel energized and of course for maximum muscle gains! I recommend reading the book ""Models"" by Mark Manson. Its a book on pickup, but its much more than that. Its a book that shows you how to think in a healthy and mature manor when it comes to dating and becoming the man you want to be. 

Pick up your hobbies and follow them because you enjoy them, not because you think you'll pickup girls. I read a comment on reddit years ago that resonated with me a lot. Pick three hobbies. One hobby that keeps you fit (for me thats boxing), one the lets you express yourself! (for me thats music and dancing), and lastly one that makes you money (still working on finding one). 

Read books on body language to read people when they say something but mean something else. Read books on psychology and philosophy to understand your own feelings and those of others to react to certain situations calmly and level headedly.

Lastly, id recommend just throwing yourself out there and getting over your fear of rejection and to learn how you like hitting on women. Learn how you like to build trust with new partners. Learn what type of women you like and want. What type of relationship dynamic you desire. Dating is frustrating because it takes time finding a quality partner and making things workout. It also requires that you learn about love, trust, working through problems, learning to control and understand emotions, and learning to forgive your partner for mistakes. Many people think its like the movies were you'll find the one and live happily ever after. That's not real life. The reality is that love is work, and everyday you must put in the effort to make love work. And even then, sometimes love isnt enough for things to work out. 

It's a scary thing to start dating when youve never done it before. So take it easy on yourself and learn from your mistakes. Most of all, have fun with it and celebrate the little victories when they come up. Much luck my man, and again, have fun with the journey and not just the end goal!"
6897,I would say try a few dating sites just to get your feet in the water. But if not just go ahead and look at events and clubs around your area. If you looking for a relationship having something in common will make it better in the long run.
6898,"Here is some more comprehensive advice. 

Honestly hop on a dating app NOT to start dating but to learn how to talk to potential partners. You likely won’t find the love of your life on there and you probably won’t even have great conversations, but if you’ve never dated, that’s a good place to get some practice. 

For real considerations, as others have said, go with hobbies. You see, it’s not just a place to meet your love interest. It is a place where you can be happy and yourself. Putting yourself in your element makes you more attractive. And then when you find someone your interested in, you know you’ll already have mutual interests. This also applies to friends.

The difference though is that you need to ask someone out when the time is right. I find the best way to not be a creeper is to get to know someone a little before asking them out. Maybe ask them out after your 3rd or 4th meeting. When asking someone out, don’t go with any over romantic or super public gesture. That might work on some people, but frankly it’s creepy to a lot of others and you barely know each other, so keep it casual. The romantic stuff is for later. You want to ask them on a specific date. Have an idea before hand, plus a backup if they say yes but don’t like the plan. You want the first date to be ideally somewhere you can talk (not movies) but not something you do together already (then it’s not a date). Grabbing a drink or coffee is perfect. Dinner is a bit high pressure but I think lunch is good. You aren’t trying to sleep with them on the first date, you’re trying to figure out if they are worth having a second date with. And they are doing the same to you. Leaving avenues to end the date are helpful while also have a back pocket idea to continue if it is going well. 

So to recap, you want to find a group of people who have some similar interests. You want to break into the community a little so you aren’t just a strange creeper. You want to say something like “hey firstname, I’ve been enjoying getting to know you a lot. Would you want to grab coffee with me on Sunday?” Oh yeah and after you ask, you might be nervous, but STOP TALKING. If they are silent for a second, let them take that time to process. Yes or no, the moment before you get an answer is twice as stressful as the moment before you ask. Once you get an answer though, it feels a lot better. And I mean regardless of the answer. You don’t have to have some “oh I didn’t mean as a date” reaction if they say no. Just say “ok I respect that,” and move on. Wait a little while before asking someone else. No one likes to hear they are the second choice."
6899,"^ This 
I can not overstate how important loving yourself first is . It's a very long process and one that you largely need to undertake alone. 
My sister rushed into a marriage without loving herself and she basicly put a lot of emotional burden on her husband which stressed out their marriage.  She has now cut herself off from her family and may close friends who literally watched her grow up."
6900,"Rule 1: Be attractive 

Rule 2: Don’t be unattractive"
6901,"Totally, i met a girl who said she doesnt care about looks and she led me on only to reject me when I proposed. Next month she is fucking my good looking friend. Hmmm"
6902,"Ouch, sorry about that man"
6903,Did you not follow rules 1 and 2?
6904,"Online dating is by far the easiest, and where most people expect to look nowadays. I’d recommend starting with bumble and or hinge then going on a few dates at least to get your confidence up. The benefit of online dating is that everyone’s intentions are clear, which isn’t the case for clubs/community groups"
6905,"It sounds like just a joke and really tongue-in-cheek, but if you really think about it, it’s actually really good advice. 

Be attractive: take care of yourself. Stand with your chest out and shoulders back. Work on yourself and live your happiest life. Be kind to others. Be generous with your attention and time. Chase after your goals and dreams. 

Don’t be unattractive: don’t be mean. Don’t put others down to try to make yourself look better. Don’t be toxic. Stop doing disgusting habits (smoking, day drinking, etc). Stop doing the things holding you back from achieving your goals. 

Following those two rules, even if you are not physically attractive, will easily help you find joy in life and maybe even a deep relationship with a partner who doesn’t care about looks."
6906,"I would suggest you ask this question on another subreddit as well, because that way you'll get a wider range of answers from people in different age groups. That being said, I would say that working on yourself and your social skills simultaneously is essential. 

No matter how great your social skills were prior to getting to this stage in your life where you have no friends, by now your lack of social interactions have probably dulled your social skills. Work on becoming interesting/someone you would respect, and from that your social skills will improve, because you need to feel at least a little confident going in. And you need to be able to hold a good conversation. Good luck!"
6907,Sadly not everyone is ready to handle the magnitude of that statement
6908,I would imagine people that are interested in dating would be interested in sex as well.
6909,Wait for corona to be over
6910,What’s your gripe with online dating?
6911,Honestly just start talking to people on tinder and bumble n shit. Its better practice than people will tell you. Plus its the best way to safely meet people during a pandemic
6912,"I think in this day and age waiting till marriage or abstaining entirely is going on to make dating difficult no matter what route you take. 

That being said, from my experience there are definitely people on dating apps that are interested in relationships and not just sex. However they might not be interested in a relationship that doesn’t involve sex down the road but that’s just the status quo."
6913,Hinge
6914,"Listen. The answer to this is the answer to everything else in the world. Do more, think and talk less. So, let’s do this like a science experiment. What you are gonna do is meet 1 new person per week. In that week, give that person attention and learn about them. If you can meet more, do more. The idea is this: you are gonna desensitize your mind about meeting people. 

Covid has created issues for in person so, let’s do this online. Each time you meet a person, takes notes or pay attention about what is happening. How they spoke to you, how you spoke to them, how it ended up working out as you chatted. Don’t put any pressure on this other than “you are just chatting with a stranger”. If you can do this on face time or video call, that would be ideal. First few times, you are gonna be nervous. You’re going to say stupid things. This is the key part- the first month or two, you’re just gonna practice. The expectation should be to know SOMEONE ELSE deeper as a friend. Keep repeat if this process until you start effortlessly talking to people. Keep going and see if you can meet in person. You’re going to do the same thing in person. Meet as many people as you can and try to see if it goes anywhere. If not, move on. 

Basically what we are doing here is forcing you to interact with people and getting rid of a fear reaction that you’ve developed. 

Exposure helps make this normal.

By the way, if you’re serious about a person, you gotta keep a bit of mystery with them. Don’t be too available. Don’t text too long. Opt for in person or over video call. Create a sense of unavailability to a certain degree. All of your past chats, which were experiments have led you here."
6915,"https://youtu.be/N7FVmeJXwCY

Someone suggested me this King of the Hill clip where boomhouar shows Bobby how to date. Haha

It's obviously meant to make you laugh but basically he was trying to tell Bobby not to get frustrated if he gets shot down.

Make a dating profile and list some interest, hobbies etc and see if you chat with anyone. 

It's dating, don't think cause you chatted and maybe even met for coffee or something you have to get married etc. 

You'll do alright after a few ice breakers."
6916,"I would say to definitely join clubs based on your hobbies, but also definitely use dating apps. If you join a club with the intention of finding people to date, it could make it hard to keep the friends you make in the clubs you join. Online dating is a good way to start dating because if you do something dumb and embarrass yourself, you don’t have to see them ever again. In a club you can make more meaningful connections, but being thirsty in a club can mean that you might end up making people uncomfortable and sacrifice your hobbies and your friends to try to get a date. 

Of course if you have a real connection with someone in a club, then go for it, but I find that those connections happen at the times when you aren’t searching for them. That’s why I think dating apps are a good thing for keeping everything platonic in your friend groups."
6917,"Well to start with some unfortunate news, practicing dating is easiest in school. You find friends and see which you vibe with most.

Dating in the “real world” is a bit harder because everyone are at drastically different places in life. Friends are more fake and relationships are even faker. I say focus on making friends first, like 3 or 4 good friends. Maybe through mutual interests, like a hobby club"
6918,"True, and rightly so. I'm just not looking for that"

Listen, for most people we have to work for a LONG time, my advice is to find something you enjoy going to at least a LITTLE bit, it has made my life 150% better and I’m not depressed everyday. Yes work shouldn’t be your whole life, but it is a big part so might as well do something you enjoy."
6924,The wise man has spoken
6925,THIS is so important. It took me years to realize this.
6926,"I understand where you’re coming from. Did well in school from grade school to university. Now I’m in a relatively “stable” phase in my life where nothing I do will result in undoing years of hard work. I just stopped feeling like I have to prove something by doing well in work. And I do well in my job but that’s it. It’s just ... a job. Sometimes I find myself bored, yes, but I’m more at peace. Now I have time to develop new hobbies and routines. Even better, I have time reindulge in some of the enjoyable things I gave up as a student to be able to focus in school. 

I breathe a little easier now. I have no advice because I enjoy the lull and dull. I think at some point, if/when things get better, we’re all going to want to get out in the world and devour life. Sounds like too much energy, no? I’m saving all my energy and courage for that."
6927,"I agree with what everyone else has said about finding meaning in your life outside of your career. Honestly, I just work so I can do the things I enjoy in life."

6929,"Work doesn’t have to be what drives you to get up in the morning, but it will help if you set clear goals for yourself. I like a short term, medium term, and long term goal. This weekend I am going to go for a hike. Next month, I am going to go on a camping trip. In a year, I want to be better at rock climbing. These goals can be career oriented or not, but it pushes you to get up in the morning."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

...loving your job has never been a real thing (in the long term). See what I did there? Hopefully that got a giggle out of somebody. Anyway, two quick anecdotes to validate my (completely subjective) opinion on this.

Story 1. My grandfather. He loved fishing his entire life. He used to skip school to go fishing, he budgeted heavily and went without most comforts in life so that he could afford a boat to go fishing whenever he could. After about 15 years of welding, he took a risk and started a business as a fishing guide (using that boat). He quickly started earning more (over 3x) his previous income doing the thing he had loved his entire life up to that point. 

After about 10 years of being a guide, he started dreading going to work. He stopped going on fishing trips outside of charters (work related), and even had trouble getting excited to take me and my siblings on our first fishing trips (our parents insisted). He retired in 2001, he hasn't gone fishing one time since. He sold his boat within a year of retiring. He gave his tackle to my brother and I. He's the one who told me that no matter how much you love something, if you do it for work it will always become labor.

&#x200B;

Story 2. My personal experience. I work in IT. I don't particularly like computers and I don't even bother to keep up with new hardware releases unless it's relevant to work (I did look into Epyc pretty heavily). I do this because I'm pretty good at it and I had an easy ""in"" to the career path.

For a 6 month stretch last year, I was temporarily tagged into a project management team at my company. My job description changed to something that had absolutely nothing to do with IT and was entirely focused on human/resource process improvement. 

Both jobs, I love. I enjoy what I do even when it changed because one core part didn't. I was using my obsessive perfection chasing brain (a real negative attribute in a lot of instances) to help people improve their jobs and therefore their lives (to some extent). Being able to use a skillset that I've worked my ass off to develop to help enable others to thrive in their careers brings me joy. I don't particularly care what specifically I'm doing to achieve that.

When I started focusing on the impact my work had on others more than the work itself or its impact on me, my entire outlook changed.  

I know this won't be helpful for many people, but hopefully it will help you a little. Good luck out there, either way. Also, don't forget to be proud of your achievements so far. Getting to where you are now is no small achievement."
6932,"Be gentle on yourself when you feel unchallenged or bored. Most careers are like this once you learn the ropes, and it’s a blessing in disguise. You don’t want your whole life to always be about achievement and job. Someday family will be the most important, or maybe volunteering and giving back to the society that gave you the job in the first place- maybe reframe it... you’re now “safe” in a career and can direct your focus elsewhere?"
6933,Pls stop the blatant advertising
6934,"Hey, I actually know the feeling and went through it about a decade ago, but before I get to what helped me it is worth reiterating what you and others have said 1. There's a big transition between school and work - mentally and emotionally speaking. 2. Yes, the current downfall of society is bogging down a lot of people, not just you. You never know, once more time has passed, you might actually be more comfortable in your current role.

What really helped me wasn't about the passion I had for my job, but the passion I had for what my company did. I spent about 8 years working for a company that made a bunch of money, but really wasn't having a positive impact on society. A few years in, I was dragging - loved my team, was in a good spot financially, but never really enjoyed my work. When I started looking for a new job, it hit me that I didn't just want another job, I wanted one that actually has a positive impact on people's lives. That's where my next two jobs have been and it was a huge lift to me personally. 

Working in ""data"" probably gives you the opportunity to work in a whole bunch of industries, I'd suggest looking for companies you want to be a part of. That whatever your passionate about is part of their mission."
6935,"Ugh I have had the exact same realization. I'm still not quite sure what to do with it. I'm job searching to find one that fits better with my newfound appreciation for 9-5, trying out new hobbies and spending more time outdoors and with friends. Basically I'm trying to build the interesting and fulfilling life I should have had during college. 

Best advice I can give would be to just let yourself live. Try out all the weird hobbies you want to. Don't be afraid to move on from old hobbies/friends/lifestyles that don't work for you any more. Call in sick from work once in a while just to do something nice for yourself (this one is still thrilling to my former overachieving self lol). Since you're already on reddit, you might try following some subs about things you're thinking of trying to get a sense what the community will be like."

6940,"I'm 23 turning 24 in a few months, still going for my Bachelor's. Studying comp sci. It took me a while but I'm on my last year now. I did internships, solo travelled for almost 2 months during summer, and then did a reduced courseload for a year to try new things (improv, hot yoga, a lot of group therapy, going to unique places and trying new food around my town).

I think there is so much to look forward to in twenties. We have time to enjoy our youth AND build our future. For me recently, I've gotten into stocks and psychedelics; I've also bought new kettlebells to increase my strength. There are other hobbies I'm looking into.

But sometimes, everything just seems uninteresting, and you need a break to stop searching for it and just be alone and focus on nothing. Take some time to breath. After that, let curiosity guide you. Start looking into things you wouldn't normally look into. New things to do. Books to read? There is a lot out there, I hope you can share this opinion with me one day.

Low key jealous that you have a job btw, I'd totally kill for one. I graduate May 2021 I still don't have anything lined up post-grad, meaning I'm potentially gonna be a stay-at-home son. It's so hard to find a job.

Or how every politician who has been behind the fear of climate change owns a beach front multi million dollar house, flies in a private jet, and surrounds themselves with people who do the same. Fear is an amazing tool for control. I highly recommend reading about Edward Bernays and how his propaganda methods are still begin used to this day."

6948,"Big gamer here.

With all the technology that seems to pervade our lives, it can feel impossible to escape. Much of my time is spent gaming, watching TV, hanging with friends and doing more of the same. I'm even teaching myself to program and code so I can incorporate it into my career.

Lately, my eyes have been giving me trouble, mostly due to screentime causing strain, according to both an opthalmologist and an optometrist. Both have indicated this being an inevitability as we continue to saturate our eyeballs with light. The former advised me to incorporate eye drops into my hygiene routines, and the latter a warming eye mask to stimulate oil gland production in my eyes (the avg person's tears last 10 seconds on the eye, mine last about 1-2 seconds). 

If I can't get away from the screens, I wear yellow clip on glasses to block as much blue light as possible, even while I'm watching TV or gaming. I also make sure my monitors and screens have their brightness turned down as much as possible. Bright enough for me to read and see what I'm doing, dim enough that I don't feel my eyes roasting. Most phones and operating systems come with a Night Light setting, which turns down the amount of white and blue light output (which makes your screen turn yellow/orange). I also make sure I regularly take breaks (go get water, bathroom, have a snack, take a short nap, meditate, do my eye mask and apply drops afterwards), anything to give my eyes a break. As another user suggested, other light besides the lone monitor is also helpful. Make sure you're not too close to the screen, you want to be a comfortable distance away that you can still read what's on it.

I try to make time to spend with friends away from the screens. That can mean an outing, and going for a simple walk is better than nothing. It also helps to turn off my phone, or at least the sound and vibrations of nagging notifications. When I'm with friends, I make it a point to not look at my phone until I'm alone or if it's urgent.

I eventually also want to develop a better habit of reading and drawing, just to try something different and to enrich my intellectual livelihood. I want to give myself something better to do before bed instead of watching reruns of Family Guy.

And remember to be patient with yourself. Changing your habits is hard, but it's worth it in the long run. Good for you for taking the first step in taking care of your health. You need your eyes, take care of them!"

6952,"# OP LOOK UP EYE STRAIN EXERCISES 

these seem good— https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327524#exercises

Eye strain, medically referred to as asthenopia, can lead to real problems. Often artists work with exercises like this too, and whereas light is a concern, so is focal point. These instructions mention looking at something 20’ away for 20 seconds every 20’ minutes... but realistically , those eye tracking exercises should be much more involved.

6956,"There’s also a program that I run called Flux, it adjusts screen temperature and takes the bright blue hue out of the screen. It’s weird looking for the first day or two but you get used to it very quickly. Would recommend!"
6957,"Anything that’ll get you out and about. I’ve read that it’s important to vary your focal distance to reduce eye strain, so if you’re looking at a screen within a few feet, make sure to take breaks where you can focus on something more distant. Look out the window and try to figure out what your neighbors are doing. Cloud watch. Whatever. Maybe take up metal detecting or magnet fishing."

6960,Try podcasts instead of tv(I color while listening) schedule out your day to have breaks in between screen time (set alarms for this) get a fidget toy or anything to keep in your hand (even a rubber band) to keep you hands busy so you don’t feel the need to automatically pick up your phone
6961,Take partner dancing classes. It will change your life
6962,I agree with this--I think the problem OP is experiencing is due to the distance rather than the screen colors. Getting outside or even looking out a window helps my eyes feel better.
6963,"Not OP.

I am mostly on my phone screen.

My phone is at half an arms distance to my eyes.

That's pretty close, isn't it?"
6964,Ambient light will help reduce the strain from screen light. Color doesn't particularly matter
6965,How close is the screen to your eye distance
6966,Most eye doctors agree that those are placebos or not enough research has been done to prove they work. Eye strain exercises are actually proven and free.

6979,"You know, I graduated last year with my masters in architecture and all of us in architecture school were sweating bullets about a recession hitting, back then because of the trade war. This is unfortunately a tough time for everyone, but the plus side is that the recession (at the moment) is driven by an external shock (the disease), not some failing in the financial system. This will be rectified as quickly as people can get back into old habits- it doesn't hinge as heavily on structural economic change, and thus we're likely not going to see entire industries vanish indefinitely.

As far as the job goes, did you consider looking for a research position at your university, or a policy think tank? Consider even doing PhD? I did date a girl a couple years back doing a masters in art history- very bright young lady who was going for a route in academia. That said, your degrees sound more policy or academia oriented. Nothing personal, but you really don't need a masters to get a job at an art house or film festival (bachelors even is a stretch)- those actually sound like underachieving on your part, unless you're looking to be a curator. Perhaps now's a good time to think about alternate career paths and pivot. Have you had any discussions with your thesis advisor about this? They could likely offer better guidance for entering the working (or academic) world."

I love my independence which I'd practically completely lose if I'd move back. Actually my SO and I have been talking for a while about getting a little place together when I finish my masters. I'm really gonna work hard to make that work.
6982,"Well, It's not from coronavirus. The crisis was unavoidable and happens every 7 years. It's been 11 years from the last one, so this one would be horrible and so strong thanks to governments of all countries that was giving money to delay it. The virus just let it happen quicker but I suppose that without it this recession would take place in the next several months. We could expect that by observing Warren Buffet actions. Before the last crisis he liquified almost all of his assets. He did it in the last year again. And I speak about it after finishing Economic studies and being very interest in the topic. But there is one thing that concern me. There are only 120k deaths from this virus - more of us die on roads, and we are talking about all the world. I watched many films about virus and PhDs with biological and virus knowledge and it appears that this virus was created by people. I don't know what to think about it but in something like 2017 - id2020 organization was founded by Rockefeller. I don't believe in conspiracy theories but every new deal was a conspiracy. Let me add that COVID-19 if just change V to W which is very similar to each other means COW ID. So I think that the vaccine for this virus will be with id chips and that's what Bill Gates tell ""Only people which been IDid should have right to work and travel"". What the hell does it mean? What next? You will have to get permission to leave your house? Where is freedom in this? I am Very concerned about the future, but well. We live in very interesting times. Let's smile now and remember that 1% can't out stand the 99% percent. We are stronger and we will always be. Let's make future something great and let everyone grow and feel happiness. Best regards from quarantine. Stay strong!"
6983,Ohh that sounds awesome! I've seen a few VR animated short films in the past. They were great.
6984,The best you can do is finish strong and try to make as many connections in whatever field you're trying to get into. We live in really uncertain times so being as marketable as possible is the best approach. A lot of people need jobs so you have to stand above everyone else.
6985,"7 months from now we could very well be on a strong bounce back. Obviously there’s still cause for concern and I def feel for you, but worrying right now could very well be completely pointless. 7 months is a pretty long time!"
6986,"Good decision!
What are you gonna study?"
6987,Those will be difficult degrees to get a good return of investment on. Everyone is struggling in a way right now. Use that to your advantage to band together with other young aspiring professionals in your field looking to get back on their feet. Communal connections really help provide a lot of opportunity in art-based fields.
6988,"I don’t know if this will make you feel any better...but I graduated last year and a few of my friends are graduating this spring. One just posted that they got a marketing job at a place she interned at 2 years ago. 

She said that her career center was fantastic and that a lot of her professors helped. There’s so much uncertainty that a lot of people aren’t even looking."
6989,"At my university you need to do a special 2 year research-master in order to even have a small chance of doing a PhD, so a PhD is no option for me. Also PhD's often take like 7 years..
Is a PhD so easy to get where you're from then?

Also, around here there are quite some people who have studied at university working for filmfestivals?
Also, I don't have a real dream job (yet) so I'm pretty open to jobs as long as they interest me and are preferable in my city or close enough that I can keep on living here, because I really love living here."
6990,"Wow, this is quite an interesting take. I have to admit that I had similar thoughts about vaccines having a catch 22."
6991,"I'm also afraid of this happening, every time I tell someone I'm just looked at like I'm crazy. I donr know about COW ID but there's some serious connections with Bill Gates looking into micro IDs that can be inserted in the skin, then talking about how he can implant a ""bio marker"" if we've had the vaccine or not. Im not a Christian, but in revelations they talk about a ""mark of the beast"" during the end times going on your right hand or forehead, and without it you cannot buy or sell. I mean... is that not a microchip? 

But I digress, theres a lot of people scared of it and with enough pushback I don't think it'll be mandatory. If it is... idk, we're screwed"
6992,"PhD route really varies based on what field it's in. They take as long as you want them to (I'm an American), but 5-7 years for architecture history or theory is pretty standard if you want a theory degree in those design fields. As I recall, art history was similar, but I've known people who are highly focused and get it done quickly. The acceptance rate also varies across the board based on what you're looking to do it in and where- PhD program acceptance at my alma mater actually was fairly high provided you find a faculty member to be your advisor. Now trying to do it at the local Ivy League here, well that's a whole other story. 

Yes, never said that working at a film festival is out of the question- certainly common as a starting job, just not really a long term career path for most. Hence why I threw out research or PhD route, and that certainly would give you the opportunity to stay where you live if you don't want to move."
6993,Could you elaborate on this topic? I'm interested in your point of view :)
6994,"I share the same feelings. I don't know if this ""mark of the beast"" that I heard off for a few times is real, but it's very logical. Maybe god is real? There is a video about a finance worker. He committed a ""suicide"" 6 days after this interview was released. Suicide before he called police and family with message ""they want to kill me"" and then he ""drowned himself"" in a 1 feet deep pool. You can hear all the interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-EC0-Zy3qA. It's in polish and under conspiracy theories logo, but there are sources in the film description. Unfortunately this sources videos were deleted from YouTube! I wanted to share with you the originals but I can't find it :( I'm normal person. Not a conspiracy theories freak and I want to stay on facts and logic all the time. But it smells.
This finance worker was a millionaire. He didn't want to get famous and get money on it. He didn't had to. He just felt it's the right thing to do.
You probably don't know Polish language, so I will quickly describe you what this video are about.
This man had a several businesses which made him rich. Only money was on his head, and he wanted to earn as much as possible. Then the day come that someone come to him and said ""hey, I can see you work hard. I want to retire and I can give you my place for 10% of your earnings where you can earn the real money. I will teach you everything but you have to turn your conscience off. The man agreed. In this video he say that he was in charge of money laundering for countries like Germany and French. He explains how the oil business work and how terrorist organizations work. 
And then when he was involved deeper and deeper he reached level of the great finance people of the world which are satanic sect. And then when he was involved in rituals which were fallowed by orgies etc. Then this one ritual came, and they said that he must kill the child, because they wanted him to really involved. Then he snapped in this time and tell them that he won't do it. He had very hard childhood and experienced so much evil in his lie. That is why he did it. In this video you can see his face expressions when he talks about it. It's horrifying.

So my point is - Maybe on this world exists powers that we are not aware of. I'm just asking because I don't have knowledge of it and I try very hard to not believe in it, because it would be just terrifying. But It's so logical. If it's true - for something positive in it - there are people who don't want it. Who are willing to tell the truth. But well... If it's true the bad guys hold the real money. And without money you can't do shit.

It's very sad. I hope for some discussion on it and maybe we will come to some useful conclusions. But well. If it's real, we - small people - are not able to stop it."
6995,"I’m a first year headed into a finance major. I know I’m a first year and idk people seem to look down at us because we’re basically children still lol and that’s true. But for my career path in the investment industry I’m quite thankful for this market crash that was inevitable. By the time I graduate the whole start of my career will be on an upswing after this crash that’s almost as bad as the Great Depression. So personally I am happy that the market has been beat down in the dirt because my whole career will be a success just from my timing. Only problem will be an influx of competition because everyone was laid off and looking work. I hope all goes well with you in your field, I’m sure things will work out in the end worst case it’ll just be a bumpy start.

6996,"Yeah that's true. I'd say my resume is solid, so that gives me some faith."
6997,"Yeah in a way it is!

6998,"Credentials and education are always good to have. Experience and project you can point are typically more valuable, especially once you get your career off the ground.

7005,"Hey! I am doing the whole Integrated Marketing 360 Program (Paid 5200 for it with a 30% discount, originally 7200) and it's personally helped me out a ton. I was extremely skeptical as well because, well, I didn't want to drop 5200 on courses that may have been worth it. I already finished the digital marketing certification and am in the data driven part of it, I finish up the whole course in march but am doing it full time. Started the first of July 2019, finishing the 3rd of March 2020, and that's doing it full time for their longest marketing program.

Regarding it being Bullsh\*t in the field, I don't think so. It's honestly what you take from it and apply rather than just a piece of paper that ""could work against you"". I'm pretty passionate about marketing so I am in my junior year of college at ASU doing Mass Communication and Media Studies (Lots of digital analytics and marketing), have taught myself how to build websites and do SEO, and am also taking this Cornell course. I even got an internship out of it, and am working doing marketing work now because of it.

If you have any more questions I am more than happy to help, because I remember how skeptical I was right before I signed up!

&#x200B;

Also regarding the courses and how they are prepared, they are made and prepared by SC Johnson Business School of Cornell, and the videos include the professors of the school explaining the material to you. Now and then they'll also have times during the week where you can call and actually ask questions to your professor on a conference call, and the whole class can join if they are available. You also get feedback like 80 percent of the time on submitted assignments and discussions, so they are not as ""cookie cutter"" as other courses may be.

I personally take notes on every single little thing said that I don't understand or know, and have learned more in 3 months of Cornell compared to 2 years at a community college getting my business associates degree."
7006,"eCornell is a good value based on what you pay IMO.  The professional/post grad education industry has some bad actors in it, especially some of these coding bootcamps that are often affiliated with a university but have zero authentic connection to them.

7025,"The job market has always been about supply and demand, not how hard you work or how ""important"" you may think a job is. For example, a stay-at-home mother is very important and provides a lot of value to the child, but there's no market for it because the demand is just coming from your kid. 

If companies are looking for college graduates to fill positions and only some people have a degree, then they will naturally have to pay more due to lower supply. Same logic goes for lawyers, doctors, and engineers. You literally got a degree so that you can work less hard and be paid more.   


Lots of jobs in the professional world are BS, and it seems like your is too, but it doesn't mean the entire corporate world is BS. Doing some errand during the work day while WFH is common and not that big of a deal if you get your work done. Some companies fail and some succeed. For example, thousands of professionals came together to build reddit so that you can post on here. People are running these companies behind the back and it's definitely working.

Turns out I was thrown under the bus and made out to be a slacker (which is the farthest from the truth, I worked as a server to pay for school). I started staying at my desk like they wanted just on the internet doing stupid shit and wasting 2-3 hours at my desk doing nothing as opposed to anything else productive. I’d ask for more work and was totally disregarded so I just twiddled my thumbs like they wanted. This is also when I found out I had ADHD 🙃

Long story short, the stupid majority of the professional is not even that professional. It’s everyone playing pretend or power tripping most of the time. If you find time to yourself, don’t let it go to waste!"

OP is right. Most middle class jobs are unnecessary. There is no relationship between how hard you work, how important your work is, and how much you get paid. There is a glut of students who’ve been taught that work gives life meaning, and they graduate to find there are no real meaningful opportunities.

I agree that it’s less taxing overall to be working in CS, but the things I am taxed with are things I like doing. If I was super sociable and liked interacting with people I might have found this line of work much more exhausting than customer service, but I’m pretty much the opposite.

I think  @[Philharmonia](https://www.reddit.com/user/Philharmonia/) your objectives are more a repelling force than attracting. You say you have nothing that you want - but there is, you said you wanted to move out of your parents house. So I think you should work with that as much as you can and see how you can achieve that. Because that small objective in itself could expose you to more objectives that you may want to achieve. Moreover you'll end up realizing that you want to achieve certain ones more over others. For example, you may have a look at the job market and realize that, even if there isn't a specific job you want, that you want job (A) more than job (B) - so even that sets a small objective.

What I'm trying to say is: in your quest to move out from your parents house, expose yourself to the many different routes you could take - which would be alot since you dont have anything specific in mind - and then be picky with which one you'd rather follow over another. That could create the sense of objective you're looking for.

Nevertheless, I wish you all the best - life fluctuates and goes up and down. This may simply be a low for a very big high so stay hopeful. Make sure to let us know how you get along !"

And I understand that it's just a ""parent"" thing to take care of your children in that way, but god damnit I need to get my own place. That would probably give me my mood and relationship with my mom back to a good place.

Anyway, I really do wish you all the luck in life my friend, don't be a afraid of what is to come, be happy of what is. here and now."
7056,""" I don’t think I’m living. Just surviving. And that’s as good as death for me figuratively. ""

This is a scary position to be in. Mainly because you're really susceptible to taking on the world's desires as your own.

A horrible solution we've found to try and feel fulfilled is the pursuit of the bigger and better. We often call this ""having aspirations"". 

A lot of us pursue love, wealth, family, an excellent career, a wonderful partner, or well, even just beauty because we are unable to feel content with what we currently have. It's not to say that a lot of these things are great and will bring happiness if we truly appreciate them, it's just that often we convince ourselves that the reason we do not feel happy today is because the thing that's going to make us happy will be found tomorrow, in your case, maybe it'll be found once you find a true aspiration. You can say that you want to pursue a goal, and tomorrow, when I hit this goal, there in that moment is where fulfillment exists, this is when I won't feel like I'm only surviving.

However, this is a fallacy!

Tomorrow comes and we realize happiness is actually found next Tuesday. Or that happiness is actually going to be in this new car, new job, new *experience*. Soon enough, hitting the goal doesn't matter, what matter's is solely that we are able to place new goals on new things and pursue them until we die! The sad reality is people will do this until they're old and frail. The happy reality is the fact that in this stage in people's lives they often find peace, not because they look back on all of the hills they've conquered, but because they realize they can stand atop the tallest one right where they are.

&#x200B;

Now I know having the answer to the question ""How do I develop aspirations?"" be ""to first aspire to not have aspirations"" is a little weird, bit funky I know. I don't want you to think I'm trying to preach fulfillment comes only when we sit on our hands and do nothing, because I'm really not. I just really want to caution against feeling like you need to do something because the rest of the world is doing something.

Healthy aspirations exist. We can aspire to have a healthier body, a healthier mind, healthier relationships etc. To answer your question of how to develop aspirations, all I can convey to you is what I've found out in my lifetime, nothing more. For me, when I got out of high school, my only plan was to go to college. In my head, everyone who had a degree was financially stable and growing up in a financially unstable home, that's all I really wanted. What irked me through observation was some of the seemingly lackluster lives people were living while on the road I found myself on. I looked down the road and saw love, wealth, family, an excellent career, a wonderful partner, or well, even just beauty, and figuratively, I thought, that's as good as death. I discovered for myself that those aspirations wouldn't bring me anymore happiness than that which I have today, and I slowly realized this about many things. I aspire to seek out the truth about myself and the world around me. Using this as my guiding principle has led me to meeting many new people and doing many new things, but most importantly I think it's brought me some peace. 

Everyone's lives are different, you may feel some of this might apply to you, you might not, that's okay. All we can really do is be present enough to try and understand why we do what we do, the rest will come with the answers to those questions.

Take it easy man!"
7057,"Definitely not abnormal to feel this when you’re coming out of school. I’m in a very similar boat, that is that my senior year was cut short due to the pandemic now i feel lost. I think it is actually okay to not have these great big goals and aspirations, sometimes just wanting to be happy and secure is enough of a goal to satisfy yourself. Start small, set really small things you want to get done or accomplish and try to put yourself on a schedule that you can force yourself to adhere too. It sounds cliche, but doing thing habitually will really help your motivation and productivity levels. No reason to aim too high you’re young and have time just take it a couple steps at a time and you’ll do fine."

7060,"I tried to get any opportunity I could without knowing what I wanted after college. It'd be good to figure out what you don't want by trial and error so you can reach a relatively comfortable place. 

I don't use words like aspirations. I work to get paid so I could sustain my life, and my goal is to make my life (off-work hours) comfortable. There's no problem in working just to pay the bills"
7061,"I think media like movies and TV show us that everyone has a calling and is driven my ambition that defines them. We’re taught to always go after it dreams and people around us have subscribed to that idea. Real life doesn’t always work like that and not knowing what you want to do is as normal as it gets. 

I’m 24 myself and I have no idea what I really want to do. From working a few jobs after graduating, I am starting to get an understanding of what I don’t want to do and that’s been very valuable. 

All we can do is look around for opportunities and take every good one that comes around. Someday, things will sort themselves out."
7062,"Before I give any advice, please note that we're all ""figuring it out"" in this world and it can be tough. If you're feeling depressed, lost, or even just want someone to talk to in person, I \*highly\* recommend seeing a therapist. Sometimes they can help ""translate"" what your feelings and brain are trying to say!

Okay, now on to your question.

Honestly, there is no one particular answer! Hooray! Everyone has and is going to have a different and unique experience filled with their own events, emotions, and perspectives. However, I feel most can agree on one thing: **Nobody really knows what they're doing.**

Aspirations and ""potential"" are kinda dumb, imo. I'm not saying throw them out the window, but hear me out. Growing up, I was in fine arts. I did theatre, dance, and any form of singing I could get my hands (throat?) on. People constantly told me I had all this ""potential"" and to keep following my dreams. I *wanted* to be an actress. I *aspired* to be... something. Someone. And people around me encouraged it!

I went to a prestigious college for music theatre (my over-arching passion at the time) and was able to afford about a years worth of school before I realized that if I continued, I'd be:

* Way in over my head with debt
* Broke regardless, because moving to NYC like every other ""struggling actor"" will be Very Hard and Very Fruitless
* Depressed! And likely alone. I was very depressed and solitary throughout college and was unsure if I wanted to continue that trend.

I realized the more I made my aspirations and dreams my actual career, the less I loved it. For the first time in *my entire life* I thought,

""I don't know what I want to do.""

I let the winds of the Universe decide where I was going to end up.

So, I dropped out of college. Which was not in my ""plan"".

I met my husband on Tinder. *Definitely* not in the plan.

And I let go.

After decades of self-pressure to have dreams and aspirations, I realized it's okay to just... Not.

I still love performing. I still enjoy theatre. I sing and torture the cat with endless Broadway Ballads! playlists. I just... don't feel the need to actively pursue it anymore.

Sure, I have things I *want*. I want to do well with my job (which I honestly don't want to move up in, I'm happy just existing in my position.), I want to do some fixer-upper projects on our home. I want to travel some more. But none of those are what society tells us are ""aspirations"" or ""dreams"". And that's okay!

You are allowed to not be actively travelling through life at an insane velocity; It's *completely okay* to just stroll through and be happy with where you're at. It's okay not to want things. It's okay not to aspire to be things or have insane dreams or goals.

If your goals are simply to wake up, eat breakfast, and go to work so you can save to get out of your parents' home, then that is a-okay. In fact, it's perfect.

You are the one making your reality. You call the shots. Sure, we have people that we have to heed sometimes (i.e. managers, parents, law enforcement...) but overall, you have control over your life and where it goes. Maybe one day you'll wake up and suddenly be filled with inspiration. Maybe you'll see something on your trip through the Universe and decide that's what you want to be or do or help. And maybe you won't! And that's okay.

You're on your own path. And that's just fine. :)"
7063,"I'm going to comment quickly about passion, because you're not the only one who comes out of college and 'drifts', with no real direction, no real passion. From the sounds of it you're not really passionate about anything.  

A lot of people seem to think that people just wake up one day and suddenly ""know"" what they want to do with their life; they think people suddenly discover their passions, just completely out of nowhere.
In most people, this just isn't the case. Typically passion is found not in a single go, but instead is developed and nurtured by doing things. 

For example, a pianist will probably have played piano for some time before realising that that was what they wanted to do, to dedicate lots of time to.
Likewise a chef might have grown up cooking in the house, and it's that time spent cooking that means the chef can really enjoy it and have a great passion for it.
And this makes sense, how can you be expected see the beauty or understand and enjoy the challenges in a given field/area/hobby without first investing time into said thing. 
I'm using examples of obvious things, but this extends to maybe everything.  A job as a manager in an office might appear really boring yet actually be full of specific types of interpersonal challenges that resonates with your own personality - you could enjoy it, but you can't know because you have no experience. It's just an example.

My point is, is the best way to find your passion, to find direction, and this extends to more than work, is to *just do things*. Go to the gym, do a sport, get a hobby, join a club, get into poker, write something, just apply for a job in whatever, go for a walk, volunteer, go see some live music, or a play, get into programming, or video editing, or arts and crafts,  *anything!!!*. Give things a shot, add that means a proper shot, don't just quit after a day. If you find something isn't for you, great, you now have a better idea of what you want (well, what you don't want). The surefire way to NEVER find a passion is by not doing anything. I promise you this

As for looking at other people and seeing them and all their plans etc... Don't. Half the time they're hollow generic NPC aspirations: have a nice house and a nice car and a family, lots of money. It's cliché to say but material aspirations will leave you unfulfilled. They just will, just ask older people who have done it, bought the car got the house and the big TV etc. The exception is having kids, obviously, which is by all accounts very fulfilling. The point is this kinda stuff is usually regurgitated crap that everyone is told they want (TV films media books other people etc)
Obviously, you'll also know people who have real passions in life and are very driven, and that's awesome. Talk to them about their passions, how it started etc. And keep them around. Passion is contagious.

That's all I have time to write for now, but I sincerely hope it helps. Just do things, literally anything, just do things which push your boundaries. Things you haven't done before.  The worst that can happen is you find something (job etc) you don't want to do, and that's very valuable information too."

7067,"Media these days paint this picture that all successful people know exactly what they want to do, and upon completing school, they spend the next 30-50 years of their life doing that one thing.

* [Here's another good article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) on the struggles of finding a career

Anyways, it takes a lot of time to figure out what interests you. And it's not just time, it's trial and error. And then more time - a lot of studies show that you can 'learn to enjoy' something if you practice it enough.

In the mean time, spend some time figuring out what brings you happiness. Don't focus on what jobs would make you happy (yet), then about what you like doing - do you like being outside? Do you like solving problems? Do you like being creative? Do you like being with other people? Do you get satisfaction from completing 'projects'? Do you get more fulfillment from finishing something quickly, or from working on a longer project? Questions like these will help you figure out your path.

7068,"- First of all English is not my native language, but I´ll try my best. -

You and as I suppose many here including myself had that feeling like "" I don´t know what do here from now"" when you got out School/University, as an example I studied a career just to study something but never really realize how important is the decision I made that day I just did it because everyone was studying something so I got my degree in business administration when I was like 24/25 I applied some jobs I did not like, went to interviews I didn't wanted to advance but I did it to gain experience, glad I didn't pass those interviews, for some reasons of life I ended up taking a job as a High School Professor teaching Economy, Human Resources etc, wasn't something I ever expecting to do to be honest, but it was a good experience I enjoy it, good pay and a lot of vacations, that give me the time to enjoy and discover some other hobby I asked to myself what I really like, I already knew what I don't want to do so... I say beer.. I like beer... So I beginning to studying fermentation, history of beer, took classes about styles and sensory analysis of beer I like it with a lot of passion and that lend me to be a Homebrewer and a Judge of beer in competitions, it´s not something from what I´m living right now I actually work in Human Resources for the Government but I know what I want do now and I need money to start it, so its a job I don´t like but it has a purpose, a step that it will help me to do what I really want, my point its YOU DON´T have to know what to do or have a dream right now you are young its something that comes naturally for me it was at 27 year old, its ok some people know what they want since forever but other like you and me need more time to discover what we want to do and thats its totally fine, just do thing even those that you think you will not like may surprise you."

7070,"Here are my two cents: 

The people in the comments are giving really great advice. Especially those who mentioned the idea that Hollywood sometimes gets us to expect an almost prophetic moment of ""knowing"" what do.  Drifting is something I speculate we all must go through at some point in our lives. 

Many people I trust who are in their later years have told me that they didn't always know what to do next, they would just go out and try things and reflect on their experiences after. Upon reflecting they would sometimes say there was one thing that they thought was worth exploring further and some said they took and enjoyed many things further. 

Many said that ideas and thoughts grow on you, the things they ""know"" they earned after some time. But that also works in reverse, they had to explore to find the things they didn't want. 

I guess the common thread here is to explore, it strikes me as a signal from yourself that more exploration needs to be done. And btw another common thread of most self development is about the actual process of exploration. 

As you begin to see more, especially what you don't want, what you do want may begin to become clearer to you. There is a lot to see out there and so the sheer quantity may be discouraging. But start anywhere, flip a quarter, write idea down and pick one out of hat, or ask someone you find interesting for suggestions, anything to get just get ya started. 

I sincerely hope this helps you and remember many are in this boat with you. 

Best of luck :)"
7071,"Don't worry, the whole world is in shock right now.  You have the perfect attitude to survive quarantine.  

Try to find a job you can do at home, to save up money to look for an apt when all this is over, and maybe take some training for a job that pays well and is hiring.  Moving out of your parents' house and supporting yourself is an excellent aspiration.  

Many people have the opposite shock, they follow their dreams only to find it didn't turn out as they expected.  Instead of think you're depressed, maybe you are a late bloomer.  Some people don't discover their true passion in life until they are 40 or older.

what I’ve been doing lately is exploring old hobbies I used to really love, for example reading. I have a bunch of series from high school that I still have at home, and last night I decided to give it a shot and reread one of my favorites. I was so invested into the book and remembering the details and the feeling of being in another world that I didn’t realize what time it was. so now i’m going to make it a goal every night to read at least 50-100 pages before bed rather than watching netflix or being on my phone. find something that sparks joy in you!"
7082,"Absolutely. Happened to me as soon as I graduated college, got a full-time job related to my degree, and finally made enough money to move out of my parents' house. I think this is the first time in our lives when we don't have some broad, imperative life goal we're still trying to achieve. 

For the first ~25 years, it's graduating elementary school, middle school, high school, getting your driver's license, getting your first job, graduating college, getting your first ""real"" job, and moving out. *Relatively* speaking, it all becomes somewhat stagnant after that. It's taken me several months to adjust to this. 

I've tried developing hobbies, like picking up guitar and foreign languages. But it's only been a band-aid. There's some deeper malaise I'm trying to fix."

On the other hand, I had no money to see my friends or do anything interesting with my time that wasn't very cheap.

I feel like I've kind of broken through that stage though. Mostly. Ever since that bloody virus happened I've been unable to start work to earn money, and I can't see friends either. I had recently ended my last tenancy and I am back with my parents for a while, unable to move into a new place, so again that also feels like a back-pedal.

I’ve been thinking the same thing as you OP, I miss being in college and now I think “wow life was so much easier in college when I didn’t have to stress about finding a career.” But in college I thought “I can’t wait to be done and have this weight of getting a degree off my shoulders.” Clearly I have a habit of not enjoying life for what it is at any moment.. maybe you’re feeling some of that. You’re transitioning to a new point in life that is different than any other, really, all we know up to college is school and how to revolve our lives around school. Now there is more freedom even though it’s difficult. Just trying to say you aren’t alone and try to enjoy this new period."
7095,I’m taking a gap year right now before college and I’m going through the same thing with high school.

7097,"The site in particular, meetup.com, seems to be a hit or miss for people. You could try to create your own group if you're up for that. Fortunately there are also other sites or other events that aren't strictly ""meetup groups."" And there are other ideas for making friends in the wiki. 

Some of the ideas might not work for everyone though, and that is important to consider, so it's good to hear someone else's experience."
7098,"I relate to this a lot. Thanks for posting, it is a common thread on this sub and glad we all feel confident and safe sharing sharing it."
7099,I feel the same way as you OP. I graduated in May also and I do miss some of the stuff you mentioned. I played on an athletic team and right now all the returning players are back preparing for the season to start and seeing it on social media makes me miss it. I for sure miss seeing my friends right down the hall or next door to me. Can't really see those friends now since most of them are out of state but I do talk to them occasionally. It's totally normal to feel nostalgic but what I've been trying to do is just grind at work and try to keep my mind off it.

7101,We’re in the US. He wants to go to grad school but it’s expensive and he wanted to work a bit to save some money for tuition.
7102,"Totally get that, the US isn’t always friendly when it comes to funding college haha. Let him know that once you’re in grad school, it’s much easier to get access to relevant jobs like being a research assistant. Friends of mine have been offered it just for doing well in class. He may feel better if he knows his work is helping him in his chosen career - it’s to pay for grad school, which will get him to where he wants to be.

I even know someone personally that became a junior therapist after grad school with no internships or anything. He will be fine!

I have no insight on general science though :’)"
7103,My brother got his masters in psychology. It’s a field where you more or less need a masters degree as a minimum requirement to entry. Maybe social work would be easier to get into with a bachelors. I wish him the best of luck and to hang in there. Life is long and beautiful.
7104,He kinda has to do work experience if there is no jobs willing to take him with no experience
7105,How can he get experience?
7106,"It's a difficult spot to be in. The other users are right - to get experience, you need experience. For many people, this means starting with research or internships while in college. Unfortunately, the importance of internships sometimes isn't stressed enough. And to do anything specifically within psychology, he most likely needs to pursue more education. Many people have psychology bachelor's degrees. The field is over saturated right now.

Regarding internships, he may be able to get something paid, but the vast majority of internships are only looking for current students, so that ship has most likely sailed. His only option here is looking at internships that are also available to recent grads. He could also look into volunteering, which would hopefully be less of a time commitment. 

I would first recommend he go to his school's career center and get some help. Meet with a career advisor there, and see if they can help him with his resume and/or interview skills. If there are any career fairs coming up, he needs to go to them. Perhaps the department could also put him in touch with alumni who could mentor him or network with him. I would also have him post an anonymous version of his resume to r/resumes for feedback. 

On his resume, he could list his GPA (if 3.5+), relevant courses, and any big projects he worked on that showcase his skills (such as an undergraduate thesis). I would also check out any free certifications or courses he can pick up online in his spare time. He could try to develop skills like programming to break into another industry entirely. Not everyone works in their intended field, and I believe most people don't. If he's open to teaching, he could try teaching English online or abroad. I think anyone with a bachelor's degree can get that type of job. 

He could look into job placement centers or temp agencies. I also think he needs to just be applying, as much as possible. With no experience, it may be very well be a numbers game for him. He needs to take the initiative on this and be applying to new jobs daily if he can. Browse the popular job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn. Some people unfortunately have to send out over a hundred (or more) applications just to get one offer. This is the reality for many people, and it can take a while to find that first job, so please let him know he's not alone. In his case, I would be looking at any jobs that require a degree, to expand his search and just so he could get in somewhere. If he's willing to relocate or travel far, that may expand his search further. 

I would also try to view job posting requirements more as guidelines than anything else. Even if he doesn't meet all requirements, he should still apply. He doesn't have to be the most qualified applicant - only the most qualified applicant who's applied. If he can spin his experience and skills to be more relevant to positions, do that. 

I would encourage him to use his network too. Does he have any family, friends, professors, alumni, etc. whose companies are hiring? Could they put in a good word for him? In many cases, it is all about who you know."
7107,Thank you!
7108,Look for an assistantship. He can help a professor do research and get his degree paid for.
7109,Themuse.com was helpful to me post graduation.
7110,"Work experience. Some places do paid work experience, though I don’t know anything about the psychology field so it might not be true for his case."
7111,"Hey there. I understand how stressful the job search can be. I graduated last year and faced some major depression this year and only now do I see the end.

Did he have an idea of what he wanted to do with a psych degree? That would be helpful so I can offer some possible advice on how he might be able to get there.

If not, employers will probably look at his resume and see the psych degree and assume that he has a good idea about working with people. He can likely find a job anywhere working in Human Resources. Some companies I know offer leadership development programs and that may be something to look into. Sales can be lucrative and they hire just about anyone willing to gruel it out. Even marketing can be an option. Just because a listing doesn’t say they are specifically looking for someone with a psych degree doesn’t mean he shouldn’t apply to something he thinks can be interesting.

It’s probably not going to be the thing he really wants to do but it’s experience and he will probably have to go to grad school if he wants to work in psychology."
7112,"My bf got his degree in psych out of undergrad, and he ended up finding an entry level job with a clinical research company doing recruitment for studies. This was a few years ago, he stayed with clinical research and is working as a project manager now. Would definitely recommend looking on the clinical research side!"
7113,"He’s been looking for awhile and I want to help. His first job doesn’t necessarily need to be something he is absolutely over the moon about, but I know he would prefer something in his field and paying a livable wage. I just wanted some advice so I can support and help him reach his goals. He isn’t lazy AT ALL and is one of the hardest working people I know. He just needs some help and that’s nothing to be ashamed of."
7114,"First, I'm not trying to paint anyone as lazy so lets get that out of the way.

But I'm not sure how you want or can help him reach his goals besides showing support? You can't apply to jobs for him, you can't pick the jobs he likes or doesn't and so on. Job searching is actually a very personal isolated task because he knows himself best. The most you can do is proof read his resumes, cover letters and do mock interviews him, maybe attending career fairs with him or refer him to your current job? maybe family is willing to hire him? The rest is up is actually up to him not you.

Maybe he's unsure and you might have to tell him to do some research and have him present you with that information? Talk to him about these career paths and the why? Honestly, this is about as much help as you can give someone who is having difficulties finding their first career job.

&#x200B;

I want to be honest here. Based on what you've said so far in your original post (limited context) the most constructive feedback or insight I can see anyone giving is that It sounds a lot like your boyfriend isn't doing the bare basics. I could be wrong but I'm just trying to give you insight so you or others here can give better advice.

It's not necessarily that there isn't a job for him out there or that he doesn't have any experience. It could just be that he's not applying enough. When I was looking for my first software engineering job it took me 6 months to find a full time job. Each week I sent out an average of 50-80+ resumes and cover letters. I had them all recorded in excel and was able to refer back to him for why I got denied, when I last applied, when I could reapply, the feedback they gave and so on.

If he's already doing all this + more? Tell him to show you this data. Look at this data and try to find trends or heck even post/share some of that data here so people can give better insight to all the places he's been applying to."
7115,"As soon as I read the “doesn’t want to work additional job with no pay” I kinda was like okay....

I could be wrong, but your post makes it sound like he’s sitting around feeling sorry for himself. Has he been applying? What efforts has he made so far to break into the field?

OP, if your bf wants to get into his field, he has to be willing to work his ass off for it now since he didn’t work for it while he was in school. That means working a job while also doing an internship or volunteer work at a hospital or whatever he can find. If he’s serious about finding a job relevant to his major, then he has to buckle down and hit the ground running 

And as a side note, there is no reason he should be paycheck to paycheck as a server *unless* he’s being irresponsible with his finances. (assuming he’s healthy and has minimal if any debt). Cut out the fat - eat at home, don’t go out drinking or eating, get rid of Netflix or Spotify, go to a dirt cheap gym. 

You mention he’s saving to go to grad school but you also say he’s paycheck to paycheck? Which one is it? I ask because I feel like it’s common to say that you’re saving for something when you’re not actually saving. It’s just a filler word to comfort yourself thinking that you’re just in a temporary space until you “save enough to go to grad school”

Is he even sure he wants to stay in psych? Seems like it would be a potential mistake to just assume that grad school is the way to go without at least dabbling in the industry"
7116,"Hi, I just graduated with my Bachelors of Arts in Psychology this past Sunday. I currently work as a behavior technician and do therapy with kids with Autism. I don’t know if your bf is interested in working with kids, but it’s a good was to get psych field experience that doesn’t require a masters degree. Plus the pay is great!"
7117,If he likes working with kids he could be a middle or high school counselor. He could work with looking at brain patterns. Be a sort of scientist you know. See how people feel when this happens and what goes off in their brain
7118,"I may suggest he look into becoming a mental health technician at an in-patient hospital or facility/ center. You only need a bachelor’s degree plus you gain hands on experience. I’ve heard it is not the most pleasant of jobs, however, it’s a great start. 

Good luck to him! And you’re a great support he’s lucky to have!"
7119,"Play the odds and plant a SHIT TON of seeds.  Apply for everything of remote interest.  ... “must have 3 or 5 years experience, etc”... bull crap.  It’s just a barrier to see if anyone has the drive to learn or overcome challenges.  

A past team I was on would just put a “must have X experience” and would interview the most ballsy or ones that show they’re ready to learn fast, iterate, etc."
7120,"I know someone who did something similar. They ended up getting a job in medical administration. They started out as a full-time receptionist (low pay but had benefits) and was able to quickly move up into a supervisory role since they had their degree and most receptionists did not.

7122,">How to ***help*** bf find a job he ***likes***?

&#x200B;

I suppose he didn't want to get help himself? hence why you're posting for him? I think these deeper problems might be worth addressing when it comes to his sense of urgency and responsibilities. The stakes for him should be significantly bigger than it it for you, so this says a lot.

Next, let's address 'likes'.

A lot of people don't like their job but it's necessary for growth. I personally didn't start in a job I liked and if I was working in service or hospitality I don't think I'd be this picky for my first career job. He needs to learn how to critically think about Risk Vs. Reward and analytically make the best decisions for himself.

What I'd recommended is he start from the bottom up and build his experiences. If you two are living together and money isn't tight this should be quite easy for him to achieve. If he's living on his own then it's a matter of time and effort management, there's no easy way out. Otherwise, there's probably some internal mental health problem that is becoming a bigger impediment. (depressed, anxiety, insecure, imposter syndrome etc.)

Other things worth mentioning and since you're the one asking how he can be helped. Ask him how many job applications he sends out per day, weeks, and months? Have you seen his resumes? cover letters? where is he searching for jobs? Try to get a sense of how he's using his time and what strategies he's been using if any..This may very well be the case that he isn't doing anything to better his situation and I don't think even you can change that. He needs to start somewhere so he can see progress."
7123,If he really wants a job in his career field he’d volunteer time...
7124,"Unfortunately the answer is yes and no. I have talked to my supervisor about how I legitimately am thankful for the job and would ideally like to stay. And they understand they hard situation. But they mentioned “A transfer wouldn’t be possible for at least several years. We hired you here because we need you here”

And to be fair I 100% respect and understand that. Luckily I do know we are getting another college hire at the end of the summer. So I’m gonna try holding out and keep doing things around town to try and meet people until then. I don’t want to throw in the towel completely until probably the end of the year or beginning of next (assuming things are still not going super well then)"
7125,you successfully got a year of work under your belt! now you can start applying to new jobs in bigger cities and actually make a good income for the area 😁. You have made progress toward that and should be proud you’ve set yourself up well for future moves.
7126,"Rest assured it’s not Greenville. I’m in Virginia so I went North not South. I would really try hard though to try and connect with coworkers ahead of time if you know there’s others coming on with you or already in the office

Unfortunately friends up until this point in life where made out of forced proximity. When you live on your own and are out of school you’ve gotta go out of your way to to meet new people"
7127,"I feel you, if you check my post just under yours I’m in a really similar situation, except I just moved here and am on a one year contract. Do you know if there’s ways you can transfer?"
7128,It’s certainly something you have to balance. Having a prestigious job title and making good money is certainly nice. But what good are those things if you don’t have anyone in your life to well...experience life with? I suppose work life balance is called that for a reason. It’s important to have a career you want to be a part of but you shouldn’t sacrifice your social life or happiness along the way to do so

7130,"Hey, I get it. I did the same thing when I graduated in 2019. I moved home after 3-4 months and found another job there. Hang in there - you may feel stuck rn and that’s totally valid, but things are less hopeless than they may feel."
7131,Charlotte is great for leisure. I work at a company now in the exact same situation. My situation is being mid 20s and everyone else is retiree age. I mean sure it’s kinda hard being 20-40 years younger than everyone. I have no people I can hang out with that I work with. I haven’t made any church friends or people outside either. But I do still have friends from college that I chat with. I’ve been thinking about joining the Charlotte young pros group. I feel like that’s just a stop gap until I find out where more people my age actually are.
7132,"Oh okay, that does make sense yeah. And thankfully you have that to look forward to! Definitely things might be looking up. But of course it’s good to keep those possibilities open. If I were you I’d just keep doing what you’re doing until then, doing your best to keep yourself happy and enjoying the summer however you can, and then see how that works out. If it’s really awful, you can always keep your eyes peeled for other opportunities elsewhere."
7133,Time to start applying
7134,"I had the same issue when i moved for work. It just sucks, and i’m sure its even harder now. Maybe you could get a dog?"
7135,"That's why you don't make your life revolve around your ""dream job."" People are much more important than work. You are exchanging your time for money. That is it. It doesn't matter what you're doing."

7137,"Particular I’m in Banking and Finance which is why it’s kinda a tough situation. I’m currently making about $15 grand more than my friends who live in Charlotte and also have well paying entry level finance jobs. Hell im actually making about $5 grand more than one of my friends whose an accountant with a masters degree in Raleigh 

Part of my hesitation to job search is no matter what opportunity arose I’d be very likely taking a massive pay hit to live in a city that has a much higher cost of living. I know money isn’t everything (learned that the hard way). But it’s sort of the golden handcuff situation. Since I know I’d be moving lower on the career ladder to make the move"
7138,"Thanks for the advice. As a lot of people have mentioned I probably am going to start putting out some applications in places I’m more interested in living. I figure it can’t hurt and worse comes to worse if I go through the interview process and don’t like it I can always withdraw my search. It’s just a hard thing to accept that your first job isn’t how you envisioned it after putting so much into it. But I suppose that’s life sometime 

As for the older workers I wasn’t trying to come accords as ageist. My coworkers are nothing but friendly and helpful, but it’s just sort of mentally taxing since because of Covid I haven’t really been able to meet people my age in almost a full year. That weighs on you after awhile and certainly feels lonely at times"
7139,What do you mean sucked in?
7140,"To each their own but what you're describing (economies dying, people leaving, only old people staying there) describes a lot of parts of the country. It doesn't sound like fun for a young person. 

I'm not even from somewhere horrible and I still needed to screw off after college."
7141,"I was thinking about that, when I had the opportunity to do final interviews in Michigan for a job in my ""dream career"". I grew up in the PNW/west coast all my life and I really would like to stay here. I figured I could do it for a year or two if I had to...but I don't want to end up miserable, especially as a young adult with no friends in that area, whereas here, I have them in Oregon, WA and CA."
7142,"I live in Charlotte. It’s a pretty neat place, and I guarantee that the job you applied for isn’t the only available position here. It’s a growing city... I would say you should definitely keep looking for something else if this is where you want to be. Maybe part of not giving up on your dreams also means not settling for a city you’re unhappy in. What’s your career focus if you don’t mind me asking? This city is huge on finance, engineering, and marketing. There are other little niche roles as well, surely you might be able to find something else? I know all too well about being unhappy due to life’s circumstances and can guarantee you won’t feel this way forever."
7143,It's shitty because North Carolina. Go to NY or LA.
7144,Best thing about moving to Charlotte is you might be able to hang out with Ric Flair.
7145,I also live in Charlotte lol
7146,"Getting the first job really is the tough part. We're in an improving economy and now that you have some experience under your belt, you're in a much better position to aim for a job that you want.

All that said, where you live/where the job is is very important. I'd personally take a job I'm lukewarm about in a location I'm happy with over a dream job someplace I'd be miserable. But few things in life are permanent- view your current job as a stepping stone, because realistically, you're probably not going to be there forever.

On a personal note, being in an office with significantly older people never bothered me to a huge degree. I've been in said situations, and to an extent I kinda like it. Don't feel pressured to hang out with people I see day in and day out. Also I like the mentorship, and older coworkers treat me like their kids, since I am the age of their own children. Certainly makes the entry level job environment more comfortable when you have good older mentors, and that they know how to talk to someone your age."
7147,"I was born in Michigan and I can tell you this... if you aren’t actively trying to leave the state, it’s really easy to get sucked in. I relocated to the south over 10 years ago and never looked back."
7148,Ehh I’m actually from NC and prefer the south to larger massive northern cities. Never been to California so I can’t speak to how living in an LA or somewhere like a San Francisco would compare
7149,WHOOO!
7150,"Where in va are you located? 
Edit: Nevermind saw your other post. I’ll try to think of people maybe I can put you in touch with but also Considering your other post I highly recommend checking out a jiu jitsu place. Not only is it a great work out it’s also an awesome way to meet really cool people."
7151,"i hope so, what do you recommend for someone moving there right out of college"
7152,I don't know much about it because I've only visited never lived there but I've heard that there is good night life from friends who would go downtown there a lot. This was when I was going to Clemson so it's cool enough for kids there to wanna make the trip there rather than go downtown Clemson which says a lot imo cause it's an annoying drive. Also there is a restaurant there called Tupalow Honey and it is amazing I took that annoying drive a lot just for that place.

Then, I actually found someone at my college in my major and I actually went through her connections and I added some people whose names sounded familiar but I probably wouldn't have remembered them to search on my own. I also started liking people's posts too to show support. And I reshared posts that were either motivational, other people's work or accomplishments, or from events from my college. I think that gave me a good basis for a profile that looked like a well rounded student. Then I honestly just searched companies in my city and then I looked for people who were alumni who looked like they were somewhat active. I messaged them saying I go to their college and was interested in learning more about \_\_\_\_\_ career.

I went from graduation straight into college and let me tell you I messed up bad and was put in probation, stuff went down and I’m still trying to recover. I regret not standing up to my mom and taking a break from school.."
7189,"Honestly, for some people, this is normal. Now I don’t know if you can relate, but at least for me (18M, rising sophomore), parties don’t do anything for me. I’d rather hang out with a few close friends rather than a huge party."
7190,"I'm a bit of both. Could've studied smarter, AND also could've been more social. I also don't think I took the fullest advantage of my experience on both sides.

My last year of college is where I sorta tried to make up for it, trying leadership things and taking up swimming. I did my relative best. Better late than never, but damn, I had 4 years behind me already - and I still wasn't studying smart or prioritizing a little more time with my friends.Or even prioritizing better opportunities for self-care, like exercising and exploring the local landscape (I lived in a beach town, never took myself to the beach or local aquarium). Part of my reasoning for it was being kinda scared of burnout. But I was just terrible at cultivating myself lul. It's like I grafted a fruit onto my personal plant of life, instead of growing it myself since my first year."
7191,"Man I also have so many post college regrets. Went to a great school but never had any direction for what I wanted to do with my life and feel like I've still made little to no progress on that front. Was part of a fraternity but never felt like I fit in and never really became close friends with everyone the way I thought I would. I didn't keep in great contact with my HS friends (which I had a decent amount of) and now after years feel like it's becoming too late to reach back out. Also always wished that I could enjoy going to parties, bars, mixers, date functions like everyone else did yet each time I would try, not matter how drunk or drugged up I got, I would still be miserable.

Yet despite all this, I have a perfectly rehearsed response anytime anyone asks me how my college experience was that'll make it sound like the most amazing time ever."
7192,You can start college from the beginning again
7193,Yeah I wish I could have another go at being social too.
7194,"I went to three parties that were very stressful and the fourth there was a lot of cheese and bread which was fine.
For me I learned parties weren't my thing, maybe a couple of kickbacks with Uno.
I, like you kind of wish I had taken more advantage and gotten out a little bit more and made more friends. But I struggled in school and couldn't really extend myself any further except for the several friends I made. It's been a few years and I don't regret it steeply or anything. rather for me it just indicates what I want to have in my life and what an ideal day, week, month, season, year, etc looks like for me. Since then I've made a friend group at work, part of a book club online (yeah yeah I know) but the thing is I cherish the shit out of the time I'm spending and I think that's so damn important. I don't always cherish my time(like right now I'm moving and work is a cray cray) but knowing what makes time spent well spent and fitting that in where you can is good. Hopefully the wishes you had for that time help point you in the right direction."
7195,"Grabbing a bite with friends is always fun at least to me. At least you went to the bars and all that stuff. I went to a few parties, they were cool, but they weren't all that special. It's never too late to live your life again. In my opinion huge wild parties are overrated"
7196,"Well that's funny because i'm also 23 and I have just graduated and I do sometimes lay in bed at night thinking I should have studied harder. I'm now looking for a job and I feel unprepared. I had way too much fun in college and was too relaxed and when I look back I wish I could've spent more time on my studies.

However, I don't regret it. In my case, the job will come anyways. And you shouldn't regret it either. I even think you're at a better position than I am. Just remember so start having more fun. Life isn't over!"
7197,"I totally understand. In college, I was similar to you - not very social at all and would often mentally berate myself, as I sometimes felt that I was missing out on experiences that I would not be able to replicate later. On the other hand, I was very busy studying for my classes in a rigorous engineering major, conducting research, and working on personal projects, which later paid off as I received some fantastic letters of recommendation from professors and admission to several top grad programs. I also will be starting full-time work soon at a multinational engineering company that is very well-known in its field, for which I am extremely grateful during a pandemic when a lot of people are losing jobs or unable to find work. Even then, I occasionally still get minor regrets about things I could have done differently in undergrad, but then I remember that in all likelihood, someone else is looking at me and wishing they could trade places with me.

I should also add that even if you think your life right now is bland, the importance of financial security (especially during these times) cannot be overstated. The fact that you are stable in that area of your life really counts for a lot, and you should absolutely give yourself a hearty pat on the back for making it to this point."
7198,"You can go to college as many times as you want, OP. It's expensive but if you save up you can relive those years. You don't even have to get a degree, just pay for one year of classes and enjoy yourself. Only difference is you'll be a few years older."
7199,You have a second chance at social life if you go to business school
7200,"Maybe look into some organizations in your community? It might take awhile but doing that or community service will at least help you meet a ton of people. They might guide you to more people, etc. ."
7201,Maybe you're just a boring person.
7202,"Here are some that I have been into recently: 



-shooting, find a range nearby that has rentals, people are usually friendly to beginners




-archery, you can pick this up for under 20 bucks, just youtube backyard bowyer and how to make pvc bows



-trail running, look up some trails nearby, costs nothing to get started, but be careful not to twist an ankle"
7203,i was thinking of cooking lessons ... something i have always enjoyed & done a lot when i was younger and would like to learn more complex techniques
7204,"You can never go wrong by cracking open a book! I know it's not the most *exciting* idea compared to others' posts, but it's simple, free, and beneficial. Doesn't require much of your energy either. I try to do my best and put my phone down for a good 30 minutes and read some of my books that I have laying around."
7205,"I've found that it's about building habits, and what helps me build habits is to have a goal in mind. Last year I fell into the same rut, I was just going to work, eating out, coming home and playing video games or watching YouTube. Nothing wrong with that but I realized I wasn't satisfied with just that, so I set some goals for myself, some of which have successfully converted into habits and hobbies and others that haven't.

*  
I've enjoyed cooking before, so I decided to host dinners with my friends more often, forcing me to practice and experiment. Upside is I also save much more money now and can make some decent meals to bring in for lunch.

* 
I used to love reading as a kid so I set myself a book goal for the year, and I've just fallen into reading on my commute, when I get home, and just on the weekends. I also joined a book club which let me meet new people and more actively engage my reading.

* I wanted to improve my Mandarin to better understand my culture and communicate with my grandparents so I've used some free online sources, and I've also started volunteering at a non-profit legal clinic for the local Asian community. 

* Personal finance is a big pet project of mine, so I searched and signed up for non-profits that would allow me to teach students and do a bit of outreach. 

* I'm a hobby artist, but I'm afraid of committing myself to more intensive pieces, so I set myself a goal of sketching something quick a day. It worked for a bit, but never stuck, which is unfortunate, but I'm also trying to go to more local art museums, galleries, and exhibits to compensate.

* I had a gym routine down, but it was uninspiring and I didn't feel like I was gaining anything from it. Luckily my new apartment has a punching bag and I used to do taekwondo and kickboxing as a kid, so I've been building my own kickboxing routines which has helped my gym motivation immensely. 

Not all of these was at the same time, and some hobbies wax and wane with time, but keeping a goal in mind has kept me busy and enjoying the hours of life that I don't spend stuck at work."
7206,"archery is so fun! i think i did it once as a kid at camp. i just took a class and i was thinking that this is what people who play golf must feel because it's probably not that interesting just watching it but doing it is so different. i guess this goes for a lot of sports. but golf just seems so boring to me lol. i enjoy doing sports more than watching in general. although, i love watching tennis."
7207,"That’s a great idea, I love to cook so I might have to look into this"
7208,thanks! i already incorporate reading into my lifestyle though.
7209,"Easier, and more enjoyable because you get to drink while practicing"
7210,"Honestly the easiest thing would be tagging along with a hobby that one of your friends does. It's really hard to stay motivated doing a hobby by yourself unless if it's something you really can't do with other people. A lot of the hobbies you listed that your friends have are a lot of fun to do in groups and aren't that hard to do as a beginner so I recommend joining for one of those! Everything is more fun with friends, and since you already have friends that's half the battle!"
7211,"For a while I felt like I was the only one! Winter grad here! I actually walk on Thursday (lmao shit). For the past two months I’ve been feeling  Incredibly lost and realized a lot of it has to do with 1. Not having college groups to rely on 2. Realizing college made me lose a lot of my childhood/high school hobbies because I dedicated so much time to academics and 3. I’m bored and don’t know where to begin again.

The job search has been grueling so I finally s raped together some money and reached out to family up in New England and make a lil skiing trip. It has been really helpful finding little getaways, even if they are by myself.

I was an athlete in college and found it good to put my boredom in keeping active. When I’m too lazy, I put together a list of movies/shows I never watched and asked my friends for a bunch of recommendations. I’m finally accepting that I can use this time to get to know myself again and you deserve it too! Hmu if you wanna play Minecraft lol best of luck!"
7212,"You need a creative outlet. The perfect life balance is sleep, eat, work, exercise and create. You can certainly give music a go. I'm addicted to playing guitar, drawing and building things physically. I feel super satisfied with my skills and feel that they give me a lot of fulfillment, individuality and character as a person."
7213,perfect! then my suggestion can be disregarded lol
7214,ah but your advice applies to me old chap
7215,I did the same thing! It’s surprisingly a lot easier this time around.
7216,I started taking up piano. I always wanted to learn and it’s starting to click. I only practice for about a half hour a day. But the rest of my day is spent by me staring at my phone and watching something on tv. I took up crochet to keep my hands busy and off my phone. It’s also nice to have a tangible thing at the end of a craft. I still suck at crochet but I know I’ll get better if I keep practicing. I’m gonna get a dog soon and hopefully it’ll give me a reason to be outside for an hour a day. i can’t wait to go back for a masters just because I miss school and having a purpose and a task.
7217,I got into golf after college. It’s a lot of fun and you can always improve
7218,Creek fishing is very fun and good exercise
7219,this sounds lovely - music would be a great option!! & happy cake day :)
7220,"Not really. For example, I work in an office setting doing analytical work and I do 12 hr days 3 or 4 days a week. Every week I get a 3 or 4 day weekend, and  if Im saving up money for something I can just work more days."
7221,What’s your job now?
7222,"There are hundreds of thousands of different jobs in the world, plenty of which don’t work 9-5 or in offices. Do you oppose the office life or the 9-5? Plenty of careers and jobs are looking for night shift workers since few people are looking for those positions. Positions like security guards, warehouse workers, etc. Jobs in nursing, food, retail, trades are more hands on than office jobs. Many of them have different hours as well. 

Do you want to attend college or training? Trade school is a good option for those that oppose desk work and has good pay.

The 9-5 office life isn’t the only way to make a living, but your best bet at finding a position that works for you is defining the things that you want so that people can give better suggestions."
7223,Fellow lab tech here! I feel the same about my job. I’m not sure why more people don’t consider going into science...
7224,"Different jobs fit with different life stages.  

At 23, I thought death was preferable to spending 8 hours a day in a cubicle (sandwiched between traffic jam commutes).  

I went off to Japan and taught English for a couple of years. (Don’t do this, by the way—the job options have changed.). 

After more schooling (and debt), I worked some very long-houred professional jobs. It wrecked my personal life.    

I went off to China for a couple of years. Interesting, but saved very little money.

Then I was a contractor back in the USA. I prayed for a stable job, even though I was surviving ok.  

I’m currently in a stable job with benefits. I finally really value what a 9-5 salaried job provides. The ability to plan ahead to meet friends on a certain day, and some confidence that I can survive most common problems without wondering about my insurance or my next client. The job is just a job, and I forget about it when I walk out of the office."
7225,"I was never able to finish my degree, would need three full semesters to finish and would need $8000 up front to be able to go back.  I would kill for a 9-5 office job compared to who will hire me without that degree..."
7226,"It's not the only option, as others have outlined below, it's just that a lot of Boomers seem to think that's the only option."
7227,What do you do that allows this schedule?
7228,I'm a contractor/analyst in the defense industry. Our tech support people work the same schedule though.
7229,"9-5 is honestly fine and if your motivations for working are “not being like other people” you’ll have a hard time finding something you like. 

There’s lots of non 9-5 jobs out there as you know, and other commenters said. But if you’re trying to find what you like and ignoring a whole subset of jobs JUST for the reason that you want to be unlike everybody else, there’s a good chance the job you actually enjoy will be in there and you won’t know.

I really hated the thought of working in an office for most of my life. I wanted to be an artist or work in an NGO and travel. Then I got an office job during/right out of school, thinking “I’ll just make myself do this for two years until I pay off my loans and then I’m outta here”. 

Now I actually really enjoy my job. In a lot of ways it’s good for me, and includes things I value. I feel like I’m doing meaningful things. And I have so much more spare time now that I’m not in school that I can use to enjoy my hobbies, see friends, and go on trips.

Will I be here forever? No, but I’m glad I picked this now.

Plus I do want to impress that nothing has to be forever. Most people switch jobs every 5 years. So anybody could do an office job for 5 years, work or volunteer overseas for another 5 years, come back and get a 1 year diploma and switch fields for 5 years, learn something on the side and switch fields again for another five years. 

There’s other things to consider too... you don’t care about the money NOW but you will when you want to retire and you don’t have any savings. This isn’t a reason to jump into a job you hate but something you have to consider. You have to make enough money to live and die on SOMEHOW, so find at least one thing you like that actually makes money and at the very least do it as a side hustle to build up savings. You also need money for most life experiences. You won’t be able to live a different or special life if you’re too poor to ever afford anything."
7230,I think I'm scared of a lot of things but I think you mostly described them like sitting at a computer all day or wearing a suit all day.
7231,"Aircraft mechanic here. 

I work 4 10 hour shifts, from 4:30pm-3am and I’m enjoying it. It’s whatever you make of your life with what you enjoy"
7232,If I just sit in front of a computer screen all day I oppose it but I don't necessarily hate it.
7233,Because no one is guiding me how to be a lab man.
7234,[deleted]
7235,This sounds very similar to what Adam Devine’s character in Righteous Gemstones would say lol
7236,"Well I don’t live in the US, so, you can not directly compare the money I make here to the US salaries. But the company I work for have several locations in the US and I know the salaries they pay in the US for my same position and it is around $120-130k a year."
7237,"9-5 office work isn’t so bad, don’t knock it til you try it. My hours, location, type of work and coworkers are all stable, compared to working in retail/hospitality where I would start at the crack of dawn and get called in at short notice. It’s good money and it doesn’t mean you have to do it forever. My life is far from average and yours will only be average if you make it so. 

Also, I would be careful with the “don’t wanna follow the pack” mentality. I used to think like that and it only made it harder to get to where I wanted to be and accept that being like everyone else in some ways isn’t the worst thing in the world. Sometimes it’s comforting to know that a lot of people are in the same position."
7238,Ya I'm young so I want to be active. An office job is ok when I'm like 40 but I'm not so enthusiastic about it now.
7239,"This thread is relatively old but I’m still going to post this. I’m currently in a solo trip throughout Southeast Asia and I’ve met people with completely different lifestyles that I would have ever imagined. I’m not saying this is an option for everyone but it’s an option. I’ve met plenty of people that have been working 4-8 months in their home countries/Australia/wherever and then traveling 6 months around Asia. They find some more work at bars or hostels and eventually go travel the world again. 

I’m not saying this is what you should do but it’s just an explanations that in the modern world there’s more to life than just office jobs. If you want money then fine, but you can do other things too."
7240,Can you describe what you do at your job more? I’m a senior in nursing school but I think I hate traditional nursing and I’d like to go into research. Did you go to grad school?
7241,"I’m a Manufacturing Engineer focused on metals transformations. Sorry for the late response, I’m on vacations and was sleeping."

7243,"So don’t do the job you hate—but make a plan. Save up a bit of money, and then try something else. The youth and energy you have now is unlikely to be available even 10 years later."
7244,"Saw the odd combination of paper mill, breweries and medical device companies and knew it immediately.

Hoping to become one myself in a few years."
7245,"I work 9 hour days, but I get every other Friday off. I personally love my schedule and stability, and especially my 3 day weekends. However, I know several servers/bartenders who make as much or more money than I do and work less hours. My job allows me to wear jeans, but I typically wear khakis and a blouse anyway just because I feel more put together. There are all sorts of options out there for you. 

I interviewed for a job that asked me to travel for 6-8 months at a time, and I'd be out in the field doing work the entire time. I turned it down since I have a significant other and pets, I didn't want to be away from home so much. But something like that may be an option for you if you like to travel."
7246,It’s not the only option for ANY people
7247,As a mechanic I often think about wanting to work for a fleet that makes me work nights because man summers are hot and nights make every workday 70-80 degrees  instead of 95 to 105 degrees
7248,Go be a mechanic you can usually get a job with no degree doing maintenance like oil changes tires and then after a while move into an apprenticeship and then be a mechanic making good money and most shops at the worst are Monday through Saturday so you'd get a day off during the week and have sunday off. Working something like 7-4 or 8-5. However that is if you were willing to get a physically demanding job.

7250,"Graduated in Economics and worked first in a Private Asset Manager and now I'm in a middle office role in Hedge Fund Admin. I can say with absolute certainty, you'll be fine. 

Lol my degree basically thought me nothing about working in finance. You'll receive all the training you need on the job. The degree just shows employers you have the capacity to learn said information and the discipline to be good at your job. 

My advice? Really brush up on your excel skills and if you can, get some python coding experience. The vast majority of your first year or two in Finance will be spend being a spreadsheet monkey"
7251,"I’m not OP, but thanks for saying this. I never felt solid about having learned photoshop and whatnot."
7252,"Almost Everyone goes through the same thing. Colleges just cram stuff in you. Retention is super low. You learn on the job. You’ll use 5-10% - rest, you’ll learn and relearn. So, just go and get yourself a job and start. You’ll struggle for 1-3 years and it’ll get easy and boring after that. Try to make as much money as you can a early as you can. And save/invest it well."
7253,Yeah I was curious what coding I should get. Imma do that and get an excel certification
7254,Relatively recent grad here (not in finance)... I didn’t learn basically anything in college that I use in my job. I think most employers recognize this and will train you. Trust me you’ll learn more in a couple months of working than you did in 4 years of “school”. Be confident!! You just need to start working to get over that feeling haha!
7255,"Someone employing entry-level people would probably rather have an employee coming in thinking they know nothing rather than an employee coming in thinking they know everything.  If you are willing to learn how they do things, you’ll do just fine. 

Wells or boa?"
7256,"chem degree here! I used to be the same exact way, especially during interviews I was so nervous they would ask me a chemistry question and I wouldn’t completely not know it because I as well didn’t retain a single thing from uni. I now work in a cryobiology lab, complete opposite of my field, where I got all the necessary training. you’re not expected to be a genius. you’re not expected to be perfect. you’re going to trip and fall and stand back up. I promise you, it’s going to be okay. I say this as someone who was extremely terrified of the real world after university because my whole life was school. you got this!"
7257,"On the job training is better than any info college can give you. That goes for undergrad at least. When you get a position soak up all the info they give you and that'll help tremendously. Don't worry about info retention, you'll know more than you think."
7258,"Hey man, I am 24 (M) in the midwest and i also studied finance. Feel free to message me if you want to chat. I know i didn't graduate during a pandemic, but the feeling of incompetence and inability to find a job is pretty fresh in my mind. 

Don't give up, keep looking, keep applying, and BUFF up your linkedin as much as you can. this is how i got my job, just by messaging people form my school on there. you'll land something, and it a couple years you'll likely be pulling 60-70k.

Cheers mate, you got this."
7259,I am in the Charlotte area and I am sure you’ll be fine. Vanguard used to hire tons of people in your shoes. I used to work there. I wouldn’t worry at all. You’ll be fine.
7260,Im studying IT too and I also feel like I didn’t learn much.  I have a year left but I’m so worried about job interviews. I’m worried they’re gonna ask me an IT question and I wouldn’t know the answer to it
7261,"My concentration is in risk mgmt and insurance, so I won’t be touching banks unless I’m a mortgage consultant.

Also everyone has a risk management division, but yeah🤷‍♂️"
7262,"Start investing and saving money. Make it into a number game. My advice, you need to partially live your life by some sort of numerical metric, I guess.

My return on investment stats is a good way for me to track my progress through the years. This is fucking depressing but it works.

I'm turning into my fucking dad, bitching over electricity costs and being overcharged 25 cents on milk, but it keeps me stimulated. Makes me believe in something."
7263,"In a lot of ways, its great. I have money for stuff, i have a job, i have a place to live on my own... But it also feels weird. Like, ok, now what? Whats my goal, what do i do now? I dont even mean a legacy per se, i just want something to work towards."
7264,"On the bright side, you have the opportunity to be a quiet millionaire in 20-40 years by investing in low cost index funds and well performing growth stocks, or a fucking REIT - jesus listen to me talking about REITs, you believe this shit. I had so much imagination and hope when I was younger. The light inside has gone out.

Anyways, money will be awesome to have in your older age when some of your friends start to die from cancer, heart disease, car accidents and you don't give a fuck anymore - I'm in my mid 20s and it's already started, I don't think the therapy is working."
7265,"Man there seems to be a lot of unhappy people in this thread. Thought I'd drop my 2 cents:

For me, I was able to find fulfillment with a lot of introspection, effort, and distance. I too was on the track of upper-middle class success: graduate with a valuable degree from a reputable university, get a high paying job, ???, happiness (?). This failed miserably as I spiraled into a horrible existential depression post school.

What worked for me was several things:

* Retracing my family ancestry. Really reflecting on my family's path and how they ended up where they are today. For me, this meant going back to China and retracing our immigrant roots and putting together the pieces of the cultural differences my family and I have. Learning the history of my family and what they and their ancestors went through by learning about historical events
* Studying a bit of sociology. Breaking down how our society is organized globally socially. What are social classes? What differences are there? Why do they act differently? This meant doing some immersive anthropology, like working in working class jobs around people of a lower social class than the ones I grew up with. Really trying to understand and connecting with others and gapping whatever differences exist.
* Traveling. At least for me, I was fortunate enough to be able to do some solo-backpacking, which was really meaningful. Not only did it show me how countries are different, it gave me the confidence to really just go wherever I wanted in the world, if I really wanted to. I know this is a huge privilege, but it definitely helped answer the why's I had in the world.
* Understanding how the world is run. Getting into the nitty gritties of how our society works. From government to supply chains to culture, our world is a huge organism with lots and lots of moving parts. Stopping to appreciate things like how taxes work or monetary systems are established and maintained really gave me perspective. Ex: Money isn't just something one should chase after, it should be understood from the same perspective of the architects that created it.
* Doing nothing. Seriously. I feel like society just makes us hustle to get from pt A to pt B as quickly as possible, and we never get a chance to really stop and ponder. I honestly think in our attention economy, doing nothing is a skill, and we shouldn't feel ""guilty"" for not doing anything. For me, doing nothing helped create an atmosphere where I felt free to be curious.
* Prioritizing creative expression. From drawing to composing music, I think it's really important that we express ourselves on a regular basis. Making time to do little things like drawing a picture or translating a feeling into physical form is deeply rewarding.

Now, I realize that I likely have a lot of privilege to be able to do all these things. But I think everyone deserves to feel content in life, and I really don't think there are shortcuts. Lastly, I have found that prioritizing connecting to all living things has really helped me feel fulfilled. I think humans are made to connect, and I think for the first time in history, we can really connect with all people and animals on the planet with the aid of technology. Social constructs like gender, race, sexuality, etc. aside, we really are all sharing this small blue planet, and we all wish to understand and be understood by each other.

Also, I skimmed a lot of books. There are a LOT of books out there, and I use Goodreads to track what books I've read / want to read. Even if you don't end up reading the book, it's good to know what kinds of books even exist out there than not. (For reference, my to read list is nearing 1000 books! but I've only read about 20-30 of them probably :P).

I definitely don't see myself as some kind of guru with all the answers, but I'm a lot happier now than I was a couple years ago.

edit: In retrospect, I'd say the common theme in all my suggestions is the prioritization of freedom. I think humans crave freedom more than anything else, and structuring my life around prioritizing that has made me a very content person :) The more you stop caring about things you don't care about anymore, the more you start caring about things you do."
7266,"Just graduated and on top of this pandemic and quarantining I don’t know when I’ll ever feel like working. I’m not lazy, I’ve had jobs and internships before but everything going forward seems hopeless and unfulfilling and I don’t want to get stuck in a shitty job that i hate. I’m not ready to be working full time and I’ve only found a handful of jobs that sounded interesting that I applied to but heard nothing back which isn’t helping"
7267,"Feel fortunate...I graduated two years ago, I don't have anything I always wanted, I'm still looking for a decent job, struggling to make more than 30$, no clothes, just one pair of shoes. I'm enrolled in a Masters Degree Program with no immediate job opening. I envy you...live in a third world shithole"
7268,"They're companies that buy, manage, maintain, various types of real estate. They're bound by many laws, obligated to do this and that. They generally pay out dividends, the price of shares can go up too, but generally do so slowly. REITs got wrecked by COVID.

It's a way to invest in real estate without all the problems or headaches of investing in real estate. And it's liquid, you can sell your shares easily, unlike a house. But doesn't have the tax benefits of home ownership, so it doesn't have the main advantage as you can see.

Lot of people on reddit caution against chasing dividends, idk.

check out /r/investing /r/stocks /r/personalfinance"
7269,I feel you. I graduated from college with a basic business degree because nothing specific interested me and now I don't know how to start looking for a job because 1) I have no interest in business & 2) I feel like I really did not learn anything in college because my degree was so broad. Also have no confidence on how to sell myself to employers so I'm feeling v lost too
7270,"There’s a painting, or maybe a drawing, showing a wall with a series of ladders and stairways with a clear goal to get to the top representing grade school and college. At the top, there is a wide open plain with no path forward, with someone standing at the top of the stairs looking out over it. 

I’ve never been able to find it again, but I’ve never seen anything that represented how I felt better than that drawing did."
7271,"well you at least have something you can work towards:

figuring out what is you want to work towards. time to try a whole bunch of different shit and see what sticks"
7272,"I've seen it, on reddit. Id have to Google it, but I know exactly what you mean. It fits what I am to a T right now. And how I've been after graduation."
7273,wtf is a REIT (from a 23 y/o)
7274,"I guess short term my “goals” are really more personal, like finishing up a project or starting some new aspect of my hobby. Long term it’s really more like “get another 25k in my home down payment fund” or things of that nature"
7275,"I also graduated two years ago but I still have a goal to get a green card. Meanwhile I started indulging in things I've never done before. I started playing piano, flute and doing other music related things. I also took some classes online on udemy, etc. Now im studying for gre in case I need to go for my masters to stay in the states. After that, I plan to pursue my passion of being a designer instead of an engineer. 

All of that is to say, indulge in the things you couldn't do before. If you have a slight feeling that you might enjoy something, go for it. This is the time to experiment and follow your heart. Just make sure you don't heavily impact your job performance. 

There is still is so much to see and do. There are many places to travel to and explore, activites to take part in and enjoy, different people to interact with and learn from, meeting a significant other to bond with, etc. Be creative and look forward to the future."
7276,"Thanks! I'm glad you are entering a stage of life of exploration, freedom, and healing.

Regarding traveling:

\- Pack light. I never brought anything more substantial than a carry on. The less you have to worry about, the better.

\- Websites like SkyScanner and Google flights are good for booking.

\- I stayed in hostels that I found on Agoda/Expedia/Booking etc. I prioritized frugality over comfort, but to each their own. It was fine most of the time.

\- I went solo, and would meet other friends along the way. Sometimes I'd meet up with friends in the place I was visiting and crash / do stuff with them.

This was just my experience, I think everyone has a different relationship with traveling and creates their own strategy for doing so. There isn't a right answer! All in all, trust yourself, be safe, and have fun!"
7277,"Thanks so much and totally, I interestingly did a ton of traveling in 2019, interestingly all over Asia as well, but I have family in Asia, so little easier there. Other continents would be a newer experience for me. Do you meet other friends when you travel that you already know ahead or are you meeting them brand new once you're physically there, I assume I think many hostels have events of their own for solo travelers, but looking options and experiences."
7278,"Quick phone reply so please excuse lack of detail and brevity: I lived in a van driving through the southwest of the US, Berlin, Thailand, Mexico, and China. I also went to Japan and South Korea on a different trip.

For Americans specifically, I think visiting a country closest to your “race” is a good experience especially after working. America is a unique country in that it’s an “idea” — that everyone should have equal opportunity regardless of identity. However, in other countries, race is mostly controlled for, so it’s easier to observe class differences in homogeneous countries while controlling for race. I think this is useful to unlearning intrinsic racism built into American society."
7279,Yep. Try reading some philosophy. Absurdism and existentialism helped me cope and figure out a path forward once I realized life is kinda bullshit and meaningless.
7280,Figure out how to break into that new field.
7281,"So I had the same feeling of all my goals being achieved and a little bit of panic about how rote and.... *forever* things started to feel.

Anyways this isn’t solid financial advice, but I bought a house and now I have a never ending list of things to achieve. 

You can find other intermediary goals though, like, saving up to travel, buying a piece of furniture you’ve always wanted. I always wanted a Murphy bed, so I got a Murphy bed. Getting good at a hobby? Idk. Shit will decouple mentally from the really solid markers school gave you, eventually, it just takes a while, to start feeling your own goal posts.  

Anyways, there’s my 2 cents."
7282,"If I can say something on this as someone who graduated 6 years ago from my bachelors and 2 years ago from my masters. (I'm 28 y/o based in the UK)

Feeling this way after graduation is completely normal. If there's one thing we're not taught about in education, it's how to deal with being in the big wide world. We're no longer in our education bubble once we graduate, and everything we think will make us happy i.e. stable job, regular income, roof over our head etc. doesn't actually leave us with any fulfillment. 

After I graduated, I didn't really know what I was doing. I had a number of different jobs in the first 2-3 years, but none of them left me satisfied or happy really. I was just going through the motions and knew there was more I could offer. This was the main reason I studied for a masters because I found something that I had a passion for and it excited me. 

With your position OP, I'm assuming you're early 20's? If so, you have the rest of your 20's to discover more about what it is you enjoy and explore new things. There's a lot of pressure on us as a society to have everything figured out in our 20's, and even more so when we've gone to universityy/college. It's good that you're acknowledging how you're feeling because you are now able to reflect on what it is you enjoy and what you want from life in the next 5-10+ years.

If there's any advice I can give, it's to brain dump all your thoughts on a piece of paper - what you like/dislike, what you see your ideal career as, what you enjoy doing in your spare time, what you would love to learn, the places you would love to travel etc. That way you can see everything in front of you and it can give you a picture of what you can work towards.

The reality is many of us will go through this period in our lives, especially in our 20's. You're not alone in this."
7283,"Agreed. Stuff like that helps a lot, but it also feels like im kinda wasting time ""now""."
7284,"good read. just kind of curious, did you leave your job to be able to do all these things?"
7285,"This was an incredible writeup and I feel it as well, I also interestingly left my job for a lot of my passions and to spend time figuring life out and what I really enjoyed. 

Wondering for your travels, how did you plan the logistics? Did you just pack a bag, bought a plane ticket, and by yourself just flew to another country? Did you stay at hostels or rent a place? Were you part of a travel group or totally solo and independent?"
7286,"For sure. I think this is my biggest thing. What to do. There's so many hobbies to try, places to travel. I just need ideas sometimes, ya know?"
7287,"Yeah, I was working at a tech firm but left after 8 months. To be transparent I was 23 at the time with about 45k USD savings at the time so I definitely had a significant safety net. I spent the next 2 years working odd jobs / teaching / pondering while living off that nest egg.

I already mentioned I was extremely privileged and but I will reemphasize it. I think experencing what I discovered is possible with less savings though as I was living in a high COL area, but living relatively frugally if that makes sense (high rent, low excess spending). For example, I spent about 5-6k backpacking for 4 months. I want to share what I learned with others though so feel free to DM me or reply with any questions you have!"
7288,Yeah that's the current goal.
7289,Where did you backpack to if you don’t mind me asking?
7290,No. I was married at 21.
7291,"See, here is where I would argue that that is not ""plenty of time"". I don't want to exist to only have 4 hours to myself at night to relax... All so what? The billionaire at the top of food chain can get richer, meanwhile everyone else would die for a raise. 

It's just not how the world should work man."
7292,"Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. Once you graduate the achievements laid out for you disappear and it feels sort of like floating aimlessly in space, I'll try to stay in the present and be okay with juts existing"
7293,"I'm working at an in-house graphic designer for a beauty clinic from 8AM-5PM on weekdays and 8AM-12PM on Sat. No OTP. Mediocre salary etc...

At first glance you might think this is a horrible place to work but the truth is this one is the MOST lax company I've worked for:

* Salary is still deducted if you come in late too often, but aside from that, no punishment nor verbal warning even if you do it EVERYDAY as long as you can meet the deadlines.
* Your work hours is YOURS time, you can use it whatever you please (surf the internet, play video game,...) at long at you finish yours work on time.
* No dressing code or any regulation. You can pretty much walk out of the company during working hours, go buy some coffee and then go back to work. No probs.

Basically, my team almost have *total freedom* during those 8 hours/day, it's up to us to decide how to use it as long as we can deliver.

IMO, it's not the 9-5 jobs are problem itself but the lack of freedom, which make it feels like your time being taken away. That's why you don't see people complain if they get to play video game/surf reddit all day and still get paid."
7294,"Dude I love my 9-5. Im usually home by 5:30, plenty of time to make dinner, go for a jog, play some video games, and watch a show. The routine is nice. So far the only downside is every time you need to do something important during the week the place is closed by the time you're off work."
7295,You described it super well. The achievements now become enjoying what you have a making a wonderful life for yourself! I am also guessing you are in your 20s. You have soooooo much growing up to do. Buckle up. It's exciting!
7296,"This right here. I live in the future. I’ve never once learned to live in the present and once I started working in then 9-5 world, I started to really crumble."
7297,"Thats where you're wrong, I DO get depressed 😎"
7298,"I work for a place very similar to this; amazing company, fun job, great benefits and my shifts are usually mine as long as I finish what one or two tasks need to be completed and we deliver with our events at the end of the day. Even still, this being my first full time, 9 to 5 I am absolutely miserable and I have been kind of losing my mind. I honestly am struggling with the idea that this is something I can do everyday, save for two days off, for the rest of my life. I hope this is something that goes away, but I feel you OP, I feel you."
7299,"I graduated last summer, I just got a job as customer service for a postal company and I have worked there for about 1.5 months. I don’t really get depressed about it because I get that sweet sweet cash money"
7300,"Eh, not as bad as you might imagine. I’m in a field that allows me to work remotely, which adds a ton of flexibility to my days. I’d say take it day by day and don’t overthink the future too much.

The 9am-9pm days back in school were crazy, and fun, to some extent… but I enjoy having a means to explore some of life’s other passions."
7301,Agreed I don’t think that’s plenty of time either but to each their own
7302,"Well it is a bit rough at first, but usually i find comfort in my colleges and try to become friendly with them. Plus if the company is good you get vacation/off days and can have the weekends to yourself, id much rather be doing the 9-5 at a desk/work place than the grueling 12-14 hour shifts in BOH cooking and managing a team."
7303,"Yep, I'm trying to stay active outside of work, hoping to become a part of a local communities so I can feel less out of place. Thanks for the advice!"
7304,"Yep the 9-5 office job is definitely cushy compared to other kinds of work, it's important to keep perspective"
7305,"I used to do 7-3 when I worked 8 hour shifts but now I do 6-4 and have wednesdays off. Shit ton of free time imo.

I’ll be the first to agree that starting at 9 and ending at 5 is the worst thing. I know it’s the same hours worked but it’s so much better coming home in the early afternoon and having a day to look forward to. The 4/10 schedule made it even better because every day is a Thursday or Friday now. Not all jobs will let you do stuff like this though so you just have to make the best of it or find a place that fits your style."
7306,"Money for sure helps, especially when you've been broke your whole life"
7307,"I work 4 10's and I take it day by day. I exercise, I study, and I watch TV in my free time and on my breaks/lunches."
7308,Not really. But hey I'm still a mf in college so what do I know?
7309,"u/No-Conversation2755

What you want is to be FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early), which is also what I aim for. The idea is to build streams of passive incomes whether from investments or other methods (loan, stock, blog...) and gain enough funds to the point you can live off them without having to work or just do minimum amount of it.

For example, my parents have 10 units for renting and my dad no longer have to work (Production manager). But he still need to do maintenance work like repaint the rooms, fix the broken pipes, check the sewage system...

My personal goal is to build some blogs that I can generate passive incomes from them. Then I will switch from working full-time to working part time. With that, I can gain more freedom without suffering from lack of finance.

But the idea of ""freedom"" varies from people to people, I'm 100% content with my current living condition without desire for more luxuries (Big house, brand new car, brand clothing,...) . So my method to reach it might not be suitable for you, like ""working for a mediocre but lax company and use the extra time for personal projects"".

Some guys may prefer going hard, moving up the ladder to earn as much income as possible until their 40s then pull the trigger.

It's up to you to decide. Here the sub ( r/financialindependence) if you want to know more about being FIRE."
7310,"My last year. Like I feel dread in the sense that meeting up with people is going to be a lot harder and it’s a end of a chapter. 

But looking forward to my education coming to an end because now I can enjoy life and not have my life revolve around random dates my professors have set."
7311,"I would suggest mindfulness meditation and practicing conscientious gratitude.

Beyond that, think of stuff you are truly passionate about and do that as a side hustle and see if you can make it a business. Many people are perfectly happy in a 9-5, but it takes effort to come to peace with it and find value in your work."
7312,"This is literally me right now. I graduated with a chemical engineering degree, have been fortunate enough to be working with a very reputable company. But I feel so stagnant now. It's like my existence has no meaning now? I feel like I've suddenly hit the brakes and my sense of self worth is eroding. I've been considering studying for the Mcat because I always wanted to pursue medicine when I first started university but 'settled' with engineering because I wanted a secure fall back plan. Argh! I don't know what to do right now to be honest."
7313,now thats an epic gamer move 😎😎
7314,"I got out of sixth form and straight into the workplace as a degree apprentice, I quite like the 8-4/9-5 workday bc I have structure to my day.

Even when I finish I have time to go out play football or video games and make some food for dinner"
7315,"Really depends on what job you'd be doing, salary, benefits and who you will be working with. So far I don't mind the fact that I'd have to do a 9-5 forever because this job is pretty cushy. Good salary, pto and vacation, benefits and awesome co workers. When I had to do retail I couldnt take it for more than a few months. After work I still have around 6-7 hours of freetime to play games and do whatever. If I ever start feeling unmotivated I think about how much I'd be earning that day and dream up stuff to buy haha"
7316,"I'm 25. When I first graduated college, I had a glimmer of hope to climb the corporate ladder to the top by the time I was 50. After this last year with the pandemic, it really changed my perspective on working and now I just want to invest/save enough money to live the simple life."
7317,Antidepressants 🤷‍♂️
7318,"What year? I started feeling this dread in senior year, knowing college was coming to an end"
7319,"Yeah I'm realizing my privilege because like you guys, my job is incredibly chill. It doesn't remove that feeling of dread but it does numb it a little. I'll see how I feel a few months down the line, I'm wishing you the best of luck in navigating these feelings too"
7320,"Sorry for the misunderstanding but I used “cash” as an expression. I get digital money. Also, you can just take out the money to cash at one of those machines right? (Forgot name of the money machine thing)"
7321,"I would even say it's one of the most important things you can do for your own motivation to live and work.

I am not even joking, I've spent so much time contemplating things like ""my true calling"" thinking that I should have one of those ""jobs that I will love"", but I could never find it. I don't even believe such things exist anymore. I can tolerate jobs but nothing beyond that.

Viewing jobs as a way to allow the pursue of hobbies was a major turn in my life. The activities that really make me happy are the ones that I want nothing to do with making money. I can take my time doing, they have no clear goal besides my own satisfaction."
7322,"This, and done be pressured to reach “mastery”. Select something you truly enjoy and will get better at and will still bring joy as you get better. 

I started playing more golf lately, picked up sewing, and even started painting! I’ve really enjoyed learning through trial and error, and watching/reading online. I would love to get get really good at all those things, but don’t let the difficulty of mastering your hobby prevent you from enjoying it and continuing it"
7323,"Heh, that's funny, as the video does talk about how the hobbies actually tend to help you with meeting new people."
7324,"We think this post has something to do with meeting people, making friends, or dating after school.

7325,nice!

7328,I cope with video games and cars. Not exactly the most efficient way lmao
7329,"You habe to put yourself out there. As scary as that may be, you need to let people know what you care about and you need to care about others in that same way to build community. 

Belonging is a verb. It's something you have to participate in. People arent going to bring you into their fold if you don't let them know you want to be a part of it."
7330,"I just moved back home recently and have tried to find really good quality friends, and I’ve definitely had to sift through some crappy ones to find the good ones. I felt bad for pushing the unfitting ones away, but their stress they put on me was electrifying, and I do not want to subject myself to that type of “friendship” Or cohabitation I’d say."
7331,"I wouldn't say ""nobody"" cares. At different stages in our life we develop different support groups. If you work in a good office, your bosses and senior staff care about your personal development. When you build your own family, your SO and eventual children care. If you have religion in your life, your congregation cares. And while yes, many of us do fall out of touch with friends as we move to different places, no friends I can think of from any point in my life are against keeping open communication and having a connection. Your friends are only too happy to be in touch if you weren't a toxic person. 

This is also taking an overly nostalgic tone towards school- I remember in high school, legit there were people who nobody could care less about who only came to the forefronts of peoples' minds when something happened like they OD'd. Or intergroup dynamics made it seem like people care on an ephemeral, surface level when in reality they were all sniping at each other behind each other's backs. 

All this is to say, people care or don't at all points in your life, it's the nature of those bonds that differs. The formality of relationships in school switches to those of work, family, and other bodies you belong to in adult life. But at all points we're human and our social instinct plays out."
7332,"This. No one knows you like you, no one will care for you but you. People can try to help or what have you but ultimately you are the only person who can truly take care of you."
7333,Wait you guys had people who cared?
7334,My parents keep telling me to be friends with everyone in case you need them... But like a lot of them are annoying or just have really really different views and lifestyles with us...
7335,"This is a nihilistic and sophomoric interpretation of the world. There are good people who care only when you seek them out. You are a reflection of the world you want to live in. If you are good, you will attract other good people. If you think that there are no good people, that is an indictment of yourself rather than those around you."
7336,"Its true, society is alienating. Especially work is alienating under capitalism. But try and surround yourself with people who want to care for you as much as you care for them. They are out there. I think that’s why people form couples in general, just to avoid playing life on single player mode. 

Finding a political cause or some grander mission in life definitely is also helpful. People who share a mission usually have love for each other. (At least on the left)"
7337,We are legit the same person. Lol. Those are my two coping hobbies.
7338,[deleted]
7339,Volunteer towards a cause you care about
7340,Absolutely agree.
7341,"1. Don't care about the job, but do a good job
2. Care for others even if they don't care about you
3. Find someone/thing to love, and be loved in return"
7342,"Only you can care for you ultimately. 
You can have friends, relationships, participate in some kind of community or WHATEVER your jam is.... but ultimately only one person can help you and that’s only because they know literally everything about you and that’s yourself. 
Don’t get caught up about who cares for you and who doesn’t, it’s completely irrelevant 80% of the time. 

What I do whenever I feel overwhelmed is go swim, I use to swim competitively in high school and something about the water just puts the world away.... In the water I can just simply exist in the moment instead of worrying about all my pointless issues and emotions and worries, they will be there still when I’m done decompressing. I take care of myself by finding my chill and just existing in the moment, others may find what I do boring and pointless and ineffective for there needs and that’s fine.... different strokes for different folks ya know? 

I hope this helps man. Stress and anxiety can really fuck us up as humans, we as a creature don’t coop well to it constantly, you’ll find your way I’m sure In due time. Till then just keep your head high and know that you exist and that’s enough, you already do the impossible every day."
7343,"Question, why do you need people to care?"
7344,Would it be super weird if it was some friend from high school who I haven't spoken to in many years and I secretely worshipped due to admiring this person's work ethic and intelligence?
7345,"Yep, I have learned to expect nothing from other people. That doesn't mean they're always useless, I've just been disappointed enough to expect nothing the vast majority of the time."
7346,"I think realizing this, that no one really cares, was something that helped me cope with it a lot, even though it is an uncomfortable truth.

Not expecting people to care has made my life a lot less dramatic and emotional. I just do things for myself, my loved ones, and the needy. So, actually, accepting others don’t care and actively caring for others is how I cope, I guess! >.<"
7347,"You'll find in life that most of your interpersonal relationships are relatively ephemeral. Most people just have family, and maybe a friend or two that are close enough to basically be the same as family. Beyond that, you need to be happy with yourself and focus on your own needs."
7348,"You care about yourself. And then you say ""screw the system"" and care about others too :)"
7349,This why people become christians because “when nobody else was there for me Jesus was”
7350,Don’t live life based on how others feel about you. Take care of yourself first and you’ll find positive people
7351,You have to ease up on yourself and others. People do care and you simply have to make them care by being a good and responsible person. Not everyone is so indifferent to others.
7352,"My take is that your group always cares. As you age, how you find that group changes."
7353,Yo find a church or a hobby
7354,"I'm in college right now so I can't answer this question - but honestly, if what you're saying is true, it sounds liberating."
7355,have friends
7356,Compulsive and evolutionary need to share things with people
7357,[deleted]
7358,"Nah, dude. I think you're good. It's reasonable to want to progress and better yourself. If you know what you're doing, the responsibilities of the job are not overwhelming, etc., you're good."
7359,"Yes and no. Keep applying to other jobs while you are at your low paying job. If relocating isn't an issue, then i suggest it."

7365,Have you considered working for a small MSP? You'd still be paid well and would be able to use your tech skills to directly help your clients. I find it to be a very rewarding career in all aspects.
7366,"I agree not to write off the field because of one company. That being said, what’s so good about computer science is that it touches almost all the other industries, so you can dive into an area you are passionate about and bring an attractive and downright important set of skills with you.

I definitely resonate with what you write, I’m 25 and feeling something similar with my computer science degree. I’ve been looking at opportunities in journalism, like the teams at nyt or wsj that make those kickass interactive infographics. Try to think about similar roles in industries where you can write and help people with your background (maybe education tech?). What I’m saying is that computer science makes you very flexible to move industries, and so you should keep your eyes peeled and actively research interesting areas and ways that they could use tech, so that you can get your foot in those doors.

Good luck!"
7367,"Managed Service Provider. When a company has technical needs they can either hire their own tech team or outsource to an MSP to handle everything from hosting to networking to printers. Working for a smaller MSP allows you to get your hands on a lot of different things which keeps day-to-day work interesting. You also get to interact with a lot of different clients, but the dynamic is usually one of mutual respect."
7368,"I think being a teacher, maybe even a professor, would do you some good. You could teach computer science at a community college or university (not sure if you need a MA to teach at a university). You sound a lot like me; quiet, would rather help people in my field. Teaching is fulfilling and definitely helpful. It definitely doesn't pay as much (thanks America), but if it fulfills you, it might be worth it."
7369,"That's complete bollocks. I work in Finance, a sector notorious for bad working hours and poor work life balance. I absolutely love my job and have the best craic there. If I moved to another company, it might not be the same. Chances are OP just works for a shitty company. You on the other hand, sound like an auld bitter cunt who hates their job and wants everyone else to suffer to legitmise your pain."

7371,Yes
7372,"I was thinking this, too. Teaching K-12 is a lot like babysitting during your first five years. It’s like 50% classroom management, 50% lesson planning/teaching. I used to do it and personally, I wouldn’t recommend it in this situation. Between OP being shy, the massive pay cut for them, and time and money needed to get certified.. I don’t think it would be worth it. r/technicalwriting is a great resource with a lot of FAQ’s for beginners. I think it could be a really good fit!"

7377,"I’m still in HS and am doing a lot of research into future careers, so I’m no expert. Computer science is very broad, maybe you can aim to work in other field of cs like robotics. Biomedical robots need programming and I feel you can get the satisfaction out of it. Also there is computational work and data things some pharmaceutical companies do, so they also look for cs grads. I feel like there are a a lot more possible jobs in CS that can help you feel fulfilled.

Edit:wanted to add some things 

You could also teach cs as well, as a lot of people are trying to break into it, you could go back to Uni and get a masters and be a TA before transitioning into gaining a place in academia/research."
7378,"I share a ton of these sentiments (especially about wanting to become a teacher). I work at an edtech startup that employs tons of teachers so I really love that all the work I do is closely intertwined with that interest of mine, and we’re still small so I constantly get to interact with them and feel the direct impact of the work that I’m doing. It’s a lot of work but I love the way that we have to think things through thoroughly before we start every project to make sure it aligns with everything else we’re working on, where we’re heading, and always has the most impact for the time we’ll spend working on it. 

You might enjoy working at an edtech startup lol. And we’re hiring so if you know any web dev feel free to PM me!"

7380,"I had a friend who was a civil engineer who disliked working in her field. She had a great paying job and her company wasn’t horrible or anything, but she was unsatisfied. A year later, I asked about her work again and responded differently about how she felt. I asked her what changed? She was still doing the same work and whatnot. Her answer was practicing mindfulness.

Try reevaluating yourself and your field. You choose this field before most likely because of an interest in what you were learning. Sometimes we forget why we’re in the position we’re in today. Changing your mindset can definitely help you see a new perspective of how you can possibly enjoy the small moments of your life."
7381,"Can you talk to any of the designers or researchers at your company?

At most (good) companies, there's groups of people talking with users of the software you make and getting feedback on the way it helps (Or annoys) them. It might be fulfilling to learn about how what you're doing is helpful by talking to the UX designers or UX researchers.

You may even find you like the UX research side more because of how much they interact with users, hear their problems, and relay that info to management for developers to fix.

There's also the field of UX writing-- which is all about the focus on the tiny microcopy in the software"
7382,"You can always take your skills and go work for a firm within the kind of work you want. That way you’re using your skills for something that you care about.

7392,I needed this reminder. I’m graduating from undergrad in less than a month and while I have landed some interviews (yay!!) I’m nervous for what the future holds. I always have to remind myself that I’m only 21 and I have all the time in the world to get my life figured out.
7393,It would be nice if that was my worry. My worry is when will I get a full time job so my bf isnt so stressed out. So it's not another night of hot pockets cause we dont have enough money for food and the light bill. Or praying that the sound the truck is making is really a 30 dollar fix and not the transmission  about to fall a part because we cant afford a new transmission or a new truck. I went to school to get a degree so I could get a FT job with benefits and weekends off to do house hold chores. But a year later I'm still working as a cashier.

7396,"It’s hard to give specific advice without knowing the field you are talking about but as a general rule just don’t give up.  Take free courses when you can, if you have time to, then do voluntary work to try and gain the skills you need for the job you want.  There will be you and hundreds of other applicants so you need to make yourself stand out, your CV needs to be distinct and your interview technique needs to be on point.  If you can show you are willing to teach yourself new skills and are able to sell that fact in an interview, it will go a long way towards getting the position you want."
7397,If you feel you’ve self actualized and are happy with where you are then there’s certainly no reason why you can’t devote 2-3 hours of free time to gaming if you find happiness in it. Equating maturity with productivity isn’t something I’d say is completely accurate
7398,"Everything is about trade-offs.
You actually DO have time to play those games, and even if you do not, you could always make some time.

It's all about what you really want to do.
If you want to play some games, but you are on a tight schedule, you still have options.

For example, you could wake up 30 Minutes earlier than usual, or stay up 30 Minutes later than usual, each day. 
Take 5 minutes to decide on what game you want and grab your snacks and fire up your console and get everything set up just right, and then use the remaining 25 Minutes to enjoy a focused  uninterrupted play session.

25-30 Minutes of gameplay a day is plenty, especially if you are consistent. For single player games, thats ussually enough time to clear a single stage/level before saving the game, as long as you are reasonably good at the game. This is especially true for most open-world/RPG games, where you can roam freely and save the game whenever you want.
For most multiplayer games, 25-30 Minutes is enough time for a full match, or possibly even 2 full matches, no matter your skill level, and that's fine too.
Keep a daily diet of 30 Minutes of gameplay a day, and each month you'll notice considerable progress through your game collection. 

Now, of course you could take that same daily 30 minutes or so and use it to develop a new hobby or skillset that could enrich your life or even make you some money someday. And that's a great alternative. 
But if you have a whole game collection that's just collecting dust, and your heart is really yearning to play some of those, then maybe it will be more satisfying for you to just play the games instead. 30 Minutes a day will let you indulge your desires without substantially  affecting your daily life. Heck, you might notice a marked reduction of your stress and some improvement to your mood each day, all because you are having more fun. Who knows?

Like I said, its up to you. Take Care."
7399,"I've got so many games to plays that it overwhelms me, so I just stick with mainly one and play others whenever I feel like it. Coming home after an exhausting day of work and playing some games, while talking with friends over Discord relaxes me."
7400,"How do fully fledged adults in functioning relationships combine ""play time"" with real life obligations? While it seems that free time is sparse enough as it is, I feel pressured to spend the little time I do have doing ""productive"" stuff always. Gaming after a certain age really does seem like something to be ashamed about, like I'm still playing with my toys."
7401,"How do you find time for them? I've recently gotten a bit more time and I seem to be enjoying them just as much as I used to, however my standards have been raised significantly. While I'd just play out a game I barely find bearable fully when I was a kid, nowadays I'm dropping games the second I feel like I don't enjoy them."
7402,"I had to do homework until midnight or later almost every night in school, and now I'm done with anything required at around 5pm every day. Idk where everyone gets the notion you somehow have *less* time to do things than school + homework + part/full time work."
7403,"I had less than 4 hours of classes per day, with 2hours per week homework which gradually scaled up to something that took up more time than a full time job at the end of the semester. Then I'd have the entire february and late january off because I'd finish all my exams early. Same with the entirety of summer. I'd work during summer sure, but summer jobs never had that 9-5 pressure."
7404,Just gotta get last that feeling of “I HAVE to do productive things.” I think it’s something that needs to be worked towards sadly haha
7405,"I’m getting married in a couple months and have a full time job and still have plenty of free time to play games assuming we don’t have obligations with friends or something. Even then there’s still some downtime that I could play games but I tend not to unless there’s a larger block of time.

Since COVID my work schedule is a little later from about 8-4, fiancée is home from work about 5, we eat together and depending on the day I hang out the rest of the time, play games, or both. Back in bed around 10ish. If you’re handling two jobs, a child or other family members, have a long commute time, or are also going to school, then I get the whole “I don’t have time in the day” but a normal full time job, even with a relationship commitment, there’s still plenty of free time I’ve never understood these complaints."
7406,"Even worse, in those rare instances where I have the time to play I do not have any mental energy left. I am playing less and less multiplayer games, oftentimes just going for a bit of super mario on my 3ds."
7407,"It comes down to whether or not you budget your time. It's exactly like money, if you spend without budgeting you're always going to feel some level of guilt on ""frivolous"" purchases, but if you have a budget and fill out all of your goals you can blow your budgeted fun money with zero guilt. 

If you say ""This weekend I am going to get all of my shit done on Saturday so I can game for 8 hours on Sunday"" you're good."
7408,"Ah, so you never had to work during school? That makes sense then. I'm also jealous your homework wasn't crazy hard until the end of the semester!

Also, idk where you went to school but how do you finish exams early? Our exams were always at the end of semesters (June/December) and we all had to show up the day of our exams, no early exams allowed.

We only got 2 months off for summer, half of June, all of July, and half of August, and then 6 weeks during winter, usually Dec 20 or so until around end of January

I had to work full time or part time all throughout school (part time during community college for first two years since it was affordable) and then full time for one year during my first year that I transferred to University (which was horrible and way too difficult), and then part time the rest of the time at University, which was another 2 years. Work study is what my part time work was and allowed me to get more grant money by working for the university"
7409,"20€ of tuition per year, and cheap transport meant I could just work summers to earn enough for drinks and activities over the year. 

We had 2 preliminary exams which would make your grade instead of the exam if you were successful with them. The rest of the grade was lab work which I got done as I went along. 

 Even just combining full time work with my thesis is too much and I'm glad I never did both at the same time."
7410,"Which is why I said there is time for both. OP didn’t say he finds happiness in it, he didn’t say he’s “self actualized and happy with where he is,” he said he feels ashamed. Because on some level he understands it’s not really serving him the way he wants it to. If you really think I’m saying maturity = productivity you should read my comment again. Maturity = shifting towards thinking more about long term outcomes. Stuff like exercising or spending time with family isn’t “productive” per say but it is a sign of maturity."
7411,"Congrats on your degree and also being in the EU haha. $30,000 in loans here for only 3 years of university. Community college was cheap enough to pay in installments with my part time work so no loans from that. I got really lucky that my school cost so little per semester compared to a lot of other schools."
7412,I probably wouldn't even study if it was that expensive...
7413,"Welcome to America... If you don't, you can have fun working minimum wage jobs while conversations tell you you don't deserve to be paid more because you only work a minimum wage job. Or you can get your degree and *still* have a hard time finding a job in your field and have to resort to minimum wage jobs until you can, which this subreddit us filled with stories about."
7414,Because with maturity comes the realization that productive endeavors are much more satisfying in the long term than playing games. There’s a time for both but if you’re still playing games like you’re on the schedule a middle schooler it’s a sign that you just haven’t developed at all as a person.
7415,"Something i've realized, we are not behind at all in life, life in my opinion truly starts at 18-19, so what, some of your friends found significant others, dream jobs, apartments while you are still discovering life. You are in the beginning stages of life. I haven't peaked yet, but keep on grinding."
7416,"Pubic relations and living in an extremely rural area seems like it might make it difficult to find something. I'm unsure how much overlap there would be if you thought of pursing a human resources job - it's more internal and company based so if you can identify yourself with the values of a company, try seeing if you can simply speak to their HR manager - they have all the insider info you could need about the field for further questions, and about the company itself since they are the ones in charge of handling those internal employee relations, benefits, and generally act as a spokesperson for their company. 

Main point: life can be *corny* sometimes, (especially in rural areas lol) and you're right about everyone's journey - but you can most certainly wind up somewhere you may have never even considered! Just keep pursuing and expanding your knowledge!"

7418,Where do you go to relearn everything?
7419,"You’d be amazed at what your brain has retained, all you need to do is figure out how to unlock what’s there and keep building on it. I know I’m really bad at math, so I liked looking through the syllabus, figuring out what concepts we’d be discussing, and reviewing a super easy website like MathIsFun before we’d learn about it in class. That way my brain had the chance to get exposed to the concept and do some thinking on it, making it easier to expand on in class.

Websites like KhanAcademy also have incredibly helpful step-by-steps where you can practice what you’re learning. I usually combine that with MathIsFun if I need a refresher on something (cough cough, long division) or if I’m learning a completely new topic."
7420,You get better and quicker at learning.
7421,"Tafe, in Australia, I’m not sure if you have tafe in your area, but look for something similar to tafe, it’s like school, but for people who are too old for school, so it’s for you,"
7422,"You can usually take an assessment test at your nearest school to see where you stand in your math and English skills and depending on how you score, will recommend where you should start. Talk to an academic counselor. That should be the first step."
7423,"dude we are always learning and relearning, its cool. Dont worry about it if you learned it once you can learn it again, plus if millions of teens can learn this so can you"

7427,Well let me give you a pointer. Dont just go to class. Always sit in the front row and watch a seminar by Marty lobdell on youtibe it saved my life. Also get in the habit of studying before school starts just research some topic for like 30 min a day before the first day of class
7428,I only suggested it cause not only was I scared of not being able to hang but mainly the cost of it. All I did was offer a route.
7429,What others have said in this post. You’ll forget everything every semester and that’s okay! You’re not going to be tested on the first day of classes. You’ll have your textbook and notes that you will learn off from. Good luck and have fun going back to school!
7430,"Khan academy as stated in a previous comment. 

You’ll also just be surprised at how much you’ve retained when topics come up. In high school you were being exposed to things for the first time, so trying to “relearn” is going to be like getting back on a bike after a while."

7436,"My wife and I laugh about this very topic all the time. It’s not uncommon for us to go to bed at 11pm on a Saturday and have no regrets. 

College marching band was a hell of an experience. We did many dumb things and played many drinking games. I grew up in a time when Animal House was what my Dad expected college to be. Cable tv in the 80s and 90s showed that college was fun. I was a young adult immersed in a culture of crazy. 

As I progress through my career my goals and priorities have shifted. I’m a music teacher and having the biggest baddest band in the land was what carried me through college and first years of teaching. I am fortunate to love my job. However, after 17 years in the business I have completely different motivations AND the biggest baddest band in the land. 

No club or house party compares to having a scotch around a fire pit after a home cooked meal with friends I’ve known for 15+ years. 

If I could tell my college self something that I wouldn’t listen to; College is a chapter of the book. Enjoy it for what it is, while it is and be prepared to transition."
7437,"Yup. Clubbing, raves and rolling, going to the bars, getting blackout Friday through Sunday. Maybe instead of doing a darty, it’s now a day of drinking and playing golf. Different friend groups than college and still fun but not as wild. Sure COVID has changed a couple of things but that hasn’t stopped me and my friend groups."
7438,"I kept waiting for the /s text after this persons comment. Absolutely felt otherworldly to me, and shouldn’t be taken as the end all be all. I literally don’t know a single person with enough money to be traveling and acting all sophisticated like this at 25. Maybe if you’re in IT you’re flying oversees to have a drink, but uh, the majority of society I know is sure as heck not in this category. I think of myself as someone with an array of friends, and yet none of them are doing as such.

I went to go college, worked my ass off, never really partied, and didn’t have time for much. Once I graduated and moved downtown that was finally time for freedom and exploration. Everything beautiful, artistic, creative, fun, wild and energetic to me happened between 21-26 and really only stopped because COVID. No, I wasn’t puking my brains out or being crazy dangerous, but we were dancing and connecting and creating and having some of the funniest best times of my life. 25 was plenty of first rave, fire breathers, drag shows, dance parties, underground events until 3AM, rock festivals, grungy fashion shows, freak show acts, with an array of people under the influence. 

You can find your tribe, a new group, or whatever vibe and life you are feeling at that moment no matter the age. If you got the wild side out of your system, then maybe this persons comment is applicable, but for me it wasn’t. I finally got to see truly fun ass and entertaining things post-college. It’s likely a personal preference and just based on when you get through this stage naturally. 

Do what makes you happiest. Don’t fold into someone you think you should be just because of your age. 

Edit - looking at how many other comments agree with this person is mind blowing. Maybe it’s because I’m gay and straight peoples lives are wildly different when it comes to expectations of relationships and aging, but none of my life reflects these comments. All ages welcome, true community based involved and fun at every corner."
7439,"This seems pretty realistic and as I would expect as you get older. Thank you for your great response! Btw I've seen a few of Drew Binsky's videos, if you like Drew I think you would also love Mark Weins!"
7440,"Never grew into it in the first place tbh lmaoo

I never found it fun, personally."
7441,"Tonight I am still buzzed from my virtual wine night with my best friend, so if you call that a party then hell yeah. I’m 26 btw 😂"
7442,"You can do whatever you want, but life happens and often times you can’t party after college. There’s just no time. 

Once you start working you straight up have 2 days to party: Friday/Saturday. And usually you’re using these days for grocery shopping or doctors appointments or some obligation you can’t do during the week. 

Have a girlfriend or a wife? She’s going to want one of those free days for her. Tag a kid on with that and your ass is going to be at home. 

Have a big boy job? You might be drug tested so you can’t do a little blow or even smoke weed. 



Let’s assume most will at least have a girlfriend after college. That leaves one day - Saturday. That means giving up any and everything Saturday has to offer to party. 

So where are you going to party? Where I live, going to the popular clubs or bars as 28+ is going to make you an old-head. At some point drinking and hanging around 19 year olds with fake id’s isn’t it. So you’ll want to find somewhere else to do your drinking. Those “somewhere else's” aren’t as fun as college parties, don’t have the same girls. It’s just different. There’s nothing like some 20 years olds with a twinkle in their eyes thinking any night could be *that* memorable night. 

You also have a *lot* more to lose after college. The thought of a DUI or getting into a fight just isn’t worth it anymore. 

I straight up don’t see how people want to/have the energy to party after college. If you’re working 40 hours a week and working out 5 days a week, with a girlfriend. I don’t see how you wreck yourself on Saturday. There’s so much other shit to do anyway. 

The only way I see someone really partying after college is the first 2-3 years after graduation, they don’t have any relationship and they don’t have a job they need to perform at. Otherwise you’re going to find it a lot more difficult to party."
7443,"I turn 30 next month n still party almost every weekend. Either at my house, friends houses, wife’s friends, bars, while playing group games, etc. 

Still have full on house parties 3-5 times a year for holidays, super bowl, birthdays, things like that.

Also still go to shows, festivals, raves"
7444,The second to last block of text really makes me want to ask how you kept in touch with those friends even after school. I have a similar friend group that I’ve known forever and we still all talk even at different schools but I honestly get spooked that we could still grow apart unless we all plan to live pretty close to each other or something
7445,I did before COVID! I am kinda sad that my first full year out of college was cut in half by COVID.
7446,"No idea what you’re talking about. Aside from traveling, he’s explaining the norm. 

From your comment it doesn’t seem like you party regardless. OP’s asking about partying and raves. Aka drugs and alcohol - not performe art.  So I’m moreso confused at your response to OP."
7447,"It is what you decide to make of it. I think inviting a few friends to have some beers and smoke weed has become the norm now for me at 28. I agree with what was said regarding going to a lot more restaurants, breweries, chill bars. I can count on one hand how many times I've stayed up way too late and had way too much to drink in the past 5 years.. (I was in a fraternity in college and partied pretty much every weekend except around midterms and finals). My body is no longer capable of drinking more than like 4 drinks without me feeling like absolute shit for the next 24-48 hours. I went out with my brother and a friend last weekend and we planned on getting drunk at dinner and then going out to a bar LOL we drank 2 bottles of wine at dinner and then just went home and passed the fuck out... it's actually really nice to be at this stage though because I now wake up earlier on weekends and have more time to actually do other things instead of being miserably hungover every Saturday or Sunday morning.

EDIT: I've always hated clubbing, the waiting, the crowding, the loud music where you can't chat to anyone... I have to be with a good group of friends and really drunk to be able to stand it. Glad to say I haven't been to a club in years!"
7448,"The fact of the matter is, you have more freedom to do what you want once you have an income. I was always terrified of turning into someone boring after college, but it's more of just doing what you want to do. Going to party bars and concerts are always fun, but other times you just want to talk with your friends over a few beers at a brewery or relax at home.

You do whatever you want to do, but often the ""growing out of it"" part is just a natural change in your perspective and desires.

I will never not love concerts though. Covid 𝑆𝑈𝐶𝐾𝑆."
7449,Didn’t go to “college” but am older 29 rn now and i still live going to see DJ’s and I’m part of a group that throws bigger underground raves with 200-300 obviously not now with COVID it’s fun when  you find a community and everyone from there early 20 to 50/60 can come in and dance and enjoy themselves. Maybe it’s more of an electronic scene thing but you can party on as long as you want. Assuming you don’t have kids or can at least find a responsible babysitter
7450,Now to find said friends groups...
7451,"I’ll be the first to admit that I am very lucky to have friendships as long as I have. We make time for each other and support when needed. We regularly call on the phone and do the best we can to get together when we can. We’ve gone through break ups, marriages, job loss, birth, death, cancer, home purchases, covid and many more events. It’s not always great, sometimes we don’t like each other but we communicate and forgive each other. 

I think it’s the difference between a friendship and a relationship. A relationship has more syllables than a friendship so it takes more effort to sustain."
7452,"I don’t have the time, or really, the money to even think about it. If I’m getting drunk, it’s an occasion vs when I want to get drunk (all the time)"
7453,"“ If I could tell my college self something that I wouldn’t listen to; College is a chapter of the book. Enjoy it for what it is, while it is and be prepared to transition.”

I love this, well said"
7454,"NY to California cost under $200 precovid. Idk how you can work for a fortune 5 and not have enough money to travel, you're probably a miser and you don't even realize it."
7455,"Yes, I’m aware. Definitely including a rave, disco parties, underground events until 4AM, huge live music festivals in the city, weird funky art/DJ /visual shows people are tripping at or drinking. Usually stuff like this includes alcohol, and sometimes drugs if that’s your thing, seems redundant to spell it out."
7456,"For me personally, partying is rare. In college, I was going out to bars and clubs four or five nights a week with my sorority sisters. 

Now, in my mid-twenties, I go out for casual drinks with some friends about every other month. My soon-to-be mother-in-law likes doing shots, so about the only time I ever do shots is with a 56 year old woman. 

Life isn’t bad, it’s just different from college. I have more responsibilities and stronger (but fewer) relationships."
7457,More music festivals and shows than clubs nowadays. Festivals are way more fun anyways
7458,"Yes lol, it’s a little different in a covid world but you don’t get just old and stop liking alcohol and socialization. The setting just changes. It’s more fun in a way - you actually have more money to blow on better quality alcohol and events!"
7459,hell no
7460,"Hell yes lol, the hangover gets worse but otherwise you got more money to blow on expensive alcohol and trips. I’ve been to 5 EDC’s since graduation. (Suppose to be Tomorrowland this year but ya know...)

Some people settle down and become home bodies but I’m enjoying life until I can’t."
7461,Ugh same. I’m so sick of this bullshit.
7462,"Before Covid I dedicated one night a week to this and it used to be my favorite night of the week. Being in my late 20s, I’m reliably dead the following day after dancing night but damn did I look forward to it through all the monotony of adult life."
7463,"Not quite as often as I did in college, but yes."
7464,"people party, must some grow out of it. People still go to get togethers, nightclubs. Maybe it's just me but partying gets old after college. Sometimes we would go to a friends house, or a lounge type of place and a music venue and people would drink chat, talk etc. Im not a huge party goer, ive always liked hanging out with a tight knit group of people, drinking etc, but no huge project x type of party. Fun things i like doing with friends is going to Arcades, Breweries, restaurants, shows, golfing, bowling, movies, hookah lounges, pubs etc. People still have lives after college, maybe not a huge project X type of party at a sports house or frat house."
7465,Thanks for the advice everyone!!!
7466,"If you have Irish citizenship, you may be best off just working in the US for a bit to save up money, then moving to Ireland (or another country, but I'd recommend going somewhere you speak the language fluently) and looking for a job after establishing even a temporary residence in the country. 

Just like any other major move, it's easier to find work in a country while actually there (and most companies probably wouldn't pay relocation costs for a new hire, unless you have extremely competitive skills), and once you find a temporary job to help hold you over for a while you can apply for more long-term or serious positions."

imo, at this point in our career, it is much better to focus on gaining experience and fostering professional connections than wages, if you have the privilege to do so. Most entry level jobs now expect some experience, so anything to get your foot in the door helps, especially if it is in a career field you want to end up working in. The wages will hopefully come later"

I mostly use Google sheets and do a lot of online research all day. Plus daily meetings. My job doesn’t require a bachelor’s, though most of my coworkers have one or are working towards one.

Edit: In my interviews I focused on the quantitative and qualitative skills I gained from sociology. It helped a bunch."

7500,"that's exactly what I was thinking! i was thinking that there might be some relation between logic (via computation and math) that helped keep my mind sharp. but now that i'm in a reg 9-5 job and not doing logic, my brain went south fast"
7501,I also noticed towards the end when I went back to finish my undergraduate degree that I really couldn't deal with the sleep depravation like I did in high school or the first time I was in college. Something like that might play into it too.
7502,"I relate to this as well. Used to be very sharp, always performed well in school, even pretty quick-witted. I feel like out of school I've dulled, my partner often comments on my poor memory, and it takes me a lot more effort than I feel it should just to think through puzzles/logic problems/general critical thinking or problem solving. I'm 23, started noticing this a lot around when I turned 22. Finished undergrad a few months before 22 but my last semester was low-intensity and I was actually away for the last month of classes on an internship.

I've started learning Japanese on Duolingo (out of personal interest and also hearing that language learning helps with memory and focus) and have been trying to start reading for leisure again. I actually have been prescribed Vyvanse as an adult as well at 22, it seems to really help with focus as well as using that better focus to socialize more easily, but I wasn't diagnosed ADHD as a kid or anything. Those things altogether seem to be helping me feel more like myself lately, and I feel more clear-headed than on average before trying these things."

7510,"For me, I've noticed my anxiety and social awkwardness getting worse and worse since I graduated at age 20-23ish (I'm 26 now). I don't know where it's coming from, I thought maybe its because I've entered the professional workforce and I'm subconsciously comparing my self to my peers and am unhappy with where I'm at in life and I'm always afraid of getting found out or something."
7511,"I noticed a lot of similar changes though for me it was around 19, i also got prescribed vyvanse recently and it's helped a lot but it's still weird and hard. sometimes adhd can just only be visible in certain environments"
7512,Good thing I don't want kids then hahahah

7516,Most of the research I’ve done points to lifting as the best for creating new neural connections
7517,Do you have any other symptoms or history with ADHD?
7518,"Your mind is certainly similar to a muscle in that needs to be exercised in order to maintain its strength, which you can do in *many* ways outside of school.  But given the proper exercise, it would seem the mind can become sharper and sharper with age well into old age.  So many academic types seem to become ever more eloquent and intelligent with age.  At the very least, they never seem to lose a step."
7519,nope!
7520,I do and I feel this way too. What do you have to say?
7521,This happened to me too. Around 23-24.
7522,"I've experienced something similar but I'm not convinced it's 100% biological or from lack of using my brain. My brain is freaking full all the time as an adult. My responsibilities are greater, my decisions are more consequential, and I make more decisions per hour than I ever had to do at 19. I had the time and energy to become pro at things like video games or simple work tasks. It was easy and I didn't have the same decision fatigue,so of course I got fast. Now, I take my time. If I have to be fast, I can. I mountain bike a lot and the decision making has to be lightning fast a lot of the time. But overall, I take my time because of all the factors I listed above. There is no need to do things 100 mph. I just end up making mistakes, and now the mistakes hurt and I don't want to deal with them."
7523,You guys should really try Ritalin.

7525,"this might be it, too!"
7526,">So long as I’m making progress on those tasks, I know that I’m doing a good enough job and the ground won’t fall out from under me.

I have seen people meet and exceed a lot of their metrics, list them as is in their self-evaluation reports, then they got all their metrics slashed by low level management reviews. What was ""exceeds some"" became ""meets"" and ""meets"" became ""meets some"".

Must I stress that all those people with good KPI *got fired* in a couple of weeks?"
7527,"I think I functioned so well in school because it may have been an outlet that worked for me for some ADHD symptoms. Now that I don't have that type of structure, those symptoms might be more readily manifesting without a channel for that energy. That's my guess for at least a part of my personal experience with perceived cognitive decline post undergrad."
7528,"well I’m not an expert obviously but I’ve been feeling very “stupid” lately too and noticed I have very short term memory. I did some research into it and it turns out that this is common with people with ADHD. It presents itself differently in adults than it does in kids, so whereas kids show hyperactivity and inattentiveness, adults will also show poor memory, feelings of underachievement and inadequacy, inability to focus on one thing at a time (unless it’s very mentally stimulating), and a LOT of other things too. 

If you have a family history of it you should look more into it, it could potentially be why you feel this way! I know for me personally I’m not a stupid person and I have a passion for learning, but it’s extremely difficult for me because of these symptoms that I strongly believe are from undiagnosed ADHD, and it makes me feel stupid."
7529,"I'm 30 now which means I was in the same situation as you nine years ago.  I remember how hard it was; the first three months after grad I sat at my parents house with nothing to do because I (1) didn't have money and (2) couldn't find a job.

Here's a few things to remember:

1. It might be hard to find a job at first.  But once you get it, it'll make finding the next much easier.
2. Hold that job close.  If you work for a really well-known company, try to stick it out as you can.  I know burnout is real, but you want something to build a resume on.
3. You're still early 20s, correct?  The nice thing about that is the stage of life you're in can be similar to college if you make it.  When I was 24, I remember inviting friends over for game nights, meeting at the park every Tuesday, and going out with big groups for birthdays.  I still lived a ""fun"" life until 5 years after college, when I had a salaried job with big responsibilities that I could have stayed in my whole life.  I worked various hourly jobs until I was 26, and I look back and think about how nice it was to still have time to hang out and not have to take work so seriously.  I remember years ago I would rush to get out of work to get home to get ready for trivia.  Basically, my 20s were fun until 27.  TL;DR the same fun you had in college can last in your 20s
4. Ask if you have to work Saturdays.  Please."
7530,"Going to be honest that's tough!

I think for people like that, they just haven't found their passion. I personally believe its out there for everyone they just have to find it. And the thing is, sometimes its not obvious, and sometimes its really really niche, but I truly believe its out there for everyone.

**I guess a lot of it lies in ambition.** You need to truly believe your life is worth more in order to be motivated to find a passion. I truly believe the 9-5 life is not for me that's why im motivated to find a path out of it. And within that motivation I found a passion that im striving toward. I think the motivation is that one day this can all change for me, that's what keeps me moving. So really it starts with the ambition, **Do you believe you are worth more, do you believe you deserve more?**

The most common question to ask is ""what do you like doing?"", ""What is something you are so passionate about that you'll never get tired of doing""

And the enjoyment never comes from the destination... its the journey that really gets you ready to wake up in the morning. 

**And I think that's why life after school is so jarring.** We spend all our lives in anticipation for the next step. 1st grade, to second grade, to third grade... to 12th grade, to college, etc etc. and then once that senior year of college hits and you realize you are at a finish line, all the dopamine escapes.

**Finding a passion, ambition, its really about finding another milestone that you can run towards. Thats where the real dopamine of life comes from.** 

Just gotta find a milestone then you have to enjoy the journey."
7531,What do we do if nothing makes the passion happen and all we wanna do is play Xbox and drink? What advice do you give those people?
7532,"To the people reading this, panicked because they don’t have a mission or something they aren’t passionate about. You’re okay, breathe, you have time. Sometimes you don’t need a goal sometimes all you need is to be gentle with yourself and to live a value based life."
7533,"I would say everything in moderation. Drinking and playing video games can be great, but not if that's all you're doing. 

When I first started working, initially all I did was come home, eat, and play video games. Games made the time pass by so quickly and it felt like no time was passing. After what felt like only a few minutes of play, I'd have to be heading to bed already. 

I changed my after work routine and that helped significantly. Instead of playing video games for hours, I cut it down to 45 minutes or an hour of play, at most. That freed me up to do other things. I could work on personal projects, read, take a walk, spend more time with family, play cards, watch a half hour of a TV show, etc. 

I felt like I was getting so much more out of my weekday nights once I started doing more. It was the same amount of time as it was before, but it didn't feel like it. 

I think a passion is good but you don't have to have a specific passion, or something that you feel so strongly about. A combination of things that all make you a bit happier works too. Or, maybe your passion is just being around people you care about and who care about you too. In that case, I would cultivate your relationships, no matter what else you're doing.

I would also try to be saying yes more, and no less. Don't be afraid of life or doing things, especially by yourself. If you see something you want to do or see, go. Don't care about anything else (I know that's much much easier said than done). Just be yourself and enjoy it."
7534,That’s the problem. Can’t do shit with covid
7535,"I graduated last May and started working about a month after, so I can relate to the feeling you're feeling. It's a big change, and ill admit I had a lot more fun in college. Alot of it is self-inflicted, I got a job in a new city where I knew no one in the middle of a pandemic so it's hard to meet new people. I would highly advise to keep in touch with old friends, try to do video calls, and what not to make the transition easier. and like the person said here work towards your passion."
7536,"COVID definitely impacts a lot of activities, but there's many hobbies you can do and enjoy either at home or outdoors. I would start off with the sub r/quarantineactivities.

You can write, read, draw, learn to play an instrument, take online classes (a lot of gyms and practices offer virtual workout classes now, too). Go hiking, biking, running, dancing. Start a garden. Study a new language, improve your cooking or baking skills, take a road trip, meditate, learn calligraphy, take up knitting or DIY projects. Work on a puzzle. Start a scrapbook or journal. Go for a walk in a local park. Learn more board or card games. Sculpting. Making music or short films. Learn animation or graphic design or coding. Start a blog. Skateboard or roller skate. Get into woodworking or photography. 

There's still options. There may be less social options (unless you're doing activities with friends outdoors or indoors socially distanced), but still options. People are still discovering new hobbies and things they like doing amid this pandemic. You just need to find at least one thing you like and go with it."
7537,"Not gonna lie, its been 3 years since I graduated and I still miss college quite a bit. While the top comment is right in general, it doesn't mention the fact that its differs based on your situation. If you work with extroverted young people in the middle of a big city, the odds of you making friends and going out is very high. If you are like me and live in a residential area, far from everything and work with less social older people, the odds will be low. You can still make friends but the effort far exceeds that of college where making friends is relatively easy. I also don't know how the top comment person managed to go from philly to new york that often on the weekends and party. Seems incredibly exhausting. Im jelly.

One thing is for sure though. You will actually have more time to pursue your passions. Contrary to college, establishing a routine after work was easier for me and I was able to learn a lot of stuff and take better of care of myself. You can look forward to that. It's what matters most in the end."
7538,"Here's something I really didn't consider when graduating: move in with your best friends again. If you are single and not moving for a job, follow friends. I consider myself just as close to my college friends as when I graduated, and we joke constantly about moving back to the same city. We knew a lot of friend groups who made the conscious decision to move to cities *together* and grow & find opportunities in the same location (like couples, lol), but we all went our separate ways for careers/grad school. We all say we regret not really considering choosing a city together, but it wasn't realistic at the time! 

If you can't, then life will change but it still gets so much better in so many ways! I'm three years out and don't feel that horrible nostalgia at all.... seconding the above comment about finding a vocation. I remember having a similar concern because my last year of undergrad was the best, but by the very end it was exhilarating to embrace change. All my roommates/friends and I have done *so fucking much* since graduation, and we couldn't have done that if we'd stayed in our tiny college town. It has hurt to be away from my best friends but we talk every other week or so and text all the time. It is just as nice to watch all of us grow separately as it was for all of us to live together :)"
7539,You can do more than just work out at home. I listed a bunch of options here...
7540,"Advance congratulations on your graduation!! The feeling of pressure is always there when you graduate and struggles for sure will be there once you tackle the real world. That will be harder, but all you gotta do is face it. You can do it!"
7541,"Don't know the answer, but I feel you so much. I've loved university. I've never really been happy in life, but it's gotten pretty damn close here. I love the town, I love my friends, I am studying something I enjoy. 

I've already got my bachelor. I got it this June. But I chose to do a one year add-on course just so I could stay a little while longer!

I found out that both of my best friends (one moved away after graduating), are planning on staying in uni for another two years next year to do a new master's degree their working on. I SO WANT TO STAY HERE JUST BECAUSE OF THAT! I would want a master as well, but I'm burnt out so I'd just try to find work. But I super wish I could move in with them and just be here until they're done with the master's. I just want to enjoy the uni lifestyle for a little longer because I know it's going to be over once it is...

I'm torn because I originally meant to move to the UK to find work next year, and I was excited about that too. But I don't feel ready to leave this place yet..."
7542,I’m guessing you’re not a gamer? Ever since I graduated college all my friends have been on discord every day after work and we all chat and play games with each other. I would recommend setting up something similar for your group of friends to keep in touch.
7543,"i remember at 23 having to go to work at 6:30 in the morning and then hanging out until midnight.  sounds like a terrible idea, but i'm glad i had fun"
7544,"Seconding the ""similar to college"" bit-- the best memories I've had since college are when I've carved out time for fun! It's different since there isn't a whole social calendar, but once you realize you just have to plan things to have something to look forward to... it's great !"
7545,Thats great to hear! But how did find such great friends?
7546,How has it been since you graduated?
7547,Church
7548,"Think this is what happened to me during lockdown, I'm normally pretty cool having the single in your 20s lifestyle, but this lockdown, looking at social media, the news, indoors all day, really got me feeling down, thinking maybe I needed a date to be happy. Then I had to realize I still enjoyed the single lifestyle, it's just that most of the benefits don't apply times like these. Most months I'd be taking advantage of the single in your 20s lifestyle to travel, learn new skills, pursue hobbies, go out. With covid, majority of these things don't exist, so really have to keep in mind, these are extraordinarily unique historical times."
7549,The comment I was responding to was about maintaining a social life and finding friends. OP talked about going to bars and clubs. None of the activities you listed help with that. Like I said I appreciate the sentiment but I’m done with wasting time doing activities alone that I don’t even like. It was cute the first few months but holy shit if I have to spend the rest of my life pretending to be content with staying at home baking bread or some garbage and living in fear of social interaction just put a bullet through my head. Life like this is not worth living
7550,I appreciate the sentiment but I am going to kill myself if I do another at home workout bruh
7551,Moved into an apartment by myself after graduation because I’m tired of shitty roommates. I can’t really live the way I want at home because of shit with my mom. Rent sucks but it’s worth it for the peace of mind alone. 8/10 would recommend
7552,Yeah I know way more people who live alone or with roommates than those who move back with their parents?
7553,"I graduated in June 2019 and moved across the country for my dream job in September 2019. The job was with an org in my field that I’d had an involved two year internship with. I was also president of the club related to my field. I moved across the country with my best friend, work from home, have two foster kitties, life is great.

Edit- I should add that life was not great before the move. But my dedication to the field helped the most. It’s something I’m extremely passionate about. 

TLDR- pick something and do it well"
7554,"I lived with my boyfriend right after I graduated. We actually moved 1000 miles away from home for his job, and I waited tables for about 10 months before finding mine. Now, about a year and a half of living in our new town, we own a house at age 25, and that's with me owing a shit ton of student loans (he has none). 

Just my experience, don't live with people who you consider good friends. It changes the friendship dynamic and destroyed a few of my best friend relationships. It's better to live with someone you kinda know rather than good friends."
7555,"I feel like it depends a lot on who you know. I know a ton who couldn't, and a couple who have. Ones a civil engineer, the other is a horse girl who I thought was independent somehow, turns out she just gets bankrolled and her parents pay the rent. I don't know if that's different than moving out or not."
7556,Lots of people land good jobs and have an easy time living alone. OP is clearly in a specific financial situation and doesn’t have the same opportunities as many. It sounds like he/she is asking for advice from that perspective.
7557,Start applying to jobs and networking **NOW**. You want to financial freedom? You need a job.
7558,"OP, I have to say that while I don’t feel that old that it’s been ... thirteen years since I moved out and it’s possible things have changed and I missed it or something. 

But I moved out at fifteen and think if I pulled it off you can probably do that with a degree for sure."
7559,"My parents got divorced when I was 9 or 10, my mother married a highly unstable and abusive man, this led to a deterioration of our relationship and me getting kicked out of her house to my father's after my (ex) stepfather was hitting my mother and my little brother and I went downstairs and got a pipe and threatened him with it around fourteen years of age or so.

My father was also an unstable and abusive man due to severe alcohol abuse. He would come home drunk and angry and looking for a fight. Eventually he got it when he threw a mug at my head that I ducked, and that precipitated a brawl in the yard. 

I left my father unconscious in the yard, went inside and without much thought, packed a bag and walked ten miles into town and looked for a place where I could stay."
7560,What % of your paycheck goes to your rent?
7561,as long as you can land a full time job just live with roommates...
7562,"I moved out. I don’t live with my parents. I am (semi) successful. 

It took some time to get adjusted to life providing for myself, working on my own schedule, learning from my mistakes the the mistakes of others, but now I’m planning another move, across the country this time, and I couldn’t be more excited. If you’re finically stable enough to move out, I suggest it wholeheartedly bc you’ll learn so much about yourself by living in your own."
7563,"Started applying for jobs over christmas break of my last year, got a offer far away before graduation, moved there right after graduation and worked and rented a house for a couple years while i saved up then bought a house."
7564,"I left home as soon as i was 18, did college and uni and it was hard at first because you gotta learn to manage efficiently. Meal prep and scheduling is lifesaving. I had roomates the first year but decides i’d rather move on my own. I’ve been living with my SO for 4 years now. All situations have their pro and cons, picked what’s best for your lifestyle. :)"
7565,"I was in a pretty similar situation. I graduated in mid-May 2019 and moved into an apartment in Boston the first day of June. I landed a job about 8 months prior, so I knew actually what I was doing once I moved in. My mom had also moved down to Florida, however there was no way I wanted to start my post-grad life down there. At the time, my girlfriend and I were dating for about half a year, which we both agreed was way too early to move in with each other. I moved in with my two good friends from college, and my girlfriend has her own place about a mile away, so it worked out great. I suggest you do the same with your boyfriend — independence is extremely important at this age and I’ve heard terrible stories of people living with their significant others too early on in the relationship and things going downhill from there. So a few key things here that I’ve learned for a successful post grad life: get a job you actually care about, live with friends, grow your social network, eat well, work out, and save money. I know that’s a lot but be focused."
7566,I moved out of my parents’ place my sophomore year of college and started paying for everything myself. My brother and I were both in college so we moved in together. I did my best to find internships in the area that I could work at while in school and switching jobs a bunch. This really laid the path for me after graduation. This made me financially responsible and made me understand what kind of budgeting I need to do. I am used to living on my own now. I refuse to go back when I graduate and I am excited for the future and finally getting a place all to myself (no roommates).
7567,"Agree with the others, this isn't an uncommon path.  Sure many people move back home but I'd say it's pretty split between the two.  I moved out of my parent's house at 17 for college.  I had an apartment in the city where my college was so that's the point I considered myself ""on my own"".  I had a job lined up spring of senior year and moved to NYC for the job, which I started 3 months after graduating.  I was home the summer between graduation and starting work, but that's the longest time I've been at home since I was 17.  Job started, got an apt in NYC and never looked back. I've had rough times since, after quitting my job and struggling to find something else, but I just promised myself I'd never move back home.  

A few weeks ago my lease was up in the city and I couldn't afford to re-sign it.  I had been job searching like crazy since October but it was the holidays and nothing was going anywhere, and I had no income to take to lease a new place.  I thought I was going to have to move back home, jobless and not knowing when I'd be able to get out of their place, and I was insanely depressed through the end of the year thinking about having to leave the city and go back home (we're talking a cross country move here).  Seriously, I cried all the time and my mental health was in ruin.  But I just promised myself I'd figure it out and worked so hard to.  I stayed on friends' couches for a week and a half when my lease ended and lined up as many interviews as possible in that time, as companies start hiring again in the new year.  8 days after my lease ended I had 2 job offers and started work mid-month.  I did a short term sublease I found on a Facebook group for 2 weeks until I get my first paycheck end of month, and I've re-leased my old apartment again and move in on Friday.  This story may seem long and unnecessary, but the point is that if you want something (or don't want something ie. moving back in with your parents) bad enough, you can make it happen.  I thought my life was ""over"" (dramatic term, but it's how I felt) just 3 weeks ago-no job, having to face leaving the life I've made and move back home with my parents at 25, and now everything is great.  Obviously timelines don't always work as well as mine did the last few weeks when job searching, but if you don't want to live at home bad enough you can find any situation you want so that you don't have to.  

I'm not sure where you live but if you're going to live with roommates, you probably don't need some fancy job right away to make enough to pay rent.  If you don't have anything lined up after graduation, get whatever you can, even retail or service jobs, and work that while you look for something higher paying.  Even here in NYC where rent is stupidly expensive I know people who support themselves living with roommates on min wage service salaries.  With a degree and some time you'll be in a way better position than them."
7568,"I don't want to be inconsiderate, but I'm curious: Why did move out at fifteen?"
7569,"I just graduated this past May, and briefly moved back in with my mom. May - September. I knew it was short term though as I was heading off to grad school overseas. However, I moved in with family that live in the country and commute to my lectures/TA times. 

If you have family (cousins/siblings) that are looking to move out, it’s not necessarily a bad idea. Its a cool chance to get to know some other members of your family a bit better and can be a solid way to save money. 

Hope this helps!"
7570,"I was hired for my job before I moved after college. That made it easier for me to price out how much I could afford to spend on rent, where to look for apartments, etc. I had an advantage of being hired in May for a teaching position that started in August for the next school year, so there was obviously no expectation to start immediately. That gave me plenty of time to apartment hunt and move. I moved out on my own, no roommates, three weeks before I started my job. It was definitely a steep learning curve at first - just managing everything - but it’s been well worth it. I’ve been here for almost three years now, and love everything about my living situation. It’s been great."
7571,"I mean, your plan sounds pretty normal. Also, are you sure your boyfriend doesn't want to move together with you due to financial struggles, and not just because he doesn't feel comfortable moving in together at this point in your relationship? I know moving in with my girlfriend has come up, and I've told her I'd consider it right now but I'd also generally be more comfortable on my own for another year and moving in after we'd been together a bit longer.

Also, a lot of this depends on your financial situation. I was lucky enough to get out of undergrad and masters without debt, so I ultimately wound up getting my own studio, which actually was doable, even if I'd like to save a bit more on rent. My parents were generally adamant about me leaving home as soon as I finished all my schooling, which I wholeheartedly agreed on. My dad also was pretty determined I not have a roommate unless it was my girlfriend. He was saying I have a masters and at my age, I'm too old for roommates (this I disagree with him on- I was 23 at the time). Still, I do prefer to live alone if I can.

All that said,  I make enough to cover the place and live a comfortable lifestyle. My dad was also nice enough to offer to give me a bit extra in cash if I wanted a nicer place or a 1 bedroom. He said since I saved our family so much by getting those full scholarships for my degrees, the least he could do was spot me a few thousand extra if I wanted something a bit above my price range.

Ideally, move in with your significant other when you two feel you're ready, and don't let finances pressure you into it. It comes up more and more with me because my neighbor can be an a\*\*hole and play music at 3 AM and is constantly coming back drunk and yelling. At one point even shouted my name when he staggered in drunk and started having this lengthy monologue about how the world sucks and I'm apparently a cocksucker, right outside my door. That aside, I live in a nice enough place and it's doable. Your own plan also sounds perfectly doable. Having roommates isn't always bad, particularly if they're your friends. It's actually normal at our age. I'd say go for it."
7572,"Went to the career fair 2 weeks ago, got a job in San Diego (from Michigan), and looking for roommates there now!"
7573,"A little different, but I got kicked out when I was 17 and that's when I became financially independent because of necesity, now I am 19 and have my own apartment and am putting myself thru college. I make around $25-31/hr without a degree because I grinded it out for a year and applied to jobs I wasn't qualified for and ended up getting one! Don't stress too much. Moving back in with your family is never a bad thing, I wish I had a family who wasn't crazy that I could live with to save money"
7574,"Unrealistic? No it’s not. Get an engineering degree from a half decent state school, and your starting salary will be $60-75k. May not get you really far in LA, Nyc, DC, Seattle or Chicago, but that’s definitely an adequate salary in Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Milwaukee, Indianapolis,  Austin, Dallas, and plenty of other great cities."
7575,OP seems to be in a fairly specific financial situation.
7576,"Yeah I mean if you get one of a few specific degrees, or are in some other advantageous position, it’s not always unreasonable. Everything is a case by case basis, and some can afford to live alone responsibly right out of college. But in general, many career fields first year out of college don’t start with that high a salary (if someone can even get a job in their goal career field), and many people have debt from undergrad, making it unrealistic to expect most grads to afford living alone right away. Moreover, it’s an economic choice to cut living expenses by living with a roommate if that’s acceptable to a new grad, even if it’s technically possible to live by themselves."
7577,"I think we both agree that it is sometimes possible to get a high paying job directly after college, but when you say “I don’t know why you would get a degree that doesn’t pay well after graduating,” it looks over maybe the main reason people pick career paths, which is personal interest and how good you think you’ll be in that field. Yeah, sometimes people don’t consider pay expectations as much as they should, but not everyone can or should be an engineer or a programmer or a nurse or an accountant. Also, there are so many jobs where people expect to make very little at the beginning in the hopes of working toward a higher salary. We need people to fill the jobs that are lower paying, many of which are absolutely essential to our economy and daily life. And although it’s smart to weigh how much you can make in your intended field, it’s not foolish to also want to do work you feel you’re good at and enjoy."
7578,Wait until you get a job before you start making arrangements
7579,"I live in an apartment with my partner. You can live with friends just like during college, just with a job instead of with student loan money."
7580,"What I’ve learned from moving out at 17 is if you really want to do it, you’ll figure it out. I was on my sisters couch for 6 months and now, 2 years later, I’m looking into buying a home. I’ve been living in a small home that I’ve been renting for a little over a year. It’s hard work but it’s rewarding to have your own space :)"
7581,How about mindlessly scrolling Instagram?
7582,Is reddit a hobby?
7583,Is mayonnaise an instrument?
7584,"Watching shitty TV is her hobby, my wife is the same. 

While she watches crappy TV I have no interest in I’ll go do something else, the key is to balance apart/hobby time with couples things that both parties want to be involved in so that you keep investing in the relationship.

So long as the relationship stays strong it doesn’t matter how anyone spends their downtime, so long as it’s not personally destructive of course..."
7585,"Forget that, Netflix can be a hobby if you have watch parties and discussions.  I’ve made plenty of friends through discussing tv shows and other things"
7586,Video games? Lol
7587,"not really a hobby, but i've been pretty into craisins recently"
7588,I feel personally attacked
7589,🏅(this is all I got . Plz take it )
7590,"Yesss to this!

I plan on taking up piano again, going back to writing (for fun, lol which I haven’t done for two years), and volunteering. 

Now that graduation is around the corner, there’s no other way I’ll meet new people and make new friends outside of work so I’m going to try and put myself out there to meet some."
7591,Since I finished my undergrad the one thing that's honestly kept me social was getting a puppy. I'd been planning to before I had graduated just on a personal basis but after bringing him home people in my neighborhood always came up to talk. Since I basically had a routine I met the same people day after day and it progressed into actual relationships. Also our city has a pretty big breed specific following so there's an even larger following.
7592,Sounds like she just wants to spend some time with you man. Relationships will whither and die if you just co-habitate and nothing else. Have you tried suggesting something new besides TV?
7593,"Not that simple for people working a gig job to complement their main job. At that point, your free time is for chores and catching up on rest but otherwise, I agree"
7594,As long as you’re not in the middle of nowhere theres a good chance theres smash tourneys or at least people who meetup and play that you could join. I’d recommend checking out websites like smashboards or checking for local facebook groups. Turns out my area has tournaments multiple days a week at multiple locations.
7595,"I would definitely agree that “sitting at home and binge watching Netflix is not hobby.”  However, becoming interested in films and tv and using Netflix as an easily accessible source of those things can lead to numerous hobbies.

You’re original post was a blanket statement on “Netflix” as a whole.  I just wanted to interject that Netflix can most certainly be a part of a hobby.

The post literally refers to “hobby clubs”. The reason for a hobby in this post is to make friends and relate with other people.  Netflix is one of the easiest ways to do that because it’s so prevalent in our culture."
7596,"Sitting at home at binge watching Netflix is not a hobby. At most what you are describing is a get-together activity.

But there is a meme/reality where girls write ""Netflix"" in their dating profiles like it's something they are good at."
7597,"I suppose you’re right. My view on it’s a little jaded because she considers playing video games to not be a hobby, and to me TV requires less activity, so that should also not be a hobby. We’ve got almost 0 interest in the same hobbies so sometimes it’s a little tough."
7598,"Don't worry if your hobby is something cringey. I met my fiance and my closest friends through a local brony meetup group. not only are we still a very close-knit group 7 years later, the fact that we met through a very embarrassing fandom means that we've all gone through the most awkward chapter of our lives together.

I consider myself an introvert. I'll probably never bother to go out and meet new friends again. but I've got about 2 dozen friends that I consider extended family at this point and it's all because I decided to go try out a meetup group for a stupid cartoon once."
7599,"Wow, the king dork speaks, and he has the worst hobby of all time... BIKING!"
7600,"Yes, you can be my friend."
7601,I feel ya dude I was in a similar state for a while and have a similar viewpoint (at least playing games involves some input). The wife has come to accept my activities are hobbies for me and vice versa but likewise we struggle to find activities we both want to do..
7602,High key tryna get into some smash tourneys in my area. No clue where to start tho
7603,"I’m aware of this and we do different activities together. I just can’t stand watching bad television day in and day out. It’s like zombified, passive consumption. It just feels dirty."
7604,"Not really a hobby, but I'm pretty good at alienating significant others. Like if one of y'all's girlfriends or wives were here, I'd make her feel uninvited, unwelcome... I'd phase her out of the conversation, slowly but surely."
7605,"Your wife sounds like my mom

This isnt directly related to you and your wife, but it never fails to piss me off when people try to say “that’s not a ReAL hObBy”

90% of the time they are just trying to tell you that you’re wasting your turn and its annoying as fuck, like something has to abide by your arbitrary qualifications for ‘hobby’ to be worth doing in your free time

That being said, not all activities are made equal. Whatever your hobbies/interests are, making sure that you are making the most of your time on earth is a good idea"
7606,"Glad you mentioned this. 

I've found a bunch of local events (many at my local library, some in surrounding towns) that I'm excited to go to. I wouldn't mind trying to volunteer somewhere too, eventually. 

I decided I also wanted to start recreational reading again (as I won't have to do any reading for school anymore!) so I set myself a small reading goal for the year. 

I've heard there are apps like Bumble for people to meet friends. Maybe asking in one's city's subreddit could be another option? 

I've also heard good things about recreational sports leagues. My old internship had their own sports teams and played games after work. It seemed like a fun way to get involved, stay active, and meet and network with others in the company."
7607,"My mom makes fun of me for coding Roblox games (a few YouTubers played some of my games and it’s been seen around 6 million times on YouTube) and playing with electronics, coin collecting and other fun stuff. I do all of that and get all my school work done with good grades.

All my mom does is read shitty books and watch shitty tv shows."
7608,craisins are good lol
7609,"Not really a hobby, but when my family and I dine at restaurants they give you a beeper and I’ll always pretend like it’s buzzing"
7610,You’re right that’s not a hobby.
7611,"I was an overachiever in university, always taking more than 20 credit hours, extracurriculars, shows, groups, etc. Now when people ask me if (what I got my degree in)  is still what I want to do. All I can say is “yeah, I think so.”"
7612,"Honestly I just moved across the country for a sweet job and I have ran into the weird problem that, for the last 5 years I have been doing everything in my power to not lay down roots so I can get this dream gig, and now I have no idea what to do. 


Like I've focused on getting to this point for so long I never really planned on what to do when I got here. I feel like I crossed the finish line and they told me I was only on lap 1."
7613,"I can definitely relate. Just graduated, got married and moved from northern CA down to the LA area. Got my degree in criminal justice and had originally planned on a law enforcement career but that just doesn’t seem to be where my heart is. Been applying to all sorts of city government type jobs whose hiring processes move at a glacial pace. To make it worse, I applied for all kinds of retail jobs in the mean time just to get some income flowing in (Disney, Total Wine, etc..) and I can’t even get them to call me back. I just seem to be kinda lost all while adjusting to a new environment."
7614,"Yup, same here, not having a good time."
7615,[deleted]
7616,"Good analogy. Was in the same boat, all I wanted was a secure job and to finish my degree. Now I’m here and having to REALLY figure out my identity."
7617,"Shit this is about to be literally my situation.  I'm moving across the country in September after scoring my dream job.  I'm financially planned out, and I'll plant my feet firmly but holy hell am I nervous.

Any tips?"
7618,"I felt this way just after graduating high school. It was weird. What the hell was I going to do? 

I went to EMT school, and had a blast (but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’ve got a strong desire to be a fire fighter, cause that’s the only way you’ll retire) and things just kinda fell into place. 

It’s cliche but you just gotta find your niche. I love medicine, but even now I’m struggling, cause EMS isn’t a career unless you can snag a fire dept gig. Do I want to be a nurse, or just give up on medicine, and pursue strength and conditioning? 

You’ll be faced with this shit your entire life, the only difference is, each experience will help mold the decisions you make along the way."
7619,"Not to make you feel bad, but I’m 43 and feel like this. But, there’s freedom in not knowing. You can do any of the things you listed. Whatever you choose remember you can always do something else. Good luck out there, brobama!"
7620,"It's nice to see after a few months you're doing ok.

Thankfully I've got a roommate lined up who's also a coworker. Just signed the lease this past weekend.  I'll have a decent place to stay with furniture.

I'm going to struggle with the same thing, so it's nice to know it's consistent.

Best of luck friend :D"
7621,Lost as hell
7622,"I think the one positive thing about this feeling is that whatever you choose next, doesn’t have to be a four year commitment. You can try lots of different jobs, cities, etc. until you find something that makes you feel like you have more direction."
7623,"For about 20 years of your life you've created and have become attached to this identity of a student. Due to leaving you are now left stranded and lost but here is the beauty of leaving. You can be anything. Look to your past, who you were before school, find what makes you happy and whole. Any attachments you have to your school identity. Question them. Are they really you? Did you join groups them for the ego boosts? Do your hobbies truly give you pleasure? That's ok if you you find yourself answering no. Now is the time to be whatever you want."
7624,At work?
7625,"I'm two months in, and feeling somewhat ok.

Tips, if its across country, see if you can sublease something for the first month/two months that way you have time to find a year+ long lease that you are happy with instead of blind picking something you can't tour. 

Get your boss's phone # obviously and (hopefully) they understand you are moving across the country. Mine has, on a few occasions helped me out since I have no support out here including helping me move a couch after work for a few minutes. 

Find a group of people that do your hobbies, friends are harder to make since they aren't forced to interact with you like in college. I'm struggling with this but have a few connections now. 

Understand your apartment isn't going to be full of things like your parents, it likely took them decades to fill it with furniture."
7626,"I had a 2.5 year gap that I needed to explain in my interview. I would recommend being honest about it. I would absolutely mention you working on your language skills while looking for work at the same time.

They don’t need to know every detail about why you were out of work, just try to get a good read on whether or not your interviewer is satisfied with the information you’ve provided."
7627,"Don't mention the year gap unless they do, then you say you had family issues. I have holes in my resume because I was working at jobs that didn't add to the professional resume and I was never asked about the gaps. You will be fine."
7628,"For what its worth, I had about a year gap after college where I couldnt find a job, until I finally started working in my industry. I've had plenty of interviews since then and no-one has ever asked me about it."
7629,"First I feel your pain. It so god damn condescending when they ask you ""What were you doing between that time?"" as if they are confused. To be honest it really feels like they are throwing shade. 

2nd, just say you were sidelined by health issues. Not something that can be verified, so just go with it."
7630,This is the only answer you need OP
7631,"Same. I have several career gaps, never been asked about it."
7632,"Don’t listen to this. You have literally no reason to lie. Having a year gap between graduation and your first job is no big deal, especially right now."
7633,"I feel you OP. I honestly believe that while this is definitely something you should be concerned with, you shouldn’t have to be concerned with it. The working landscape of America is inappropriately concerned with “work ethic” and disproportionately afraid of “laziness”. Don’t you think it’s sort of fucked up that just because there is a gap in your career, you need to explain yourself to potential employers? Why should that be their concern? If you’re not working for a year that should be nobody’s business but your own. Hot take."
7634,Never heard of the word familial before. But it makes sense so I’m taking it
7635,"Thank you so much for this advice! I love it because it’s actually true, but it still saves my face. I’m gonna use this!"
7636,"Yea I’m definitely not listening to that other person. 

>You have literally no reason to lie. Having a year gap between graduation and your first job is no big deal, especially right now.

Also, thank you for saying that because that’s so reassuring."
7637,It’s a word I promise! Lol
7638,Ik its unethical but ur better off just lying HR wont care about ur reasoning its just a red flag in their mind
7639,"The CIA will neither confirm nor deny anyone's employment history with them, so I always just say that I was working for them to explain the gaps in my employment history. Nobody will ask any questions after that."
7640,[deleted]
7641,"Learning to cook? How can people have lived away from home for the duration of a 3-4 year course and still not know how to cook anything?

Other than that, very nice. Always appreciate more of this “college aftercare” stuff given that I am in that boat."
7642,"The Tinder part is horrifying. I pity both the girl and the guy.

Going to such extremes instead of being honest and straightforward."
7643,"Not all students move away for college. If a college graduate lived at home the whole time, they might have had all their meals cooked or taken care of by parents. 

Some families cook, and some go out all the time. In this scenario, it’s possible they never needed to learn how to cook, never expressed interest, or was never taught to cook, so they may not have learned. 

If a college graduate lived in the dorms the whole time, they might have had all their meals covered by a meal plan. Even if they moved to an apartment they might still eat out a lot or get frozen, easy meals if that’s what they’re used to."

7655,"Wow, if you read this, dm me!"
7656,"In school, your surroundings also constantly changed with your schedule, adding variety to your days. An office (assuming you work in one) can be a motivation-sucking environment because you see the same thing day-in-day-out, got other things you'd rather be doing/thinking about, have to maintain surface level conversation with coworkers, etc.

The answer might be different for everyone, but for me the 'freedom' of work life meant I needed to develop the self-control to make myself do stuff, rather than be driven by peers and grades. You can end up feeling like you have no control over your time, but it's important that you make the most of the hours you have to yourself, otherwise what else is there to life than work?

Things that have helped me:

1. Take frequent breaks at work. Stand up, walk around, stretch, drink water. Give your brain a few minutes to turn off so you're separating your day into chunks of tasks rather than one long, grueling shift.
2. Shift your mindset. You also gotta build the mentality that really you WANT to do something, not that you HAVE to. You don't HAVE to walk your dog, but you want to because it makes him/her happy and you also get some exercise/bonding time with them. These responsibilities aren't a waste of time; they're an investment to your well-being. All the little things you do are accomplishments in themselves.
3. Tell yourself you'll do a specific task for at least 5 minutes before quitting for the day. I've learned to cope over years of depression with this trick. Hobbies ended up feeling like chores and my responsibilities piled up because I would put everything off. Building the momentum to start is ALWAYS the biggest challenge. Telling yourself, ""only 5 minutes"" will lessen its perceived difficulty and help you get the ball rolling. Once you've started, why stop? Remember to reward yourself afterwards too. ""Oh, I ended up working for 3 hours? Gotta treat myself with some shitty fast food french fries tomorrow!"" (I recommend doing this in moderation lol).
4. Do any activity that helps YOU relax. Get off social media (yes, Reddit counts) and be mindful about the quality/amount of content you consume. Your brain's already absorbed so much information throughout the day, the poor thing's constantly overclocking. It's also okay to not be ""productive"" by society's definition (aka anything that makes you more valuable to the economy). Personally, I play low-effort games or just organize stuff in my room. It makes me feel like I've accomplished something for myself, and gives me the drive to do more.
5. Most important of all, listen to your body and don't push yourself. The expectations/schedule enforced on people in college probably isn't ideal or healthy for anyone, generally. On top of my coursework, I was an officer in more than one organization, working PT, commuting 2 hours a day, running on a few hours of sleep everyday for years. I barely functioned, yet still felt like I wasn't doing enough. Life's not a friggin' race, so do what's optimal for you. Got energy to do only one task outside of work? Any progress accumulating over time is better than NONE!

Phew, this turned out long but I hope it helps. It took me a long time to figure all this out so just be patient with yourself if you trip along the way."
7657,"I think there's an effect in which people can do whatever they need to (within reason). If you needed to work that hard in school, it was only after you were done that you felt you could stop. So, if I know I have a 12-16/hr day ahead, I won't think about being done until I'm done. If I only have one small thing to do in a day, it seems to expand and fill that whole day. I keep thinking,""Four hours until my one-hour task."" Then after that task is complete, I feel exhausted because that was the thing I had to do. I think many people work like this. 

(Also, the work day feels like it was created to sap our strength.)"
7658,"Same. I'm exhausted from my job, and can't focus on any related to certs at home because I have so little time there. 8 hours of work, an hour of commuting, and I just barely have time for myself at all.

I can't progress in my career like this. I don't think I ever will."
7659,Wow great comment. You should consider posting this on its own just so it gets the visibility it deserves. Thanks for taking the time to write it out.
7660,"Gee, thanks! I tend to pour my soul out in comments so I wasn't sure if I rambled too much... Posting it sounds like a great idea, though. I might just do that! :)"
7661,You don’t. Welcome to the grind. Honestly I’m trying to take some online classes to change industries and I haven’t worked on it in two months because I’m so tired. When you work on a computer for 8 straight hours and are expected to be “on” the whole time then your brain turns into mush by clockout. That’s why so many people get off work and vegetate in front of the tv or on the phone. My psychiatrist has told me that the average person can only be productive for a maximum of 4-6 hours per day. I have adhd and bipolar and I think 4 is my threshold. But yeah. In college you’re not in one class for 8 hours straight. You’re not doing homework for 8 hours straight. At work you have to be in the same place doing the same thing for 8 hours straight for the next 40 years. You’re not flawed. Everyone is tired. The ones who aren’t are weird energetic extroverts that everyone else envies or they’re taking amphetamines.
7662,Thank you for this - number 2 specifically.
7663,I think that’s the point. Keep the majority of people at the bottom to do the grunt work. Keep them too tired to notice or attempt to climb
7664,"One of my best friends moved to Hong Kong about 4ish years after graduating. He was making good money, living in Washington DC, and had a pretty robust social life. He was born in America, had never been to that part of the world, and got offered a job from a former boss.

He's been there 4 years now. He thinks he'll move home at some point in the next 5 years. He said it was pretty difficult for the first year, but he's grown a lot. He would travel to a different country at least every other weekend, and has had the opportunity to explore most of the world. He's engaged and getting married soon. 

Living in a non-native country is a really unique experience, you'll develop a crazy level of empathy, and get to experience so many different things. That's not an automatic endorsement for staying in Hong Kong, but just a different view to consider. Obviously, you have to take your health, career, family, and social life into account before making a decision."
7665,"One of my friends was on the plane with the 200 people and he said the corona virus was spreading everywhere fast. Idk he could be exaggerating, but he was freaked out (haven’t talked to him since they landed.) On the other hand, my cousin in Hong Kong says it’s no big deal- so I really have no idea what to believe."
7666,"Hey, I remember your first post. Honestly if there’s only six months left I’d be inclined to stick it out. The government is not to be trusted but honestly I think HK is still full of good professional people and they handled the 2003 SARS just fine despite being completely inexperienced. Just be careful not to buy used face masks or whatever. There’s always those who are completely ignorant or unscrupulous who would try and turn a profit. That’s true anywhere else. 

Though at the end of the day it’s entirely up to you of course. I think a large part of being in HK sometimes is about not letting the daily headlines and rumours on whatsapp affect you too much. So much of it is blown out of proportion and super polarised imo. Even here on reddit. It’s not good for your mental health. As I said in your original post (might have deleted it, can’t remember) only you know how much shit you can tolerate."
7667,I want to see the picture
7668,I mean the flu is still a more deadly virus and nobody is ever worried about it.
7669,"I would go back to the U.S. but that’s probably just my fearsome western ass. I feel like if you really wanted to stay in HK you could make it by without illness by taking the proper precautions, but, better safe than sorry in my book."
7670,I mean only 200 have died from it in the entire world at this point so don’t stress yourself out too hard dude
7671,Spam that resume. Start flipping shit if you have any decent knowledge of any hobby. 6 months of unemployment is really going to start souring your resume.
7672,"I’m in the same exact boat as you, so i’ll be watching this post. From one to another, try to breathe, understand you are very young, and more job and internship postings will come out and maybe one of those are for you. I know it’s hard, don’t give up. If i have any advice to offer it’s to maybe ask people you know if they have any job openings where they work/ know someone who does, etc. I got a job interview by talking to a friend who worked somewhere and got me into the interview (didn’t get the job but the interview was good experience) . Best of luck"
7673,"Life is much better if you're nice to talk to and nice to look at. Luckily, you can improve at both. All jobs just require some minimal level of competency and it's honestly not a large hurdle. The rest of the hiring decision is just answering ""do I want this person around me 40hrs per week?""."
7674,"It would help if you provide some info on your major/degree, jobs you’re targeting, and past internship experiences. 

Also I would suggest asking for feedback from the interviews you’ve gotten but did not pass.

Resume drops are not very effective at your level unless you have stellar past experience and grades. Try to network and get referrals."
7675,"This is a common occurrence on this subreddit, a lot of people talk about not having jobs and graduating but not telling what they majored in. Even though its a key aspect in getting a job."
7676,Well what u graduate with
7677,"This, take and get anything thrown at you, the longer you are inactive after graduating is a red flag for hiring managers. I mean, great your own business in your industry. Offer free consulting to local small businesses, literally anything. Feel free to msg me unemployed college graduates!!!"
7678,"First, breathe.

Life is going to kick your ass before it pats you on the back and if you think you’re doing everything wrong, you’re not.

Second, I would first download Headspace’s some other meditation app and hop on a basic beginner session just to...well...give your head some space. It’s easy for anyone to feel depressed when luck just hasn’t been so stellar. It DOES NOT make you less of a person.  You clearly have skills for where you’re applying.

Second, and I’m not sure if you already do this, but always bring a notepad/book and pen with a few copies of your resume. On a page that the interview/ers can’t see while writing info about what they’re telling you, have pre-written questions. I would recommend anywhere from 3-5 meaningful questions that convey interest in the position. These could be found via a simple Google search of ‘Interview questions to ask”. My go-to is “Where could I see myself 5-10 years starting from this position?” You ask questions to lead up to this but it conveys interest and level-headedness in understanding that every company, like a relationship, could be rocky and you’re willing to stick it out.

Thirdly, search power poses before interviews. This will help you psychologically to become more confident right before an interview.

Last but not least, PREPARE, PREPARE, PREPARE. Search everything you can about the position, company, that’s relevant. If it’s a corporate environment, look up President, Vice-President, etcetera info ON TOP of what they actually do. I would recommend at least 40min-1hr on the low end of researching (this could vary widely depending on company and work associated with it)

I hope this helps you and please focus on your mental health. It’s much more important than people think."
7679,"Graduated in May and still no job gang rise up!

I'm in the same boat, countless apps, a few interviews that just ghosted me later on and a lot of self-disappointment. I did just start a seasonal part-time job because I ran out of immediate options for employment at home, it sucks this lull of no meaningful career fulfillment. I've been told companies start doing serious hiring in January so maybe, just maybe our time will come. Until then, I feel ya, stay strong and continue to pursue a career, pump out those resumes, opportunity could be just around the corner."
7680,"Took me 10 months and over 300 applications to find a job in a city that's known for having plenty of jobs in my field. It's hard, but keep going. Keep track of all the jobs you apply for and if you can get a contact number/email from the website, follow up. What really helped me was getting a crappy serving job in the meantime to keep up with bills, which helped to remind me why I wanted out of that industry. Not sure if that's viable for you, but it helped me with my depression and mental sanity to have some sort of a schedule, even if the job was awful.

As a side note, make sure you're keeping up with your hobbies and interests, it's that time of year where depression and SAD can really set in and it's hard to pull yourself from that dark place."
7681,"i’m in the same boat, too. i managed to somehow land three interviews this week and have moved onto the next step. though my advice doesn’t pertain to landing a job, i still think it’s important to do something that you have a spark of passion for that occupies a little bit of your time. for me (now that baseball season is over), it’s going to the gym regularly. going for half an hour - an hour and a half each day has made me a little bit happier (and motivated, too)! don’t give up, op. you got this"
7682,Same here. Graduated with a mechanical engineering degree but no luck. I had no internships and past jobs so that definitely hurt me. My advisor told me to apply out of state before I graduated. Have you thought about moving out of NY?
7683,Maybe volunteer in some place slightly related to your field? Just so it shows you're doing something and what not and gain an additional reference.
7684,"Dude I went through the same shit and my dad introduced me to our neighbor and I applied for a job where she worked after that and landed the best job I probably could’ve landed for what I’m doing. She put in word for me but I’m not sure how much it meant to my boss because she doesn’t even work in my department.

tldr: have someone get you a job"
7685,"Same position as you. My advice (which I am about to begin doing myself) is to put in the work to tailor your  resume to each job you apply to. I have only had one resume for the 100+ jobs I applied to and got maybe 3 interviews that went nowhere. I think the problem with the approach is that you rely on the probability of eventually getting something if you just send enough resumes out. You might be like me where you just find a position that you feel even remotely qualified for, mindlessly go through the application motions, and move on to the next one without having taken any time to decide whether it is something you actually want to do, or even forget applying in the first place... If you aren't getting responses like me, it's probably your resume. You could also get to networking as well, but this is a more immediate fix, though knowing people is always more important in the long run"
7686,"Be willing to work in a job that isn’t related to your field. 

Sales is a very lucrative, commission-based job that will take anyone with a bachelors. If that’s up your alley. 

If not I have the following recommendations: marketing (anyone can get a marketing job, you don’t need a specific degree for this, and there’s a lot of these positions available); teaching (you can teach the English language to foreigners, or tutor for SAT/ACT prep or even high school/college courses, and can do it with a company or private on your own)"
7687,"Go to places that interest you career wise, and talk to the people there. Tell them you're a recent grad and want to find out what it's like there. Buy them a coffee and ask them stuff. 

If that ends up being the last time you see them, then that's that. But you never know, they may know someone that knows someone that's hiring, or you may end up pursuing someone else.
Either way it can't hurt"
7688,Have you tried applying to internships or training programs? That might not pay well (or at all) but will give you something to stand out on the resume. What’s your degree in?
7689,"lots of good advice from others, but wanted to suggest you see if you can defer your loan repayment? might be different depending on state (GA for me) or loan provider, but i was unemployed when they wanted money from me so i looked at my options and you can like defer or make “payments” of $0. worth looking into!"
7690,I graduated two years ago and just landed my first real job after college. It’ll happen! Keep your chin up and don’t be afraid to look for temp agency work in the meantime!
7691,Same exact situation as you. I few weeks ago I started working at chick fil a to get me by while I continue to look and apply to places.
7692,"I'm also in the same position. I've still got the part time job that I had throughout uni. But I feel the same, it's so depressing knowing that you're not getting anywhere despite all your efforts"
7693,It will come I was in the same position as you. I just started my job on last week. Just be patient and keep applying it will come
7694,"Don’t have much advice on the job front. But just remember to stay positive. And this rut is temporary like every hard part in life. Hydrate a ton, workout, get good sleep, socialize, and be positive."
7695,"Out of curiosity, what did you major in?"
7696,"> I live in nyc, which makes it harder to compete with others.

The competition is harder here in NYC but there are SO MUCH MORE opportunities for every field compared to other cities / states. You just have to put yourself out there. Get your resume redone and use your free time to learn valuable skills and network. Seriously."
7697,Move to a less competitive job market or make yourself more desirable
7698,A lot of the Americans I met abroad were teaching English for a year or two to help pay off a chunk of their student debts. Teaching in Korea or China for a bit may help take some of the pressure off from the loans.
7699,"Main thing I'd say is that although it is tempting to, don't get caught up in the routine of late lie-ins, late nights and too much drinking. It's really hard to motivate yourself if you fall into that routine. Not impossible, but a real drag. 

At the same time, try not to do the thing where you sit and punish yourself and refuse to do anything you enjoy because you haven't done another application. You will not do anything because you'll be too stressed and miserable. Better to go out occasionally and ""waste"" a little time de-stressing than sitting paralysed and compounding your anxiety and guilt."
7700,"I'm in the same place as you are; at this point you should take a regular paying unrelated job to pay any bills you have. Definitely network with people, through linkedin, facebook, wherever. Know that you have a higher advantage over others when applying for work, you have a degree."
7701,"Hello, 

As a Chemist in the UK, I have a learned body (The Royal Society of Chemistry - I know that there is the American Chemical Society in the USA that is similar). Joining a learned body such as this gives you letters after your name, which although is fun, it's actually more important to look at the careers resources that they have available to help you with your next steps. 

The Royal Society of Biology I happen to know is nearby the RSC in London and so looking online I found their careers advice section. The RSC offer their members free [careers advice](https://www.rsb.org.uk/careers-and-cpd/careers/career-resources) (that's worth a lot of money) and also network meetings, companies often advertise through them too. 

Look into a society like Canada's equivalent to the RSC or RSB and they will gladly help you and once you have joined, all of the resources are included in the membership. 

RSB have a ""next steps"" PDF [booklet](https://www.rsb.org.uk/images/SB_Next_Steps_booklet_2018_AW_.pdf)

They often work with one another, so knowing that they have a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) in place with the [**College of Applied Biology**](https://www.cab-bc.org/), based in British Columbia, Canada, whereby Registered Professional Biologists (R.P.Bio.) in Canada can be recognised as Chartered Biologists in the UK, and Chartered Biologists can be recognised in Canada as Registered Professionals, I'm sure they will put you in touch with people and careers advisers who can help you. 

Some minutes later...

It looks like they are the body in Canada and offer [resources](https://www.cab-bc.org/file-download/student-brochure) similar to the RSB. You could join the RSB in the UK if you prefer or as well. They have members all over the world. 

I also know that my university offer free career advice for life and a quick search at UoT I found that they have lots of  [resources](https://clnx.utoronto.ca/home.htm); it's worth getting in touch as an alumni (someone who used to go there) and ask how they can support you. The almost certainly will. 

A few minutes later...

Done."
7702,"I graduated from a university in the states with a BS in biology and have been working as in QA operations at a biopharmaceutical company. If you enjoy a corporate environment, maybe look into Regulatory or Quality related roles. Feel free to ping me if you have any questions!"
7703,Not OP but I’m blown away by the amount of effort you put in for them. That’s really kind of you! Can I ask what the process is like to join the RSC and get the letters after your name?
7704,Have you checked out r/publichealth? You might find some buddies there :-)
7705,"What do people with a life science degree do?

Id like to know myself

Please keep us updated!"
7706,Thanks ! I will look into that definitely . But to answer your questions my marks aren’t very competitive I have a cgpa of like 2.7 although my last years were above 3 but still on the lower end.
7707,[deleted]
7708,Thanks! You’re too kind! So much effort for a random me . I will look into it for sure .
7709,"Joining is a quite simple, because they admit members who meet their qualification criteria, found here: https://www.rsc.org/membership-and-community/join/ 

You need to either be a student of, or hold a first degree or equivalent experience in the chemical sciences then, depending on your experience you either qualify for Associate Member or Full Member (AMRSC or MRSC). I think the annual membership fee is ~£100 a year (annual fee or monthly direct debit). 

Some companies pay for membership to professional bodies and you need to talk to your manager about that option."
7710,Did your college not have a job fair? See if they have any connections
7711,This x1000! Thanks !
7712,Thanks ! Pmed!
7713,Will do!
7714,Hey that’s actually so cool! I was looking at a one year post grad program at a Seneca college in Toronto. It’s a one year quality assurance and cannabis regulation program but I’m not sure if the jobs are good. I know that the jobs are probably there since weed was just legalized in Canada . If you don’t mind me asking how much would I expect to make or how much are you making and made at the start compared to now with more years in the industry. I know it’s kinda rude to ask so you don’t have to answer it if you don’t want to. But thanks anyways
7715,"There are definitely quality assurance jobs all over the country in the cannabis industry and will continue to be as it will always be pretty tightly regulated similar to pharmaceuticals.  Even in the states too I bet.  You can always google quality assurance cannabis and see what the salary is like and the scope of what you would be doing. 

I think it would vary how much you get paid depending where you end up and how big the company is. Starting out I would estimate around $40K CAD and then only move up from there. At the top of the quality chain is your QAP and they make upwards of $120K. Goals 😄

I started out at $24 an hour and now make closer to $30."
7716,Feels better knowing we aren't alone. I hope we both can find help in this post
7717,"I second this. I'm going to have anxiety over it either way, so I'd rather have 2 seconds of anxiety, get through the call, and take a deep breath afterward than be anxious for hours and hours and STILL have to eventually make the call anyway.

I sometimes comfort myself by trying to accept the inevitable. Like, if I know I have to do something the next morning, I'll relax the night before by telling myself that I'll have to do the thing whether I worry or not, so I might as well not worry. Expecting a phone call and worried there'll be bad news or an argument? Remember that the person is going to say what they need/want to say whether you're anxious about it or not. It'll just happen, and then it will be over. The anxiety only hurts you, it doesn't affect the reality of the situation at all.

Obviously you can't just think away anxiety, but it might help to tell yourself this. I still get a spike of anxiety when I see my phone ringing, but I just try to answer the call before the anxiety paralyzes me. Once I've taken the call, I can't back out. It's almost always not as bad as I thought it would be. And every time I successfully get through a call, I can remember it later on when I'm anxious again. I've done this before and it ended up fine, I can do it again."
7718,Practice interviewing. A great way out of this rut is to practice gradually until the fear is just a passing thought.
7719,"Practice interacting with people. I know it sounds stupid but I’m doing the same thing. Each week, make a new goal, like when you go to the grocery store make small talk with the cashier. Answer telemarketing calls and talk for a minute (nothing to lose there!)."
7720,"It's hard to do for me. I don't even have a car and my groceries are delivered. But you're right, small incremental practice is what I need to start working on"
7721,"Not sure where this stems from but as someone who dealt with something similar but not to this degree, I would guess that it's related to your self-worth in the job market.

In my case, I felt very anxious about new opportunities because I expected them to be tedious and believed that they would eventually lead to failure and no job. I felt judged and started to doubt myself and my skills. This stemmed from my history of being rejected over and over again. 

But at some point, I reached a feeling of indifference. I started valuing myself more and developed somewhat of an ego. I said to myself: ""These companies can go to hell. I am what I am and I worked so hard to get to where I am. If you don't value me then good riddance"". Yes it's a toxic way of thinking but it helped alleviate a lot of the interviewing and job search stress.

Tldr: Don't take the job search personal. You are valuable and  if companies don't see your value then move on. Be proud of what you've been through and I hope you find a job soon."
7722,"I think you guys are there most right so far. I need to not be in my head as much and just do. I know this seems obvious but honestly I didn't realize how it was weighing me down till you two addressed it.
Thank you both"
7723,"I'm mid 30s and I enjoy answering the phone these days ( keep in mind I generally don't give my number out to anyone unless I've known them pretty well for some time, I will give randos some social media contact or whatever) . If it's a number I don't know I answer the phone like ""Hello, this is <my name> speaking"", and go from there. If it's a telemarketer I ask them to remove my name from their db, they legally have to. However, if it's someone calling about a job; the thing you have to remember is they're calling you because they have a problem, and they're hoping you are the person who can help them to solve that problem. Mentally you can put the onus on them because they're calling you, and taking up your time. You don't have to take the freakin' job if you don't want it, PLUS you're more than likely NEVER going to be in contact with that person ever again, so don't be afraid of making a fool of yourself, you'll get better the more you do this, and you'll get worse by not practising. Just try acting like a professional about it,  don't be a dick but be confident, even if you need to fake it. Best of luck!"
7724,I think I'm going to make an effort to chat with my friends more and not like once every 3 weeks. That should help and then forever upwards. Thank you
7725,"I’m an introvert myself who hates answering the phone, but I’m guessing this has to do with fear of interviewing.

One thing I would say — and I am speaking as someone who has hired entry level people — is that they’re probably expecting some shyness on your end. You’re certainly not expected to speak perfectly. If they reached out to you for an interview, they’re interested! I once interviewed six people for an entry level job and ended up hiring the WORST interviewee. I never regretted that decision.

My advice:

- Let go of any need to appear perfect during this phone call, and any fear that you’re not qualified to even be having the conversation. Imposter syndrome is real: recognize it for what it is and move on.
- As an introvert, you’re probably used to having something of a running monologue in your head. For me, this is actually a space where I’m at an advantage in interviews, because I’m able to think through what I’m saying on the spot and express complete ideas.
- Others suggested practicing your interview skills. This is good advice. Focus on being able to provide a short “pitch” for yourself, the answer to that “so, tell me about yourself” question. What you studied, what you researched, what your goals are, etc. Be yourself. Realize that there’s a good chance that whoever you’re talking to is interested in the same professional things as you — take the opportunity to nerd out a little bit!

Good luck, friend."

7727,"This might be too simple of an advice, but I hope it helps nonetheless. I graduated in May 2020 and in June, I got a call about one of my applications- anxiety got the best of me and made up reasons to not call back (in this case, bad reviews on glassdoor) In July, I get a call back for another application and from decent medium-sized company, at least according to glassdoor, this time I ran out of excuses. It was a thursday afternoon, I sat down with my phone in my hand while building the courage to press the missed call number and whispered to myself ""its either: one day or its day 1."" The recruiter picked up my call and scheduled me an interview the next day. 20 minutes after my virtual interview, I got a call to start on monday. I've been with the company for 6 months and I couldn't be happier, felt so blessed to get a job 2 months after graduating.
Perhaps picturing the end goal can also motivate you to click on that call back button. Good luck!"
7728,"Maybe if those two examples are too big of a jump, practice with a friend? Not just with casual conversation (though that might help and be a place to start) but ask them to pretend to interview you or send a pretend email to respond to. It might feel really silly, but you will build up confidence and even some skill in responding."
7729,"Not sure how much I can help but I think it might help to create as rigid of a structure for yourself as possible, so you basically just have to go through the motions. Have some email templates ready so you just have to minor edits for each response, and come up with a checklist of things to do to prep for each interview (for example I always review my ""about me"" and situational-question responses, have questions ready about the job, and do research to have responses for ""why this company/role""). For me it's still stressful to have interviews, but having a checklist of things to do to prepare (and writing things down so I can reference them in zoom interviews) makes things a little less anxiety-inducing. 
Another thing that helped me was to do informational interviews with my friends. It was much lower stress than a real interview or practice interview, and it helped me improve at asking questions and really engaging with the person I was talking to. 
This is just what helped me, so your results may vary, but best of luck tackling your anxiety--it's not easy but now you have strangers on the internet rooting for you!"
7730,"Except thinking like this and just winging it may produce unwanted results, you may want to practice for potential questions they might have before calling. Prepare but don’t delay."
7731,"Just think of what things make you the most nervous, not just job stuff, and then come up with incremental steps to meet that challenge. Definitely go slowly and at your own pace!"
7732,"I’m not sure if you have access to a primary care physician, and in NO WAY am I suggesting to rely on medication, but I was prescribed a beta blocker for my speech anxiety and it helps TREMENDOUSLY with job interviews. Propanolol is a medication mainly for people with high blood pressure and all it does is decrease your heart rate. When I have a speech or job interview, it decreases my heart rate from going out the roof and overall helps my physical symptoms with anxiety. That way when I’m in an interview I’m not shaking, my heart isn’t beating through my chest, and it helps with being less shaky and sweaty. It’s a pretty cheap medication and again I’m not sure if this is an option for you, but something to look into. My other suggestions would be to respond to a potential employer immediately and practice interview questions. You would be surprised how much practicing interview questions helps your answers in the actual interview flow more naturally!"
7733,"Thanks so much for this advice. I've made sure to send this to a friend to help implement this but even beyond that. It means a lot to get advice from a fellow introvert. Imposter syndrome is really and the longer it goes the bigger it grows. Thank you again for the advice, I REALLY appreciate it"
7734,"Thank you, having templates ready to go would be so much stress off my back. I'm definitely going to implement this. I've also sent this post to a friend to help me implement these suggestions so that you so much. I really appreciate the advice"

7738,Wow this is literally me. I apply to jobs and then never answer when I get calls from unknown numbers. I get such a surge of anxiety and feel totally paralyzed from answering it.
7739,Thank you. I think I need to work on this but I've sent this to a friend to keep me in track. I can do this and I am worthy of what I am working for. Now I've just got to keep the momentum. Thank you again :)

7744,"Thanks you all for the support and advice, I can't express how much I really appreciate this communities response. Responding to (almost) all the posts in this thread had been me practicing! But we all know I can do better. Wish me luck fam."
7745,Is it introversion or anxiety that's getting in your way? If it's anxiety maybe think about seeking a therapist.
7746,"The bonus of office hours is that you can ask more or less anything. Go to a few and ask class related questions to introduce yourself, but then once you start to have a relationship, ask your prof over email to take a look at your resume, or write a recommendation for a job app, or even help study for a coding interview. Ask for permission via email and do it in person if the professor has time."
7747,"We made a video about this a few years back!

7750,Office hours.  Go to office hours.
7751,"Hi there! I’m currently working as a mechanical engineer and just graduated from college this past May with a degree in mechanical. I also did not like school but I pushed through it because I felt it would be worth it at the end. My job now is sooooo different from almost all of my classes - I get to design things in CAD all day, which is what I love doing and exactly what I wanted to do. I took two design classes in college and absolutely loved them, but I didn’t end up taking them until my third and fourth years of school because the first two years were a lot of gen eds.

My advice would be to try to find electives that aren’t necessarily straight up mechanical and see if there’s another field of engineering or a specific aspect of mechanical you really enjoy. A mechanical engineering degree is broad enough that you can do a lot of different jobs with it, and what you do at work won’t necessarily be what you did in school. 

Also, try to find people with jobs you think you’d be interested in (engineering or other fields) and ask them how they got to where they are. I did that a lot in college and it mostly made me feel better to hear that two people doing the same job got there through completely different ways. 

I hope this helps!"
7752,"For what it's worth, I guarantee an overwhelming majority of the other people feel like you. Getting a hard degree is a war of attrition. If you like it well enough keep on plugging away."
7753,"Being an ME means you're taught how to solve problems. Those skills can be transferred later to other fields. Unless you know what your true calling should be (it's okay if you don't), I'd suggest you stick through and earn your degree. You won't regret it"
7754,"This is exactly what made me leave my schools engineering department! I like some of the professors but I couldn’t stand my classmates, thankfully I found a great mentor in another department."
7755,This is actually really good advice lol. It seems like a superficial way to think about it at first but it makes a lot of sense.
7756,"My GF shared a lot with me when she was wrapping up her EE BS. The imposter syndrome doesn’t really leave till you’re in your first job/established as capable. She had done decently well and had been applying for jobs while wrapping up her degree, and the thing that stuck with me was “I don’t know how to be an engineer. I know a lot of math, and science topics, I can do x, y, and z, but I don’t know how to be an engineer.” You’ll pick up a lot on the job.

This all only works though if you have a genuine interest in it. The classes get tough, grades can fluctuate a bit, that’s expected in a tougher degree. But forgetting about your imposter concerns, and forgetting about your worries for the future, you need to know if you’re enthusiastic about what you’re learning, if by and large you enjoy your classes, or your peers, or your faculty. If you can look at a future of you working in your field and your thought is “I can’t wait for that,” then I’d say stick with it.

Take some electives, feel out other areas of study. I started in Applied Math and took a focus on computer science. Before long I ditched math altogether as I found I really enjoyed working computers and tech. The faculty were great, the students were helpful, and I just saw myself working in the field in the future.

Best of luck to you! Hope any of this helps even a bit."
7757,"Push though! I graduated with engineering and school was wicked hard. My job is so easy compared to a homework assignment. I’ve often told myself that a high school kid could do my job with proper training. It takes time to adjust to the work load in school. You’re not an imposter, you just have to adjust to that way of life. I was a very bad student in high school and didn’t do so bad for myself during college. Best of luck bud."
7758,"I'm in the same exact boat as you. I'm a second year mechanical and mechatronic engineering student, also contemplating whether to see my degree out. Because my university ""offers"" a 1 year internship (which you have to find yourself) it's actually a 5 year degree, and seeing how my grades have plummeted this second year, and I struggle to find any interest nor motivation to continue studying the majority of my subjects, I'm also having second thoughts. The problem is that engineering seems to be one of the things I'm most cut out to do. Maybe I just haven't found the degree for me, but I don't think I'd be much better at doing something abstract like art, nor would it give me as much of a certain or lucrative career like engineering.

Everything would've been so much easier if that aviation doctor hadn't screwed up my results when I tried to join the Air Force."
7759,"You’re always going to have the feeling of being an imposter. The more you learn the more you realize what you don’t know. This isn’t a bad thing, it’s usually a sign of intelligence. 

I’m in software engineering, and I’d say I worked harder in school than most given days in my career. Not always like that, but still easier over all. 

I would encourage you to finish. Maybe try some new studying techniques, things that worked for me for all of school weren’t enough in the last years of college. 

Here’s my closing advice:

* No one knows what they’re doing, we are all just stumbling in the dark. 

* You’re never going to _feel_ like an expert, even when you are.

* If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room."
7760,"I swear I’m not a dream crusher. What I’m about to say is just semi-related to a lived experience.

Basically, art history is something you can’t do much with unless you get a MA or PhD, and even then, it’s grossly competitive and ripe with burnout. I’ve had several friends and mentors walk out of museum sciences because of this. Your BA doesn’t mean you have to continue your education in art history. Having any BA is a great stepping stone. Don’t undersell yourself there. Most people change careers multiple times and their BA often doesn’t match up with their career trajectory. It’s normal now. It’s okay. 

I highly recommend an MA in administration or pursuing something in finance. With your art history BA, you could then potentially push yourself into the nonprofit sector, which isn’t always great money, but I’ve met people who climbed toward six figures. By the time you finish school, the economy likely won’t be in tip-top shape, but it could be good enough to get in with an internship or two. Don’t feed into the idea that internships are just for kiddos. 

Another recommendation is AmeriCorps VISTA. Plenty of people apply during career changes, and while it’s pretty rough money, you are getting paid, get a $6,000 education credit at the end of your contract that’s very flexible, and you can put the experience on a resume with or without the AmeriCorps label. A lot of people in nonprofit go this route, so it’s a great talking point in interviews, too. Again, this is VISTA, meaning it’s mostly administration work. I’m not sure if that interests you, but it’s been a solid option for many. 

I’m sorry things have been so rough, but there are options out there for you. You’re still incredibly young, and it’s not uncommon for people to end their 20s with a career flip. View it from that lens, express it to yourself and others like that, and it really sets aside any shame or self-loathing you might feel because you’re ‘behind.’ Have confidence. You sound like a hard worker who was dealt a bad hand and some misinformation. Good luck! I’m wishing you the best."
7761,"I feel really sorry for you
 This is what colleges do, they give you false ideals of ""get degree. Get Job get rich.Get family. Get happy"" and society pressures young people into that false goal. Then when they fail they just laugh at them or ignore them.  

My only advice is if you have any other skill or any opportunity to learn any other skill. You are still young enough to reinvent your non existent career."
7762,I don’t know anyone who thought they’d get rich by studying art history. I don’t even understand the thought process of choosing a major without considering how much you’ll be making.
7763,"Unfortunately, this is really common. I sort of did the same thing because I had no financial literacy and was the first in my family to go to college. It took me until almost 30 to figure out what I’d done to myself, and now, I’m working my way out. It sucks. It sucks so hard, and I did my best to impart what I learned onto my younger sibling when they entered college, because wow. Money sure does run the world, huh?

People need to push financial literacy programs in impoverished rural areas. There’s a ‘college is the end all’ myth in areas like that where you grow up being told getting any degree will keep you from working in a factory or trades that break down your body. You’re never taught to think beyond that. Likely because just figuring out how to pay for the fucking degree takes up so much brain space, especially at first. 

So it’s all just. A lot. I totally get how it might seem alien and downright stupid to not consider your future salary, but it’s a real thing rooted in real social problems people refuse to solve."
7764,"I'm all for people learning trades, however, just like college learning a trade is not and should not be for everyone. It's just one of many paths."
7765,"Sorry to hear about your situation my friend. The advice I would give you is that if you don't know what it is you're interested in, do something that will make you money as a result. Take a coding bootcamp. Learn daytrading. Get a cybersecurity certification.

However, based on your post it sounds like you have an interest in art, so maybe try working for a local museum or art gallery? 

Wish you all the best."
7766,Develop a skill set that people look for... that may require you to stop playing video games in the evenings. Try to learn basic coding maybe?
7767,"Actually make sure you like coding first. I got tired of hearing the ""just learn to code"" advice so I went to a bootcamp only to realize I absolutely hate doing it, I'm not particularly good at it, and can not think of anything I want to do less than code."
7768,"There is something thing about working in trades that nobody ever talks about. 

They don’t have the same employment rights as everyone else does. 

-	Vacation time doesn’t get banked.
-	Job security lasts as long as the project does.
-	Performance is 99% based on just being there on time and getting the job done on time. 
-	You’re made to feel guilty about taking vacation time. 
-	Speed takes priority over safety and quality."
7769,Yeah I was thinking the same reading that. I just didn't want to come out as harsh. Art history and language majors are among a few others the most stupidest degrees you can get. The only job left would be to teach others the same subject.
7770,"yall ever realize how insane this is? now we have perfectly rational human beings rightly telling other people not to go to school.. to finish high school and just stop

imagine what kinds of people benefit from the people telling themselves to be less educated

shit society"
7771,"Stay with your parents and go to trade school or go back to college. Don't fall for the lie that you're too old to return. 

If all goes well you have 4-6 more decades left on this Earth, what's 2 years of a little more schooling gonna hurt?"
7772,I feel like people with an art history degree want to be like those sellers who do paintings at auctions or whatnot or so passionate about art they want to teacher others. That’s like two of the job qualifications.
7773,"Perhaps go to your local library and see if there is a career center or other resources for signing up for a course or learning about new job opportunities.

Wishing you the best of luck!"
7774,"Have you considered going back for an MA? That would open up a ton of gallery and museum jobs (hopefully, once COVID is over)."
7775,"No I don’t want to gamble away another 100k. If I go back to school it would be to an accountant or something practical like that. 

I have no interest at all in tech so programming and related careers would not suit me at all."
7776,"I have a bachelor in fine art. Art school was amazing. I learn so much and many of my friend have great careers. I went into curating and teaching and work in that industry for two year. I decided to leave and pursue my passion in skincare. I went to esthetician school. When I graduated I work in a medical spa. For a five month program my salary double and I was making more money then I did teaching or working at a museum. I am now getting my master license and applying to a master in dermatology science program. Art history from my experience and the student I see is one of those majors that require a lot of investment and the salary is gonna be low. Big curator might not be making 6 figures. If you really want this industry in museum work most job opportunity open at a PHD. Look for fellowship, that allow you to work and learn at the same time. You might have to juggle and work part time else and part time at a gallery. Sometimes unpaid internship and work have to be done in this industry. If you are not feeling this industry anymore consider a new industry"
7777,"When I was 18 it was either that or McDonalds. I was trying to escape my unhappy home life. My dad committed suicide my senior year of high school and my mom started dating my art teacher and moved him in with us. I just wanted to get away from that and college was the best option to do so

I inherited money when my dad died and I do not have student loans as a result."
7778,"I have a college degree and a pretty good job but the opportunity cost is fucking killer. 

I’m urging both my younger brothers to pick up a trade be a happy kid with money, then go to college when you understand what you want out of life. 

I wish I had an older brother tell me this, I hope to god my brothers listen.

Work is work, it’s going to suck at the end of the day. If I would have jumped off the tracks of high school to college I wouldn’t have been a waiter as long. I wouldn’t have sat in/paid for bullshit courses I ended up not needing for the major I graduated with. I may or may not have a lot more money right now also."
7779,"Art History is really not a stupid major. A lot of my former classmates have great jobs (in museums and auction houses) with just a BA in Art History. I used to have an OK job related to my degree...

I think if I would have majored in Math or Engineering or something I would have failed out or dropped out. If I wasn’t studying something I was interested in I wouldn’t have finished school."

7782,"Is the census job part of the federal civil service? Sounds like it may have some future growth possibility. Is there someone a bit further up the food chain you can speak to about future possibilities? What about more random jobs like firefighting or trucking? As you're an art history major, you're probably good at written communication. Is there a way to demonstrate that skill in the census job that provides value?"
7783,"I'd suggest checking out youtube for the 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson. Right about now, there's not much you can do to fix the job market, and switching trades takes time and you're in emotional turmoil NOW- the most powerful part of your post, to me, was ""let myself go and not worked much"". You can start with the little things, like cleaning your room, taking care of your diet, taking walks... and a better path will eventually open up. Don't try to tackle it all at once. You can do it, bud."
7784,"I had a job in security at a museum a long time ago but I quit after only one day. I was only being paid $10 an hour and the work was incredibly boring and demeaning. 

There isn’t much upwards mobility in an art museum from security. Museums typically hire tons of security staff and also have a small pool of professional staff. 

The two pools don’t intermingle. The security guards usually eat lunch by the loading dock while the professional crew obviously enjoy much better facilities to do so..."
7785,why sunk cost?
7786,"I don’t know. I really dislike living with my mom and it hurts my mental health to share a common space with her. Plus I can’t have a social life until I move out... all very good reasons not to focus on school right now

There are also very few opportunities in my hometown... wages are very low and jobs hard to come by"
7787,Omg this is the exact path I’m going down. I’m currently finished up my Art History and philosophy degree. But I plan to get into skin care too and then hopefully start a business within that area. How was esthetician school?

7790,"It’s very important to remember that the progression in the psychological field isn’t linear! It’s a very up and down process haha 

I’m around halfway through my MSc in psychological disorders and I’m going to do a doctorate in clinical psych but first I need to go get at least a year of work in a clinic or home before I can get there! 

It sucks because I want to get trained in the different therapy approaches but a year or two out after my masters gives me a lot of time to mature, travel, save money and get experience! 
So if you want to keep working for a while then do! 

But make sure that year or so is also full of gaining experience (in the UK most unis will require a year minimum of clinical experience to train you for a doctorate)"
7791,"3 is definitely super important. I JUST switched fields from Corporate AV to Musical Theater Audio (degree in audio) and I took a pretty massive pay cut. HOWEVER - I’m way happier than I was at a job that didn’t respect me for still garbage pay. 

The Corp position allowed me to have a cushion to allow me to take this pay cut temporarily until I developed more rep in this industry and so far it’s working out.

I’d really take #3 to heart - happiness over financial gain will always “pay” itself off."
7792,"I was going to say that. Many programs require a ton of logged clinical hours to receive certifications like a CAC in the US. Another option would be, if possible, to just work a couple of the “good” nights at the restaurant like Fri/Sat then work during the day full time. Some rehab/treatment centers also offer flexible hours so you could have two part-time jobs. The value of those hours career-wise may be worth more than an extra $50/night during the week."
7793,"I would say it’s okay to take a break. What’s the rush of getting into it? Save some money! In psychology, it’s easier than most fields to find something part time. If you’ve worked at this place for a while, they would be okay to work with your schedule. 

I worked full time as an adoption worker and did my old job part-time on the weekends. The psych field takes some time to develop into better money. 

But do what’s best for you now. That degree will always be there! So will the master programs. They take people straight from bachelors programs or after 6 years in the field (like me).

Edit: lots of typos"
7794,"I'm currently in my first year of grad school for counseling psych, and I took a year off to work in retail. I didn't make that much money, to be fair, but it's helping now that I have less time to work outside being a graduate assistant for the school. 

Anyway, according to my professors who either still work or have worked as therapists, skilled counselors can make around 80k per year on average, and that number can go higher or lower depending on where you end up working and how specialized you are. I'm not totally sure how that number compares to what you're making a a server, but I assume you want to go to grad school because you'd enjoy working in the field of psychology more than this. 

Like a few previous comments have said, you should make this decision yourself rather than listening to a couple randos on the internet, but if you become a counselor and are good at what you do, you'll be making a fair amount of money, so I think you just have to ask yourself what you're comfortable with.

Hope that answers your question, and good luck in your decision making!"
7795,"I was in your exact situation when I graduated. I applied for a ton of pharma sales jobs which I was constantly turned down on because I don’t have sales experience (my current job is also very lucrative, as a server in a major casino averaging $300+). I got offered starter positions in medical sales, that requires a bachelors degree, starting you off at 30k/yr! I think for someone who is by themselves, I don’t know how you could live on that.  
What did I do? Well, I’m still at my current server job and decided to go back to school for nursing. The more I think about my BA, honestly the more frustrated I get. I hope you get guidance from these posts, but just know you are definitely not alone."
7796,"I am getting into grad school this may after working 2 years and half to save up for school of course. Listen buddy If that’s what you want to do and you think grad school is essential for your career advancement and something you will enjoy doing then go for it. If you are happy with how much things are going right now for you then that’s a different story, if your worry you can’t keep up between both a job and school. If I was in your position, I will keep my job since it pays me well, but also I will be taking classes but minimum numbers every semester so that I can keep up with both. That way I am doing grad school on a slow pace and also have a job, best of luck. Will be in similar shoes soon."
7797,"At your young age you should optimize for developing high-value skills and your career, not short term cash flow.  You have no family obligations, etc, so cut your expenses as much as possible and make every decision around how it will develop unique skills, knowledge and/or advance your career.  

It’s hard and requires sacrifice, but is increasingly necessary in a difficult and tight economy.

If you need short term cash flow to fund grad school, fine, but make that decision is based on how it propels your career, not on other considerations. Also try every other possible alternative like grants and stuff before resorting to taking a job that won’t move you forward in skills or career."

7800,"I'd make a list of skills you want to learn, then find internships at jobs where you'd learn those skills. Even shadowing someone for a day, or offering to intern for a few weeks for free would help you decide which path sounds the most interesting. Good luck 💙"
7801,"I went through a very similar thing. Grew up thinking I’d be an engineer but ended up not liking it at all in college and struggled to find what to do and it hit my grades pretty bad for a bit there. Somewhere along the way I got heavily interested in personal finance. I started reading books, listening to podcasts, and reading blogs about it. 

I switched my major to information systems because I liked business, process improvement, and computers. That is when I took an accounting class and learned more about the field. There are loads of avenues to pursue, the job security is good, and the pay is pretty solid. I have decided on accounting mostly as a means to an end. It is a good path to take to reach financial independence if I play it smart by the time I’m like 40. It is also something that my interest in personal finance kind of aligns with. We will see how it goes. 

Point is, it took me 2 years bumbling in college and losing motivation, getting depressed, etc. until I got an idea of what I wanted to do. Some people it takes longer. It’s cliche, but it honestly will come to you. In the meantime I suggest you choose something logical. It is not necessary to have your job be your passion (contrary to popular belief). This advice can be pretty bad and it led me to nearly spiraling down a hole because it didn’t work for me. Life is long, your passions, hobbies, and interests will change. Just choose something that isn’t underwater basket weaving and you will be fine."
7802,I was considering volunteering for the animal shelter that might be a good place to start. Looking at jobs on Indeed is driving me crazy so maybe Idealist will have some better listings

7809,"I took a personality/trait test a few years ago, via the college's mental health center(at my local college Ofc). Literally matched me spot on with the career advice I was kinda expecting, but was surprised with the results at the same time. At the end of the test, I got a list of career options that I would probably do well in or would fit my personality, and I'm pursuing one of them right now out of my own choice, not with the choice of the personality test. 

But if you have a therapist or are even in college, then take a personality test. I'm pretty sure you can do this online as well if you can find a legit website. I think this will give you a better view of what you'd like to do career wise."
7810,I wish I figured this out before I graduated. Not that I would have really known what major to switch to anyway
7811,Did you end up taking one?
7812,Looking into it now. Somewhat expensive but sounds like it could be helpful.
7813,"These are for the most part already covered but just to give you an idea of what my experience was... First of all don’t worry too much when looking at vacancies. After a couple of them you’re bound to feel overwhelmed, I often started feeling more and more inaccurate as the day(s) passed. It is ok and normal to feel that way and most importantly temporary. Fake it till you make it, you’ll have to make mistakes somewhere to be able to learn!
 
Secondly, more specifically about finding what you like and what your strengths and weaknesses are; scouring Linkedin profiles can really help to get an idea of what other people have done, how you may stand out, and what other possibilities there are that you might have missed. It might help to make notes while you do this.
 
Lastly, I often was afraid that I’d pick the wrong job/experience and that I’d be better off doing something that might be even more related for my later career. Don’t wait too long, finding out that something ain’t your jam is just as useful as finding something that is. I for instance didn’t know if I wanted to work with children or with elderly (as a psych student) - I took a job as mentor for a spec needs child and although I figured out I didn’t want to work with children, I now know why and still had fun and learned a lot in the process (about myself, but also general skills).
 
Anyway, sorry if I’m rambling, but I felt the same this past year and just got out of it. Hope it might help. Good luck!"

7815,"Hey there [u/boonetown18](https://www.reddit.com/user/boonetown18/), I have sorta been through this. When I was in high school I thought I wanted to be a dentist.  I did well in high school and went to university and it was a struggle for me in the 3rd year.  I got sick and had a stressful living situation and I just fell apart.  I dropped out and got a job in a restaurant.  Fast forward several years and I went back and finished school with an art degree...with no intention of applying to dental school.  I ended up moving abroad for 5 years and teaching English.  From there I got credentials to teach in my home country and did that for a couple of years but it wasn't for me.  Now I run my own business and my career is starting to make sense.  I have 2 points: the first is don't think of all the twists and turn as failures but as stepping stones.  Second, be open to possibilities when they come along.  Without my past experience I wouldn't be where I am and what I have learned along the way has really helped me in my business!"
7816,"it is extremely good, I agree, the worksheets and inventories are the best part as well as the some od facts and figures provided."
7817,South Korea!  It was hard but I grew to really love it there!
7818,80k hours
7819,I’m definitely afraid of picking the wrong job especially since my last one (call center sales rep) went so terribly. I’m sure that feeling will go away eventually and something will work out.
7820,Sounds like you have a great story! Where did you teach abroad?
7821,You're welcome!
7822,Thanks
7823,"you’re right!! I feel like I have a pretty good sense of self worth outside of the professional setting, it’s just something I need to work on. I’m getting my degree in environmental science and would like a job with some travel and where i can apply my autocad/gis skills."
7824,What you are describing is called imposter syndrome. It’s very common and I would say almost everyone experiences it at some point in their life. Do some research on it and you will find lots of resources to help you overcome it :)
7825,"That's up to employers. All you can do is shoot your shot (over and over and over and....) with fingers crossed. You could find work this coming week, you could find work 18 months from now. You have no choice but to play the game."
7826,I’m on the same boat as you. I feel like college doesn’t prepare you for an actual job. I’ll be graduating next week and all I really know what to do is study for tests and write research papers.
7827,the uncertainty is what really makes me nervous haha
7828,"What you are feeling is called imposter syndrome. It is very common. I suggest you make an appointment with the career counseling office to help you with the job search process. Cover everything from your resume to practice interviews. You are going to find that entry level jobs are just that, beginner jobs. This is just getting you started I’m your field. Any company that hires you is likely to have their own orientation and training too. Your employer knows you are just starting out. Relax and go live your dream"
7829,exactly i wish i realized the importance of networking and finding experiences outside of courses earlier on
7830,"You are worthy! Those feelings might help you avoid the other end of the spectrum- you know- the entitled folks who think their degree is a Golden ticket to 100k/year or more on day 1. That’s generally not reality. 

Apply to everything you’re interested in whether you feel fully qualified or not- let that employer make that decision. Then when you land one, learn everything you can and work hard as you can like you’re serving the king. 

It’s what you do after landing the job that makes you deserve it, not what’s on paper beforehand. I have for sure hired people who didn’t check all the position description blocks because I got the impression they wanted a shot to prove themselves and would quickly fill in what was missing!"
7831,"A couple examples:

- No/not enough time doing exactly what I needed but was eager to learn, had a passion for the activity, or had a passion for who we were serving

- Had never used a particular software but was generally familiar with the OS, environment, and engineering in those environments. Explained about another time they quickly learned a new technology and how they would be willing to do the same or asked if they could spend their first couple weeks in a boot camp or crash course to get up to speed.

- They have a degree in unrelated field but experience or passion for the field I’m hiring for.

- My favorite is when they are looking to break into a different field and demonstrate how they’ve obtained skills or have qualities that are parallel to what’s required and that they could use for me if given the chance.

- They have done some research, study, or training on their own about what my job requires or did something with it outside of conventional employment because they were genuinely interested."
7832,"I’m in my third year as a high school teacher and I felt the same way when I started applying. All the advice so far is good, but I’d like to add that some positions and some companies will expect you to be unprepared for the position to some extent and will give you your own training and mentor. They’ll usually be your main source of help as you learn the job. If the company doesn’t do that, make some friends in your work space who you can talk to and ask about anything you need. Also, I’ve always been told and I say it myself. It takes about 5 years to really know a career job inside and out. Until then, you’re learning. Also, keep in mind you always have more options than whoever hires you does. Don’t feel obligated or get tricked into staying in a role that doesn’t treat you right. Some companies will try to take and abuse you and you can’t let them. You’ll find a place where you’re happy, so look for it."
7833,Do they do recruiting at your school? That’s a great place to get a job from because they know you’re fresh out of school.
7834,"If you're about to start your final year of undergrad, I recommend getting an internship to get your feet wet in your chosen field first! That way you have some experience when you do land your first job out of school, and you'll feel more prepared! (Coming from an HR professional who just graduated this year, had an internship for 2 years, and am comfortable in my role.)"
7835,I feel you. I’ve been applying to jobs since end of April and haven’t gotten anything yet. I’m also a recent grad and feel like I’m not qualified for anything
7836,what did those people that you hired do to give that impression if their resume didn’t completely match the job description?
7837,"I believe in us dude! Just keep applying and pick up some skills while you have the time, that's what I'm doing now :)"
7838,"A month ago, I'd been in your shoes since December. All anyone said to me was ""Yeah, it sucks, but everyone goes through it."" And that's the truth.

Is there some sort of cosmic comfort that you're joined by millions of people who've gone through or are going through the exact some thing? Maybe, but it still fucking sucks. And when you finally get through it (because you will), you'll be feeding everyone else the same line."
7839,Thank you everyone for the suggestions!
7840,If you have to ask then no.
7841,"If your school has this then they also might have a career center where they can help you make a solid resume, mock interviews, general advice etc. If it’s like mine they’ll designate counselors to different areas of study who are more knowledgeable in your chosen field. It’s worth looking into."
7842,"Exaclty! Those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. — Steve Jobs

Take Garyvee for example (he’s an entrepreneur) 
- he was an immigrant and his parents were dirt poor from Belarus. 
- he was a d and f student (his words) in high school and college, attending a college where most of his friends ended up in prison. 
- he hustled so hard in his 20s and gave it up to become successful in his 30s. He worked so hard and was patient and became a millionaire

He is an ordinary man who worked so hard and was patient for a decade in order to achieve the success he did today. Anything is possible if u put ur mind to it. It requires a lot of patients and hard work and determination. He is not a genius nor particularly handsome. He’s just an ordinary man with a lot of determination. 

You really could be a governer if u wanted to be. No one is stopping you. Did u ever think Rosa parks a black woman who simple said no to someone could change the nation? Well she did.

Success is not going to come straight away obisously and some may have more hurdles than others but u can do it if u believe."
7843,"Success can mean something different for each of us. Success might mean a happy family for you or a nice car for another person. 

Always aim for something tho, when we stop dreaming we stop living. I’m trying to become a paramedic now lol big doubts in myself but I’m not giving up yet."
7844,"This statement is rooted in a certain amount of privilege. If you come from money and have the right last name, you can be anything. If you are born to a family that has been subjected to centuries of disenfranchisement or are a the first in your family to graduate college (let alone high school) or you had to start working as soon as possible to help support your family then the deck is heavily stacked against you. This statement is meant to assuage the guilt of those who could do something to create a more equitable and just society but refuse to."
7845,"The next governor? Maybe not. But there’s no reason you can’t be *a* governor.

In 1922, FDR was a 40 year-old crippled law school dropout. He became the governor of New York.

In 1992, George W. Bush was the 46 year-old owner of the Texas Rangers and a few failed oil companies. He had a whopping 2.2 GPA in college. He became the Governor of Texas, even in the shadow of his scandal-ridden father.

And why can’t you be an actor? Matt LeBlanc was literally homeless when he auditioned for the role of Joey on *Friends.*"
7846,"While it’s true that only you can only have so many governors (for constitution reasons) it is not true that there can only be so many rockstars. There’s no limit on them and who determines who’s going to be the next rock star. This industry is a little different to governor in that there’s a lot of luck needed tho. But as for govenor, you can still be governor if u wanted. It may be for a short time and not something u get in the first decade of trying but it can happen."
7847,It's true if your family is comfortable and has a decent amount of money. It's b.s. if you come from a poor family that can barely afford the bills.
7848,I would also like to point out that if one cones from a privileged background (like Bush Jr.) it’s easier to realize these goals than if you weren’t.
7849,"Yes and no. Obviously you have to be reasonable, but you can usually give most things a good shot.

What I have found is that nothing bad (in the long run) ever comes from just going for it and trying to achieve these things. Even if you don't quite make it to your original destination, you usually end up somewhere you didn't expect and somewhere good for you and it kinda just works out.  Having passion and ambition is always better than just not even trying in the first place. You'll always end up a better person from trying."
7850,Exactly!!
7851,"If taken as an absolute gospel of truth, it is complete horseshit. If you are, for example, born as a black woman with terrible genetics in a poor unstable family in America, there is no way in hell you are ever going to be the President of the US, no matter how hard you go after it."
7852,"Utter bullshit. Life is a maze. There are a lot of obstacles, twists and blind turns. Another similar crap is ""follow your passion""."
7853,"it's bs. sure, plenty of people will find something they're particularly good at and will excel at it. but most people will simply remain average. that being said, being average is not necessarily a bad thing."
7854,"Half true, half BS. You are capable of much more than you think, but you’re not capable of everything. For example, I could have worked my ass off as a kid and teen but I definitely don’t think I could’ve been a professional athlete"
7855,"I would check out the book/audiobook “So Good They Can’t Ignore You” by Cal Newport. Quick summary, the “follow your passion” advice is bs. Passions aren’t innate, they are developed. Pick something that you could potentially be good at and then stick with it."
7856,"Yeah, that's why I'm not having babies. 

Why bring someone into this world, just to be disappointed with how terrible it all really is."
7857,Ya it doesn't have to come from wealth or material items (that's what most people think.) As long as you're happy that's all that matters.
7858,This^
7859,"Exactly! 

20 years from now you’ll regret the things that u didn’t do more than the things u did"
7860,It is important for us to recognize different factors that provide privilege to one group and disenfranchise another.
7861,Yes!! ^^
7862,"There are limitations, yes. But the array of possibilities that still exist of what you could become are VAST. Usually, we are unaware of what possibilities are available and get bogged down just because one door is closed. Experience through reading, meeting people, and trying stuff for ourselves are ways to become aware of the possibilities for success and happiness."
7863,it is true but it has a big IF which very often can be prohibiting. it's kind of of an oxymoron really
7864,"It is true to a DEGREE

No matter what your faith, practice or spiritual belief is - there is a very deep power the mind has and how it will subconsciously begin to shape your reality. 

If you are like most students after college you are rightfully scared, nervous and thinking ""I'll never get a job"", ""Ill never find work"", ""Ill never be qualified"" - and the problem is you are creating that reality for yourself. 

If you can give yourself small goals - it starts to map out. 

I use myself as an example. I graduated in 2002 with a very useless degree in Saxophone Music Performance. When I got back home to NYC, I started applying to every role possible. I was always turned down and after every turn-down I got more depressed and feeling worthless. 

Finally one interviewer asked me what I wanted to do. She said I didn't get the job but gave me my first real career discussion. After talking to her for an hour, I realized that the field of Human Resources sounded interesting and I began to apply specifically for HR jobs that were entry level. 

Once I had direction, things started to get easier. Instead of saying ""I'll never get a job"" I started saying ""I want to work in HR"". I read HR articles for free and spoke to a few people that worked in HR, and I began to think like an HR person would. I noticed my interviews were going MUCH better. I was now being invited for my 2-3rd round.

I got my first job as an HR Coordinator about 3 months later, and I loved it and I loved the field. I decided that by the time I was 30 I wanted to be an HR Manager and make a 6-figure income. At the time I was a low level HR Coordinator, but I started ""thinking"" as an HR Manager. I did what an HR Manager would do, I went back to school to get my masters, I talked to HR Managers and I began introducing myself as an HR Manager because it felt like I was one, I just didn't have the title yet. 

Evertything started unfolding pretty easily. The more I thought about being an HR Manager, the more resources came up. Books, meeting with people, work experiences and I by the age of 28 I was an HR Manager earning 6 figures. (I live in NYC so this is a lot less impreessive than it sounds)

I had a long career within HR - and I've seen a lot of people do the impossible and I've seen a lot of people fail. What I find to be the most prevalent them between either is their mindset and setting small attainable goals that you can believe in and charge yourself with. When I was right out of college, and thinking ""I'm going to be an HR executive and make a million dollars"" there would be a small (or large) part of me that wouldn't believe that as reality so it would never unfold. 

You can be whatever you want as long as your mindset, perspective and goals are clear, attainable and that you are supporting your belief with actions and behaviors that lead to that outcome"
7865,No one can tell you. Just go after what you want 100% and it’ll either work or you’ll be satisfied knowing you did everything you could.
7866,"I tend to say no... I have three kids, aged 11, 9 and 8. I tell them all the time that they WILL find that they are good at something. I'm a Christian, so I tell them that God has given them specific gifts and talents, and discovering them will lead them to their career ""sweet spot."" 

I don't necessarily think you can chase after something hard enough to make up for a lack of natural talent. 

I am a counselor, and I remember in grad school, one of my professors had us do practice counseling sessions with classmates in front of the class. We were asked to take notes of our classmates as they practiced their counseling skills and honestly critique their techniques. One of my classmates, who I really loved, had her practice time, and when she was done, our professor said, ""I don't think you have a natural instinct to be a successful counselor. It isn't about being nice or giving advice. You seem to lack a natural talent and understanding of this career."" 

Major major OUCH. Like, damn. But, today she's not a counselor. She got her degree but is not in that career. She worked really hard to study counseling and psychology and psychological theories. But she lacked that natural talent. 

I think hard work goes a LONG way... but you also need to figure out what you're good at. I have no doubt that you have natural talents that others don't have. If you can figure out those talents and throw your hard work at that talent, honing it and perfecting it... you'll find success."
7867,"It’s bs, is what you’re saying. Just in the nicest way possible"
7868,"Precisely, in current times, especially in the US, social mobility is at an all time low. To suggest anything else is to ignore the empirical evidence."
7869,"Not to be a wet blanket but your post disregards the systemic struggles faced by many People of Color (especially Black and Indigenous people), women, and LGBT people.

People of Color in particular have faced centuries of disenfranchisement from slavery and genocide to redlining neighborhoods and reservations without adequate resources to current policies that, while not explicitly racist, have disproportionate negative effects on communities of color."
7870,"Precisely, what the poster failed to realize was that both of these individuals were several steps ahead to begin with."
7871,It's true to an extent. So much of success is based on mindset and drive. Confidence and hard work goes a long way
7872,I like this. And it would help me gather experience  to better my chance at landing a full time job. I appreciate this. I decided though that I’m going to push through and be more patient with myself and less tough on myself and not let potential mistakes or stuff define me if I do make them along the way of becoming the stable person I know I can be.
7873,"I had a very similar experience about a year ago. In my case I had to put on big boy pants and I got fired from two professional jobs over the course of that year. Fortunately I recovered and was re-employed after 2-3 months each time but without that year and those hard experiences I don’t think I’d be as on top of my life as I am today.

Personally I’ve found tightening up getting healthy and dealing with things is actually much easier when you have to. If I would have taken the year off that I wanted to I think I would have only delayed the inevitable and just made my problems worse during that time.

I think regular schedule and having to show up prepared for work 5 days a week has been healthy for me. And you’d be shocked how long a weekend can be when you’re making money and don’t have to worry about exams or anything (long in a good way)

But that’s my case. Can’t speak for anyone else"
7874,"Stop working for your parents. Even if you don’t mind being around family, living away from family has helped a lot of my friends depression."
7875,"Does anyone have an idea *why* getting a job while working is easier? Does it signal something to a hiring manager or something? 

I feel like being employed doesn't allow you to draw any real conclusions about the applicant compared to unemployed unless there's a big time gap"
7876,"I really appreciate this response though. My anxiety stems usually from a place of needing to be perfect. The perfect health, the perfect son, the perfect friend. Now I’m worried about being the perfect employee. So hearing that you were able to rise above gives me hope. Thank you. I’m already giving up on myself without even trying. I appreciate you and I’m so happy for you. Keep on keeping on!"
7877,"Oddly enough had an experience not too long ago playing  Age of empires taught me how self-killing the perfection goal can be.  

At a time when me and my friends were getting deep into it, playing over discord every other night, finally learning meta they would freeze up and want to quit if they placed a building wrong or didn’t perfectly harvest their early-game resources.  While this can have a large impact over the course of a game it’s hardly fatal 

I was the same. But. After a bit of time I realizing they were all doing this and seeing how much mental strain was being lost in their panic over really small losses I stopped caring when I made mistakes and developed an approach of letting the mistakes slide and just continuing progress ignoring them. Shooting for what I knew or at least at the time saw as the correct method and if I fucked it up not even giving the mistake a second look and continuing on. 

I was pretty shocked how much of a difference this approach made. They won’t play with me anymore because I beat them every time :("
7878,"I graduated a year ago. I thought I would stay with family across the country for a while and help them out since they needed the help, and I had a job lined up to start a few months later. During that period of time where I didn’t have structure in my life (no job or school), I became even more depressed and anxious. Constantly ruminating over things, feeling like a complete failure, etc. When I started my job, the depression and anxiety didn’t go away (of course), but I do feel a greater sense of accomplishment and feeling productive has helped me a lot. 

If you have a solid plan for how you will spend the year, being productive, being social, etc, and you have the financial ability to do that, I don’t see a problem. But for me, it was a recipe for loneliness and rumination which really made my problems a lot worse."
7879,"My suggestion, work part and use the other free time to work on yourself and seek medical attention. Anti-depressants take a while to dial in, but once it works it can change how your GAD and depression effect your life. Maybe once you’re feeling better you’ll be more up for something 9-5."
7880,"Not sure if it's a hiring manager thing, or just that someone interviewing who is working likely has more confidence, has more recent and specific answers to situational interview questions, and comes across as less desperate for the job because they are still doing some sort of work.

I think that at least working part time also helps to maintain a structured schedule and a sense of normalcy, which can be helpful for transitioning into full time work down the line. Plus, they may find something that they didn't know they liked doing (ex. I never realized I loved spreadsheets until I started working with them)."
7881,elaborate? seemed sound enough to me.
7882,I have been feeling the same way lately. I have applied to over 100 jobs since January. My motivation has been at an all time low for the past few months since my internship ended.
7883,Get a part time job and seek help(or just do the latter if you can't do both)
7884,"I understand what you mean and the kind of feelings you get just thinking about moving on, however if you take a year for yourself doing “nothing” this useless feeling will only get worse, getting a job helped me as I felt similar about this, but since I’m working now I have been doing a really good job and people depend on me now in the company and this feeling is great, at the start it will feel like shit, however the more you grow in the company the more useful you will feel and this feeling will help you personally too, I’d say you should start working or at least in a voluntary field, taking a year off is really not something I would recommend at all as it only gives you more time to think about how “shit” you are(not saying you are, but this is the feeling about yourself from what I understand”, go for it and get some experience, I believe in you stranger :)"
7885,"Pretty much what has already been said.

I personally got bored just sitting around doing nothing.  I would advise you get some kind of part time work. It is very difficult to ""to get yourself together"" if you aren't doing something. It is a series of habits that will help define your success. There is only so much time you can spend and not much you can learn while sitting on the beach.

The only benefit I see of taking the year off is you may come to the realization that there has got to be something else to do. Every time I get pissed off about having to work I remember how boring it is not having anything to do."
7886,"Yeah I feel this. I’m definitely not trying to sit on my ass all day. It’s a little ironic because HR is what I’d like to do and I’ve been applying for entry level positions. I don’t put an emphasis on making my life all about work anyway. I’m an “in and out” kind of person and I would just love to have money in order to publish books and stuff in magazines and build a name for myself over time.     I ultimately suck at selling myself. 100% suck at it. I do have a good amount of experience, though. Maybe after being so fed up applying to many places, I’ll actually feel worthy of a job I hopefully land knowing I did that myself from my own efforts of searching (I suffer from imposter syndrome, so it’s big for me to know that I’ve accomplished things on my own)."
7887,"I look at applications, not having a job after school or nothing at the moment is looked at as a lazy person, if they have an applicant with a job they will pick them first every time, this is also backed up by data as leaving the “confort” zone is harder than people think and being late or lack of responsibility will develop the longer you don’t do anything"
7888,I mean it’s definitely more on the common sense side but i wouldn’t call that “bad” advice.
7889,[deleted]
7890,This is bad advice
7891,Thank you so much I really do appreciate the advice. I do no that I kinda have to keep this job until something comes along I just guess I was looking for confirmation if I should leave a job and possibly take a pay cut to go somewhere. I.e a $40000 year job over this one
7892,This really puts in perspective. Over 40 years of a job making this much more it really wouldn’t change my life insanely. 40 years of daily not enjoying what your doing just for a couple nice purchases doesn’t seem worth it. Thanks for being someone to talk through this with me.
7893,"After college I had a job where the commute was too much. 3-4 hours a day. 

I wanted to find something while I was working but it was hard since I was always commuting and so far from where I wanted to work. Eventually (with the support of my wife) I quit and did a full time job search. I used a recruiter and within a month I was able to find something much closer and only took a small pay cut ($2K/ year). 

It was a great decision. If you live in the area where you want to work I wouldn’t recommend quitting like I did. But I would recommend using recruiters. You can use a firm like Robert Half or jump on LinkedIn search a company you want to work for with “recruiter” after. Then connect with them."
7894,Don't sell yourself short; your ceiling is not 45k.
7895,I am a service coordinator for an insurance company. I visit people’s homes and help arrange things like home health aides. But literally nobody speaks English and it’s such an obstacle for me that it takes me out of it.
7896,"I don’t really have a “path” but I just graduated with a BS in psych and soc, minor in global health, and found a recruiter who got me placed in an entry level job where the pay range was $60-70k. This was unusually high for their positions and I lucked out with it fitting into my prior experience, but I totally thought $45k was my cap too. Definitely work with a recruiter!"
7897,Absolutely. Don't settle for shitty jobs if you don't have to. Good luck with whatever you end up pursuing!
7898,"Umm basically their job is to find applications and future employees for a company who has an open position(s) and have paid them to do so. They’re free, however, for you to use. I just searched recruiters on LinkedIn in cities I was applying and connected with them and sent them a message each time. I looked for a nonprofit recruiter in SF Bc I wanted to work in nonprofits, we Skyped so she could get a feel for me and my experience and what job I wanted, then she told me about a handful of positions she had open that she thought I may qualify for and enjoy, then they send your resume over to the employer and the rest goes from there. again, totally free for us to use. It’s a huge asset. Their goal is to get you hired and fill those vacancies Bc they get paid from the hiring company when they do so."
7899,I’m curious what’s your job like ? Day to day? What do you actually do ?
7900,For a bachelors in psych? Do you possibly know a path with a higher ceiling? Could use some encouragement tbh
7901,Thanks man
7902,Psych just was interesting to me. The idea of talking and looking into things that can help the brain get better. A masters degree will happen in the future I plan on attending after I get married next year and I just in the meantime pretty much feel stuck.
7903,"Job retraining for a municipality has the highest job satisfaction for psychologist.  
The pay is not great but it typically comes with very good benefits and a pension."
7904,Well for future interviews I suggest asking the interviewer to walk you through the day to day for your position. They should be able to do that and if not then they have no idea what they’re talking about and that should be a red flag for any job
7905,"Don’t quit before you have something else lined up. 

Every potential employer I interviewed with lied to me, or at least stretched the truth. One of them, an international bank, told me there would be lots of travel. I got a passport before I started. On my first day, they handed me a bus pass, and that is all the travel I have seen so far, now a year in. 

The hard truth is that you need to make a life outside of the job. They call it “work” and pay you to do it because it is not fun and not how you would normally choose to spend your time. 

You need to decide whether you want the money this job pays or you would rather go somewhere to work where you might be happier, but it also might pay a lot less and leave unable to ever retire. Personally, I suck it up every day aiming towards retirement. I don’t know that the ideal job is really out there, at least not for me. 

All the best!"
7906,Keep your head up bud don’t under-sell yourself. Could potentially look at something in Digital Marketing or Advertising. Consumer Insight and Strategy has good area for growth and uses transferrable skills from your psych degree.
7907,"Ok then try this. Your four year degree means nothing to most of the companies out there. You need experience to get a real job doing real things, and if you think you can just leave and find another job you like better making more you’re sorely mistaken. I can’t give you a timeline because I’m not the exact same career path as you, but maybe you want to do some actual research instead of vague reddit posts. If you wanted to make 70K right out of college you should’ve been an engineer or became an officer."
7908,Literally these are just people on LinkedIn that do this? Like I live in southern New Jersey so I would just go on LinkedIn look up recruiter and get connected with them?
7909,you can do this or go through an agency
7910,"I feel the same way. 45 a year is actually pretty good in terms of first jobs out of college. You don't need to have it all figured out right now. Invest in yourself and your future. Do the best you can for this job now, and then when you've exhausted the learning potential, look elsewhere. I usually recommend a year before you start looking if you can hold out that long. If you can't then start applying but be prepared to have those discussions. Eventually, you'll get promoted and with promotions, you'll get more money.

I'll say this, never worry about income. It's just a means of living. I would work for free if it meant I lived my job."
7911,If you don’t like the job because of the corporate culture there you may just want to look elsewhere. If you learned that in practice you really don’t like the field of work that’s a completely different issue. If you like the field but need an advanced degree to get the type of position you want is a third issue. For the last two I suggest keep your job to gain work experience and go to part time grad school. This is to either get qualified in a different area or get an advanced degree. Now that you are out really think about your current situation and list what really makes you miserable to help you figure out what you need in a career. Good luck
7912,"Hey there [u/Dougary96](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dougary96/),

I can't offer you advice on how to fix this but maybe you can change your perspective?  My brother got me onto this and it has really helped me: I think of my job as the thing that allows me to do the things I like.  I have hobbies and interests and my job pays so that I can do all the things I enjoy."
7913,This is a really not bad idea at all.
7914,What is a recruiter? If you wouldn’t mind explaining that process to me it’d be really helpful
7915,What kind of job was that? I don't know many entry level jobs that pay $60-70K unless in finance or something.
7916,Okay. This is fair advice. Sorry if I came off rude
7917,"No worries, all the best"
7918,Okay. Thanks for steering me on this I always assumed a recruiter was working for the specific company and only them.
7919,"Yes I also made appointments with some agencies by looking up recruiting firms or staffing firms in the area, sorry forgot to mention that. But otherwise yes, I just searched them on LinkedIn and connected. Some even reached out to me before I did them! It’s a useful tool
And again completely
Free."
7920,what made you want to pursue a degree in psych in the first place? I remember my first of intro to psych my professor told us about careers in the field. She basically said that you’d need to pursue a graduate degree to really get anywhere. What about going back to school for a masters?
7921,"“How do I be happy?”


“lol u chose a dumbass stupid major, go be an engineer and be miserable”



Reddit never ceases to amaze me with the level of total dogshit advice they give."
7922,The government? Why should the government have a say in what you can and cannot study in college?
7923,"The government pushing STEM and business as the only degrees that will get you a job is the reason why we have a surplus of people with STEM degrees and business degrees who are not using their degree. There is no such thing as a sure thing major, a lot of it is being in the right place at the right time and getting lucky (unless you have parents or some other relative or family friend who can gift you a first professional job)."
7924,"What I'm suggesting is that blame needs to be spread around and shared between students/families, the government, colleges/universities, and employers because they are all culpable stakeholders in creating the current awful situation we're in. Blaming any one participant is shortsighted at best and scapegoating at worst, and we're not going to fix anything until see the forest for the trees.

Students/families need to better educate themselves when deciding on college and making sure that the choice fits within their current financials. The government needs to crack down more on predatory behaviors among colleges, stop pushing lies about higher education (like that STEM is the end all be all to gainful employment), pass legislation to force employers to consider applicants current in the US (citizens, permanent residents, those here on other employment/study related visas, etc.) before those applying for new H1-B visas (like what is similarly done in Europe), and crack down on the predatory behaviors of employers that are forcing students to be put in these awful situation to begin with. Colleges/universities need to stop engaging in predatory and deceptive behaviors (make them all publish gainful employment numbers and other student outcomes). Employers need to stop relying on unpaid internships (which are technically illegal in the US) while simultaneously requiring a masters degree and 3-5 years of experience for an entry level job that pays \~$12/hr with no benefits."
7925,"As someone else suggested already, writing a blog about museums/ history/ related interests  is an extremely good idea! 

Even if it won't be financially profitable (at first, then maybe who knows you could get some ad revenue), it will be an amazing addition to your CV, and also to connect with people with similar passions and building a network out of it."
7926,"If OP will be unhappy doing anything else then why pursue something else? I have a friend that works in a museum and although he makes less than me, you should see his eyes light up when he talks about their new exhibit in Babylonian scripts or Napoleonic coins. 

I know I am speaking from the fortunate position of being passionate for a field that is in demand, but sometimes vocations/careers have more to do than just ROI.

Pursue what you are passionate about OP. If Museums are your life and blood, then by all means, chase after it with everything. It might involve sacrifice (moving, terrible pay,etc.), but you seem like an ambitious guy/woman so please do what makes you happy. Life is too long not to ;)"
7927,"I know several people who had well above a 3 with internships, co-ops, and research experience who are struggling to find a job related to their STEM degree. They're also in relatively large cities. It is not the silver bullet that everyone makes it out to be."
7928,"Do you really love museum studies, OP? Is it something that would be really fun for you to do for the rest of your life? 

If so, it’s worth carrying on with and wracking your brain to find every possible “in.” You’re in a field that’s notoriously light on positions, but if this is really your life’s work, you should be able to get in eventually if you’re a real motherfucker about it."
7929,"I had my dream internship position before covid. I remember no matter how bad my depression was, every day that I was in the museum I was happy and motivated."
7930,"The number of people who I know who went into ""in demand"" fields, attended goods schools, did well, networked, and did internships, co-ops, and other things to make themselves more competitive and can't get a job related to their degrees would all beg to differ. These aren't people with your general biology degree either, these are people with degrees in like computer science and mechanical engineering (to name a few)."
7931,"Unfortunately this is realistic advice. A masters/phd may provide more credibility to get OP where they want to be, but there’s a reason we can’t follow what we’re most passionate about - not everything is marketable. If you don’t have a solid plan you shouldn’t keep sinking time and money to chase a dream. I know that this is never what anyone wants to hear, but I’ve seen so many people push for something unrealistic because they’re told to follow their passions."
7932,Well said
7933,"Alan Watts once said “Do what you love, and if you eventually become a master of it, chances are someone will give you a good fee.”"
7934,"So then what, Congress should limit the amount of degrees universities can give to prospective students to ensure that those who graduate get a job? You can't just create a job for every graduate. What's your argument to solve the problem we both agree exists. I'm saying that relying on the gov to dictate higher ed supply/demand is foolish"
7935,"Echoing others, you may have to move... maybe you will have luck looking for archival positions in different types of organizations?

It’s going to be a crunch for a bit... it’s just so crazy how covid has affected first years and graduates so extremely and so differently. As a 2020 graduate, I feel the crunch. Even without covid, it’s tough out there.

Just make sure you are doing something so that there is no gap in your resume. If you have any personal skills you want to develop like drawing or other freelance type skills, now is the time to focus on that. Think of two things - a. What skills would you enjoy learning? b. What demand is there for this type of skill?

There are so many small odd jobs now that do require technical skill. Find something you like and work on that until you can get into your field of discipline."
7936,"Check out /r/museumpros. 

I’m in the same situation. I got an art history degree and can’t get a job, so I’m thinking of becoming a plumber or carpenter. I’m still waiting to hear back from a local residency center, but if I don’t get the job, I’ll just work in the trades."
7937,"To everyone including you, thank you. Each comment has helped more than I imagined."
7938,"Is there any way you can work at that specific museum again? You might have to start working remotely and then transition to an in-person job after covid. Are you good with social media and communications? Maybe you could run their social media and emails to members, or you could run virtual programs. Maybe you become a development associate and work in fundraising for now. 

Also, USE THOSE CONNECTIONS!! It sounds like you had a great time and your work was valued by your supervisor. I’d recommend reaching back out to your boss at that museum and ask if there’s a position open now, or if they know of any similar positions at other museums. Ask if there are museum job boards/FB pages. 

It’s so wonderful to hear that you had one great experience, and I know you’ll find one again! This is a REALLY TOUGH time to be looking for a job. Don’t worry if you have to take a break and do something different for a while. If you’re not really committed to grad school, don’t rush into it. 

Good luck!!"
7939,the problem is maybe your passion isnt marketable and should be a hobby instead
7940,"Are people with stem degrees having trouble finding jobs?  I think as long as you have above a 3 and some internship/TA/research experience while in college, you can find a job.  I've even had friends who had below a 3 get work from STEM.  Just not in the best location."
7941,"Clearly not enough people; but that doesn't mean it's the government's job to regulate who gets to study what. We live in a free society where you deal with the consequences of your actions. Don't want to go into a highly sought after field? That's your prerogative, good luck with your career. If you begin to realize the limitations of your degree AFTER you graduate then maybe college isn't for you in the first place"
7942,"> while simultaneously requiring a masters degree and 3-5 years of experience for an entry level job that pays ~$12/hr with no benefits.

Wait, this is happening for people in CS and mechanical engineering? Man, you can make that kind of salary working for a fast-food restaurant..."
7943,It felt right.
7944,Pursuing something you love and enjoy and having to eat bean sandwiches and drink tap water is better than doing a job you don’t like in exchange for creature comforts.
7945,Good thing about it being a hobby is that it’s purely for fun as well. If someone told me I had to watch reality tv 40 hours a week to put a roof over my head I’d suddenly hate it.
7946,">I got a degree in museum studies/history

lol. youre having trouble finding work because you dont understand how supply and demand works.  how oversaturated is the demand for history majors? very.  no ones spending that much money on museums.  dont get a masters you will only be digging yourself into a deeper hole. or do get a masters to make yourself happy a little while longer and keep the fantasy going before you hit the real world"
7947,Who knows when they're 18 that their degree won't get them a job?
7948,It's unfortunate but a lot of graduates can't find jobs because there are not enough jobs for the degree. I'm not sure why the government let's this happen
7949,"In my 20s I went from homeless to college grad to homeowner and transitioned genders in the midst of all it. It was a crazy time. Now that I've hit 30 I'm trying to settle down into a routine and explore new hobbies like fishing, writing, and painting."
7950,"Get off social media! Stop looking former classmates up on LinkedIn! Quit comparing apartments or vehicles or fancy meals!

The 20s are difficult enough. Adding social media to the mix as a voluntary pressure cooker will make it a lot harder to find the habits and interests that serve you best."
7951,Definitely the most difficult. I don’t know when it will let up. You sure need to plan out your life at an early age. Pursuing an education in something I love seems like a huge mistake in hindsight. I’m glad I got through it all. The fire might have burned me but it didn’t consume me. Trying to have relationships in my 30s has almost been a complete failure. Probably from my isolation and addiction but also anxiety. Be careful who you welcome back into your life. I don’t know if I could claim any of the last 9 years as exciting. My lifestyle has changed so hopefully the last of my 30s will be better than the rest of it. Writing this has depressed me some but I’ll go ahead and comment and not delete it.

7959,"One thing I realized is that you sort of aggregate all the things your friends buy with their money together (as multiple people with multiple interests and incomes) with yourself (a single person with a single income). So, one friend may spend their money on a nice car, and another may spend their money on expensive vacations, and another may rent a luxury apartment, but very few are dong ALL of those things at once. But when you compare your friends to yourself, you think ""Dang, all my friends are buying cars and clothes and houses"", when ALL of your friends aren't buying ALL of those things, and you very likely have something that your friends are envious of that you don't perceive."

I just graduated college and after spending 5 years of work getting that degree, I realize it’s not what I want to spend my life doing after a few months interning. I’ve been unemployed for almost 7 months now. Girlfriend of 6 years (roommate of 3) left me during quarantine and now for the first time in life I’m off the guided track, truly on my own and completely unsure of what to do.

I’ve recently got into backpacking and camping as it’s something I’ve always wanted to do and have been opening my mind to doing bigger and better things like traveling the world (or country at least) with everything I need on my back and living the simplest life I can of ra few weeks or months at a time. Really anything is possible moving forward and it’s important to remember that."

Probably buying a house in the next year or two, they are just so expensive (looking at like $400-$500k range for a small sfh for my area)"

7991,"Right now I think a lot of people are doing that. I am usually the type who obsessively mkaes plans, but since being stuck at home, pretty much all my plans went out the window and I've been forced to learn how to be flexible. As hard as we try, we can never plan out how our lives will go."

7994,"Your resume is getting you interviews so that is not the problem. It doesn’t hurt to tailor your resume to the individual job posting. Work on your interviewing skills, research the company, have a 30-45 second pitch for when they ask you “tell me about yourself”. Start with work and school experience, then move into a quick tidbit about yourself personally (where you’re from is a good one)."
7995,"If you’re going to submit code/GitHub repos, it should be well commented and organized, so someone with little context can understand what you did.

Why is your code not OOP? It’s good practice to abstract and modulate code. The point of it is to reduce complexity so others can understand what you did. Take some time to do that. It won’t help that your code is super complex but not understandable to the tech manager.

Feel free to pm your github link"
7996,"Does a project have to be object oriented for it be looked at as quality work? Some things I've done with side-gigs have been too complex to turn into object oriented code.

If I put coding challenges that I've done up on a private repo I share with employers, is that noteworthy?"

And OOP sometimes may not be the best design patter anyway :)"
8000,"Another option if you’re desperate is to take a different but related job in a company where you can make a move down the road. One popular example that was pushed when I was in college was Wegmans. They have a ton of people start at entry level jobs, but that with their degrees and certifications are able to transfer up into their desired position in a year or so. If you’re flexible with your definitions then having a not directly IT company where you can move into their IT department later can result in a solid career."
8001,I've tried Apex Systems. It hasn't been too successful.
8002,Have you tried getting into software testing?
8003,"Highlight anything you have completed. Employers want to know that you finish what you start. 

Also, highlight any teamwork. Employers want to know that you can play well with other. 

I interviewed a guy who highlighted his skills and told us that his colleagues were a bunch of idiots. He did not get a second interview."
8004,"I’m confused, are you trying to get an IT role or a software engineering role? Im not clear on why you’re practicing programming problems"
8005,"I second this, I got interviewed and hired super quick after I applied"
8006,"Just because you aren’t in an IT direct position doesn’t mean you won’t use your skills. I have a coworker in QA who is an IT person, who keeps his skills sharp by working on items for people (typically phones and laptops) and consistently studying and working on new certifications. 

Skills only get rusty if you let them."
8007,That’s unfortunately very common now. If you’re still near your school they sometimes will offer workshops for recent grads that can help you hone your interview skills. It might be worth it to look into.
8008,Did you have an internship in college?
8009,"I haven't, that's an interesting idea I might explore. I did unit testing in one of my internships but, no full fledged jobs yet in this role."
8010,"Depends, a project should be designed with a paradigm in mind, though. If not OOP, then data oriented (typically for performance), or some other pattern. “Too complex” is kind of a non-answer. If someone told me they didn’t make something OOP because it was too complex, I just take that as they themselves weren’t able to translate it into OOP. If they instead said they opted for xyz instead of OOP because reasons, it looks a lot better."
8011,That's strange. Have you applied for jobs close to the govt? like contractors or sub contractors
8012,"Of course, I wasn’t trying to take that away I was just saying that maybe mentioning that it was “too complex” to convert to OOP might be something worth not mentioning or simply rephrasing (ie claiming and backing up that it wasn’t worth making OOP because it would take too much time) because otherwise it just comes off as a time where you did the job but ultimately weren’t able to deliver everything they wanted."
8013,"You're getting too close there. The NSA from my experience either recruits directly in college, or hires people that already have their foot in the govt space. Also, if you do apply they take forever to get back to you. That's normal.

Aim for contracting jobs though. Seems hard to believe that you've done 200+ applications. Something is off, it may be that you're bombing the onsite interviews."
8014,"Unfortunately, that's done partially because of economics. It's kinda disappointing since after you've been removed as a candidate, the employer doesn't want to waste any more man hours on you. Provide even basic feedback on what a candidate did wrong and a lot of people will then attempt to correct their mistakes and follow up with the recruiter, or even make excuses for their mistakes. But again, at this point the employer has moved on and doesn't want to spend any more time on you, since recruiters have to be paid for their hours, so they just ignore follow up emails since they don't really benefit any from responding.

It can be frustrating, but IMO the only way to improve in the job search is a lot of  self reflection on what you did wrong which can be difficult when you feel everything went perfectly. Comparing your interviewing with other people who were successful also helps a lot. Or, it may not even be the case you made any mistakes, just that another candidate simply had more to offer. 

I got my first internship for this summer and the way I prepared for it was mainly though watching youtube videos and reading accounts of what recruiters are specifically looking for from a candidate during first, second, and third round interviews. I think that helped me a lot as I was too focused on projects and what I did to meet requirements, rather than the difficulties and challenges that crop up within each project and how I overcame each of them using skills I developed in college and in non-academic settings."
8015,"That's a good first step. You need to sell yourself. Whatever is on your resume, you should be able to pontificate on it without hesitation. If you get asked something, you should sound confident and competent. If you get asked what tools and platforms you use, you should list them like the back of your hand. If you get asked what version of XYZ you use, you should know that too (because you work with it every damn day). Of course, you should be able to answer technical questions.

I've axed interviewees for not knowing the stuff I've mentioned above."

8019,I would think picking up a project and succeeding where a past seasoned programmer has failed would be more noteworthy.
8020,"Yes, never got a response or got denied. Ex: the NSA."
8021,Ya... it's hard to know how you're doing when most experiences seem positive and then you get declined. There's not really a blackbox to a system that doesn't provide me with much except a cash sink.
8022,"It literally was that though, the client wanted a complicated program (without going into too much detail) to organize data and perform like a proprietary program. I wrote a non-OOP that performed all of the features of this unnamed program but, for free. The previous programmer tried for months to create a program in the OOP design pattern and failed."
8023,"Well, prior to college I didn't really do interviews so I'm taking notes and trying to improve my performance by reading books, mock interviews, etc."
8024,"Ehh, getting a job in law is super hard right now. You better stop cancelling those interviews. I dont know why you are feeling like an imposter when you should feel the crushing weight of your student loans coming due.

8028,"Yeah. 

I feel really bad for OP. I feel like i'm an imposter a lot, but i just think ""fuck it I'll just try my best and if I'm out of my depth i'm just wasting someone else's time."""
8029,"I'm from the UK, what crushing debt? :P"
8030,I feel like it would be more impressive for a fraud to get a job at a law firm so if you pull that of it would be pretty dope

8032,You can do it!
8033,Wait I actually love this approach
8034,It is better than $300k
8035,"3rd year of practice, still deal with it regularly. I've learned to embrace it. Fake it til you make it. And I fucking mean that.

You don't need to know everything. And it's ok admit such and say you will do some research and get back to someone. Same with your resume. You are getting interviews which already says plenty about that. But be thorough, resourceful, hard working, and most of all CONFIDENT! Even if you aren't inside. And I'm positive it will pay off. Get out there and give it a go, I promise the thought is worse than the experience 99% of the time. Action is the antidote to despair"
8036,"Graduating law school is a great accomplishment, you would not have passed if you didn't learn anything. The problem might be that you are nervous about interviewing. It might help to read some books/articles about interviewing and how to answer interview questions.

Edit for clarity"
8037,I’m about to start grad school and I always has the feeling I never belonged. That somehow I managed to fake my way in and that I was going to fail and end up dropping out. However some of the orientation material our school has given us has gone over that feeling and I never knew it was called imposter syndrome. Yet knowing that I’m not the only one who feels this way has made me feel a bit better.
8038,"Don't pass the opportunities. 

Even if you fail, it's good learning experience for your next interview."
8039,"I mean you’ll still have, what, £45k of debt? Not exactly a laughing matter."
8040,"Roughly that yes, but I'm not forced to pay it. It only gets paid when I'm earning over 25k and I think repayments are about 9% of my salary"
8041,I should probably let you know that all debt gets wiped after 30 years too. The UK system is by no means perfect but lightyears ahead of the US
8042,You will feel like that for sometime but with experience the feeling will go away. Go to your interviews
8043,4th year as a practicing lawyer. Imposture syndrome is stressful but helpful to make you a better lawyer in that you will typically be better researched on the law. I worry about lawyers that don’t know how much they don’t know. You shouldn’t feel too out of place because law school doesn’t teach you much besides how to think like a lawyer. Your real legal learning is just beginning. If I get stressed about not knowing enough law I remember that it’s all just made up by humans in an ever changing experiment that usually favors the rich or powerful.
8044,Just you wait my friend... JK I hope you don't have to go through this

8046,"Dude.

So can you."
8047,"Bro, whaaat. In the states I have to pay my 60k+ USD debt with my 25k salary. Which, mind you, is in the fucking field I went to school for."
8048,"Damn. That's cool. I'll survive just fine, but wish it didn't have to be like this for us US folk."
8049,"I used to feel like I didn’t deserve my 1st degree. In my second year I had time off due to extenuating circumstances (an overdose), and was late handing in assignments, so I figured my lecturers gave me higher marks out of pity."

8054,"Jobs being posted online to LinkedIn and allowing “1-click apply” is why I think a lot of people say they’ve applied to thousands of jobs.

It's probably not a safe time to be expanding your social circle, though."
8068,"Hobbies are a good way of meeting new people, for example if you like running. sometimes people like to arrange meetings on social media where they decide a place where everyone meets up and then run together, probably not right now because of the rona. But hopefully you get what I mean"
8069,"Hard with the pandemic right now, but it's probably doable.

I made a lot of friends through playing Magic the Gathering. I picked it up in college and met a lot of people in my community that way, and it's easy to google a local game store when I visit a new town, call them, and ask when an event is happening. I have met some of my closest friends through total happenstance, too! One was in a sport fan group who wanted to carpool to a game, we hit it off, I went with him to trivia, and met all his friends. Now we're all pretty close even though some have moved away.

What are you interested in? Hiking? Board games? Trivia? Honestly I would hop on Facebook and look for groups in your area that fit your interests (you might have to get creative with your search terms). If your area has a subreddit, drop a post there!

Honestly I find dating really difficult myself. I've found what works for me is picking *one* app and sticking to it rather than a bunch of different ones. Especially since you described moving to a small city, the dating pool may be small, and an app or website is going to be able to help with that by setting distance preferences. Just be genuine in what you're looking for, and use good quality photos.

Good luck!

Quick ninja edit: don't forget to drop your old friends a line once in a while, too! Playing games online with my friends over Discord or Steam has been really cool when we couldn't hang out in person. I've played Halo with friends all over the US in the past month, for instance."
8070,"I always tell people to stick with their hobbies because that’s where you’ll find people who like what you like, but if you don’t know what those are yet, get some groupons and just start going to random things and see if you like any or if you vibe with anyone there."
8071,"saving for myself to refer to later :,^) thanks man"
8072,"This is what saved my social life after college, I went through the same story, where I lost a huge majority of my friends, or rather that we were still close, but because of physical distance, could almost never hangout to the same frequency again, it was actually very depressing to look back and think about.  

What saved my social life was downgrading my job to something with more work/life balance and then having tons of hobbies, even more true if it's a relatively social hobby. If you're reasonably social, it's also a ridiculously easy icebreaker, because you can bond over that activity. For me, it was filmmaking, video games, music, cultural activities and basketball. I went to most of these events alone in the beginning, but the world is really small, even for me being in one of the largest cities in the world, and after a while people in the same scene tend to stick together, so you'll likely see familiar faces again. 

When I show up to a hobby event, the number of conversation starters you can easily have with people. ""Yo did you guys catch that game, what'd you think of Lebron's buzzer beater?"" ""Have you seen that movie, we need to shoot some special effects!"" ""We need a rematch in Mario Kart!"""

8079,"I also graduated a year ago and I also have not started much of a career. I took some time to fulfill a dream of mine that was in no way related to my career. All I can say is these things take time. One year is not that long and it’s okay to not have everything figured out I sure as hell don’t. 

My mindset is: make a decision and go with it. That’s what I’m trying to do. I’m not sure if marketing is right for me either but I’m choosing to be decisive and just roll with it and if in 5 years or something I find out I hate it well then I’ll go from there. 

Just ask yourself what’s important to you right now is it money? Working with people? Being creative? Sometimes you just have to choose one and go with it. 

Also I’ve been job hunting for about two months now and places ARE hiring don’t be discouraged by the news. You might have to lower your expectations a little but it’s totally possible to get hired right now just set a goal for yourself mine is to apply to two places a day, that really ads up quick! I’ve already sent out like 50 apps and gotten interviews set up! The current situation sucks for sure but I promise there’s hope."
8080,"Everybody's faking it, dude. I graduated last Spring and luckily I had a job right away. Luckily, I only needed to seriously apply to one job and got it. This is definitely not the case for the vast majority of people. My advice is to just apply for anything that sounds even remotely interesting, If you're a business major for example, pretty much anything with analyst, consultant, etc. type of title is a good starting point. Just throw a bunch of shit at the wall and see what sticks. You don't know if you like a job until you try it. Hang in there."
8081,"Hi there

About a year ago, I started trolling and lurking this subreddit and I've been paying attention to the common themes and frustrations that you have. (Sorry, to explain I'm an HR Director with about 15 years of experience)

I started getting really angry about 4 or 5 years ago when I started to see that we (at least in the US) push this forced idea of school > school > high school > college > now you're in huge debt

Oh, but we actually aren't going to teach you anything remotely valuable. Rather than talk about career choices and development, or pay structures or benefits or recruiting, let's instead make sure you know what happened in the Byzantine Empire and calculate the ratio of a rhombus.

Oh and even though you didn't learn anything of remote value to working for most companies, you absolutely need this expensive ass degree, otherwise no. 

Though it may not be of any use to you now, I did publish a big ass guide that covers all of these questions, it's all free. Feel free to take a look and hopefully it points some directions for you.

8082,"Hard pass. Worked as a mover for two years, and other physical jobs for years before that, and I’m done. I’m a fighter as well, and physical labor detracted from my training. The job I’m past the second interview for now would allow me to work from home on my own schedule, so I’m hoping... If not, I have other things lined up."
8083,"Idk if this would help, but. Regarding feeling daunted about job descriptions/requirements, try to see those as wishlist then actual ""requirements"". That list was probably written by HR going like ""I want this, that, and yeah that could also be good. And..."" But they will likely never find anyone that fits all of the descriptions. So it's more like a wishlist than actual requirements. At the end of the day, they are just going to hire some of the best options they got, which could ,possibly, easily be you :) I think good rule of thumb is if you fit at least half of their wishlist, you are probably good enough to apply"
8084,"I’m in the same position as you. The best advice I can give, is to not force it! Don’t force yourself to find a path because you feel like time is running out."

8089,"I do 4 out of 5 of the things you listed (I'm not much of a church person). Things are temporary, I've known that and am trying to accept that as is with everything going on right now as well. My parents have had a very hard up bringing, unfortunately were not part of the group that got things handed to them. That's part of the reason why they're so hard on me, they don't want me to be struggling in the way that they have been their entire life. They see it as I have a few steps up of where they were at this age so I should be doing better.

I started going on dates with someone the week before things got bad, we're still talking 3 months later so I'm hoping that's a promising sign and it's definitely something to look forward to.  Thank you for the advice. 

PS: I'm a lady so not much of a father figure haha :)"
8090,"I also graduated a year ago and am not really sure where I’m at.
I literally by luck landed the job I’m in in Feb this year, and was gassed as I get to travel around the UK every week.

3 weeks into working came the lockdown and I’m stuck at home, doing shit tasks and no travel.

While I still don’t know what I wanna do with my life, I now know for sure it does not involve working from home or at a desk. I yearned for a big city job simply for the money, and figure that I can stick this out for maybe 1 more year to save up and then take some time to “find myself” and worry about what my career is gonna be another time. 

Apply for lots of jobs, reach out to a recruitment agency. Job descriptions and requirements these days are so full of rubbish, trying to make it sound like the most elite thing ever. Try any job for a few months, if you don’t like it update your cv with what you’ve learned and get searching again.

My mum has worked in a local shop for 20 years and hates it, but was hired at a time when you could drop your cv off and have a job the next day. The application process is so daunting to her that she spends her days just dying to get home. Dont let your worries or fear put you off from applying"
8091,"Nobody knows what they are doing with their life, i'm unemployed, living in my parents, turning 24 in a few weeks, i just got a call back after 6+ months of hell searching for a job. It's okay to not know what you are doing, a bunch of people i know still don't know what they are doing"
8092,Thank you so much for linking that. I will definitely give it a read ASAP. The whole education system (especially the debt) makes little sense to me. I graduated with high honors and barely remember anything/feel like nothing I learned is applicable. A big joke.
8093,"Ill be fine- I dont fear things like I used to. When I was your age I felt the same way- going through things with someone else (job losses/depression/deaths in family) shows me that your life can be flipped upside down one day and right the next. As long as you arent struck down by a terminal illness or a freak accident that no one predicts everything can be rebuilt. I have 4 years of work experience and plenty of friends to help me out and a good degree. This will be infinitely harder for people your age through no fault of your own.

What you can do

\- do nice things for others with no repayment

\-try to learn new things

\- get a hobby and excersize.

\-go to church every now and then (dont get obssessed though because thats just as bad)

\- Be active in your community.

Do NOT worry about dating but make effort (I met FI at 23-4 years later we have had plenty of good and bad times). You cant control if you can biologically have children but you can be a father figure in multiple different ways (adoption/remarriage/coaching). Kids rock. You can also get divorced at any age as well and life with someone else is half awesome, half difficult- choose someone that will love you unconditionally no matter your income,race, career, political views. You can only control what you can in this world.

If your parents give you shit they are horribly out of touch and naive due to that generation being handed everything by their parents and dont take it seriously"
8094,That is true but due to a glut of people being out of work you are in no position to be picky. The generation before us jacked up the ROI on education- masters degrees are a dime a dozen these days (both of us have them) and dont teach you anything about the job. Thankfully- I was fortunate enough to pay it off while working- dont be misled into the belief that you should go 90k in the hole in this economy for something that has a 20 percent cahnce of being fruitful

8106,"20 isn't even close to being too old for college. Every class I took had at least a few people in their 30's or 40's in it. One of my good friends at work didn't graduate with a bachelor's until he was 34 and he's doing fine. 

Let me tell you a secret. Your family, your classmates, and everybody else, they don't actually care that much what you do. If you choose a path in life, people tend to respect it. The only person you need to worry about is yourself."
8107,"Yes! A degree that not only can be used but that you’re passionate about. Debt is no joke. Military is also a great route and may give you the time to explore what it is you love... and then help pay for school later! 

The “experiences” in uni all depend on what you do with your time. Will you party? Volunteer? Travel for credit? Will you have a hard time adjusting? Uni isn’t a magical place, you make your own reality there.  😊"

8109,I work full time construction. Over an hour away from where I live. So I’d have to find another job if I’m also going to school for time. Just sucks
8110,"You're only 20, super young. I went straight from highschool to uni and fucked up big time. Too much partying and skipping classes. Went back last year at 22 years old and doing just fine. 

Honestly, like 30-40% of the people in my classes were 20+ years old. No one really cares (unless your like 50, even then, no one cares) how old you are. Plenty of people take gap years, or save for uni, or find themselves in uni years after finishing hs. 

My parents constantly gave me the speech ""when I was your age I was working full time, married and saving every penny for a house blah blah"". It made me feel like shit but in the end, there's no point in doing something that makes you miserable. Find what your interested in, give it 100%, and don't forget to have some fun ;p"
8111,Thank you for this
8112,"It’s really all about what YOU want to do. I joined the army at 19 and got out 3 and a half years later. Hated it, but it still was the best thing Ive done. However, if you don’t want to join, who cares what others think. Its your life and no one else’s. Im going to be honest myself, i just graduated with my bachelors and im 26. I still don’t even know if I wanna stick to my field. Im interested in it still and always will be but I just don’t know if thats what I wanna do 9-5 for 30 years. Im moving next year and im just going with the flow and see where life takes me. Having a positive mindset really helps. Life tends to figure itself out. Goodluck!"
8113,Do you want advice?
8114,"I finished uni at 23 and I’m even thinking about going back part time for a different degree while I work. It’s NEVER too late to go to uni, you’ve still got atleast 40 years of work ahead of you. You owe it to yourself to take 4 years of that time to ensure that you end up doing something you like. And don’t worry about your parents. You don’t live with your parents anymore, hear their advice but don’t let them dictate your life."
8115,I guess you could say that’s what I’m looking for.
8116,"I know they’re your family, and you don’t want to disappoint them, but ultimately you have to live your life they way you want to live it. It’s not their life. If you want to go to school, do it. Or you can get in the military and use them to pay for your school."
8117,"I just want to say it's definitely never too late to have the college experience. At my university it was extremely common for people in their late 20s to early 40s to be students. I joined a fraternity at age 19, and a few guys in my pledge class were already in their 30s. At least where I went, no one would give second thought to a 20 year old freshman/sophomore.

As for your concerns about your family being disappointed in not following the military route, all I have to say is I hope if they truly care for you they would see that you're doing something you want to do and are happy doing it. If they can't support that, then their support isn't something you should be seeking. You gotta do what you want to do, and what will make you happy. It's your life to live, no one else's.

I wish you the best of luck!"
8118,"Go at your own pace. If you want to switch directions in life do it by any means, its never too late."
8119,"You should never feel too old to pursue something you’re interested in or passionate about, ESPECIALLY when it comes to learning something new or seeking higher education. If you go through life thinking you’re too old to do something, you’ll miss a million opportunities. 

Sometimes I wish I would have had a few more life experiences (years) under my belt before I went to university. I was always extra interested in what my older classmates had to say simply because their experience can bring a totally different perspective to the table. 

In the end, do what makes you happy. I hope your family can learn to love and support you no matter what you choose! Good luck."
8120,Dude look up David Goggins. The dude had to lose something like 200lbs TWICE and became a navy seal. He’s the inspiration it sounds like you need right now. Never give up. Stay hard.
8121,I’m also in my 20s and am still learning how tricky it can be to navigate life. It’s nice to lean on other people and know that everyone has been there before!
8122,"how do you even figure out your 'passion/life mission', seriously asking bc i feel like life is objectively empty and meaningless, and i have no place in the world or anything that would interest me."
8123,Thank you so much for the kind words. I’m grateful for every single one of you. I’ve never gotten so much support before.
8124,"Meaning for one person will not be meaning for another, so there is no objective ""purpose"" or ""meaning"" to it all, but for you you can go out, try some things, and figure out what end goal you have a passion for. Developing a skill at something, helping people out, becoming a certain kind of person, it's all good. I would say though if you've not found it in your normal routine yet, you probably won't find it in your normal routine. Go try something new till you find it I say"
8125,"Thank you, what was your MOS if you don’t mind me asking? I’m wanting to go in as an MP but also don’t want to sit at a gate for 4 years"
8126,"I graduated this past may at 27. Started college at 24. Going back was the best decision I ever made. If you believe going back is the right move for you, do it. Screw what anyone else thinks. They'll be disappointed in you for not sticking with the military route? Who cares? It's YOUR life. Live it for yourself."
8127,"Who gives a shit what your parents or family thinks about you and your life choices (as long as you’re not doing anything very clearly wrong)?

My mom wants me to go to college and make a shit ton of money being an aircraft mechanic or engineer or some shit but I want to become a US Marine and serve my country. Guess which path I’m choosing? 

Ultimately, it’s your life. Whether you go the military route or the uni route, it’s you who is the master of your life and your path."
8128,yeah but it may cost a lot of money
8129,Oh right. I’m not American so I forgot :(
8130,"tbh im not american either but life is like that, everything costs a lot and youll always need money so you cant just stop life and go back to school or try everything youre interested in.

im also getting paranoid about how im behind at saving up for retirement or a home or whatever because i wanna go back to school and ill be old by the time i graduate."
8131,"I have 2 uninterrupted blocks of work for 2-4h (depending on what I can mentally handle for the day, some days I'm more ambitious than others), and if I get ahead of myself one day then I can slack off more the next day. The stuff I do in between is organize files on my computer or optimize my workflow, get coffee and talk with coworkers, take an hour long break, move my car to a closer parking spot around 3pm, or go for a walk. 

Does anyone actually work the whole 8h? Don't drink the kool-aid."
8132,"Nobody actually works 8 hours every day. I sit at my desk for 30 minutes going through my emails and working up the drive to actually get stuff done. I’ll work for an hour, maybe two, then get up and go for a 10-15 minute walk or sit on the toilet and play on my phone for a bit. Grab a coffee, sit back down and work a bit more. Chat with coworkers, take another shit, take another walk. Look busy.

That’s really all it is. I dont think anyone actually focuses and works for 8 hours every day"
8133,"Go for walks during your breaks. And consider therapy for the anxiety, your company may have an employee assistance program that can include free confidential therapy services."
8134,"The 9-5 office job life kind of sucks, but you get used to it over time. I mean, college student life also sucks, just in completely different ways. Your schedule is more flexible, but many college students are putting in far more than 40 hours/week of work, and that often extends into nights and weekends. And in college, you have the added stress of grades without the de-stresser of actually earning a wage/salary for all the effort you put into your work.

I’m currently a third-year law student. I hated my first job after undergrad, because it was such a shift from what my life had been before. But after three years of law school . . . let’s just say I really miss only having to work ~50 hours/week and not having to constantly worry about grades. I’m now really looking forward to graduation and non-student life—something that would be a huge shock to me just three or four years ago."
8135,"Get prepared to leave for work for 30 minutes. It’s 97 degrees. Wear smoldering hot clothing and get in your 105 degree car. Sweat for 10 minutes as you drive 45 minutes to work. Arrive at work and walk 10 minutes to your desk. Sit in your sweat for 6 minutes as you cool off.

Repeat for lunch. Yes you will be driving somewhere for lunch even occasionally. 

You get to do that all that for free. 

Repeat upon workday end. Congrats, your 9 hour day is now an 11 hour day. 

Add and replace “preheat car, shovel snow, and 1.5x commute time for winter.” Don’t forget to add gas, food, and clothing costs. 

Oh… were we talking about work? I didn’t get that far."
8136,Straight up.
8137,It's horrible. Every day I was dying inside a little more. Everyone being sent home for covid WFH is the best thing that ever happened honestly.
8138,Are office jobs even that bad? I hear this kind of negative about it all the time but I don't know if it's really true about sucking your soul.
8139,Getting absorbed in something you enjoy and doing something you're forced to do for survival are two completely different things.
8140,Audiobooks are the only thing that keep me sane most days. They make the grind substantially less bad for me when the books are good.
8141,You could mostly dick around whenever possible. I did a part time internship that was an office job and I spent a lot of time fiddling my thumbs and drawing and drinking coffee. I got my shit done but I also dicked around.
8142,I think everyone thinks this way until they get the soul sucking 9-5
8143,I know every office job is different but is it like studying except for longer?
8144,"Runescape, hiding in the toilet, online shopping."
8145,"The cold hard reality of life, is that you are gonna have to pay for it at some stage. Hunger and homelessness are pretty good reasons to ""suck it up princess"""
8146,I just want to say I am in the exact same space as you. I literally am unable to cope with having complete autonomy over my time and schedule for the past 8 years in school (flexible arrangements)  to being forced to sit in an office cube for eight hours when 100% of my work can be done remotely. I have frequent breakdowns at my desk bc of this sudden shift to lack of autonomy. I don’t have any advice to offer. I don’t know how these older generations are okay with this especially with advancements in overall productivity through tech and remote collaboration.  I hope we can somehow be the change in this archaic system.
8147,We don’t put up with it. We don’t believe it’s healthy and that you can find better more fulfilling alternatives that ironically pay better.
8148,8-5* ugh
8149,Do you not stress about deadlines in this case?
8150,Is it really as bad as people make it out to be? I always hear about it sucking your soul and sitting for too long.
8151,Most 9-5 office jobs make decent money to boot
8152,I listen to podcasts and take walks. Have thought about leaving? Stick it out until you get something else
8153,It's the reason I gamble in crypto. I don't really see another way out of this hell.
8154,"music, podcasts"
8155,I started remote work beginning of covid and will.never go back.
8156,How do you do this? I would think getting into a highly specialized field and providing consulting services may be one
8157,The same way some play video games for 8 hours a day and 16/day on the weekends.
8158,"Nah people are just big babies 

I remembered the days I craved for a typical 9-5 office job

Office crappyness basically comes down to where you work and how they manage their employee’s"
8159,I would highly recommend getting your resume reviewed by a contact that is working in a position you are applying for. If this isnt possible id look into a professional resource. I thought I had a perfect resume when i was getting rejections. After a meeting and some edits I got the first job I applied for.
8160,"Got broken up with three weeks ago, wouldn't say that really helps me feel any better lmao"
8161,"Your self-worth is not based on a job! In the USA especially we get this drilled into us all the time that people are more worthy or special based on what they do. It's a complete lie that you have to unlearn. 

Don't internalize rejection especially when you are early in your career, just adjust your approach. Remember, they are not rejecting you as a person so don't take it too hard. 

Chin up!"
8162,"That isn't a particularly healthy way to go about things. No one spamming 500+ resumes and applications is going to have much luck. Tailor your resumes and applications for the position you're going for. The keywords are often in the postings. If the description says it involves leadership, then figure out something related you've done and use the word leadership in your paperwork. Same with everything else in the description. If it says you will be using Microsoft products, then tell them about all your experience in school using Microsoft. You have to beat their HR filter and no generic spammy resume is going to do it. You can do this. Just keep working on how you sell yourself."
8163,"Yeah that's fair, but IDK I feel like I am reading the requirements for each job and ensuring that my resume meets those standards."
8164,Try asking your crush out. You’ll stop thinking about the job rejection.
8165,"Well, it could. It depends how unique it is the field you are going to and how familiar the specialist is with said field. However, getting four rejections in one day leads me to think you arent getting past the AI that filters resumes before they even reach an actual person. 

Idk what industry youre going into but when in doubt include a ton of metrics and numbers. And make sure to include the obvious buzzwords."
8166,"Job hunting really sucks, I sympathize. It took me nearly a year after graduation to land a job, although admittedly I didn't have an internship. That was the first offer I got and luckily it was a good one. I only ever received one other offer after starting work, and it was for less money in a more expensive city.

Hang in there. Even though it feels like it, it won't be like this forever."
8167,[deleted]
8168,"I got my resume reviewed by a specialist at my college before I graduated, does that count?"
8169,"If you have someone close who does hiring or has been in the workforce for a while, maybe have them take a look the next time you turn something in. Outside eyes can usually spot problems we miss."
8170,"I’ll never forget getting rejected for a “dream” job TWO HOURS before I went in to take my FE exam. But in hindsight, I am so happy that I didn’t get it considering the opportunities I’ve had in the three years since graduating at my current job. Keep your head up!!"
8171,Oh I'm sorry to hear that I just have ended my two months of job searching I graduated last May 2021 and I didn't start really looking for a job until December .... The anxiety and pressure was killing me Plus I didn't even know what I wanted to do.... but somethings finally came through. It's going to get better just keep trying to something will work out for you. One thing I realized is to not ponder over what could've been too much it just causes more stress at the end of the day. Just got to keep pushing it is hard but som will come through for u
8172,"I appreciate the story, hopefully the same happens to me."
8173,"I'll try that, thanks."
8174,I would recommend informational interviewing and networking - it’s the only way I’ve gotten jobs and it’s mostly the only way we hire
8175,"Don’t worry, i apples to 50+ different degree apprenticeship’s. 50+ no responses, 4 rejects, 3 interviews and 1 offer"
8176,as a fellow job hunter nearly two years after the pandemic began—hang in there. I know how much it hurts.
8177,"I was like you in the same situation for nearly about two years.After two years of procrastination, No job and feeling like shit, I decided to take a huge step in life.
First thing I did I had to go back to university to study my MBA, learn new skills that's is Coding, MMA, Graphics and motion designing,Forex trading,  photography. And right now am pursuing my MPA. In my country, getting a job is all about Education background. 
Since I'm into coding and forex trading, even though it pays me little money since am just starting, it's worth it. Sometimes you gotta get out of the comfort zone and Make your own reality."
8178,See you ordered it wrong. Get dumped after the job rejection and you forget about the rejection. Get dumped before and it compounds
8179,"1.) I've been trying to get part time jobs around my hometown but I'm having absolutely no luck. I am on unemployment and have been saving most of the money but I was planning to use it to attack my loans before the 0% interest kicks in. My fear with getting a part time job is also the fact that I am making more on unemployment compared to the jobs I am applying for, and that is turning me off currently. Still applying, nonetheless.

2.) I've been focused on writing and getting my first short documentary out there. I just posted it publicly on YouTube and a few Facebook groups have been very supportive of the project. As for building on my social media brand, I've tried making a few YouTube videos but... Admittedly... They were cringe. Additionally, I really need to upgrade my gear but I'm looking at close to 7K if I wanted to go seriously (Which I am considering)

3.) Trying my best. I am usually self-deprecating and negative towards myself and I haven't been very kind to myself during the start of the pandemic. It's something I struggle with and wished I wasn't like."
8180,"Have you thought about making a personal YouTube channel? with your filmmaking skills, maybe you can grow a channel or even apply for jobs as a camera man for other channels."
8181,"Thank you for the link. I'll check it out! I'm totally cool with being a freelance editor. I've tried offering my services (For free, during college) to some local businesses but they weren't onboard. I might offer it again and then start charging, once I get clients. I've been working on my YouTube channel but most of the stuff I've created during the pandemic is... Cringe... I've also tried TikTok at one point and found that I was gaining and audience but I was severely unhappy with what I was making and... I'm really not hip with a lot of the trends haha. I think what's frustrating me is how the stuff I really want to make has been kinda lagging and people in the industry keep telling me that I am great with certain skills but nothing comes out of it."
8182,[deleted]
8183,Yes the having shit to do part. I miss the business and multifaceted parts of college. Now it’s just my shitty job for 40 hours and that’s it
8184,"As someone in the same field (roughly speaking,) my best piece of advice is to try to create jobs instead of finding them. That can mean doing your own stuff, but it can also mean cold-emailing people and asking if they’d be willing to take on an intern or something like that. I got my current job by asking a YouTuber I liked if he’d be interested in an intern — he realized that he would, and after my internship I started writing for him full time. Whenever film production companies put out applications for a job, they’re gonna get hundreds of applicants; even with a great resume, those are tough numbers to beat. Try to find a space where no one else is competing with you."
8185,"My end goal for filmmaking is becoming a screenwriter and telling the stories I want to tell. Because of the connections at my school, I've been able to speak with screenwriters in my field and they all say that my stories, and resume, are impressive for a recent college grad. For my work in the industry, I'm probably gonna have to start at the bottom. I've been on professional film sets in my area but it was during my undergrad years so it's been a while. I just want to get back into working in the industry.

Outside of that though, I would really like to knock my student debt out as fast as possible, feel happy in general, and get out of my hometown and even my state. I know those are kinda vague but they are the stressors in my life and I know I've been neglecting to help myself."
8186,Gah I wish I was close to you lol I would make films too. I was going to film School but I switched to graphic design and now I'm a year left of it and kinda depressed too because of c-19. Miss the solo trip and all of that. I'm in parents house too
8187,"I don't have any great advice because I'm kind of in the same boat as you but younger and not nearly as put together (graduated with a film studies BA in December and haven't made any kind of film or video since last spring tbh , have a postgrad gig not at all related to production but am tentatively optimistic about a future in film academia ? lmaoo the future is wild). But I agree with what others are saying: don't rush things and don't feel inadequate because you haven't hit your stride yet. Film is obviously an incredibly difficult field to get into without the right connections a bunch of schmoozing. Tbh im so impressed that you've managed to apply to places so diligently!!!! I gave up after a few days.

However! If you have an idea for a story, write it, workshop it, film it, get it out there on Vimeo or something. Just keep creating. Be a freelance editor or designer or other personell in the meantime. Go have life experiences and write them down and eventually you could find inspiration for your masterpiece. What's your voice, what's your perspective, what's your message? Judging from your post you don't seem like someone interested in making the next MCU blockbuster or even a Wes Anderson popcorn indie flick. You seem to want to do something out of the box and unique (hope I am not out of line saying this). While industry support is certainly nice, it can also be constrictive. Maybe now is the time to continue cultivating your creativity and perspective without worrying about large-scale releases. 

This all being said, I am genuinely sorry you're feeling this way and things have been and are rough for you. The pandemic has certainly screwed over the entertainment world but I also wonder if it would be any easier in a time when things were ""normal"". I wish I had better advice than ""self-cultivation ! "" But that's where I am too. Just be kind to yourself. Keep creating, keep growing your perspective, and maybe, one day, you can make something truly special. Even if it doesn't reach the screens of thousands. To be very very honest, we can't all be Sean Bakers or Chloe Zhaos. But we can try. 

Just please remember your stories are worth putting into the world. Don't let the industry snobs and pencil pushers get you down.

I hope that helped! And you know, if you never need any help with a script or shoot, hmu, idk how much help I'll be but I'll be free til August lol

Wishing you the best!!"
8188,"You're probably tired of hearing this but I think it's just the nature of your degree and area of interest. Even with an impressive resume, Covid is still a huge factor. 

I had a set design job on a film set lined up for this spring. But I was also told later on that they only want the essential people on set, and even those people need to be Covid tested every single day. 

Hoping that when Covid gets less intense, these jobs start opening up, good luck!"
8189,"I have one and posted my first short documentary online. It got some great reception on different Facebook groups and that felt pretty cool. The other stuff I tried making during the pandemic wasn't great. It comes down to needing a serious gear update and actors cause I can't act for shit... 

That said, the short documentary did well cause I interviewed a 90s punk musician. That was back in 2019 and it just finished up on a film festival run. Since then, I interviewed another 90s musician for my friend's site and it made me realize that it was a cool avenue to get into. I've been trying to reach out to other subject, with not so much luck, but I'm gonna keep at it and see if I can make more shorts for musicians I admire."
8190,I honestly wasn't a fan of the college experience but I really miss the structure that I didn't realize existed until now haha.
8191,"No one wants to hire someone in a different state, unless you *really* fit the bill. I doubt that’ll be the case and you shouldn’t shoot for that long shot. 

What does completely independently actually mean? you will eventually have to incorporate other people again. your small interaction with the smallest fraction of the human population means absolutely nothing and you shouldn’t let that bring down your potential. 

Use your contacts from doing cool shit to start something up right now."
8192,make your resume into a comedic film and pass it around!! that’ll definitely get you more hits. you could showcase your previous work into the video. A piece of paper won’t tell hiring managers much about your skills but seeing it with their own eyes will . It’s like software developers creating their own website to showcase and highlight their work.
8193,Have you been working on any projects during this time?
8194,"Thank you for the kind words!

I want to keep creating but what's bogging me down is just kinda being stagnant every time I've created something during the pandemic. It might be the result of sudden laziness or a general burnout that's been lingering. I essentially want results now for this projects haha.

A lot of the stuff I've been writing has some sort of personal connection to my hometown and the issues that plague it. They deal with poverty and addiction but they also are written to be exciting and tense. The one feature script that is currently on a festival run has had decent success at these festivals and I am hoping for some sort of advancement from bigger named festivals later in the year. The stuff I've been writing now would probably need a bigger budget but the first two scripts that I have ready now are low budget. I have written some short films that I want to make soon and can be shot with a micro budget but having the people that I used to make films with backstab me the way they did made me realize that I'm gonna have to do a lot of it on my own. I am capable of doing that but having some help and guidance along the way would be nice. I might hold off on shooting those films and perfect the daylights out of what I've written. I might make it next year as a result.

The big issue with myself is knowing that I'm not kind towards myself and it's something I need to work on.

Wishing you the best as well!"
8195,No. Mostly just assignments. I'm preparing my internship next year but I'm pretty anxious about it.
8196,"It's completely normal. Everyone will go through this in their head at one point after college. Keep in mind a lot of graduates don’t even work in the field/industry that they got a degree in. This is just the reality of how colleges are structured. They teach you a broad scope of information in a certain area like marketing, or engineering. Then you’ll have a general knowledge that allows you to potentially fit into certain roles that companies are looking for.

My career is in aviation as an engineer and when I first got out of college with my degree I was so lost and discouraged. My head was spinning and I felt like I would never be able to grasp the concepts, and a lot of it was not taught to me in school which was also frustrating. 

Some advice and things that have helped me:

1. In the beginning I never wanted to ask questions or ask for help because I was afraid of looking stupid, until one day I decided I wouldn't be this way anymore. If I didn't understand something I stopped pretending like I did and I began speaking up, and if I if there was a problem I was struggling with I would ask for guidance. I began to improve exponentially.
2. You need to put in the time. In the beginning just like learning anything new, there's going to be a learning curve. The more time you put in the better you will get in a shorter time. You also make mistakes. Take them as learning points and try not to repeat them.
3. Understand that everyone was brand new at one point. You've already said your boss is happy with your progress, so you're clearly doing something right. When you're new to a job or entry level position they know there's a learning curve because everyone's been there before. Keep that in the back of your head and it'll likely relieve some of the stress."
8197,"Yes, [Imposter Syndrome](https://time.com/5312483/how-to-deal-with-impostor-syndrome/) is totally normal.  Many people continue to feel it throughout their entire careers, from Junior Accountant all the way up to CFO.  You constantly feel like you're advancing to new territory you don't deserve because you are aware of exactly how much you do not know.  

I personally see this psychological phenomenon as going hand in hand with the frequently cited [Dunning-Kruger Effect,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20psychology,recognize%20their%20lack%20of%20ability.) which, in short, states that people with *low* ability at a task *over*estimate their ability, while people with *high* ability at a task do the opposite.  

This again tends to be because people of high ability are smart enough to be able to identify true mastery and expertise.  You see that you're a hired professional at a job, where you're expected to be an ""expert.""  But you're all too aware of all the things you still *don't* know and how far away you actually are from being a true master at your craft.  This leaves you feeling inadequate at your job.  

Here's the thing: 99.9% of jobs don't require you to be the world's foremost expert in your field to ""do a good job.""  Mentally, give yourself a bit of a break and don't compare yourself to the best of the best.  Don't focus solely on what you don't know (yet), but look back on just how many things you've learned over the past year and a half.  You'll almost certainly see a huge improvement, just as your supervisor does."
8198,Thank you. I appreciate this
8199,"Don't worry about it. Completely normal, I went through the same thing, I'm a year and 4 months as well.



One thing that helped me is this thought: ""Just because you're edumacated, it doesn't mean you know everything.""



I absolutely struggled with my self image, because before I was a broke college student unloading trucks, and was essentially a peon to those above me. Not having a valued input messed with my self worth.



I've learned that just because I didn't work a fancy internship, or go to a top notch school, I bring value to my team. People are excited to help, just like your position. 



Just remember you're learning something totally new, that is probably out of your routine, because you got used to the school routine. Keep going, keep your head up, you are 110% worthy of your position, that's why they hired you."
8200,Hell after being in my industry for around 8 years I still feel a sort of inadequate from time to time. But honestly it will all make more sense the more you work at it. Just keep trucking on and take criticism. You will start to see a change pretty quickly.
8201,"I think you've answered your own question multiple times. It sounds like you're doing fine, please be patient with yourself."
8202,I’m starting to be like that too. I was so afraid to ask questions and now here I am. Stuck. So I’m asking a lot and people are helping. It definitely will take time and I have to put time in. Thank you
8203,[removed]
8204,Yea I feel mentally blocked really. Something I need to work on getting past. Thank you!
8205,A change of environment could help. If you can cities or even houses that could help re-wire your habits and maybe get some drive back
8206,"Yea, I'm just trying to find something to fit my lifestyle. I live with my partner and he works the Monday-Friday job while my schedule is all over the place so it's been hard for us to do anything. The pay isn't the best for where I live either, I mean my bills are paid, but that's about it. I like the idea of what you said, you like working on cars, but don't want to be in the car industry so you work on your car when you can while others too. I feel like side hustles are what a lot of people are doing nowadays with certain things they don't want has a career. I was an intern in the marketing department and it made me realize that I didn't want to be in the field. I don't excited by data or numbers. You have the right mindset and I hope you find what you're looking for in a career. Thanks so much for replying!"
8207,My partner just told me that I need to go on a adventure by myself. I think that might be the best thing for me. Maybe some time with just myself will clear things up. Thanks!
8208,"My advice on adventures is to consciously seek out culture shock. Find something or somewhere weird and unfamiliar and then set out to become knowledgeable about the merits. 

Also, travelling solo is a brutal reality check on your own capabilities. Practicing some basic self reliance and independent problem solving skills has helped me become a better person in a variety of ways."
8209,"Idk how to really help you, it seems like a lot of this stems from laziness. That’s something us reddit strangers can’t fix. That said, I’m sure you can find something at least tolerable with the skills you have. Good luck!"
8210,"No problem happy to help, we are all struggling in this game of life. Wish you the best in finding a better suited career moving foward. Yes side hustling do seem like the way to go."
8211,Never thought of it that way. That actually would be great. I’m going to look into that. Even if I have to start with somewhere in my state that I’ve never been. It’s a start and it’ll push me to want to go further. Thank you!
8212,"That’s awesome. I don’t believe my job is hard. It’s not what I want to do, I know that.  That’s why I’m on here because I’m just confused and lost about what it is I want to do so I’m reaching out for advice."
8213,The chances of you even making the equivalent of what you earn at Whole Foods via YouTube is basically zero
8214,"Yea, it’s like I want to do it, but I just don’t. I agree, maybe talking with a career coach will help me go down the right path. Thanks, I’ll look into that."
8215,"And for how much I work and the environment there, I don’t get paid that good either. But so do most people. It’s a shit system, but we have to do it in order to live."
8216,"I wouldn’t stop working if I did YouTube. Plenty of people do it and get paid pretty good actually. I didn’t say I wanted it as a career. It’s just something I like so I thought of doing it. Maybe I could make a career out of it, maybe not."
8217,Why are even on here if you don’t have actual advice to give? I was just simply saying that I like it and thought of trying it out. That’s all.
8218,"I get paid pretty well for my job, not that hard for me."
8219,Try acid
8220,Lol yeah go do youtube then. You need like 10k views a day to make like $20 a day from it. Knock yourself out
8221,"Hmm depends on your experience. For new grads, the strategy might be to make direct contact with recruiters or to apply to the listings that are hiring aggressively. Hopefully you find something that works out!"
8222,This is crazy nobody is hiring in my city holy shit
8223,Nice list gathering. Just remember to always go through someone in your network if you can. Especially now that there are fewer openings and wayyyy more applicants
8224,Also: [https://wfh.page/issues/remote-jobs-by-wfh-issue-1-247613](https://wfh.page/issues/remote-jobs-by-wfh-issue-1-247613)
8225,"Give it 10 years. I’m in my mid 20s. I don’t currently even have a girlfriend.

I have a vague plan of:

* Put 3-4 years of grinding into my career, get to where I want to be where I’ll be financially stable and comfortable to take my foot off the gas a little
* At some point in those 3-4 years find a girl who I want to spend the rest of my life with
* ~6-8 years get married, buy a house
* 9-10 years start a family

This is all pretty nebulous though. A lot could change. There’s things even within the next year that could shift my path and my timeline one way or another. I might meet the girl of my dreams tomorrow. Who knows.

But yes ultimately I want to get married and have kids."
8226,"I'm 26 and my life is a shit show, I dont want to bring a kid into it. If I know I found my true love and if I trust her enough (i have trust issues) then i would consider having a kid at 30+ but I honestly doubt I'll ever have a family which sucks because my mom has always wanted grand kids"
8227,That is a very responsible opinion I wish more people I went to high school with had lol. I know too many people who started having kids right outta school with no real job or education and now their parents are basically responsible.
8228,Not me I’m still living with mom and starting career but I live in south and most everyone I Facebook search are married with kids
8229,"My boyfriend and I are in our early 30s and make a combined $60K/year. Having a child would financially ruin us.

Neither of us have family to fall back on for financial support or child care, which is a nice safety net for others with these resources.

We just have whatever we make ourselves. There is no working hard to achieve the American dream anymore."
8230,"My husband and I met in college 10 years ago. 3 years into my degree, I had to take my nephew in as mine. 
My husband was having trouble with school. He suffered from depression and decided to drop out for a while until he got better. I was struggling with enjoying my major. I'm a first generation hispanic college student. No one in my family ever even thought about going to college. Holy shit the learning curve is huge for people like us. I had to teach myself everything. And I knew that I wasn't ever going to enjoy working with the major I chose. So when my nephew came into my life permanently, we decided we would back home and raise him. 

After a year of doing that, I went back to school. I realized that maybe nursing would be the right path for me. I worked on my prereqs and got admitted! Yay! Then I found out I was pregnant! No! Haha I was 25 by then and my husband and I thought ""why not!"" Lol so we had our beautiful baby. And I went back to nursing school. Almost done now.


My advice: it's fucking hard but if it's something you want you can make it happen. We have a GREAT AMAZING support system we can rely on for childcare. But my husband has to work two jobs while I finish school. Then once I'm done, the plan is we live super cheap like we have been so he can finish school. My daughter will be 5 and just starting school when we're both done with our degrees. My son (nephew) will be starting high school. So my advice is if you know you want kids, then just know it's possible to have them but be prepared. I breastfed so my daughter wasn't super expensive the first year of life. We didn't buy her nice new clothes because they grow out of it SO FAST. The biggest cost is definitely health insurance. You want to make sure that whatever job you get offers great health insurance because once you have that bundle of joy, you want to have the best possible care for them. (And you can vote for Bernie for M4A and student loan forgiveness and countless of other proposals he has in place to help people like us! Haha 😉)


Being a parent is life changing. Even just being my nephew's parent was life changing for us. In a great, beautiful way. It is HARD. But we are such a happy little family. And I love it. But I'm aware that we are lucky to be healthy and have no serious problems in our life that keep us from thriving. And if we could do it differently, we would. We'd be financially stable first."
8231,"Lol yeah, do us all a favour and don't produce. What a load of utter nonsense I'm just after reading."
8232,Nothing is guaranteed/secure especially in 3-5 years man
8233,"My wife and I (both 24F) are planning on having kids in 3-5 years, but she’s currently in medical school - if we didn’t have the security of knowing she will definitely have a decent salary during that time, we probably wouldn’t be so sure about it. We’re also the only people our age we know who want kids anywhere near that timeframe besides one couple but one of them is also in med school and they’re a few years older than us."
8234,"I definitely do, but I’m terrified of being a parent. I don’t think I’m that maternal, and I worry about being able to strike a balance between family and career. Also, while I imagined I’d have three kids one day, I can’t imagine being able to afford college for three kids. I can barely imagine affording college for one."
8235,"Yeah... I don't want kids until I'm AT LEAST past my 30yo life mark. And even then, I am hoping I'm financially stable to at least buy a house. I'm just about to turn 25, and I have friends around the same age who already have one or more child. I thought I was struggling... If it weren't for their parents, all of these same friends would be a train-wreck. For most, parents are still a financial cushion into our adult years."
8236,"Yep. I'm right here with you man... Still living at home, hoping to get my state certification for my job at 28 in couple of years(hopefully even sooner), but for now I'm living off of less than 20/hr. It's not sustainable income for where I live. Cost of living ain't cheap at all, and to mix kids into the equation... I don't know how some of my friends are doing it."
8237,"I do. In fact I wanted kids by the time I got to my current age, at least my first. But dropping out, a myriad of health issues, and currently still living at home with no job has forced me to change my plans. 

Now I only wish I had a new plan."
8238,""" We make 20% less than boomers, 1 in 4 of us live at home, and life is becoming more expensive while wages aren't rising when accounting for inflation.""

Exactly this!! To top it all off, so many students are coming out of Uni/college in tuition debt, as school costs have increased from way back when boomers were in school. Half of my friends are even applying for post-grad schooling, which may mean paying even more tuition.

But you have to pay off the debt, and depending on the industry, many will say it's hard to find a job that pays AT LEAST 50k/year right after graduation.

So you could be stuck living at home for years, to save costs, and pay off the debt, before you can start saving for a house/apartment/condo. None of my friends are thinking of children rn"
8239,"The point is that something can't consent without knowing what consent is. I'm no antinatalist, but definitely agree that life isn't something anyone ""consents"" to, it happens TO you. Personally, what happens beyond that first moment of existence seems to be half chance and half you picking forks in a road with no real certainty. 

Not looking to pick a side, but just trying to clarify. Downvote if you must."
8240,"I want kids, real bad, but I want my own autonomies first. I hope in 10 years after establishing my career and traveling I can afford to."
8241,People shouldn't be down voting you for saying this.
8242,"Nice plan! I got a certification this past year in a CAD program and although it didn’t result in a raise at my current job, I’m much quicker in what I do so can go home on time. Planning to do some other certifications when I finish my masters to help widen my skillset. 

Yeah if we can’t afford to live on our own with a fairly decent wage, why would anyone consider having children? Doesn’t make sense."
8243,"I don't understand that scenario myself either. Take care of yourself before you begin to worry about others or anything else.

And good job on going for the certs, once you get your masters. A degree is always favored, but we can’t all afford to achieve them in these tough times. Certs and degrees both will always hold value in my opinion, no matter what anyone has to say. Extremely recognized no matter where you go in life."
8244,"I’m 22, about to finish my first year of grad school and know 100% I want to have kids. Starting a family is something I have always known that I wanted...so there’s no question for me. I’d like to have my first one maybe around 28-29...my boyfriend and I were just talking about it last night. He’s ~6 years older than me so he’s in a place where within the next few years, he’d like to get engaged/married. I may be younger than him, but it’s something I definitely would like too. We are enjoying our time together now but definitely know marriage/babies are in our plans for the future."
8245,"My fiance and I are planning on having kids at 25-26 ish after my fiance finishes his doctorate and gets a job as a high school teacher, which is a pretty good job in France with good stable pay and benefits. We’re both pretty traditional and have always wanted to build a family of our own. We do have no student loan debt though since most universities in France are free, so our circumstances may differ compared to our US counterparts."
8246,"Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans - John Lennon

I could go either way, I am not intimated at the thought of having kids or dating/marrying a woman who already has them. 

I can tell you I have spent the last few years saving, buying a house and new car while being alone. If I teamed up with the right woman, one who did her own thing and had a good career of her own I think we could pull it off. But it's not a deal breaker for me one way or the other."
8247,"With the ever increasing COL and national student debt problem, I am having a hard time following a financial logic on why Millennials would even want children."
8248,Correct
8249,"I mean... even doctors with shitty jobs have decent salaries. Unless something suddenly goes terribly wrong between now and then, it is basically a guarantee. And why would I plan for a worst case scenario anyway?? Obviously if something went outside of the plan, our goals would adjust. I’m just answering OP’s question."
8250,"Yeah. Except you also need plenty of work experience in addition to the certification and degrees. And in my case, a good portfolio as well to showcase past design projects that were actually manufactured. 

They look at your education and certification for a split second, then want to know where you’ve worked and what you’ve learned in the industry because school doesn’t teach you any of it. 

Basically we need to have it all. And get paid the same. Makes me pissed off most days, but that’s how it is and life isn’t fair."
8251,"I’m 21 and currently don’t even have a girlfriend for kids to be something to consider. But I eventually do plan on it, but planning and something happening I guess are two very different things.

Hopefully."
8252,I would love to have kids if only I could raise them without financial concerns.
8253,"I know kids are expensive and all that, I just did not want them because I don't want the crushing responsibility and having my freedom and friends taken away. Besides I don't like kids. I know I'd love my own, but imo if there is *any* reason as to why you'd consider not having kids, you probably shouldn't or aren't ready. Raising children is difficult and requires sacrifice, and although I know I am capable of doing it, some parts of me doesn't want to and that's reason enough. A child doesn't deserve a parent who isn't 100% dedicated to them."
8254,"Got married just over a year ago at 26, been trying for kids since we got married but it's just not happening for some reason. My wife still has another year of grad school so on some level we know the timing is bad and aren't too worried about it. Gonna start talking to doctors soon to see if anything is wrong."
8255,"Hey take it easy!! If you’re working for and with good people they’ll understand it’s your first day and they won’t expect a whole lot from you. Try not to stress. Show up on your first day, eager to learn and get to know everyone and you’ll probably be just fine!"
8256,"My therapist likes to tell me that people who are unwilling to let go of first impressions are not people you want to be around. I don’t think you’re going to say anything too horrible that’ll poison their opinion of you forever. 

Seriously though, it’s the first day on the job. They know you’ll be nervous. It’ll probably just be an orientation day. You’re going to rock it."
8257,[deleted]
8258,"This is normal. Go distract yourself, meditate, practice deep breathing, 
Also, take the pressure off yourself. Everyone messes up. Your patients will know whether you are trying your best and getting things wrong vs not caring (except those decomprnsating, but that’s another issue). You have all those nice coworkers who will be eager to help you make it. They will help you. Just ask. If you find yourself feeling like you are doing a job you have no business doing that’s imposter syndrome. Something I’m sure you have heard of. It’s normal. Just let it pass. I used to work in the field starting off answering a hotline as a volunteer. Even suicidal people will give you a second chance. Now breathe"
8259,"That’s a good word of advice, I’ll be sure to do that!"
8260,Congratulations!!! You will rock it!!
8261,"Hey, congratulations! 🎊 Honestly, I believe you will be fine. Any new job is scary and it will take some time getting used to. Also, your nerves going crazy is an indicator that you care a lot about this opportunity... and that should show you how determined and passionate you are to succeed. Seems like the people who hired you noticed already ;D"
8262,Be open to all tasks and don’t be afraid to ask questions better to ask then not know. You got this!
8263,This was very nice to hear and made me realize I am worrying for no reason. Thank you!
8264,"I’ve volunteered with a suicide hotline as well. It’s definitely a stressful position the be in, but rewarding at the same time when someone tells you that you helped them. Thank you for the kind words, I appreciate it!"
8265,Thank you so much! I like your way of thinking... it really brought my mind back to the positives😊
8266,"I’ll remember that, thanks! :)"
8267,Thanks for the encouragement :)
8268,Thank you :)
8269,"I will make sure to do that, thank you for your comment :)"
8270,Thank you!! :)
8271,You’ll be fine. I’m glad we both did hotline work. Not many even in the mental health field are cut out for it. It just seemed to fit me and my skill set
8272,"I think you are romanticizing your past. I mean, I am nostalgic about college too. I am in my late 20s and in a very similar position to you.
 
I think that feeling you’re missing is purpose. Maybe college gave you purpose, you were learning and growing and feeling stimulated by new experiences. Now what makes you excited? What do you want to get better at? are there ways you can challenge yourself, or a bucket list of things you’ve always wanted to do? Like you said, you are lucky to be where you are now. Young, no kids, healthy, capable and have spending money. you have so much freedom. what are your dreams? What gets you out of bed in the morning? When was the last time you felt endorphins flowing through your brain? 

For me, i get those feelings when I am working on my art practice.. sometimes I get in the zone and can’t stop and I’m having a lot of fun. Or when I’m hanging out with my friends, or doing something new. 

I get restless too, and when I do I journal or think of more stuff for my bucket list. I have goals for my hobbies, and I write down things I look forward to and what I’m grateful for. 

I think it ok to feel empty sometimes too. I would sit with this feeling. A book that has helped me with purpose and emptiness is ‘Siddhartha’, which I definitely recommend checking out 

Good luck to you"
8273,thank you all of my problems are gone now
8274,You’re life sounds 1000x better than mine. Enjoy it while you can.
8275,"You were living in college the way people are meant to live, in a community, a tribe, where everyone is friends, and being amongst their community/friends at all times. Now people live among strangers basically, except for their one significant other, it’s not natural."
8276,Just commenting to say I’m feeling the same way. Definitely not alone. College was just an environment where I thrived in.
8277,"Sounds like you need a hobby. Work is not a hobby. A relationship is not a hobby.  

Exercise is a good hobby, but sometimes the gym starts to feel monotonous and chore-like. Look into intramural sports or martial arts. Maybe challenge yourself - learn a new skill.

I didn’t feel like college life was that great, but I went through this after the novelty of not having to grind at school anymore wore off. I (34/F) explored new skills I wanted to learn first - sewing, cooking, baking, and painting. That got boring, so I explored exercise - weightlifting, running, climbing, hiking, and jiu jitsu. Jiu jitsu stuck, but sometimes I still get bored. I continued to hike a lot during this time too, and recently got into backpacking. My life is so fulfilling. 

I once felt the same emptiness you’re describing before. The formula that works for me is being physically challenged + existential/philosophical self-exploration, thinking & reading + gratitude for simple things + nature + most importantly - deep, meaningful bonds and connections with people. Not just romantically, either. I used to think you had to spend lots of time getting to know people to really dig deep, but really, being a good, active listener helped me to gain perspective.

Oh and one of the best decisions of my life - getting rid of social media ten years ago. 

Good luck, dude."
8278,"I think the biggest thing missing might be the meaningful relationships part. I had a lot of falling out with some relationships, and a lot that fizzled out. What I’ve been left with is not very much. 

The thing about college was, even though I was shy and unsure about myself, there were plenty around me who wanted to make new friends and bring me in. That was sort of the culture.  I feel as an adult it’s not the same, people form their own circles and stick to them, and they aren’t so open to new people, at least in my experience. Probably due to these factors, when left to my own devices I tend to be less outgoing. Not sure how to fix that since I don’t know where to start."
8279,I really does feel like the way people are supposed to live.  I feel so disconnected now.
8280,"The great thing today is that apps and sites like Wondrium and SkillShare exist (along with Youtube), and with MIT and other colleges offering some online courses for free, higher learning is always within reach. Downside is that you tend to lack the classroom setting, true.

Otherwise I feel the same way. Being an adult is basically just winging it--so long as your bills are paid, you have housing of some kind, and you're able to eat, it's like, ok now what? How do I adult? Hobbies and other activities obviously, but sometimes I'm still waiting to feel like I've achieved 'adult' status."
8281,"To borrow some Camus: life is a canvas and the life we make out of it is what we make. What you say is relatable and the same sentiment I have. To counter both you and myself: this was the best experience we’ve had up to this point in our lives. College was the best, particularly for me because high school was a drag//fucking sucked in comparison. In college I would have laughed a a high school version of myself who believed I’d peaked in highshool. Likewise, shouldn’t I laugh at myself for thinking I peaked in college ? What are those experiences which I haven’t tried yet? Maybe that next phase of novelty and enthusiasm will be having kids. Maybe it’s a new career. Maybe it’s a hobby with a devoted community you can be a part of. Think long term and not towards the past. It’s only possible to live for the future. Fuck, I’d love to be Aquaman and breathe water. That won’t happen. In the same way I should never want to let my worst moments define me, my best moments don’t limit my newfound joy.

- Another depressed college grad"
8282,I’ll look into that book.  Thanks!
8283,Time to grow up
8284,I’m 20 and I still feel this way about high school... trust me you are not alone and the self awareness and wanting to be better helps! Please don’t try to drag yourself down too much thinking about it.
8285,"Man, you’ve not alone. This is what I’ve been feeling recently, and you managed to capture it in the most succinct way.

I’m not sure if this might help alleviate the pain and it looks like you come to this conclusion, but it could be food for thought? My therapist suggested that I should focus on the progress that I made, that I have learned how to be a good friend or socialize, and to find joy in what I have now because of my growth. Realizing and verbalizing my growth helps mitigate the pain at least for me, and hopefully this doesn’t come across as too preachy or something.

Hoping that it stops hurting less for you"
8286,"I think I’m exactly where you say you were right now?  

What are the major things you’d tell yourself back then to remedy the ruining of relationships that were good for you?

What would you do differently?"
8287,I'm in the same boat. It's pretty wild how much we can learn in a few years but be too late to apply it. There's so much more I would have appreciated at college if only I had the perspective I have now.
8288,"This is normal, for those who are capable of growth.
 Your acknowledgement is honestly the first step and you might even be able to repair some of the lose beautiful but broken friendships if you take that accountability to them with an apology. We are all young and stupid at some point. And not all of us were raised the way we need to be. Don't hold that against yourself, instead, make different choice for your future now that you know this"

8290,Omg thank you for this
8291,"I will echo what everyone else has said, and add that frankly, you are not the same person as you were at that time. People grow and change as time passes. You need to forgive the actions of past-you, and learn from their mistakes. 

We are shaped by our life experiences. Regardless of any single decision that I myself have made, I recognize that I think and act differently than the person I was two or three years ago. 

Forgive yourself and move on to being a better version of you. What you’re feeling is normal, and healthy."
8292,No need to call me out like that
8293,"Happiness doesn't come from accomplishments, it comes from your lifestyle"
8294,"Never heard of a masters for graphic design but think long and hard about that avenue, not the most lucrative career and is dominated by the gig economy. Precarious work and highly saturated."
8295,"I could not agree more with this comment.  Does it make economic sense to take on significant debt with a Masters in a field with low barriers to entry?  Will the degree truly position your for success in your field, or are you hesitant to enter the workforce and simply continuing what is familiar - school.  This may be why you are not excited.  

This is a large commitment, both time and money, that may delay your personal and financial goals.  I would want to be 100% certain on my path before committing.  Enter the workforce for a year or two and then decide on a Masters."
8296,An unhappy person graduates university every year.
8297,"I made the mistake of continuing my education after undergrad because I had no direction. Did a one year post-production course (very similar to graphic design) and after a first horrible internship I realized I made a huge mistake. They are severely underpaid and very overworked. 

I did a full 180 and am now a second year plumbing apprentice. The sad irony is I’ve never been this optimistic about my future than I am now, even after all the schooling I had. We’re definitely in this transition period where college/university doesn’t mean anywhere near as much as it did 5-10 years ago. Get a job that allows you to make money to supply meaning to your life, don’t go on a search for some job to give your life meaning... you may be searching your whole life"
8298,"Let me just say that graduation was the biggest existential crisis of my life. And that’s common. And I graduated in 2017, where the world was almost normal. I had a job offer, but after graduating I rejected it for no real reason and then remained unemployed for close to 2 years. Know that this is probably the first time you will have the option to not go to school, and that is a whole new world that might scare you, or encourage you. Maybe part of you wants to dive in instead of going to grad school. Maybe it scares you and you want to feel like an adult but don’t yet. Don’t worry, these feelings are all valid 

I cannot begin to imagine how difficult, frustrating, confusing, etc life must be right now for new grads. Heck, I feel it and I am privileged to be employed and working from home. None of what is going on is in your control, and that’s terrifying. But know that this too shall pass. You will find t"
8299,I disagree. It comes from both.
8300,"I still have this problem and I am 9 years removed from college. I found I am highly attracted to things where I can immediately see the impact (ie mow the lawn, clean, power washing, production goals etc) therefore I never feel accomplished when it came to things in which I didn’t immediately see the result."
8301,"I’m in the same boat, graduated in May but took 5 years to complete my degree. 100% don’t feel any satisfaction or pride from it. I landed a job at where I was interning so it just became time to work."
8302,"""They are severely underpaid and very overworked.""

I honestly wish I realized this before pursuing my major in Radio and Television production degree. I went after that degree, because it was a passion of mine, but shortly after my December 2019 graduation and the start of Covid 19. I realized that, the video production, photography, graphic design, editor, ect positions. Are severely underpaid, overworked, and are more often ruthless and  unfriendly when it comes to helping other peers in the entertainment industry."
8303,I feel the same way. Every time I’m like yeah I have a B.S. in Biology they’re like “ohhh that’s huge congrats!” And I’m just like yeaaah except I have nothing to show for it besides a piece of paper.
8304,"I've felt similarly and I think it's because as we go through the first part of our life we have these conscious and subconscious ideas about what ""life will be like"" after high school, or college, or whatever milestone. And rarely does it ever live up to your expectations. Not that it's worse than you expected, it's just different. And you didn't think about all the boring day to day things that would also be involved in your future life."
8305,"Yeah, I feel this big time. 

I recently graduated with an Accounting degree, and somehow snagged a position with upward mobility in my field 3 months after I graduated during a pandemic and economic turmoil. By all accounts, I did what I should've and am reaping the rewards. My parents are proud of me, as are my friends, hell I even managed to secure some romantic times with someone. But now I'm working fulltime and getting home at 5pm sometimes really exhausted that I'll lay down and just fall asleep until like 11pm, at which point I still need to hit the bed to wake up for work tomorrow.

But I feel kind of sad sometimes because maybe I expected more than this? I don't really know what I expected to be honest. I remember during my senior year that all I could think about was finally finishing college, getting that damn degree and starting my life. Now, I'm knee deep in having to adjust to... well starting my life, and it's not nearly as exciting as dreaming about it was.

However, what really makes me feel good is when I was asked to recommend someone for a fulltime position at my company, and that I know the position will help my friend a lot."
8306,Picking a major and masters like that will lead to way more trouble. Yeah good luck with that
8307,"Yea, really feels like that. “Congrats you got a piece of paper, now go get a life” how I intérprete"

8311,"Well it’s clear to me that *you* think you have done exceedingly well, and tbh that’s all that matters. Your parents are probably never going to change and give your achievements the attention you want. So say ‘screw it’, stop seeking validation from them, and start celebrating your own successes for your sake :)"
8312,I've felt this way before too. Surrounding yourself with the right people is a powerful thing for growth.
8313,I think there is a difference between wanting validation from everyone and wanting some acknowledgement from your parents for something you worked very hard on. It sounds like OP hasn’t really gotten any acknowledgement from them public or private and to me it seems reasonable to be upset by that.
8314,good for u
8315,I’ve been going through a pretty similar situation with my mom after moving back home. I stumbled upon narcissistic personality disorder and it seems like your parents might fall into the same category. Id check it out because it gave a lot of insight on to how I’ve been treated my whole life and kinda validated some of my feelings that I’ve never openly expressed. Hope this helps and would def be down to rant about parents if you need to!!!

8320,Learn to derive satisfaction from within. You don’t need others to validate your effort and achievements.
8321,"I kinda disagree... You shouldn't need validation from everyone when you achieve a personal goal. If you do, you may want to talk to a professional about it.

The social media post you're seeing are unnecessary and kind of cringey. If you really love someone, and you're proud of them, it should be enough to tell that person. You shouldn't need to tell the whole world, and the that person shouldn't need you tell the whole world."
8322,"When I graduated, it took me almost 9 months for my body to become accustomed to working a full 40 hour work week. It is exhausting to go from school - where I was in and out of lectures all day, sometimes having hours/days off on week days - to commuting + working in an office for 8 hours a day. I'm also incredibly introverted, and whereas in university if I wasn't feeling being social, I could stay home and in my room while I worked, working a real job I have to be ""on"" for 8 hours a day while I'm surrounded by coworkers.

Not only that, but my body had to readjust to having a regular sleep schedule after university wreaked havoc on me. For four years I was so used to working late, pulling all nighters, and going out when I wanted because if I stayed up late, I could make up for it by sleeping in or napping during the day. My sleep patterns were FUCKED. I didn't start to feel 'fine' and in a rhythm where I wasn't exhausted all the time until January 2019, and I'd started working full time May 2018.

Give yourself plenty of time to adjust and be patient with yourself. I also recommend doing your best to get in a solid routine of going to bed/waking up at the same time - it really does help."

8326,"Hey man, I also just graduated and got into the 40 hour work days about a year ago. It was definitely rough at first, I felt like I had no time to do anything. What worked for me was getting a solid routine down, working out after work to beat the commute and then planning something out every weekend to look forward to it. I’ll tell ya now tho time goes by quick but you get used to it, the best thing is actually having the money to do the things you want to."

8334,"Hours make a huge difference. I work 7-3:30 with a half hour lunch instead of the full hour (usually take both of my short breaks with the lunch so I just get one big break). Being out that early leaves you with so much time, I feel like the day doesn’t start until after you’re done with work so any hours before work is just dead time imo, unless you’re staying up until like 1am every night then you’re just missing out.

Also it helps a lot what you’re doing for work. For example I’m in CS and I guarantee you most jobs in this field I would probably find not interesting or engaging, but I love where I am now and the work is as engaging as it gets for me, so when I’m done with work I feel like I’ve contributed to something cool, responsible, and overall just good (sort of similar to how you might feel when you walk out of a gym after a good work out) which puts a good spin on the rest of the day.

Obviously though having work is more important than having work you like, but once you nail a job down always be looking for something you could enjoy doing."
8335,I had the same realization too after I graduated. It sucks lol. I'm still trying to find careers that are better for work-life balance cuz that 40 hr/ wk for 40 years ain't for me. It sounds so depressing to me man.

8343,"Man, I graduated like 2 years before you guys, and I personally never seen a video from my grad class up to this level. As a matter a fact, the only thing I can think of near that level is of a girl who graduated in the same class as me, but was so disabled that not many people thought she was going to graduate in 2018, til she did. 

Still, I'm glad you guys graduated last year, hope it was a blast for you guys, mines wasn't all that great personally, but I still had fun here and there."

8350,damn
8351,it is best to learn from your own experiences but keep others experiences in the back of your mind and compare your results to theirs
8352,"They're both valuable.

When you learn from others, you get to see how they do things. If they're an expert they may be able to teach you a lot, and they probably also know the best or most effective ways of accomplishing something. Depending on the task, learning from someone else may be easier and faster than trying to figure it out yourself. 

Seeing what someone else did or didn't do can help you create a better path for yourself, avoid their mistakes, and learn right away what might have taken them a while to figure out. If you have someone around who knows more than you do, you can always ask questions and request advice. 

At the same time, I also think people need to make their own paths, which includes making their own mistakes. Sometimes I don't think people can grasp the gravity of something until they've actually experienced it. Sometimes people are set in their path, even if someone else thinks it's a poor choice, and there's nothing that can be done to convince them otherwise. In these cases I think a person needs to go through it themselves in order to learn, and hopefully they will emerge as a better and more developed person. 

When you learn from your own experience, you can develop new ways or thinking or looking at a problem. Maybe it's something someone else has thought of before, but maybe it's not. You may learn a lot better by doing something and handling it yourself, rather than just listening to or watching someone else doing something. 

Trial and error may give you a better grasp on the situation and what you're capable of overall. If you have to regularly figure out things on your own, you may also be less frustrated when you run into a problem or need to figure out something. Someone who is always learning from others may not experience much frustration if they know they can just hand the problem off or rely on someone else if they need help. 

Learning this way may also help you become more self-reliant (instead of quickly turning to others whenever you have an issue) and willing to learn new skills and experiences based on your own initiative."

After all, it is your life and experiences who have made you who you are up until this point. People mean we’ll, but reason through it yourself."

8380,"In a similar place here! Immediately went to look for a job and now that I have one, sticking with it for a year or two to build up my savings and then planning to take a year or so to myself. With a grain of salt, but I don't think taking time off would reflect poorly. People take time for plenty of reasons, you could use the family excuse, went back to schooling for a bit excuse, anything could work. You could even be honest and put a professional spin on it, saying you took some time off to realign yourself with your goals and life and now you're ready to begin their pursuit. 

Idk for sure if anyone would look at a resume and see that and think negatively, but I can't imagine it would be an issue 

Edit: it could also depend on the field, maybe ask a coworker or a friend or someone older who's in your field for their thoughts!"
8381,"Thank you for providing a response, and a quick one at that. I just made the grave mistake thinking that my grad money will allow me to get an apartment as soon as I can & my parents would be okay with it, so I didn’t bring it up until I completely moved out of my college apartment today. It’s a good idea to come up with a plan, but with the sudden change of events I dont know how much time I have to plan. I’ll keep all these points in mind when I talk to them again. Thank you!"
8382,"Proof of income is common for renter, but maybe their concern was you not having enough money?  You mentioned having money, but didn't mention having a job.  If you've got no job, I wouldn't do it.  You're just throwing money away at that point and setting yourself up for eviction."
8383,"You can find most of what I listed off on any apartment website + a quick call. Especially with covid, you won't physically have to go to them to find any of that. I'd still recommend touring before you move in if possible. A listing website like apartments dot com likely has all of that there, except income reqs. I wouldn't trust it to be completely current, but you can use it as a ballpark. 

I have no idea how much you have from grad money/ other savings, but I'd strongly recommend having a job before you move out, even if it is bussing tables/ fast food/ grocery store. It goes fast. If your parents are taking care of any bills for you (phone, health insurance, car payments/ insurance are common ones), also take into consideration that it might stop once you move out. Consider if your parents are on your bank account.

From your post your situation could range from abusive to ready to adult with an otherwise healthy relationship. I'm not asking for details, but just remember to keep your safety first, especially if it's at the bad end of that spectrum. Getting out ASAP might feel like the best option, but make sure that ASAP doesn't end up putting you on the street in a month. Most of adulting is making sure a few numbers add up at the end of the month. The rest you can learn from youtube videos."

8385,"This. I recently moved back in with my parents after graduating college and breaking up with my ex, who I lived with. My parents were so excited to have me home, and for the first several weeks were saying things like, “you know, even when you do get a job you could just stay here so you can save your money.” Now, several months in, the things they’ve been saying have been more like “hey, so what’s your progress on finding a roommate? What’s the timeline on you getting an apartment?” Your parents might initially appreciate your presence, but I can almost guarantee they appreciate their newfound independence just as much as you do."
8386,"Honestly, even if you did move back in with them, I would think that both parties would quickly realize they don't want to live together anymore.  You've probably changed and become more independent than they're ready for and they've grown to enjoy not having to support or concern themselves with you.  And that's if you don't start getting on each other's nerves immediately.  They think they want you to live under their roof, but I'm willing to bet that tune changes a bit after you actually did start living with them.

And you're an adult now, you don't need their permission to get your own place.  Live your life by dictate, tell you're going to do something not that you want to."
8387,"Are you 18 years old? If so, tell them ""I am an adult, thank you for the offer, but I will be living on my own. Let's have dinner occasionally."" If they don't like it, say ""too bad."" They will be upset for a little while then get over it."

Since I just finished all my college classes I didnt have any time to look for one, but I’d like to move into an apartment immediately after getting hired. It’s just a weird balance because I’m planning on staying at the city where my university is and many apartments get taken up in August."

I think part of the issue I had was the pandemic kinda taking a year of my 20s away as well. I’ll have time for the things I love still. 

Also, you’ll get the job at some point! Do you mind if I ask what you do? Cuz I’m a designer and if an artist like me can get a job in a pandemic you can too lol"

You have before and after work every day to do what you want too. What were you doing before you got a full time job? You’re going to have a schedule now and need to learn to budget your time/days. Yes, work takes up a lot of life but in exchange you get to live comfortably and buy things you like.

Also, you should learn to enjoy your job as much as you can. Learn every day, get to know your coworkers, and do meaningful work. Just because it’s called “work” doesn’t mean you need to be miserable for 40 hours a week"

I know I was a mess for the first like, 5 months of it. I lost a great internship I had just gotten because of it, I had to move in with my parents again, and I felt as though my 23rd year got wasted but I kinda just kept going through life and trying to find little good things along the way, and now I’m in a much better place.

8403,Yeah I figured... maybe I should just buy a van and go west lol
8404,"That works too. But I just wanna add that, the relationships you make at work will make all the difference when it comes to feeling this way. My first real job, I worked with people much older than me, and didn’t really make an effort to build any sort of relationship outside of “coworker” and I also just didn’t relate to any of them due to age difference. And during that time I thought “god, I have to be here EVERY DAY, for 8 hours?” 

Eventually I left and got a job that was closer to home, and with people much younger around my age, and I made friends with many of them so easily, and it made the grind somewhat enjoyable, going to work was like hanging out with my friends and I didn’t dread work so much anymore or get bummed about having no life outside of work. 

I’m not saying you need to befriend everyone you work with. It’s totally normal to just have a “coworker only” relationship with someone. But having 2-3 people at work that you actively engage with and relate to just makes it so much easier."
8405,Good for you!
8406,"This is comforting. I'm going to soon celebrate my 1 year post graduation and I haven't found a job in my career field yet. I do have a job that pays well, and living at home means I'll be able to pay off my loans. Still, its hard some days."

8418,"Starting out is tough, but it sounds like you're navigating it pretty well considering your circumstances! 

That's great you have the family business, but make sure every job you ever take is teaching you a skill that gets you closer to your goal. 

That way even though you're not working in the same field, in interviews you can still show you have relevant experience. 

Keep putting as many poles in the water as you can. In my experience, it doesn't always end up looking the way I imagined it, but eventually I do get what I wanted. Keep hustling - you got this! 💙"
8419,"I was in literally the exact same shoes as you after I graduated, except I was pursuing a career in a different field. It took months of unpaid internships, chasing leads, and working at a family business before an opportunity to work in my desired field fell into my lap just when I was about to give that dream up. Funny how life works sometime. 


My advice is to keep grinding. There’s no shame in just making money now while you pursue a long-term career in another field. There’s also no shame in doing an internship if that’s what it takes to get your foot in the door."

8421,I have a associates on CJ. I graduated at 19 and I am now 20. I live in NY and I am currently working at the same min wage job I have been working at sense 10th grade. I haven’t applied for anything or taken any of the civil service exams yet. I need to workout more but I understand what you mean. I feel like I am wasting my time or something but I know it’s better than doing nothing at all. My job isn’t crazy hard but it is defiantly not something you want to do all day. I am Nervous that I will not get hired but I always have to remember that I have to never surrender. I just turned 20 so I am really going to start turning my physical training and book studies back up in the meantime. I wish you good luck and stay safe.
8422,"Wow, 522 days? That is crazy, I think I would go insane by that time. As for the rest of your advice I greatly appreciate it, my closest friends are about 3 hours away so I can also relate to that part as well but it’s really nice to hear from others who know what it’s like rather than people who got jobs straight out of college who just say “well just keep looking” and “hang in there!”. Once again I greatly appreciate your response friend, it helps a lot."
8423,"Thanks friend! I appreciate the optimism and the comforting words. I’m trying to handle it as best I can. So far those jobs have had some good lessons, wether technical or interpersonal but they’ve all been pretty good! I’ll keep putting those poles in the water as you say and see where that takes me. Thanks again! 💚"
8424,"Hey man I’m 23 almost 24, you still have plenty of time to get in shape and apply! I didn’t start working out hard till about 1.5 years ago but you will make leaps and bounds with that never surrender attitude you got going there buddy. I don’t know much about NY standards or anything like that but with a couple years and some motivation I’m sure you will be able to land any job you want. Best of luck to you too friend, stay safe out there as well."
8425,"Do they let you know that passed/failed a certain part? So yea I feel you about being nervous...

I may be in your buddy’s boat about getting LASIK, sounds like a good investment tho. The aftercare sounds awful tho lol"
8426,"So we had to pass a medical exam which included an eye and ear exam prior to starting any interviews, checks, etc. but now they disqualified him after he passed that initially, which surprised him and I. And is now worrying me. But yea I’ve heard the aftercare of LASIK can be a nightmare... best of luck to you if you have to go through that I hope it works out for you!"
8427,Good luck to both of you as well!
8428,"Well here is to the grind then, and yea I’ve been looking at some internships but they are more geared towards students. However if one came up I would probably end up grabbing it cause I just need something to do in the field I went in for. I appreciate your input friend!"
8429,"Yea I’m in a pretty small town (population about 6,000) in the Midwest, but I’m living with my parents cause it’s way cheaper until I get the career job I’m in the process for. The local PD job was in a larger city though."
8430,[removed]
8431,"Okay buddy, thank you for the input."
8432,"In most cases a state college will require you to live in campus for at least one year, unless you have severe financial circumstances. 

As others have mentioned, this is where you will meet a lot of your friends in college and the school does a great job at giving you opportunities to meet new people. At least the good schools do. So I’d recommend doing it unless you plan on attending lots of school activities or being in a bunch of clubs. 

To answer your question more directly, it’s certainly doable with a roommate as long as you find a place in your price range. I did this with my girlfriend and two other guys for 3 years of my college and we lived pretty comfortably. But I’d still recommend living at school in the dorm for a year and if you don’t like it you can always move out the next year. 

Good luck!"
8433,"Dorms are super over priced. If you can avoid it at all then I highly suggest it. I owe about 24k in student loan debt and thats just for the last 3 years. The first year cost 22k in the dorms for me. They said it was “mandatory”, but my gf (who’s a year younger than me) just put that she was commuting and living with her parents when she was really just living in an apartment with a roommate and they never checked in on it. 

But, I would never trade the year I had in the dorms although as I get further and further along in life after college, I see that the dorms weren’t as significant as I previously thought and I’m not sure if it was worth the 22k. 

If i could give any advice, I would say look into going to a Junior College for the first year. If you don’t know what you want to yet (majority of people don’t) , then go to a junior college for a year or even a semester. It’s usually a quarter of the price as any university and you’ll be basically taking the same classes. And if you have university in mind for later, check and make sure that the classes you’re going to take will transfer so you don’t waste time and more importantly MONEY!

Hope this helped besides being a block of text"
8434,"First year student living 10 mins waking distance from campus (off-campus apartment) and I love it. I currently share a 2BH apartment with each of us having a room, and honestly being able to sleep during the day and having no restrictions with lights/sounds in your room is the best part. I also hate the dining hall food so being able to cook my own food was a plus for me.

Just for comparison, my friends who live on campus pay $17k for living+food (for 2 semesters), and I pay $4k."
8435,"Popular opinions seems to be swaying towards dorm life, but an apartment is much less stressful (financially and socially). If you’re worried about meeting people, participate in school activities, make friends in classes. I have a solid group of college friends I still regularly talk with and see - I met none of them from the dorms. 

One dorm advantage was the convenience of food already being made, but the meal plans are much more expensive than you would pay for groceries on your own. It can be a lot of work to keep yourself fed when you live on your own (I hate doing dishes lol)

With a job it is absolutely feasible that you can afford housing with a roommate off campus (but will probably be kind of a shitty place)

In conclusion, dorm life can be great or it can be not great - just depends on who you are. You know yourself best, do which one you think fits you and don’t feel like you’re missing out just because other people hype up dorms."
8436,$330 rent a month and then you're Amish and also feed via photosynthesis?
8437,"I personally hated the dorms and would have loved to skip them all together. That being said some colleges do make you live on campus for at least a year, but if they don’t it’s typically much cheaper living off campus, especially when you take into consideration a meal plan and on campus fees. The truth is, you will likely have friends/know people that live on campus, and if you want to experience on campus living, it won’t be hard to make friends in the dorms, hangout there all night/weekend, and retreat back to your cheaper apartment with some buddies you know you already like and want to be around. I came from a very unrestrictive home especially toward the end of high school, where I was expected to behave at my own risk along with a lot of freedom, and living in a dorm made me feel like I had less freedom than where I came from. It is true many people meet their life long friends from the dorms, but not everyone. TLDR; If you want to live off campus and are able to, it might be a good/cheaper option, dont worry about missing out on typical dorm experiences, you’ll have them regardless."
8438,"I’d recommend dorming for at least 1 year (some colleges require it too).  You’ll make friends and it will be easier to find people you get along with after to get an apartment with the following year. 

Unless you get an apartment with people you know really well, it’s worse to get an apartment with someone you don’t know well than a dorm. In a dorm there is mediation and most colleges will move you if you don’t get a long, no charge. In an apartment, it’s way harder to get someone to break there lease. If the person you have in mind is also going to school, you can request a dorm with them. 

It sounds like your home life is pushing you to want to move out. In high school my home life wasn’t great. I dormed all 4 years because I got free housing (RA. I’d look into that if you want to save money). I went home almost every break including summers and winter break. (My school gave us the option of staying on campus for shorter breaks.) Those breaks I spent at home were so much more smooth for so many reasons. Don’t get me wrong, I still wanted to go to back school at the end of the break but I wasn’t ready to pull my hair out. The only really bad times were summer break and I tried to get a job every summer where I worked a littler bit different hours than everyone else in the house. One year I worked 7-3.

8439,"Avoid loans whenever the option is possible to do so. If you plan on moving out on your own, debts are the last thing you want to be packing and carrying with you to a new place."

8442,"I think this is going to depend heavily on where you are intending to live. If you live in an area where the cost of living isn’t too bad, then living by yourself may not be a bad idea, but if it is, dorm life might be the better option. 

Now, people like me, who go to college in Seattle (example of high cost of living), have a rough situation cause apartments are basically the same price as a studio, sometimes cheaper even, especially if you split the cost with a second person. Living on campus (UW) is tricky because sure housing is technically cheaper, but the mandatory food plans often suck at colleges. They might force you to buy overpriced food or cooking ingredients with your student plan. 

When it comes down to it, consider cost of living, how much you’ll want to be working, how much living on campus versus off campus compares, and what your budget is regarding housing. Dunno if I’m being of any help but all, but all the same, Good luck!

Edit: run on sentence"
8443,"I and all of my college compatriots did dorming our first year and then we all got apartments with the friends we made Freshman year.

It's the best way to do things IMO."
8444,"It mostly depends on how expensive rent is in your area but I highly recommend skipping the dorms. I moved out of my parents’ the August after graduating high school and started college the same month (almost 10 years ago). I went to school full time and worked generally 20-30 hours a week and full time in the summer/over breaks. 

I learned a lot through renting with roommates - how to respect each other’s space, how to clean up after yourself, financing, how to talk to a landlord, time management (cleaning/housework, laundry, work, homework, classes, etc). I couldn’t ever imagine myself living in the dorms, each time I went to one with a friend who lived there it felt like summer camp - and I need my own room."
8445,"People are saying this where you meet most of your friends, if you want that to be so, make sure your super social a lot. I stayed in my dorm
And didn’t make any new friends and have about 2 now at school but they’re the same ones from high school that also go to the same school. But I like it that way, I like doing my own thing on my own time lol"
8446,"Agreed. I could have gone into halls at uni but it was SO expensive it was actually 50% cheaper for me to live with friends in one uni, and 40% cheaper in my second uni. IIRC, for both unis I would have been using all of my student loan purely on housing costs."
8447,"Your asking us if you can get a job to afford living in your area and that’s something we can’t do without more info. 

I’d suggest looking up jobs and apartments/ townhomes in the area and seeing what you can get, also see if the school has certain programs or if apartments near the school offer specials for students. 

Also Idk how well you know whomever you have in mind to move in with but I strongly STRONGLY suggest getting them to invite you over for a session of whatever y’all’s shared vice of choice May be and observer how they act.... in my experience kids when the first move out ( kids, lol listen to me talking like I’m 40 ) tend to do what they couldn’t at home. When I first moved into my apartment 6 hours after we could move in there was a kid who had to get life-lighted outta the complex ( helicoptered out ) because the first thing he did was pull out a bunch of booze and “ slamming them back like it’s the end of the world “( according to his roommate) is also suggest studying how they live, observe there room and what state it’s in, do there folks make em keep it clean? Do they do it on there own? How do they react when told/asked to do household chores? Do they even know how to do household chores? Do you know how to do household chores? 
I cannot stress this enough about how important these things are. 

When I moved into my apartment it was set up like dorms, 4 bedrooms 2 bath, your lease is for the bedroom and everything else is considered shared property.... me n some people I recently reconnected with moved in so we all knew each other so it was all good right? Everyone seemed fine, cll OK wan enough as 20~ year olds go.... how bad could it be? 
Well instantly I realized that’s not the case. One of them ( girl.... lets call her E girlfriend to asshat or J ) has to pay a higher premium due to her credit that she couldn’t afford and she still signed up binding herself legally to pay her dues each month.... she never got to move in and at the end of the lease they where during her for a little over 15k+ court cost. We told her not to do it, hell I specifically told her to not sign her name on anything unless she can pay the dues..... but what did I know right? 

Now for asshat...... oh asshat seemed nice enough at first, I didn’t know him too well but he seemed nice enough and we got on well together.... until we moved in. This man had a job at Nissan making good money but decided to call out 6 times because his girlfriend was giving birth with just as many months, then stayed in the apartment doing nothing but stealing shit, smoke weed, drink cheer wine , play fortnite , and ruin the dishware givin to me by my dead grandma by leaving RAMEN NOODLES IN IT TO THE POINT THEY LIQUIFIED THEN TAKING IT TO THE SINK AND ADDING WATER TO COVER UP THE SMELL AND LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DISCOVER AND TRY TO CLEAN IT ( I tried cleaning it but it was so brittle it shattered while I was scrubbing it due to I assume the bacteria in it. ) he had shady people over constantly, let a child porn addict stay in his girlfriends empty room without any of us knowing for a few months, broke into my room to use my router, stole the other roommates underwear..... it goes on and on but moral is he seemed nice and fine but as soon as he moved out all his bad tendencies came pouring out in excess. He kept his room because his girlfriend was paying for it and... well everything to my knowledge. 

Now for J. Jay was the one I knew, she was the only one who stuck to the plan we all made, she brought the cookware and I brought the dishes, she cooked and I cleaned, every Sunday we divide household chores and she helped me learn how to cook a lil and how to properly clean things and..... it was honestly really nice. I told her beforehand that I didn’t know how to do a lot of household stuff and she was okay with that, she kept the peace between me and asshat and...... you know them couples that literally act like a couple but there not but they just *match up* so well? It was like that honestly.... if she could of kept a job she would of been the best roomie ever. ( we didn’t hook up while living at the apartment, it was honestly a beautiful relationship we had going ) 

Morale of my story: move in with people you know, develop a plan, talk things out, establish a concrete foundation of house rules and personal responsibility and keep it.... but also don’t overcomplicate, keep it simple and adapt as y’all evolve from being kids to young adults. 



I hope this helps you and I wish you the best, if you need help establishing a budget to figure out what you can afford the numbers app that’s built into iPhone has templates good enough to give you a graph or pie chart as needed to help you keep it all labeled and organized. Also make sure to do your research into the area your moving into, complexes varie from complex to complex in population, parking, crime rate, space to cost ratios etc.... you don’t want a complex with a high crime rate to be your first and leave you scared. 
Again, best of luck to you! Pm me if you want any extra help!"
8448,"Live in the dorm for a year man, yes sharing a room with someone sucks but the whole setup is a really cool/unique experience and it’s where you’ll meet most of your college friends."
8449,"this is late but if you don't have a car and can't afford deliveries, i'd live very close to a grocery store so you can walk. at my uni there was one very close to the edge of campus (which wasn't ridiculously huge) with a lot of houses around it. you had to be quick with renting or expressing interest though. some places had waiting lists."
8450,"Dorm life was mandatory for 2 years then the school didn’t have space for juniors and seniors so everyone lived off campus during those years, perfectly doable ofc depending on where your school is. I paid rents varying from $450-$550 a month and campus was a 5 min walk away so no worries about transport. I’m sure your school has a Facebook group for housing you should check it out."
8451,i’ve done both and tbh living with randoms isn’t all too bad. they tend not to overstep your boundaries as opposed to when you choose to live with a friend. i’d still recommend living on campus for 1 year so you get that full college experience though. it’s pretty fun.
8452,"i was scared for dorm life but looking I actually quite liked it. It was super fun and I met tons of people. I’m graduated now but if i could go back and do it again i would in a heartbeat. but living on campus ended up being more expensive than say an off campus apartment at least where i went. I’d recommend not working at least your first semester or two just to get a feel for college. you deserve that time to meet people and have fun, just do what you want or focus on studying. you have your whole life to get a job and work. i understand if that’s not feasible but that’s just my recommendation!"
8453,Amen to this. I needed to hear it

8457,Damn that's tough. I hope he overcomes these hardships
8458,"They say that comparison is the thief of joy, and I can personally testify that this is completely true with regards to academic, financial, familial, etc. success of any kind. Ironically, I often ended up performing much better when I focused more on my own development and on learning important lessons from the activities in which I was engaged, than when I was directly comparing myself with someone else. I’m sure some other people have also been comparing themselves with me as well (unbeknownst to me), but whether they view themselves as being in direct competition with me or not, I don’t view it as any sort of competition at all. Instead, I focus more on reflecting what I want to gain out of each endeavor I pursue, and then write down my individual goals. I think the vast majority of people would also do better with this kind of thinking."
8459,had a major setback recently but always good to get this reality check

8462,"I started applying over winter break (having graduated in the spring), and didn't stop until I signed an offer letter. 


I made it clear to everyone I spoke with that I would be in school until May. I suppose I got lucky because I landed a job and started the week after I walked. But I know for sure that the early interviews I had that didn't go anywhere were highly influential to all of my more ""serious"" ones. Practice makes perfect."
8463,"You should be applying now/any day now. Make sure that you apply to a variety of jobs—even the ones that aren’t the perfect fit will give you great interview experience!

Also, don’t feel like you’re falling behind when classmates are getting jobs all around you. Apply at your own pace, but be proactive. That was some of the best advice I got when applying for jobs in the spring before graduation. 

Good luck!!"
8464,ok thanks
8465,thats a very good point
8466,I would say half a year ago. As multiple comments have mentioned it truly is never too early to get your resumé out there.

8471,Bro it is never too early. Looking back. I wish I would've taken the jobs that gave me more exp earlier. It's invaluable and makes you a prime candidate
8472,ok. I guess I better get on it. Out of curiosity where are you going?
8473,"ASAP! I just graduated in December and started applying to jobs around October/November. I finally landed a really good job in my field, trust and believe when I say you want to apply EVERYWHERE. even if it’s not in your field because you at least want A JOB so you can support yourself. you’re going to apply to probably 70 jobs and get 4 interviews and maybe land one. i’m learning this stuff the hard way honestly, start now and good luck!"
8474,Dang I'm already one day behind
8475,"I was the same way. Didn’t get a full-time job until the November after graduation despite working consistently on applications and interviews. Don’t fret—you’ll make it work and find a job you are happy with and excel at. Even if you have to get an odd job to make some cash and pay the bills while you look for the right job, it’ll come."
8476,"I remember in grad school most of us started applying right around spring break, but as architects we need portfolios for work (which many of us didn't get our acts straight to put together). I got everything together in December, and started applying over MLK Day weekend, basically checking listings and applying to new places every weekend until I got my job (which, admittedly I could have saved myself a lot of effort on, since I ultimately decided I was happiest going to a former internship). I agree with everyone, you can't be too early. But by the same token, recruiters do know when to expect students to come out for entry level positions, so there are exceptions. Things tend to be pretty quiet until you hit end of February/March, and then everyone goes crazy with interviews. So honestly, it's best to start now, but also don't be too discouraged if you don't start hearing back until the aforementioned time. It's slim pickings when January starts because recruiters and firms are first getting back into the routine and determining future staffing needs, and it takes a bit of time to pick up."

8513,"I graduated as a Biology Major, Natural Science Emphasis, in May of 2018. I was in an abusive relationship through most of college and didn’t take internships like I should have. I got out of that relationship in March of 2018 and managed to graduate. One of my classes was “The Geology of Iceland” and our lab was a week long trip to Iceland two weeks after we walked. When I came back from that I had no job, because the job I had could only be occupied by a student. I lived off plasma money while I applied for jobs and internships. Thankfully, the one volunteer opportunity I participated in (regardless of my ex’s displeasure at me being out of the house and talking to normal people) had made a connection with someone looking for a summer intern. He told me to apply, so I did, and he hired me and helped me find a place to live. The internship was 3 hours from home, which was very scary to me when I was still barely functioning as a person. The internship ended up being really fun, and I’m still good friends with that boss. I caught hummingbirds every other week all summer, and tracked turkeys and caught reptiles and amphibians the on the off weeks. On the rainy days I studied pollen under a microscope. My boss got me an extension through the end of October. I still hadn’t heard from any of the dozens of jobs I had applied for. I ended up back home without a job for a couple weeks. Then I got a job at Costco... pushing carts, with my bachelor’s degree. That was a rough couple of months for me mentally. While I was working there I ran into an old boss from a job I had worked in college, so I picked up some shifts there, and then I ran into a scientist who had a lab next to the lab I worked in at the school, and he needed help. So I did microscope work for him, balanced with working at an outdoor gear shop. I interviewed for the job I have now in early January, and I got the job, but I didn’t start work until March. I now work as an environmental consultant. It’s a good job, honestly, especially for my lack of experience. I’m still living at home, but I’m saving for a house, and I got rid of my junker car for a slightly newer one. I’m working hard. It’s balanced between field and office work which has been nice, and some weeks I get to make my own schedule and work remotely. Things are looking up!"

I think as long as you and your parents are on the same page (i.e. that you're an adult now and should be treated as such), it's fine.

I'll probably end up back there while job searching in the summer. Not ideal but it's nice to have somewhere to fall back on if I don't find anything by then.

I feel lost and resentful but at least my parents are letting me live with them.

8547,"Hi! I graduated a few years back (2018) but thought I’d share my experience. I moved in with my parents right after graduation. I was unable to land a job for 6 months, so in the meantime I worked with my dad until I could find a job. I was essentially a glorified janitor tbh (he’s a director of facilities so he hires people to clean and set up tables and chairs for meetings) and I was extremely discouraged as no real jobs were falling through. I watched all of my friends land real and well paid jobs while I could still not find one and lived at home with my parents at 23. I was embarrassed to answer when people asked me what I was doing after graduation. Finally, a customer at that very place my dad works knew of an opening at their company and mentioned it to my family. I applied, interviewed, had a recommendation from the person who knew my dad and before I knew it I had a real job. It still didn’t pay a great amount but I was treated well, had benefits, and a lot of opportunity for growth within the company. After working there for 6 months I finally moved out of my parents house and in with a friend and have had a few raises since then with some potential promotions in the near future. I now even work from home permanently thanks to COVID!

I guess I had really high expectations after graduating so was really discouraged nothing worked out as planned. But with a little patience and continuously searching it all worked out in the end :)"
8548,"I’ve been living with my parents since graduating March 2020. I don’t know how long that’s been besides almost a full year now. I still don’t have a job but I haven’t really put the job search into full gear, I’ve only applied here and there since December. 

Overall, it’s good. Like the others said I’m extremely grateful to have a good relationship with them and not to have to pay for rent or food. I was lucky to have saved up some money from working on campus and getting my housing deposit back because not getting any of the stimulus checks SUCKED. The only complaint I can have is that it feels monotonous at times and that it’s hard to be an adult individual when your parents will always so you as their child. I’m still struggling with feeling like my own person around them and it feels like I don’t know myself at times. A positive that’s come out of this though is that I’ve had a lot of time to spend with my 2 brothers after being away for 5 years and missing their early teenage years. 

To pass the time I play Warzone, Apex, and other video games with them. I’ve recently gotten into poshmark to sell some old clothes and pass the time while I wait to hear back from companies. We adopted a little dog last year and he’s taken up a lot of my time with training. I’ve also been watching YouTube videos about fashion, Marvel, Star Wars, education, you name it lol. Mostly I look forward to the new movies or shoes that will come out (The Mandalorian, WandaVision, and now the HBO Max movies have been the real MVP) and one day being able to be around my girlfriend and friends without worrying if we could possibly end up killing someone from being a covidiot. 

The biggest source of hope is knowing it’ll be over one day and we can make up for some of the time we lost. It’s better to be grateful for what we have and our health and the situation we have living with our parents is far more than others have."
8549,"Yeah I graduated the same time and found a job in October. I got lucky but there are companies out there hiring. It is just a matter of trying, not saying you’re not trying but my best advice is just to keep doing your best and hopefully luck will find you. Good luck"
8550,"So I lived at home during undergrad, however, because of the pandemic I wasn't able to move out last summer after graduation (May 2020) like planned. From my experience, as long as you have a good relationship with your parents it will be fine. There will definitely be bad times but overall it's nothing like being in high school.

Honestly my biggest piece of advice is make time for you in your day and don't job hunt endlessly for hours on end every day like I did. I ended up applying for over 700 jobs before I got a nightmare job offer. Over those \~10 months I had little to no free time and got super burned out from job hunting. Honestly I ended up giving up that role (it was that bad) so I could take a part time role and go back to school to become a teacher. Also get at least a part time job while you are looking so you can have some money, get out of the house from time to time, and fulfill that preference employers have for hiring candidates who are already employed."
8551,"Similar situation. Have to say even if your parents treat you as an adult and you have a great relationship it can be difficult living with them. I'm at the point of boycotting family dinners because Dad won't close his fucking mouth when he chews. 

But on the other hand Watching trailer park Boys and Brockmeyer with Pops is pretty great. He even vapes a little bud sometimes haha"
8552,"This is my exact same issue. No internships because I spent my summers and winters trying to graduate early. I also just straight up didn’t put in much effort. My parents have never been aggressive about me having to leave, but I hope to get on my feet by summer."
8553,Communications.
8554,Mechanical engineering. Field is flooded with new grads.
8555,"Graduated in May. Had an offer in March, got rescinded, managed to claw my way back in in October (already did interviews do they fast tracked me). Software engineer.

I have a good relationship with my parents, but it was a big jarring living with them after effectively having a single for 2 years in college. 

For the most part I have independence, but it’s really hard to get out the house here. They do all the groceries and stuff, and I need to be responsible for not getting them sick as well as myself. We don’t connect much due to generation gap. They’re on the older side and there’s a lot of culture clash between 1st and 2nd gen Asian Americans.

On the flip side it’s nice having people around that are willing to help you with stuff. I hit the depress express over the summer and my eczema (bad skin) got REALLY bad due to an unhealthy lifestyle. I’m still recovering and shit like that can be a lot more manageable with help. I’m incredibly thankful for that.

As for friends, pretty much all my really close friends are from high school and we all went to different colleges. I’m used to interacting with them online, although it’s frustrating that a lot of them are within visiting distance now and yet we can’t see each other in person."
8556,"I'm really unhappy, to tell you the truth. I've had a crying fit every night this week. I have a great relationship with my family, so it's nice to be able to spend time with them (god only knows how grateful I'll be for this time 20 years from now), but I don't have a great relationship with my hometown, and I don't have a great relationship with my ""temporary"" ""part-time"" job as a caregiver in assisted living.  

I live in a rural area with mostly older people, and none of my college friends live nearby, so I'm bored and lonely pretty much all the time. I take online community college classes for fun (and to stay sharp should I want to apply to grad school later). I did the Couch to 5k program (totally works!) and started moving on to the 10k one, but it got cold and my job was really exhausting me in every way. I go in waves of how many books I read; sometimes I go on reading binges, sometimes I'll go for months feeling too depressed to focus on what's in front of me. 

The biggest issue for me is being dissatisfied with my job, and I do realize I'm lucky to have  a job in the first place. I just wish I had been more selective in applying for a job, and waited to find something more suited to my interests and skillset, or something that could be more obviously relevant to future jobs. I feel quite hopeless a lot of the time, because I can't imagine finding  (or getting) a job that would enable me to move somewhere else, which I really, really, really want to do."
8557,"It's less that having to be around my parents is bad and more like recently graduating and going into a job search and there's nothing you can really do right now because of covid is maddening. I've been working on myself in many different ways since quarantine started but I can't help but feel like I've just been sitting at my desk for a year straight now.

Like right now I just want to start working just so I can have money and I have something I *have* to do every day."
8558,"I'm pretty much just recording music while applying to jobs. But I'm CS, so I also work on GitHub projects so it looks like I'm doing *something* with my tine."
8559,"It's been up and down. I landed a dev job a month out of college (graduated Dec 2019), got laid off from COVIS three months later, became a part-time teaching assistant in October, and I just signed an offer letter to work as a full-time developer again a week ago! :)"
8560,what do you game?
8561,What degree if you don't mind me asking?
8562,What is your field of study if you don't mind me asking?
8563,Sounds like you're coming off the end of a rough journey. Congrats on the new dev job!
8564,I encourage you to keep applying. It only takes one yes after hundreds of no’s.
8565,"How long has it been since you've been home? Good luck with everything! Tough times don't last, tough people do."
8566,Thank you! That’s very sweet of you to say!
8567,"Graduated in fall 2020. Wrote an outage tracker to track every time my internet goes out into a CSV because I have AT&T in a shitty rural area and it typically goes out 2-3 times a day at least. Also, a vivarium sensor monitor interface for reptile/amphibian enclosures I'm building in Django. I have some big plans for that one"
8568,"I get better results from doing nothing, weirdly enough. Out of those 250, I only got a response from a guy on craigslist and someone who thought I wouldn't immediately ditch the job due to my manufacturing experience. But every now and then I get contacted by some random company or recruiter I never applied with."
8569,Graphic design
8570,"I gave up after around 250 applications. I'll never get away from these shitty labor jobs no matter how hard I try.

I hate living with my mom. But most of the jobs here don't pay enough to live on my own with my student loans, and I'm not getting rid of all my tools just to still be stuck with a roommate anyway."
8571,office jobs are the reason like 40% of the population is depressed. They suck everything out of you and then you have no energy to work on things that you are actually passionate about
8572,At least you’re not laying bricks or putting up pole-barns in 90+ degree humidity
8573,"Definitely me, I work 8-6 doing the same things and genuinely have zero life outside of work because whenever I’m not staring at a screen I’m sleeping. Only 11 weeks in and currently trying to look for a job that is more hands-on because office life is not what I anticipated. You are not alone."
8574,"The invention of computers was horrible for workers IMO. Aside from the sitting down and staring at a screen it intensifies work by making us a lot more 'productive'. All the upside has been captured by capital and not labour, hence all the problems our economy has."
8575,"Lol what? I worked full time as a bricklayer all through college and we absolutely did not get benefits or high salary lmao. On the bright side, it made me appreciate my office job way more. Way better than spending 10 hrs a day doing physical labor in 90 degree weather."
8576,"All depends on the working environment. I have a ""computer-based"" job for the most part, but I'm encouraged to take a 10-minute break every 2 hours, full-hour lunch, there are couches, snacks, beers, a half-pipe, etc. Socializing and shooting the shit is expected and borderline required. Not all places are created equal."
8577,"I work 630-430 in a trade. 

Sometimes I wish I had an office computer type 9-5. 

When I used to work 630-730 it was miserable. I never want to work long days like that again. I had no energy and no life.


Why did I get downvoted for sharing my experience??? Wtf?"
8578,I think people just don't want to be poor. I was close to depression when I couldn't get a job because it was delaying my life progression.
8579,So in other words the struggle is more about how tedious it is vs. it being hard work?
8580,"""blue collar"" jobs are underrated. Less politics, nicer people, no screens. I find they make me less depressed."
8581,I dont know about nicer people. Every environment is different though and I 100% prefer blue collar jobs if they would pay as much as my office job
8582,"You sound like me! Been having that thought since Covid started & had to telework. It opened up my eyes. However, I personally don’t mind being on the computer for hours IF I’m doing my own thing. Studying, researching, etc. But when working, it feels daunting. It’s weird

I finally took the leap using up all my vacation days to start a business.

Hope it all works out for me"
8583,"I used to work as a IT technician intern for an accounting firm. During tax season, I had to stay as long as the accountants. Shit wasn't fun but at least I got paid OT."
8584,Same situation for me. First job out of college. It took me almost exactly a year and I thought I was never going to get a job I wanted.
8585,"I should say more down to earth. And you can make really good money, just have to find the right trade. Also depends how much you make on an office job. I mean it all really comes down to your personality and what you can tolerate. That's more important than the money to me. I'd sacrifice an extra 10-20k a year for my happiness."
8586,Any tips on where to look? What jobs are you trying to go for+
8587,"I think OP might be talking about those jobs with a strong union in regards to high salary and benefits. 

Even then, that work takes a toll on your body. It is not something you could do forever."
8588,"Just be glad you didn't choose public accounting, we regularly have 80 hour weeks during busy season. Low key jealous of people who can expect a regular 40 😅"
8589,"Damn that sucks wtf, how is that even legal"
8590,"yes, your fault.

but also, you can change it. do it."
8591,"It took me soooo long to get my job that I was getting depressed, even though I was living with my parents and didn't have a big financial burden. For exactly the reason you said - delaying my life progression."
8592,There’s so many days I wish I was landscaper or something where I worked with my hand outside…. Instead I just clack away hunched over on the keyboard
8593,"I haven’t gotten tired of it yet. Like yeah I’d rather be NOT working but considering I had a 6-day 8.5 hour work week for a year+ before my current job, a 9-5 is much easier to handle."
8594,What? Desk jobs generally pay better... what?
8595,I feel you. I don't wish the job search hell on anyone.
8596,"Yup. That's why i'm starting as a welding apprentice soon. It will be long hours but i've known for the last year or so that sitting in a desk wouldn't be my future. Even though i first tried coding, hated that then i decided i wanted to get into the arts... Pursuing the arts (animation) as a career killed my joy for it and now i just want a job that pays well and i can be either outside or working on my feet. I really, really don't want a desk job. But i also don't want manual labor that will break my back. There are jobs that have a happy medium of being a skilled trade that you don't have to kill yourself working."
8597,"Everyone is different: your nightmare might be someone else's dream. Maybe just your current job is totally wrong for you because that does sound awful. I barely used the computer at my last job and I was on my feet all day. Everyone else did 8-5, but I chose to do 5:30a-3:30p and I always asked to do weekends. It's worth looking into other career options to find something that taps into your interests and skills.

Edit: my bosses told me to stop working so much bc I was sucking up all the opportunities for overtime"
8598,"oh my gosh, where do you find a place like this"
8599,"It’s more of having no other option and rent to pay, rather than a “choice.” Not everyone had the support system we may had as kids, or a college fund, or the privilege to go to school while trying to support a family. 

The 9-5 office grind still puts food on the table and pays the bills, us Americans have it better than 95% of humans on history"
8600,Ppl put up with it
8601,"i feel that all the time, but honestly, college isn’t really about “learning” specific things. i feel like it’s much more about developing skills and shaping your identity. like, you might not be able to recall a particular “fact” you learned in college, but i bet you anything that you can write more competently than you did in high school. that’s what i tell myself, at least"
8602,"Felt the same way when I graduated in 2018. Got a job that was right in the field of my degree. 

First week went by and I knew absolutely nothing, not one god damn thing, that fucking 40k piece of paper on my wall was just a reminder that I didn’t learn anything. However, those long hours Researching, studying, working under pressure, and so on. All that shit that stressed me the fuck out in college was just the precursor to learning and growing my career now. You gotta understand your not done learning, it’s a hard truth but you keep on learning every day. 

Now it’s just using those skills you learned in college and translate them to the now. How to research, how to stay organized, how to manage time.  All of that shit. Focus on how you learned to do that the rest will follow."
8603,"Graduated with a degree in statistics in May 2021. If you asked me what a Z score is or a Chi Squared Distribution is, I could barely tell you."
8604,News flash you don't need to! It was a huge reality check because I thought you did. I worried 4 years in college thinking I needed to remember it all for nothing. Thanks a lot real world for not telling me so.
8605,"Yup! I was on the teetering edge, somewhere between philosopher and stupid, and now I'm just... stupid. I feel like every modest place in my hometown expects SO MUCH out of its employees. And idk who's more delusional at times. Me or them. I'd actually happily say me if it wasn't for all the antiwork subreddits."
8606,"Ooo, same. And it also sucks how you can’t get a finance job where you can apply what you’ve studied until you’ve climbed the ladder a bit."
8607,"They expect you to know some things, but nothing at the same time."
8608,"A someone with a bachelors in Health Administration, you did learn very little relative to your job. Unfortunately a lot of the admin degrees are not doing as good of a good job educating. Accounting or Finance does better than general business. I recommend you take in all you can in your job. And if you enjoy your job, try and find some certifications relative to it, or get a masters relative to it. I also recommend lean six sigma if your job utilized it in any way. It’s a great skill to learn and will set you apart."
8609,"This is a subjective post. While you may not have remembered or retained any of the information you've learned post-university, what you did gain was invaluable. Friendships, relationships, a higher mentality of thinking, growth, and professionalism. Think about the person you were before you started college, versus now, the person you are after college. You may have remained the same, but surely, more then likely, some part of you has changed. And for most people, college is a learning experience. It's never about what you studied, but what you did during that time. Best of luck."
8610,"as a ME graduate, I still have ptsd back when I had to calculate Two Way ANOVA without software like Minitab 🥲"
8611,That's because business is worthless.
8612,It's just a piece of paper
8613,"Try to do good work at your company now so that you can try and keep your contract going until you can get a new job. Even if you get a job at the first place you apply two it will probably take 2 or 3 months until you can get onboarded. But to be more realistic, it is really hard to get a job so you probably wont get the first several you apply to so you will need your current job to stay afloat"
8614,Literally considering career shift after 4 years with same company for this reason. I notice my enthusiasm disappeared and realized I lie to myself that I’m content just bc I’m comfortable.
8615,"Honestly, we have all been or will be you once. I really wouldn’t sweat it or think that you are stupid for somehow not seeing it. 

It looks so obvious from the outside looking in, but when it’s you (or me), it can sometimes seem like a better situation than it actually is. These type of work environments can be like abusive relationships sometimes. And we don’t think poorly of abuse survivors, right?

Basically, don’t be too hard on yourself. Sometimes shit happens and now that you realize your situation and the rose coloured glasses are lifted, you have the opportunity to join a better workplace.

I’m rooting for you!"
8616,">Try to do good work at your company now so that you can try and keep your contract going until you can get a new job. 

Yeah that's my only worry. There are way worse people in the department than myself so it should be okay.

>But to be more realistic, it is really hard to get a job so you probably wont get the first several you apply to so you will need your current job to stay afloat

Yeah I know. I think I applied to 100 jobs before I got the on I'm at. I'm already starting to mass-apply online."
8617,Yeah dude. You gotta leave. You and me both.
8618,">Out of idle curiosity, what's your field/job? 

I'd rather not get into details, but basically, I deal with documents at a bank.

>Unfortunately, your case isn't the first instance of an office just being a mill and having zero oversight or investment over their employees

Yeah. One of the most frustrating things about my job is how little communication there is. My job is closely knit to government regulations that we're supposed to follow so we're audited all the time by an illiterate QA department that does shit like this:

""Stop doing A, you will be now punished for doing A. Start doing B""

Next Week: ""Wtf are you thinking? B is completely wrong, doing A is mandatory""

The week after: ""Doing A and B are now optional. Also you have to do C otherwise you're a dumb-dumb""

That is only one example. What we're supposed to be doing and what is expected of us is always a mystery."
8619,"Out of idle curiosity, what's your field/job? Unfortunately, your case isn't the first instance of an office just being a mill and having zero oversight or investment over their employees, until such a time as it affects their bottom line. Definitely get out of there when you have the opportunity."
8620,"Exactly this OP, don't take the above comment lightly. I got my first job about a year after graduating, even though the pay was terrible I was so excited to start. I had a lot of enthusiasm, my boss loved me. I was catching on the to the training quickly, absorbing everything they were throwing at me, I brought fresh ideas, I was redesigning excel sheets left and right. It was a great first 6 months. After some time I realized there's no place for me at this job. A promotion is just doing the same mundane, repetitive thing day after day, for a little bit more money and a title change from analyst to team lead (oOoOoO). Fast forward two years later and I haven't been this depressed since college, I have no motivation to do anything outside of work, I'm doing barely the bare minimum right now, I'm always sour, angry, and just overall living a really unhealthy lifestyle than I'm used to. I'm looking for news jobs with no luck, honestly who wants to hire someone at their low. So, I'm quitting in a month getting my life back together and getting back out there with a clean positive mind."
8621,"I'm not really being too hard on myself. At the end of the day, I still got a job during the pandemic and got money flowing into my bank account as well as something to put on my resume.

I'm now just worried about my future employment prospects."
8622,"with the world is opening up, if you’re still near your college city you should reconnect with friends! something i learned as we get older is that people are much more willing to hang out than you think :)"

8624,What are your hobbies? Do you do them alone?
8625,What are your hobbies? Do you do them alone?
8626,"Agreed with what everyone has said. Is your college doing alumni events yet? You can connect
To people through those!"
8627,"I don't think it gets better I work at a job that pays pretty bad but wouldn't have ben able to get without a degree. No social life from job, most people aren't looking for friends when you get older, especially not new ones."
8628,Maybe you are better suited in academia. Ever considered getting an advanced degree and go into research/teaching?
8629,"I’ve been at this point, where for me personally it felt like the struggle to get that middle class life was asking a lot of me (in terms of debt, time, energy and indeed, my happiness. School had been robbed of its wonder for me, learning became about grades and little more. 

In uni I was surrounded by books, faculty and events that I literally had no energy to engage in. I felt like I had no direction either. The competition had just worn me down. 

I can promise you you’re not the only one who feels this way. Maybe you don’t care much for politics, but tbh the best thing that happened to me was realizing that I wasn’t alone, that the hardships I felt like were only happening to me in fact are increasingly commonplace not only amongst my peers (social media is not always an honest mirror of the world) but for many young people around the world too! 

I found working class organizations I could get involved in, put my skills to work for something I believed in. Maybe that’s something for you to look at. We’re all struggling in some way, why not struggle together? It’s not good to be addicted to ideology, but the reality is that our hyper-competitive culture is an ideology and to opt out of it requires building relationships of solidarity that seek to uplift the individual and affirm their dignity, not make them feel inferior. 

Here’s a talk I watched that really helped spark my imagination, maybe you’ll find it helpful. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=M-frUMXKcEw"
8630,"I think it’s important to have reachable goals. Baby steps towards what you want to do or become add up over time. Track your progress and you’ll be able to see how far you’ve come, and how much further you’ve left to go. I don’t have any standard advice for this tbh. Maybe find purpose in finding purpose."
8631,"Whenever I’m stuck I usually take a week in order to challenge myself at something. Maybe one week it’s reaching out to people I haven’t had time to see and making that a priority. Another week is budgeting. Another week is trying new stuff in the kitchen. Try it out, the stakes aren’t super high but you’re bound to learn something new every week. It helps me give myself at least a shrivel of purpose, and instead of keeping up with the Jones’, I’m content doing my own thing."
8632,There was a good podcast episode of Kwik Brain on vision & I thought “The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck” had valuable advice as well
8633,"I don't mean to come off as disrespectful, but do you have any hobbies? Something that keeps you excited? 

I think a majority of people in their 20's feel this, but it's the little things that get people through it. I've always felt like the point is to struggle together and make it out alive because of the tidbits that kept us entertained and happy."
8634,"Hi Super-owl, I was in a similar situation to you straight out of college. I know how you feel it's rough, especially when friends land high paying careers. What I found, was that change was the most important first step that transformed everything for me. Small changes, like waking up 15 min earlier each day transformed into waking up 2 hours early and working out before work. Working different positions within my same company improved different skills and built confidence. 

I do feel you should consider a job change, but you don't need to try and find a dream job, just get into something different. You'll be surprised what doors open after some changes. I would have never imagined ending up in the position I'm in now and I'm sure I'll be surprised again in the next year or two. 

Even though you're not making a ton of money, you're in a good position to make some pretty epic financial moves right now. I'm assuming your rent and overhead is low, if you have debt hit it hard, pay as much of that off now as you can. Use some of your money to start taking risks that could increase your income. Pay for courses, try business ideas, if you fail worst case is you'll be in the same situation you are now, best case scenario could be huge. I got your back if you need anything, living at my parents, lame at time, was an important step that set me on a path towards financial freedom/early retirement. I'm 31 now."
8635,"can you start looking and interviewing in other places you’d like to live? just get a taste of what’s out there. i’m a huge fan of a leap of faith and I believe that you will always be caught. even if things are really fucking hard for a while, you will get your feet under you and find your way."
8636,"Do you go to concerts by your self? I would feel so weird doing that. I met most of my fiends at concerts in the last town I lived at but I started going with a small group of friends from school, then as we started going more it blew up to tones of friends. Now I'm in a new town and know no one."
8637,"Yeah, hell yeah! I’m more in the EDM scene, and it’s so easy because you just jam out. The more you go, more people you recognize. That’s the only way I know how to make friends and I love it!"
8638,Think of communal activities that you might enjoy. Rock climbing gyms for example are pretty neat in that it’s a solo sport but with a lot of communal space. Also go to networking events or meetups. I’ve made friends going to code meet ups.
8639,Go to activities you like and meet people with those similar interests
8640,"Yeah I also mained edm shows. I once arrived at a show by myself meeting people there and some chick pointed me and was all ""wait are you here all hy your self"" that had kind of put me off ever since lol"
8641,"Its worth a shot, people are a lot more open to reconnecting than I thought they would be. Of course, not everyone will and thats fine too."
8642,"Don’t pay attention to that! Who gives a shit. You get yourself absorbed into the music and just feel it. Be in your own zone and you’ll start jamming out with people around you. Also look to see if there are any edm events going on and just go.  Don’t pay attention if you’re there with some or alone. Time slips away so fast, don’t waste it with such thoughts :) good luck boo! ✌🏼"
8643,What do you enjoy doing? Go do that. That is the way you meet people whi share common interests.
8644,"Honestly, I just started to realize that's okay to not have like all the friends you used to. 

But go to events alone and meet new people that way even for just that moment. 

Hope things flip 👋🏼 

- if I could I would make friends with all on here"
8645,"Friends are overrated. I have all my old friends, we all get alone good and I can always count on them."
8646,I've actually thought about this! Worth it?
8647,thank you :)
8648,Lol! well good seeing you and your old squad still hang :)
8649,I'll see it out :)
8650,Yknow I honestly thought it was all a huge gimmick or lie lol but it is so true. Good on you for lucking you bro. Hope I find the same vibe someday!
8651,"Try an r4r subreddit and look for people in your area.

Check their post history and make sure they aren't crazy though!"
8652,"For me I easily meet people and make acquaintances in the gym.

Specifically I've been involved in powerlifting the past couple years and you usually just kind of know when you see another powerlifter which sparks conversation and then you have a place you can repeatedly see them and potentially build a friendship.

I suggest getting into a similar niche hobby of some or just place you enjoy going to weekly and once you have that similarity in interests you will see how easy it can be to meet new people, just gotta be in the right environment."
8653,Concerts are fucking expensive
8654,"I once thought of getting into DnD but, not my jam. 

I enjoy Netflix, graphic design and art, gaming, and literally just talking to people lol so"
8655,Give it a shot. I actually just reconnected with a couple of old friends (separately) and I’m seeing them both for lunch in the next week or so.
8656,"So get involved in community organizations, volumteer for a cause you support, a local sports league,  a religious group... if you find you don't like one thing move onto the next"
8657,I've noticed as you get older making new friends is harder. So I think I just lucked out all my old friends are normal lol.
8658,"aw thanks, i am homeschooled cuz i never finished school however its pretty nice to speak 4 languages"
8659,"As a starting point, check out our [How To Meet People](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/wiki/making_friends) guide."
8660,"i moved a lot throughout my life and childhood mostly so all my friends are on the internet and it gets really lonely especially because my interests are so much different, but i'm convinced that eventually you start to find a group that fits more to you that motivates you to get more invested in engaging with them"
8661,Hahaha. I feel like in a big way going to events alone *to meet friends* is like... weird. Idk why. But maybe I should go do it!
8662,thank you :)
8663,I honestly feel that so much lol. For me I feel like homeschool would be a better option but I am in college now. Lets just hope we both someday find our niche lol. Gl bro
8664,Awww hope you finish! and wow which languages do you speak?
8665,"im born in netherlands, so dutch is my motherlanguage english obviously german and spanish"
8666,"let's organize this a little bit, I feel like there are several points.

1. Yes art is super competitive by nature but it doesn't have to be you career. Most people's jobs land in between ""passion"" and ""suffering day to day"". It's not one or the other. There's nothing wrong with pursuing a field thats acceptable but pays well.
2. If you choose art then you have to deal with the rejections. I imagine there are very few positions. An average engineer/business person will earn a decent paycheck, but not the case for an artist. So of course it's easier to get a retail job.
3. Sorry about your situation with your sister. Family can be tough. It's a small set back but just manage expectations in the future and get back to job searching.
4. You're 22 and have plenty of time ahead of you. When you're in college you think that once you graduate you get a job and then you're done. It's literally the complete opposite. College is just a small structured step toward your goals. The real journey starts after graduation. Keep moving forward and your dream job now will be the job you leave behind in a couple years. Then you will have a new goal, then another."
8667,"Also desi, (25f) and went down the arts path against my family’s wishes. Here’s my journey so far if this helps at all: I studied English + creative writing in uni, graduated at 23, immediately began working a shit minimum wage job after college bc I didn’t know what to do next, did a couple dead end internships while working in restaurant industry, then committed to my art/passion at 24. Wrote a book at 25, landed a big literary agent six months later, and now I’m revising the book with my agent in the hopes of selling it this year. Still working a job unrelated to my degree, but it pays slightly better than minimum wage and allowed me the mental clarity (and time) to finally write my book. 

I still have a long way to go, but just wanted to share that it’s okay for life after college to be shit. You never know what’s waiting just around the corner. If you need anyone to chat with, my DMs are open!"
8668,I'm South Asian. Figured it'd add more context to my struggles of pursuing an art degree/career and the family issues
8669,"I’m currently living that post-graduate life and doing work that’s not related to my degree but the best thing you can do is keep yourself busy, even if it’s a retail job you didn’t want to do. During this you can save money and apply to other jobs. Not doing anything would be wasting time but as long as you’re actively working on yourself don’t consider it wasted time, but an investment in yourself."
8670,"Damn felt bad reading that. For context I too am Desi 22/M and graduated with a CS degree last year with low GPA and have yet to find employment in Software Engineering (which is my goal). It is tough especially within our communities dealing with stuff like this especially when family doesn't support you (I am **very lucky** that mine does). I know you didn't ask for advice but if I were to give I'd say look into UX/UI especially with a design background this can give you a well-paying career or at least give you more skills you can market to employers. Anyways good luck, tough times don't last, tough people do!"
8671,"The market does not care for your passions. That is the sad reality, better do some retail until you could manage to find a job that fits you."
8672,you are 22. its gonna be alright
8673,"People fetishize STEM a lot, but it doesn’t automatically make you employable. I was a math major and I had a really tough time looking for a job this year as well (also class of 2020). Ended up opting out and going grad school instead. 

It’s not just that she has an art degree, although that definitely made it harder, it’s that the vast majority of companies stopped hiring for entry level workers once the pandemic started. When people did hire for those positions, the perfectly good, pandemic laid off workers with advanced degrees and years of experience got the jobs instead. It was just a really awful year to try to enter the workforce"
8674,"“With the weight of the world on your shoulders, plant your feet”

Rough break by your sister no doubt, but sometimes that’s what life gives us. Can’t choose your family or how the world shakes out for you. All you can do is focus on yourself, what you can control, and make the most of your situation. Be patience, keep hope, and above all believe in your own strength because no one else will. You’ll get things figured out."
8675,I'm keen to read your book!!
8676,"I just wanted to say that I am in a similar boat with uncertainty after school, but I just wanted to encourage you! Things will end up ok, you will eventually find a more permanent position and your retail job is only a temporary situation until something better comes along. It’ll be ok! Sending love your way."
8677,What is (a) Desi?
8678,"Ah I see, just unfamiliar with that term. Thanks"
8679,"When people talk about stem job prospects in glowing terms it’s just the tech and engineering parts. 

Have you looked into actuarial sciences? It’s a solid route many math majors end up taking."
8680,"Your first point brought tears to my eyes. There’s so much pressure, especially in entrepreneurial & creative endeavours to be 100%, no holds-barred, committed to X thing. Your grey thinking is a great comfort to this lost soul.💗"
8681,"Thanks for mentioning the last part. I thought me adding 2020 was a given to how horrible the market has been. Yeah it’s been dry out here. Typically in my industry a lot of people start off as runners or office work and work their way up, something I was willing to do myself. Pandemic put a stop to all of that. Even if I couldn’t get an in-person position, lots of networking events stopped and made it harder for me to build connections with others or find a mentor."
8682,"Keep at it! Rough times, yet nothing worthy is easy!"
8683,"Nah this was more than enough. I woke up with a 401k, health AND dental benefits, a penthouse overlooking the city, student and credit debt payed off, vacation home in Bali, skin clear, gas tank full and breakfast made. Thanks for the help! If it weren’t for you idk where I’d be."
8684,"why is it when people have issues there's that one guy that just says ""dO sTeM"" smh"
8685,"Going to grad school with funding instead; I’m sorted rn, I just wanted to point out that the job market this past year was objectively tough. Thank you for the concern though!"
8686,Lazy people work twice as hard. Go back to school for a real degree.
8687,[deleted]
8688,"For me full time job (that I didnt like) really drained energy out of me and with that my enthusiasm. Maybe same is true for you. I've interned two times so like 8 months, but the second one with a new team really sucked :( So I'm looking to not come back and look for a new job else where. Anyways, I guess my point is if there's something u dont like, maybe change it (your job, place u live, etc)? And starting new hobbies (guitar, skateboarding) during pendamic brought back some of the sparks in me. So maybe hobbies will help too."
8689,[deleted]
8690,"As the top comment mentioned you really need to set yourself your own goals in life now, you’re responsible for yourself. I was once in this moment not so long ago, I picked up a hobby which keeps me fit and happy and now I’m setting myself targets/goals. 

I also recommend getting a diary whether online or a physical one, write your thoughts/day. Best thing I started 2 years ago wish I started a long time ago - you can look at your growth, emotions and you’ll laugh smile and think wow! 

Time flies and I don’t want to look back thinking I wasted my 20s wishing I did XYZ when I’m in my 30s so set yourself goals and try reach for them. 

You’re feeling aren’t new, just remember there’s nothing new under the sun so you’re not the only one, Good luck OP! :)"
8691,"I feel this too. I’m 23. There’s a lot going right for me and now all that’s left is figuring out what I want to do. Volunteer, dance, travel? I don’t know. There’s no right or wrong any more. In fairness, a virus did make a legitimate obstacle, but maybe that means 2021 is the perfect year to set some goals."
8692,"Happy to share and yep I try to tell myself similar so glad it helped, best wishes to the start of this new year!! :)"
8693,"Find a partner and buy a house, would be the obvious next goal. Not obligatory of course, but I would go for that unless you have other ambitions."
8694,"a year and a half in a lab???? that's a shit load of experience. If you don't want to work in that field just talk up your experiences in the lab, like skills you learned that could be useful"
8695,"I’m in the same boat with a lack of experience, my job offer was cancelled due to Covid and all the other graduate programmes stopped accepting applications months ago. I’m using quarantine to take Google Digital Garage and LinkedIn Learning courses. I figure it’ll show discipline and initiative, especially since “how did you utilize your time in lockdown” is probably going to become a very popular interview question. It’s not perfect but it’s better than the scant CV I had before."
8696,2017 environmental science grad here. We definitely have flexible degrees but it can take some time to get a job that uses it. I had a lot of customer service experience coming out of college and I had to use that to get a job straight out. I've stayed private the entire time and I'm only in enviromental-adjacent sales right now. I don't love it but it's something and I'm constantly applying for government jobs.
8697,"I was thinking the same thing when I read this post. I’m graduating college this month and I have absolutely no experience whatsoever. And with Corona, what a time to be alive am I right?"
8698,"I don’t share your major but you have a lot more experience than me when you graduated. No internships, assistance, volunteering etc."
8699,You college should have a career services office that can coach you on this stuff. I’d start there.
8700,Yes I’m definitely learning that. Employers can see our degree as a catch-all for some jobs. My current position doesn’t necessarily our degree (physically cleaning up oil spills). But it’s a start...sigh
8701,"They don't know that. Sorting photos could be ""Categorized confidential records"" or ""Sorted confidential data"" etc. For a resume you have to talk yourself up as much as possible. Classify it as lab experience and just go to town. Any and every thing you did there, find a way to make it relevant experience. It will help you a lot. All i had on my resume was a delivery job, a work study job, and a year of undergraduate research experience but I was able to fill up a resume with it because of how much I talked everything up. Don't sell yourself short, make the most of what you've already done"
8702,[deleted]
8703,"I’ll be in your boat with an engineering degree in a year. I am also concerned.

Honestly if I don’t get in anywhere that is acceptable to me I’ll probably just start my own company. 

That somehow seems infinitely less stressful than filing out endless job applications for months at least."
8704,All I did was sort photos that’s why I thought it was kinda worthless
8705,"Lol if you think being self employed is going to be less stressful, you’re in for a very rude awakening."
8706,"I have about a year before I graduate, I honestly don’t know what i’m about to put."
8707,The universities I went to for undergrad and master both do (both state schools). I'd imagine they'd be very willing to help a recent graduate.
8708,Damn I never thought about it like that. Thank you!
8709,"Literally everything too, as much as you need to fill up the resume. Just be prepared to talk about it in an interview as well. A lot of people graduate with no experience at all, you're definitely a leg up on them. If you worked in a group ""team member experience"" if you made coffee for everyone ""helped facilitate an ideal working environment"" stuff like that. You're welcome though, hope it helps"
8710,So what did you end up putting on resumes when you applied for jobs?
8711,"You can put school projects, club involvement, stuff like that"
8712,"The university I went to doesn’t at all, probably need better advice than that"
8713,"I’ll assume that both of you did work toward trying to mend the relationship, so I won’t go opening old wounds.

My girl and I are planning on getting married, and we made these plans shortly after I graduated college, she wanted it sooner, but I said let’s wait until after I graduate. 

I think something different about us though, is that I met her in college, but she was nearly done and transferred to a different school, so we didn’t necessarily have that college experience together. 

Maybe the both of you just feel somewhat different toward each other now that the college experience is over? 

I would say just keep putting yourself out there, and just jump in slowly. Just get used to it, things always get better after you get acclimated. And right now, even though you graduated a while ago, maybe you’re still going through that transition? I could be wrong but I think many folks experience this. It’s just a different way of meeting people, it is much more intentional and in college it is forced. Let me know if I’m off the mark though"
8714,"So I went through a similar experience after graduating, we were planning on marriage but that was ultimately what broke us up. I ended up getting into another relationship pretty soon after the breakup, and I’ll say it’s very important to not do that.

A breakup this young is anything but a sentence to loneliness for the rest of your life. That said, I’ve never found a good relationship looking for one. Focus on improving yourself and trying new social activities, these will help boost your confidence and introduce you to folks outside of your circle.  Both of those things will lead to more romantic opportunities either in those activities or elsewhere.

Currently people are actually getting married less than they ever have, so with respect to the amount of available partners that’s a good thing too."
8715,Where the hell do you live where every girl you meet is married or engaged after college? That's a rarity here in Toronto. You have so much time..
8716,"I broke up with my partner while going back to school. The thought of it hurts the both of us, but I had to make the decision for all the right reasons that were affecting both of us. 

Here I am, 3 months later, single and doing okay. I've thrown myself into more hobbies, hangout with friends more, talk with my family, and just try to enjoy what's around me. Get out more and find a good social circle to be with. There are more fish out there, but the one you caught had to be let free. Just keep throwing yourself out into the fun side of the world and good things will come your way."
8717,IMO dating apps like Bumble or PoF would be a good start. Maybe avoid Tinder unless a hookup is something you're looking for. A lot of these single women you're having trouble finding are on these apps!
8718,"My relationship experience is extremely minimal but I’m 22, fresh out of college, and I see what you mean but in a slightly different way. Every guy around me is either taken or doesn’t want a relationship. Tried dating last month and somehow got hurt bc I’m a stupid softie and apparently everyone else just wants to hook up. 
The one relationship I did have was awful and so it has me falling into thinking traps that make me feel like I don’t deserve love. We broke up 2 years ago and I got over it, but lately I’ve been thinking about it again. Not about the person, but about the situation, because I “got back out there” and just got knocked down. 

The fact that you’ve acknowledged that you’re not ready for a relationship is significant. At the end of the day, I don’t think I am either, so I think my failures in the dating world were meant to be. I think you need to give yourself time to heal. Being more social in a platonic sense can help you build confidence to eventually get back out there. But it’s easier said than done, I know. But my point is, if you know you’re not ready, don’t pressure yourself into dating. You have just begun a new chapter of your life, and you may feel helpless because you were so used to seeing your future with your ex. But you have a future regardless, and you will find someone when you’re ready."
8719,"You’ll be ok. I had a similar situation happen and I felt a lot of the same things you’re feeling. It’s hard to have perspective right now because you’re in the middle of it, but it does get better. I hope you’re doing ok OP, and if you ever need to talk, there are a lot of resources you can reach out to!"
8720,I never had a girlfriend don’t worry
8721,"GF of a year whom I planned a wedding with broke up with me in March. Worked on myself heavy and now planning numerous dates with a lovely engineer. You’re young, I’m young— it’s not the end but rather a beginning. Keep pushing"
8722,"Broke up my last semester of grad school.  We'd been together about 4 years at that point.

I'm in my late 20s.

I was alone and hooked up for a bit before starting to date one of my best friends. Lots of people older and my same age are still childless and have never been married. I wouldn't worry too much."
8723,"My long-term boyfriend and I also broke up about a month ago. After the initial “I’m lonely and everything sucks” stage, I’ve mainly been in the “pissed off” stage, both with him and the situation that caused our breakup. I worry about finding someone else as well, especially since I’ll soon be in Japan for at least a year. But I’m starting to accept that I’m still so young and have SO much time and opportunity ahead of me. It sounds like it’s the same for you. So don’t get too discouraged. Like everyone else has been saying, just focus on things that make you happy and do your best to become a better version of yourself, so when you do meet your future wife, things will go better than they did with your ex."
8724,"Hey /u/ruebushcube, this is actually very common in my experience. My college girlfriend dumped me after three years. We were nearing graduation and I didn't really have a plan for after that, so I think her reasoning was, ""It was fun, but now we're going into real life."" 

My friend was one or two years ahead of me in college; we served in student government together. He had the same exact story: he and his girlfriend were inseparable for three or four years. He was president of student government and got to speak at graduation. But after college he wasn't president anymore. His girlfriend had enjoyed that social status and when it didn't continue, she tossed him aside. 

I had another friend who was VP of student government (she was actually my predecessor in the role and one of my mentors. Thanks Joanna!) who was in a multi-year relationship with a local bartender. I imagine that, for a poor college student, having a partner with a steady income (and maybe being able to get free drinks!) is very appealing. But then you graduate college, you're ready for career success, and your boyfriend doesn't have a degree, has a job tying him down in a city you may not want to live in.....so the relationship becomes untenable. 

I can think of two more examples from my personal life, but I think issues of compromise and success sometimes help end relationships. It can be tough when one person is successful (in their job or with friends or whatever) and the other is not. You see this in Hollywood often: two actors start dating, one becomes more successful than the other, it creates some friction and contributes to the end of things. I'm thinking of Chris Pratt and Anna Faris as a specific example."
8725,[deleted]
8726,"Welcome to the endgame, man.  You now have the freedom to do whatever you want.  It's one of the hardest parts of adapting to life after college.  I graduated in 2013 and have come a long way in the last 9 years.  My career is stable, but growing, life circumstances are better, I've improved my mental and physical health, enjoy some hobbies, etc.  It took me a few years to get to this point.  I'd recommend you just keep trying new things until you find something that sticks.  Starting with mental and physical health is always a good thing.  Meditation can be really powerful."
8727,"I went through the same thing, eventually you realize you have to set your own goals, your own ""victory conditions"" if you will.

For most of us, the goals of graduating school, getting a job, finding a place to live, etc were handed to us by default, and a lot of the time it takes a while to learn how to operate without being handed a goal.   


I'd recommend sitting down, writing down a few goals, and putting them on your fridge or mirror or something. Think about something you want, whether big or small, and make that your target. Give yourself something to chase."
8728,Im sorry you’re going through this too. Sometimes it’s good to know that at least you’re not alone.
8729,I feel this. I graduated May 2020 and it took me a good 6 months to find a job (and this job wasnt even in my field). I just started a job in my position last month. You'll get there. Just put in the effort and you will succeed.
8730,"thank you, i’ll give this a shot"
8731,"I also felt aimless once I started working. For me, it helped to have career goals. Working towards promotions, towards building certain skills and acquiring certain experience."
8732,"I feel you, terribly. I graduated in May 2020 into a job that I hated. I left it after a year and joined another remote working company, which is a lot better. But the endless routine of working, cooking , cleaning, sleeping, and doing it all over again has me all sorts of fucked up. I feel like I'm wasting away.   


I'm almost at the 2 year mark of being out of college and it scares me. I've spent most of those two years isolated due to COVID and struggling mentally.  My finances could be better, but I haven't struggled terribly -- so i guess that's at least one win.  


My partner (rightfully) tells me I need to set my own goals and run towards them. For some reason that answer's just not sticking to my brain well enough. Still trying.   


Sorry for not providing advice. I'm with you in solidarity though."
8733,"Before I had landed a job in a decent place, my purpose was to find such a job.   I was really worried about not having work life balance, and so I made it my goal to go to networking events, and ask lots of people about their companies, how they got into their fields, etc.

Its surprising how fast you go back to wondering what's your goal in life after you get a decent paying job though.   It wasn't long before I was back to the work, cook, clean, sleep cycle wondering why I was doing all this.

I read a book called Lost Connections by Johann Hari, which explores the curious observation that an enormous number of middle class Americans, those who've achieved the ""American Dream"", aka having a decent home, well paying job, enough money to afford, were in fact very unhappy.   In fact, so many people need to take antidepressants that the chemicals are even found in the water supply.

One of the reasons that really struck out to me was Community.   Most people in modern society no longer had a ""community"" they belonged to (now I understand why people used to go to church and why church used to be so important).   Humans evolved to live in tribes, not alone by themselves, and being a part of some community is likely extremely important to our well being.

Where can you find your community?  Well, I don't have an answer to that yet, its still something that I'm actively exploring.   I've tried some after work sports, some of which I quite enjoy (I never play sports actually, but once in awhile I meet people from sports that I really enjoy hanging out with, which makes the sports really fun for me and becomes something I look forward to every other day of the week).   It can be a bit painful trying to find the right group of people, especially if you're not extroverted, but when you do find people you like, it really makes it feel like it was all worth it :)"
8734,that makes sense. i’m unhappy in my current job and don’t really know what career I would like to take so it’s pretty stressful
8735,"it’s okay, thank you for the comment. sometimes it’s nice just to know you’re not alone. i’m kind of in the same boat. my current job actually pays pretty decently but i’m so miserable. I have no idea what direction I want to go in and feel like i’m just wasting away."

8737,What’s the job?
8738,"I don't want to come off the wrong way because your post made me feel a lot less alone in what I'm feeling, but at the same time... Fuck.  I'm 24 and hearing someone talk about feeling this way nearly a decade later gives me a really visceral sense of despair."
8739,"I'm 26 and have been out of school for almost 3 years now - I feel this every day. College is a really special time. You have all the freedom you craved in high school but none (or at least, less of) the responsibilities of true adulthood. I was in a fraternity that I cared deeply about so that makes me miss it even more.

Honestly, there's no good answer here. I think, to a degree, college will always be ""the glory days""."
8740,"I'm not sure if this helps you, but what I try to do when I get these kind of nostalgias/fantasies is for underlying themes and desires - that makes it sound more complicated than it is, but I think these kinds of feelings can represent needs going unfulfilled, and by analyzing them, we can give them names and start working on them to a more helpful degree. For example, I get really sad and nostalgic when I think about being 16 - I have a variety of memories from that age, but what I noticed is that I thought the most about my friend-group and the natural world around me. Thinking about it a little bit more, I realized you could boil these fantasies down more to a desire for community that I didn't realize I had, and a wish to spend more time in nature. That's over simplified, and what results you have can be much more subtle- wanting someone to mentor, realizing a cycle of trauma, a feeling of unfulfillment, or even digging up new facets of your identity are all things you could potentially get out of this, and feelings that I have grappled with as well.



Again, this is just what helps me, but always thinking about 'what is this telling me' - from fantasies, to emotional reactions, to even just emotions that feel out of place to me - has helped me move forward a bit, especially if I write them down and compare how I feel over time."
8741,"This is really normal and common. Being a college freshman is one of the most exciting times in a lot of people’s lives. Total freedom for the first time, less responsibilities than you’ll probably have for the rest of your life, the knowledge that you are about to begin a crazy adventure that is likely to be some of the most fun years of your life. And it felt totally okay then to not feel like a true adult. But it is comforting now being a “true adult” and knowing that pretty much nobody around me really feels like an adult either."
8742,"Not the OP but I figure the more advice the better, right?

For my own part, my advice would be to do everything you can.  Like, if you can afford to study abroad, do it.  Join clubs.  Experiment with relationships.  Talk to your professors.  Make the most out of the experience.  You will never again be able to explore as freely as you can in college.

After college, you'll have a job to go to at a certain time every day and the next eight or so hours will be conducted according to someone else's schedule doing the work *they* want you to do.  Most of your energy will go towards that, managing your money, planning meals, keeping your home clean, etc.  I don't mean to make adult life sound depressing, but like, it kinda can be.  That's why this subreddit exists.  It's not impossible to explore your passions as an ""adult"" but it's certainly much easier as a college student.  There's a real loss of freedom to be mourned once it's done.

So I say you should try your damnedest to get it all out of your system while you can.  You will never get another chance like it, and once it's done you will want to know you didn't miss any opportunities."
8743,"I’m in my third year of community college and I still feel that way to this day. After high school I saw all my friends live in the dorms, go to parties, meet new people, explore a new city while I’m living at home going to community college. 

To this day I still have major fomo of the college experience."
8744,"If it's any consolation, I know people that exerted themselves all through high school, and expressed feelings of regret because they felt like it was all bullshit.  I think no matter what people feel regret, and that's okay.  Every life path you choose closes off one other one, with benefits and losses."
8745,I'm going to be a college freshman soon what is your  advice/ biggest regrets?
8746,Think on the bright side you saved tens of thousands dollars while they went into severe debt.
8747,"It doesn’t have to. Take their experiences and use them to your advantage. I suffered really badly after school for 2 years, I’m 24 now. I had made a ton of really horrible decisions as well. Dirt poor and suffering from depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. I was able to turn it around with massive lifestyle changes. 

I went from a sedentary lifestyle to an active one. I got sober and learned to code, started my third business (first two failed hard), and am now finding a ton of success, financial stability, and can say I’m happy in my day to day life and really excited for the future. 

You can feel like this too, just embrace the harder things in life that you know will pay off: fitness & a healthy diet, mental health, discipline, having hobbies and interests, meaningful relationships, etc. 

Put yourself in those uncomfortable situations, take risks, travel. Do all the stuff you thought you’d be doing when you were 18. 

I wasted almost two years of my life and bounced back. We’re still young and have a ton of time."
8748,"Absolutely! Part of the way I think I am still feeling this way at 33 is because of a series of pretty bad choices I made in my early to mid 20s, that I ended up spending the latter half of my 20s and into my 30s simply trying to clean up. 

Nothing really and truly drastic like going to prison, severe addiction, etc. But some really bad financial decisions, destroyed my credit, dug myself into a huge hole of credit card debt, totaled a few cars, took on the care of far too animals than I could possibly house and feed, an unhealthy relationship that I clung too for far too long, unwise living situation, poor eating habits, poor sleeping habits, quit going to counseling, depression, etc. And dropped out of the university path I was on and stopped going to classes during my next to last semester. 

Just stuff. A lot of stuff. When you are spending most of your time trying desperately to undo as much of that as you can, and feeling overwhelmed by debt and without transportation, it's hard to move forward in ""adult life"" in any type of capacity. 

All of it was my fault and choices I made, and I bear that responsibility. My sisters are 30 and 25 and neither of them have felt as...inadequate....as I have, because they made a LOT better decisions."
8749,Oh god you put it into words
8750,"Hit the ground running with getting involved in stuff. Don't just stick with friends you made in orientation/neighbors in dorms or whatever - actively seek out activities and fun that interests you and pick friends that way. Don't move in with a significant other before you graduate. Don't let a significant other take up all your time. Prioritize getting a 4.0, because even if you don't think you'll go to grad school now, it's a HUGE leg up for scholarships and other funding if you do. Go to professor's office hours. Find at least one professor or professional mentor invested in your personal growth that isn't part of the mandatory mentor-mentee process at school. Seek to do an internship or SOMETHING cool every summer. Don't waste spring breaks - do stuff that you like, be they career opportunities or fun road trips. Work 10-20 hours a week to cut down the amount of debt you need to take out. Get your passport ASAP so that study abroad isn't a pain in the ass if you wanna do it. Don't stay in your room all the time. Don't develop a caffeine or alcohol addiction if you can help it. Also, don't burn bridges. Prioritize making them."
8751,"Thank you for posting this. I wish I saw something like this when I started high school. I’m a college freshman and screwed up high school socially and in other ways. So far I’m pretty satisfied with how it’s going. I’ve been much more outgoing which I had issues with before. Still working on improving, but i’ve made progress."
8752,Extremely valuable insight here. Very good thinking
8753,"A couple things play into it. First, between deciding your major and graduating is four to five years on average. The job market can change considerably in that time, especially if a major event happens. What was a profitable career could have no openings when you graduate. Next, many people are trying to find something that they’re passionate about so they choose majors they’re interested in, frequently fed lines about how there are plenty of ways to turn it into a career, which don’t always pan out. And lastly even if the overall job market is great for that major, it can vary widely from state to state or even city to city, and require moving which isn’t always possible for some people."
8754,"A lot of people go into a bachelors degree because what they want to do requires that first (doctor, lawyer, teacher, therapist, professor, scientist, occupational therapist, speech pathologist, chiropractor, etc) but that doesn't always pan out, either because you can't get in to those programs or you change your mind. Then you're left with this useless arts or science bachelors and have to choose to either pick a new career direction through more school or work your way up from the bottom somewhere. A lot of people understandably don't want to dump a bunch more money into another degree right away based on their previous experience, so they try out the work option. This usually means doing something unrelated to their degree because these degrees just aren't vocational. 

Alternatively, I've met a lot of people who seem to just be doing their major for the hell of it and not thinking at all about the future. But that is definitely not always the case."
8755,And that’s why 80% of students change their major at least once
8756,"Also, some people planned to go into something else. I know architecture majors who always planned on going into product design and politics majors who always planned on going into marketing. 

These people are working outside of their field but they're still success stories."
8757,"I'd wager this happens to a very high percentage of people.

Kind of makes sense when 17 year olds are told to choose what profession they're supposed to go into."
8758,This is the best answer I’ve ever heard for this question. I feel for the people with biology or English degrees who realized 3 years in that med/law school isn’t for them. That would be really shitty. At least you can always teach.
8759,Thats only the case if you want to be a manager at your closest retail store. Even fucking Masters degree holders are a dime a dozen.
8760,"For many people, they chose a degree based on a passion. This isn't necessarily wrong, but not all passions are profitable; Just about all of them *can* be, but when someone doesn't know how to market themselves, or had no plan on how they'd network to get a job after, it can be a problem.


Another part of the issue is location. I eventually want to go to school for a specific type of media production (I am presently a software developer). A degree for this type of media production is available all over the US(where I live) and the world, as well as tons of online degrees. But it would be pointless if I got this degree in New York when 70% of  jobs for this type of production are in California, and 30% are in Florida. Degrees and certifications are useless if your college doesn't become a ticket for you to network. I could totally learn the skills I want on my own, but those California and Florida schools have a WAY better career department than some school in rural Montana. Plenty of people think the degree is all they need to worry about when picking a college when really, location, networking opportunities and career placement percentages are ten times more important if you actually want to find success."
8761,"That’s true and the main reason why going to college at 18 is overrated, but 18 year olds aren’t completely stupid; they should be able to do basic research about their major’s earning prospects. I chose a career I hate but at least it pays well."
8762,"Yep. Have been told this since I was in primary school. Was never told I needed experience or connections or internships, so I graduated uni with nothing but a useless degree and every field I try and enter is oversaturated."
8763,[deleted]
8764,"Are you talking about the people who go do like 4 years and get an undergrad in History or like people who pick randomly because they have no clue what they want to do?

Degrees have a value where it leaves a social standing regardless. You went to school, got educated. People think of going to school as investing your money wisely even though school isn't a place to learn anymore its a place to pass in life and quickly earn a piece of paper that you learn has no meaning so you end up doing a masters in what you truly believe is your calling taking on all the fucking debt you can at some prestigious IVY school because financial aid already helped fund your undergrad. Its a circle of fuck over and America has made it into a proper blood sucking business to screw over every single American right out of high school.

If IVY schools had stock, people would invest all their money into those debt building institutes."
8765,"There's this amazing blind spot in collective reasoning that ignores how housing, education, and healthcare have all outstripped inflation over the last 30 years.  Worse, we really are in the middle of a technological revolution; productivity is through the roof.  Employers don't need a mailroom or dozens of accountants or secretaries or phone operators to take care of their basic business operations.  That's a piece of software now. They don't need to hire scores of recent grads for entry level office work; communication technology has advanced so far that they can outsource their information labor to anywhere in the world.  The internet in the 1990's was dial-up, computing power lacked, automated tasks were ineffective-- None of that is the case today and it deepens every point that you've brought up.

(just a rant, not actually disagreeing with anything you've written)"
8766,[deleted]
8767,"I mean, many of us were told to ""follow our passions."" Your passion may or may not lead to a lucrative career. Most people in high school have never even interned in the profession they're thinking of, let alone sitting at a conventional desk job. Instead, picking a degree typically is dictated by interest- teachers, guidance counselors, etc will tell students where to go based on their academic interests in high school, along with sometimes giving them a career aptitude test.. That mentality is fine if you come from relative affluence and we were still following the model many universities were founded on that you go to receive an education to become ""a better citizen"" and be instilled with humanist, enlightenment values. Needless to say though, we're living in 2020, not 1700. 

The other thing is the market has become oversaturated with degree holders. Really, we probably shouldn't have people going to schools with over 50% admissions rates (and even that is a bit generous). There's this perception that getting a degree automatically puts you on the path to a high paying job, which was true a few decades ago when you had about 20% of people at best getting a bachelors degree. The mentality has remained the same, even as more people get degrees. Now it's an expectation on the part of employers that you have a bachelors, even if the job doesn't require one. The new frontier for ""high paying stable careers"" now has become professional or (some) masters degrees.

And all this also isn't factoring in the social pressure in many middle to upper class communities. I remember in my high school, if you lived in a neighborhood with a lot of professionals, people looked down on families that weren't sending their kids to college. At that point it didn't matter what degree they were getting, the kid just needed a degree, and the better the school rank the more prestige was vaunted on them. That's how I have a friend who's family sunk all this money into a policy analysis degree from an Ivy League, only to sit on his parents' couch thereafter and make marginally more than a cashier, working in a hospital's human relations department. Similarly, I'm also friends with his cousin- sweet, intelligent girl. But she had the pressure just to get a degree with a good name school, so wound up at Wellesley for anthropology, and now is just floating around trying to figure out what to do with her life. The social attitudes tend to equalize now that we're out of school, and families look at where the child wound up working and how their professional life is playing out, but at that time where everyone is graduating high school, it's a big deal to people.

For what it's worth though, I completely understand your mentality. When I graduated I picked a professional degree route (architecture) that would culminate in licensure and reasonable pay/stability. And where I went to school was based on money- I picked the place with the best scholarship, not the highest ranking or where I loved the ""atmosphere"" or campus life or whatever amorphous term they're using to describe colleges in the brochures these days. Similar with my younger brother who's studying civil engineering currently- my dad said he needs a degree that leads to a profession, otherwise he wouldn't help him out to get it."
8768,"What a stupid question. 

I have a degree in what some people may deem a ‘mickey mouse subject’ but I ended up getting a job straight out of college and have a set career path. 

I know people with a Law degree who are working in a phone shop cos they can’t get training contracts/jobs. 

You don’t know what’s going to happen in the future."

8771,I got a goddamn engineering degree and I still can't get a job in my field. Except maybe the shitty factories I'm trying to get away from.
8772,"I don’t think this is the answer for most people, but I look at college as a valuable experience and not as a way to make more money. For me it was an opportunity to be educated and improve myself. I majored in theatre and was working in customer service and going to auditions before this all started so I guess I’m still working towards getting jobs in my major but my number one priority was enjoying myself and bettering myself as a person in college. Plus I only knew one older adult who ended up getting a job that related to their major!

(Also theatre gets a bad rap as a “no jobs” major...people don’t realize that lighting technicians, sound designers, set designers and builders, and costume designers all major in theatre as well as actors and directors)"
8773,wish i knew networking and location were key because now im finna graduate from a hbcu. i got good ed but not a lot of networking for jobs in my maj since a shitload of them are like grad school

8777,what is it btw
8778,"You’re absolutely right. There’s this narrative on reddit about how there is no “right” thing to study or whatever. In reality, people who can’t do anything after college don’t have anyone else to blame but themselves. It sounds brutal, but it’s true

I’m saying this as a new graduate who is figuring out r/lifeafterschool (the narrative really exists in that sub)"
8779,Which degree out of curiosity?
8780,"Shoot me a message if you need help with networking. I train people on how to do that to get jobs. I won't charge or anything of course.


An HBCU typically has *very* good networking, especially if you're a person of color yourself. It's likely that you aren't tapping into the right channels. My best friend goes to one (Howard) and has lots of opportunities."

8783,"My fear right now is not being able to progress from here. Like okay i'm done with college, now what? I am not exactly great at something, i lack the passion and ability. So finding something that i can progress in is going to be so hard."
8784,"My biggest struggle for a long time was finding a job. Not even a job that would use my degree, just _a_ job. I finally got a job about two weeks ago, so now I’m really happy and excited and will probably appreciate it on a whole new level. I’m thankful that it’s a job I actually wanted, although it does not use my degree. 

Other than that, my social life. I barely had friends in college, and the friends that I do have either live across the country in my home town, or just don’t ever want to hang out. I’m very lonely and it really sinks in when my dad comes to visit me every few weeks, because until he comes back, I always forget what it’s like to even be around people. Yeah I’m around people when I run errands, etc, but I barely engage with those people. I have crippling social anxiety. That and my depression kept me from socializing practically at all during college. But so far at my job, I’ve done a good job of talking to people and not just isolating myself and feeling like an awkward POS like I always have. So this job is already helping in that department, which is great. 

My mental health has been a lot better since graduating. Although I still have depression and take medication for that and anxiety, finishing school just made me feel like a real person for the first time in a long time, if that makes sense. I do have a lot of anxiety about the future, because it’s so unknown at this point. I need to start seeing a therapist again because I don’t really have anyone to talk to when I have bad days. It’s just been hard to make so many phone calls and not even get close to booking an appointment because the info on my insurance portal is inaccurate and part of the reason why I never get responses."
8785,Transitioning from college student to adulthood.  It's really tough finding your career and having to pay for everything now.  I'm just worried that life doesn't get better and it's just a struggle. There's got to be more than scraping by to pay bills.

8787,"Hey good for you for looking to get help. It can be hard and just like every caregiver, the first therapist you try might not be right for you. You deserve a therapist that you can feel at ease around, but that doesn’t happen in one session."
8788,"Mental health. It scares me to imagine that the 9 to 5 is my future, and it's lead to a lot of anxiety. Also, self care. Self Care is HARD outside of the support system of a University. I don't have friends next door, 2 PM naps when I don't feel good...you just have to power through, especially if you leave your town after graduation.

I loved college and was excited for the ""real"" world, but leaving the confines of a mental health and self care support system has been so challenging."
8789,"Honestly? I only feel fulfilled when I’m in school; I was one of those psychotic over-achiever kids, and my whole self worth is essentially wrapped up in what scholarships I earn, what grades I get, etc. I’m paying about $30k to head to grad school next year, even though the degree likely won’t earn me a job, just because I can’t deal with the lack of purpose anymore. 

I also miss how easy it was to make friends in college. I’m just a sad sack without school."
8790,"Right now, finding a job after graduation and not being around friends. When I ask for career advice, I get very little.  


It's adjusting to being responsible for moving everything forward in my life from now on. Making friends will require a lot more effort on my part, as well as maintaining friendships."
8791,The fact that you desire to progress from here is a sign of hope. Don’t give up. You may have to kiss a few frogs before you find what really gets you fired up for life.
8792,"Lol meet ups always have people who are so much older. It’s a struggle! I’m like that too...I miss the college life of going out and finding people who are a constant. It was never a question of what we were doing on a weekend. Everyone was on the same page. 

I’ve learned to kinda accept things won’t be like that anymore, and slowly but surely I’ve made new friends (I moved states too). It still gets to me that my friends here aren’t as close or as fun as my friends back home, but that’s part of growing up. 

Check and see if your area has any fun leagues or things other than meet ups. I play kickball and as a part of our league, everyone goes to a bar and plays flip cup. I’ve met friends that way and it makes me feel like the old days again, even if it’s just once a week"

8797,"Social life. Everyone spread out after uni, leaving me in a situation where not many people were around. Couple that with financially struggling and it's a tough combination.
I'm finding being financially better off helps, as it just costs money to be social. But also it's something i put a lot of effort into - you've got to go out yourself, have hobbies/activities that are digital, and make plans to see your friends yourself etc.   

It's tough and I'm still learning"

I also don’t have friends or any social interaction outside of seeing my family at home. And the family at home just seems to be disappointed in me. I try to stay out if their way and be invisible but then thats seen as me being more reclusive and they have a problem with it and look more disappointed. I just don’t know what to do."

Probably making myself more interesting too haha. I’d like more friends.

Overall I’d say the work life balance is pretty great, but I understand impostor syndrome and social pressures when other people are working longer and you aren’t. If they’re working those hours because they want to, it’s good to note that.

8824,"I just want to say to the both of y’all, have fun, be courageous, contribute to all the discourse all you can, and the fun in your studies will be met with that with your peers and professors in that regards. I absolutely miss undergrad as a psych student! Congratulations to y’all both! :-)"
8825,"Thank you! I’m looking forward to it. Psych undergrad was awesome and I enjoyed it a lot, and I do like working in the field so I hope I grad school will be good too. I really appreciate your kind words, friend <3"
8826,"You do tho…. 

I study for certifications and am working outside of a strict schedule"
8827,"Untrue, if you're trying to move industries or get a promotion or learn a new hobby you have to learn, hence studying. You have to pass tests to get certifications. Unfortunately the schooling doesn't stop."
8828,">	Within a few days of me redoing my portfolio, I got a message from a recruiter. And another one. And another one. I did not have to apply anywhere, and got 4 interviews within the first week.

This is exactly the thing to do. Don’t convince yourself that you’re “stuck.” I think your story is going to be very enlightening for a lot of the people who come to this sub. You were clearly worth more than you were being valued. 

I’d like to add a similar story for the (hopeful) benefit of others as well:

A friend of mine also wasn’t satisfied with the wage she was being paid, but she liked working where she was. There were certain perks, such as a flexible schedule, that would be hard to find at alternatives. Still, she applied for another job and got an offer. However, before accepting the offer, she went to her current employer and said something along the lines of, “I recently got another job offer, but I really like working here. If you can match what I’m being offered, I’d like to stay.”

She got her raise. 

Don’t be afraid to climb the ladder. Often, all you stand to lose is some time."
8829,"Yeah, it was pretty bittersweet to leave for that reason, but it also gave me more leverage in my job search!"
8830,"I am a Motion Graphic Designer! I used wix.com to make my portfolio. I am 24, almost 25."
8831,Love on reddit when you are very blatant about your gender and people still misgender you LOL
8832,Her*
8833,Wait you’re right!!! I meant the person above :) thanks for correcting them!
8834,i bet your friends cant eat ass like u do tho
8835,"I did that at my job, but they simply could not offer anything close to what the new job offer was. I was expecting to get an offer around 80k, in fact that was what i asked for at the new place, and was planning to just use that as leverage at my current job. but they went above and beyond and offered me 120k. And my job could not match that. My ex coworkers are using this as a bargaining chip though to get raises to around 90k at my las job."
8836,I was 22! I graduated in 2019.
8837,wow. you are doing much better than me. you just got yourself a good paying job. Meanwhile me 23 still in community college working toward my IT transfer degree when all my friends at age 23 graduated. I feel like a failure and loser wdf.
8838,what do you do? What service do you use to redo your portfolio or how do you do it? And how old are u now?
8839,Thank you!
8840,"Oh okay

U graduated out of college at age 21?!"
8841,Fuck.
8842,I wish recruiters cared about my resume lmao. I’m not in the right industry to have that
8843,"For sure. Even I believed I would be earning peanuts as an art major in the art industry. For anyone else, don't let this stop you from expecting more pay! When I was searching for jobs I wouldve been more than happy with 50k to start but was lucky enough to find a place that started me at 70k even though it was the average for my role!"
8844,Way to go baby! Gives me hope! 13/hr is my highest pay! I'll stop selling myself short

8846,"Sounds like they are focused on setting themselves up for the future and you aren’t. I obviously don’t know your situation, but I’m not sure how you can afford to live, and on top of that do things on a non full time minimum wage job. Maybe you have financial freedom to fall back on and they do not, and want to make sure they can afford life in 10-15 years"
8847,"Full time work will do that you, unfortunately."
8848,"To be fair, a lot of people in their late twenties through mid-thirties right now are dealing with a lot of mental health problems that make it difficult to do anything outside of what gets your rent paid. It's how a lot of people end up with Netflix as a hobby, watching TV is the hobby of least resistance so it doesn't need a lot of mental energy to plan or perform."
8849,"It’s not harsh at all! We are living different lives now and, like you said, that’s a part of life. It just sucks that they seem to dedicate all of their available energy to their jobs. My job (as hard as it is physically) is something I can leave behind at the end of the day. My friends regularly answer emails and calls outside of work. I think this is part of the reason behind their reluctance to meet up outside of work. I have one friend who is already talking about marriage and owning a house and it just freaks me out a bit. We’re the same age (22) and yet I feel so immature compared to her. I could cope with seeing them less (I’ve lived a fairly transient life so I am used to physical distance) but it just feels as if we have nothing in common at all now. It feels as if everyone else somehow got all these new responsibilities overnight and as if our values don’t align anymore. No one wants to meet on the weekends for a hike or for a day trip somewhere and it just suddenly feels very lonely. 

Unfortunately, my work schedule means that I work long, unpredictable shifts. Some days, I start work at 7am and finish around 3-4:30pm. Other days, I start work at 2pm and finish around 8-9:30pm. That makes it hard to join a club or group with a set schedule. The “2 on-2 off” pattern also makes it hard to join anything with a set time. Then, there’s the nature of the job itself. I am a covid tester. A lot of people tend to treat me as if I have the plague, even though I work in full PPE and shower the second I get home. I find the job fulfilling, but it’s not the best for my social life. The rec league suggestion is still a good one (maybe I could join every second week or every other meeting?) and I’ll absolutely look into it. I’ll just have to be flexible about my social life going forward."
8850,Just wanted to let you know that as a 23f I can totally relate. 3/4 of my closest long term girlfriends are immersed in the having kids and getting married phase of life. We're all under 24. The reality is that women get lost in both motherhood and relationships moreso than men. Now add budding careers into that for your situation. I feel like your post is super valid and you should consider making an effort to meet more likeminded people.
8851,"I wish it was just you, but unfortunately, it's pretty much universal among people who aren't rich. They just stop caring about having fun and are just too bitter to do well, anything other than what is needed to get by in life. It's no wonder college is the best years of life. Because after college, the fun stops and there is no way to attain it ever again."
8852,"From the sounds of it, I would guess I am a couple years younger than you, but i have had these things coming up in my life as well. It's scary to think that life could be coming to a halt or that my entire way of life will change overnight. In regards to friends, it can be hard to stay connected to friends when they have their own life to worry about. But at the same time, people make time for the things they care about. Maybe you just need to make more friends who you have more in common w in terms of you scheduling or your career in general? Just try and remember that mental health is a universal struggle dog. Everyone goes thru rough times, and the silver lining is that when it all starts to make sense and feel a little better it will have been worth it."
8853,"Feeling this every single day tbh. I work almost every single day. The thing is, Im the one thats been ignoring my friends. Im secluding myself. Always giving reason for not being there or not coming over. I lost track of all the fun things that we all used to do as well..."
8854,"This is such a weird judgment to pass because it’s just so not universally true?

People after college don’t “stop caring” about having fun. They likely have more responsibilities that take up their time and energy. They have to be more selective about what fun things they do with their free time. And college definitely is not “the best years of life” for many people. If anything, the freedom and options to take your life in more directions post-college is more appealing to lots of people than college itself."
8855,"I live at home with my parents for now and I have a fairly significant amount of savings, partially thanks to the time I spent either depressed on the couch or hiding in my room during covid lockdowns. The other friends I mentioned all rent apartments in the city. I contribute some of my wages towards things like household bills and grocery expenses, but, as much as I’m loathe to admit it, my “secret” when it comes to finances is that I’m not spending half my pay check on rent anymore. The downside to this is that I struggled to find a graduate job after moving back in with them, since they live in an isolated suburb and I would struggle to commute now that offices are starting to open up again. As for my other expenses: I own a bike and use that to travel to work. That means that I don’t pay for a gym membership and my travel expenses are very minimal. The stuff I’m interested in mostly revolves around the outdoors, since I love swimming, hiking and hill walking. You don’t need to pay for any of that. I also love art and history, which is great because art galleries and museums are also free. I do like to splurge on cinema tickets, but that’s still a fairly small expense since most cinemas still aren’t fully open and I’ve not had many chances to go yet. I like drinking as much as the next person, but like I said, I just feel there’s more to life than sitting in the pub after work for the rest of my days. The stuff I suggest is usually stuff like hiking or museum and art gallery trips. Sometimes I’ll suggest coffee or a movie, but I’m not really interested in splurging on fancy food and cocktails. That’s how I “survive” on low savings."
8856,"I completely agree. I’m actually a lesbian so the whole “2.5 kids, a big family home and a huge traditional wedding” kind of life will just never, ever be a part of my life. Even if I wasn’t a lesbian, I don’t want children and I have no desire to be in a serious, long term monogamous relationship. I absolutely feel my mother lost her soul a bit when I was born. It’s not something that people like to talk about, but motherhood is honestly something that negatively impacts a lot of women. It’s just refreshing to hear that I’m not alone in that belief."
8857,"I’m graduating uni this summer had a part time job throughout uni. I still work at the same one. I think i was never the party type. But I get what you mean people are just busy adulting.

Once you graduate, people start focusing on becoming financial stable. They are thinking about buying a house and trying to make as much money as they can. All the fun kind of just goes out the window. 

I’m not looking for a job until January, so I’m mostly gonna play games, try out new hobbies and see what I like doing."
8858,"I just find many of my former classmates with their SOs and a kid while am still running around. Some just upped and went to live in different counties because that's where they got their break. It's not about being boring it's just that they have different priorities & responsibilities. People often go by what they think the next stage should be. It doesn't work out perfectly for most like me but you got to figure it out.

The people you hang out with after Uni will change just like the grade & high school ones did. Find other mates through clubs & groups you can join as someone above suggested. You can always find people in the same stage as you to share these moments then move on when you get to another phase."
8859,"LOL.  There is no real ""freedom"" after college unless you're rich."
8860,Meetup is a good place to meet people. It’s how I met some nice people to play board games with.
8861,"Having so many responsibilities after college is indeed the main reason why people stop caring about having fun. If High school or college isn't the best years of life, then that person lived a very, very sad life, completely devoid of fun, friendships, and/or chances with beautiful women, none of which are possible after college for the non-rich man. Post-college non-rich people are too bitter to even care about having fun, making friendships, or finding romance, and when they do find romance after college, it's devoid of happiness, excitement, and/or fun. For the non-rich, there is no freedom after college. All that exists is a life of misery."
8862,"Maybe it was just me, but I had many more responsibilities and felt a lot more stress/pressure when I was in school because I was doing an engineering degree, on top of working in a research lab outside class. There was something due at least every other day and it was 
 irritating to be placed with slackers on group projects. I also had to worry about applying to internships during the summer. Now that I am working and have disposable income, I feel that I indeed have a lot more freedom, and I am not rich by any means - I make a solidly middle-class income in a city with one of the highest costs of living. But now my work deadlines are much more spread out than they were in school, and my colleagues are all highly competent and pleasant to work with. Also, having learned the basic functions of my job, I can “coast” at work on most days without needing to expend too much effort or brainpower. I have plenty of free time on weekends and went traveling to Vegas just last week. My point is that while what you wrote may be true for some, it is by no means universal and the exceptions are definitely not just limited to rich people."
8863,"Building on this, you don’t need to find what you want to do for the rest of your life. It’s just as helpful to find what you don’t want to do for the rest of your life. 

And if anything I’d try and find a skill that complements your major in college. For example, I major in political science. Many social sciences pair really well with quantitative data analysis skills. So something that I have been trying to learn are statistics programs like R and STATA. 

I am heavily involved in policy work as well, so my suggestion may be biased, but see if you can get on any advocacy groups or something that’s related to issues you care about. Doing biology? Maybe join a conservation group. Engineering? You could probably find some kind of union or something that does do lobbying. It’s a great way to make connections and diversify your interests/background"
8864,">Do you guys have things you would have liked to know at 19 because right now I feel very lost i don't have any things passionate about and I'm just afraid I'm going to look back at this time and I think I just wasted a hole year

Most people either don't know what the fuck they are doing or they do what others tell them to do. At 19, if you don't know what you want to do, learn how to be an independent person. Get a job, learn how to budget, how to live on your own, how to plan your retirement, how to pay taxes, et cetera. 

When you start doing that, believe me, you'll get a lot more information telling you what you want to do or definitely **do not** want to do. Otherwise, if you're really anxious about ""not wasting"" years of your life, then listen to your parents. Go do something boring like an accounting degree, or business admin, or something that'll help you get a job so you have a fallback plan. A ""gap year"" can be a gap quarter and you can go to community college with a plan to transfer to a university. No matter what, keep moving forward and do something. Inactivity is a killer in today's world."
8865,"You are 19. Relax and enjoy it. 

But if you are really looking to do something to prepare for a professional career. Develop skills. Its never too early to start. I am not sure what careers you are interested in but business is always a safe bet in my opinion."
8866,"I wish I took a year off when I was 19. It would have helped me way if figure what to do with my life. I am 24 and struggling with life. You made a smart move to take a gap year. I would suggest in your free time to research career fields that interest you and to shadow someone who works in the field. This is also a good time to work on skills such as time management and etc. good luck 🍀, I hope my advice helps you"
8867, Thank you I will start looking into it
8868,I’m saving this post because OP is eerily similar to my situation.
8869,"What I wish I would have done at your age:

* Move out and live on my own (or with a roommate).  I didn't learn independence until I graduated college and I wasn't prepared for it.
* Try as many new things as possible.  All I did was play video games for 20 years and when I finally woke up from that video game coma, I realized how little life I had lived.  Grow plants, visit new places, research new topics, make something, join clubs, play sports.  Keep trying things.  Everyone is TERRIBLE at predicting what will make them happy.  You can only figure out from experimentation.
* Improve your physical and mental health.  You're young, so you can live with poor health choices--your body will bounce back.  Or maybe you've been living with poor health choices for so long you don't even realize how miserable you are.  Clean up your diet and start exercising.  No sugar, going for walks, etc.
* Also, be careful about two big things that can derail your life:  kids and debt.  Wrap it up every time and be VERY cautious about credit card debt, student loan debt, and car loans.  Those things can bury you.  It's *easy* to avoid most debt, but it's *hard* to boost your income.  This will keep your options open and you'll be more flexible.  ""Debt is slavery and slaves don't have choices""

Be smart, man."

8872,"> I feel very lost i don't have any things passionate about and I'm just afraid I'm going to look back at this time and I think I just wasted a hole year

If possible, you could look into attending your local community college and starting some intro-level classes. At the very least it will  help keep you busy and you can explore your interests at a low cost.

From there, you can figure out if going further in your education is something you want to do right now, or you could decide that doing something in the trades might be more worthwhile. Certification programs for trades are often taught at CCs as well, so it might be worth exploring. 

You're at a stage in your life where you can go in any direction you want. Keep an open mind and good luck!"
8873,"Read as much as you can, preferably non-fiction, but quality fiction works too.  Anything that gets your mind spinning and thinking and ideas flowing.  Get your mind going and you’ll start figuring out what you want to do, and how to live with a purpose."
8874,"I am 19, not going to college because of debt and my dream school shut down. 
After high school, when I was 18, I bicycled from Pennsylvania to Florida over 5 months with breaks for holidays going home returning where I left off. I HIGHLY recommend traveling. Go and explore, see the country and world. Be free while you can. You won’t have these opportunities in the next few decades if you settle. 

Now I am gardening and working everyday dishwashing saving money for land and more travel in two years. Growing food is one of hobbies which I’m extremely good at, and it’s usefull af, especially with r/collapse, 
This gives me a lot of my will to live. I’m expanding my gardens, experimenting, observing, and if you find a thing to do that you like it will keep you distracted from lifes pain"
8875,"Go hike the Appalachian trail, or backpack somewhere far away, drive around the country and boondock everywhere. The removal of locql social and environmental influences let's you focus on yourself and what makes you happy.

And you'll want to relocate early in life, it just gets harder the older you get and the more community ties you end up with."
8876,"My manager didn’t complete her undergrad until she was 30. She already had two kids at this point. She got her masters while her third kid was an infant in her lap. 

My wife’s sister stayed home after high school and worked two jobs at Best Buy and a small restaurant. She’s 22 now and owns a house. 

My wife became unexpectedly pregnant this year so she was unable to finish her undergrad in nursing in 4 years. She’s aiming to complete it after the baby is born. 

My sister dropped out of school after 3.5 years. She still hasn’t completed her undergrad but she works now as a wedding venue coordinator and sales person making more than all of her friends who competed their degrees.

Life’s not a race. All of my jobs in between school taught me a lot about people, the workplace, and what I wanted to do in life. Ultimately, do what makes you happy, not what makes you more money. The money will sort itself out if your wise with your paychecks (see r/ynab).Life’s too short to be worrying."

8889,I started my first job in February after graduating in December and in the same boat :( I honestly miss school.
8890,The semi recent Boeing crashes and safety stuff.
8891,"9-5 honestly sucks after the flexibility and diversity of a college schedule. I’m in the same boat now- I graduated a year ago and am in my second full time job since (lasted 6 months at the first and found one with a big pay bump) but the extra cash isn’t feeling worth it anymore. I’ve worked years to get to where I am in my field, I’ve finally made it... and the 9-5 has made me fall out of love with the career- to the point where I’m looking into taking a pay cut for a 29 hour a week job, and starting a side hustle. If the grind gets to you too much, after getting at least 6 months to 1 year experience look into more flexible jobs, even if it’s like 3 days in the office and 2 from home. Also, create a manageable routine that incorporates you time. Wake up and do a work out, cook a good dinner for yourself at least 4 times a week, (when quarantine is over) hang out with friends or family at least one night a week after work, and have a lazy binge watch tv or gaming night at least one night after work a week too. You’ve got this. It’s gonna be sucky for awhile, until it isn’t."
8892,Honestly I’m in the same boat as you. Been working at my office job since March and I definitely miss school. I miss the schedule of school and just being able to be spontaneous with friends. I like making money but definitely miss school.

8897,"I felt the exact way when I graduated two years ago. I eventually got diagnosed with anxiety and depression but it’s gotten better. 

The company understands that you’re brand new and just out of school! WFH does make it more challenging but you’ll be that much better and energetic when you’ll be able to go back in the office. 

My main advice for you is that once you log off physically, also log off mentally. Go workout, find a hobby or try something new but be consistent. Before COVID I went straight to the gym after work everyday and I’ve been working out at home since. Your career doesn’t have to be your life so you can finally try the things you’ve wanted to but didn’t have time to in school. 

The world is your oyster and you are not alone in feeling inadequate at your new job. You are worthy of your job and you’re worthy of happiness! Message me if you ever need to!"
8898,"Thank you!
Yeah, that's a good point. Being willing to learn is super important at new stages of your life, because there's so much you need to know out the gate. That's really good advice, I'll keep that in mind going forward (maybe write it on a sticky note and put it on my computer?) 
Yeah ice suffered from imposter syndrome most of my life. But I have so many supporting friends that inspire me to do better. And reading all these awesome comments has really helped too :)"
8899,"That's...actually really motivating. Thanks! 
And I'm sure your dad works hard too :)"
8900,"Dude as a software dev myself, imposter syndrome is probably the first thing anyone in tech feels. It gets better with time. I would say try to get to know your coworkers more and ALWAYS ask for help. This is the adult world now. People won’t be watching your back anymore so you need to ask questions. You don’t want something to fail and then it be because you didn’t know how to do something and you didn’t ask.

As for the transition from college to work, it’s tough. In my opinion, college doesn’t really help people transition from school life to real life. College is just a bubble where people can hang out for 4 years and then decide what they want to do. Unless you’re in the 10% of students that actually followed a track that you made before you came to school.

Life is hard outside of school. You don’t have that cushion of similarly aged peers around you anymore. 

I’m not sure if you’re an athlete, but I make sure to exercise at least an hour a day. I went from lazy guy who had no energy to do anything to working out everyday and I still feel energized by the end now. It’s incredible what regular exercise can do

All the best"
8901,"Agreed. The money doesn't seem worth it when losing all that time with friends
Honestly that's why I think so many people our age are dating, cause they need that social intervatopm and someone to fill up their free time"
8902,"That is exactly me! The dates and everything.
Yeah, it's such a fast change, and theres nothing really you can do about it. :(
Before covid I was starting to get used to hobbies outside of work that felt lile college clubs/ hanging out, and that was really nice. Things lile taking a dance class, going rock climbing, or other exercisy/group activities. Plus friends from college stay with you forever"
8903,"Graduated December 2018 and started my job February 2019, and I've been feeling the same way as you for basically a year now. At long last, I submitted my resignation notice last week - I'm starting my masters in the fall."
8904,Yes I miss that too! I miss making my own schedule- was only in class for a couple of hours. The rest of the day was for studying or hanging out with friends. I forgot how exhausting doing stuff for 8 hours was.
8905,"Yup! Just gotta make it look like I'm working and who knows maybe I'll accidentally be productive 
Thanks!"
8906,Sounds like a case of imposter syndrome. You’ve got this!!!
8907,"Yeah its defintley felt like the money isnt worth it at times
I have been taking more time to do things I want to do. Cooking, reading, chatting with friends. Watching some TV and going outside. I'm not the best at sticking to routines but making sure I have time to myself to do what I want with, and having things to fill that time really boosts my mood.
Thank you for the advice and the upbeat outlook :)"
8908,Oh yeah I agree. I would rather be broke in college hanging out with friends and having all that free time than making money. Sure having money means I can buy stuff but I would rather have free time and time with friends instead.
8909,"I had the same experience, and so have my friends. It’s such a big shift and it seems like you’ll never get used to it. And then one day you just do.

It’s weird and it makes no sense, but it just happens. It took my about 5 months FYI. 

The feeling comes up again everyone once in a while. Last time it came up, I ended up pretending I was sick because I had been dreading going to work each day as ‘work was taking my life away’. Let me tell you, one day of that and I was like, “this is not what I thought it would be, I would much rather be making money”. 

We’ll see if it lasts. 

As a final thought, I saw someone say they took anti-depressants which helped them get back on track. I’m glad they got the help they needed, but just know that not everyone is like that. 

I felt a little bit like I was in an existential crisis after I graduated as I realized this would be the next few decades of my life, but I never had to take any drugs to help me cope. It’s completely normal to be freaked out at first. It passes and life is way better now than it ever was when I wasn’t working full time I have a lot of free time in the evenings and weekends, and 7 hours a day actually isn’t that long when you think about it."

I totally needed to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to remember that pe kopp please know you're a noob at the job when everything is so fast paced. But you're right
I've actually been trying to get better at signing off. Closing my computer after a certain time and not touching it again until tomorrow, trying to get that work-life balance. It helps!
Thank you again for the kind words and putting a smile on this guy's face :)

8914,"Ugh this is so true. It's so hard to ask for help, but you're right that I need to put myself out there, especially because others arent there to help. You are the only person you can really hold accountable, and people won't help unless you ask
Exercise does help. It's hard with quarantine, but I'm trying to keep a routine and at least go outside often. 
Thank you for the advice! I'll try and stick to it"

Its nice to know that everyone still struggles with it sometimes. Were all human. 
Yeah, having evenings free is really nice. And not working on the weekend is suuper sick. Just getting my body and mind used to that change is tough.

I didn't initially go to med school to help people (that would have kept me motivated), I was just interested in the science. So if you want to help people and see it as your purpose in life you might regret it. The older I get the more I realize I don't really care about people in general, I might be a bit of a psycho or just self-aware. I just wanna do something cool, have some adventure, get laid a lot and then start a family.

You can still do those things that you have always wanted to do and it would be great if your partner also supports you with them too.

8937,">Trying to plan when you will or will not have a relationship is silly

I agree with you in principle, but the truth is most individuals in their twenties will be dating and settling with a partner during this period of their lives. A book I read recently (The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter by Meg Jay) makes the argument that people in their twenties should prioritize serious dating in their twenties so they can find the right person by their thirties. While I don't think this necessarily needs to always be the case, I do believe that by actively making a concerted effort to find a compatible partner during the prime years, you have a far greater chance of finding the right kind of love than by waiting for it to surprise you. Maybe some folks find love more naturally than me in this regard, but the only times I've found meaningful relationships in my past were when I took dating seriously and consistently put myself out there.

>There is also a difference between dating and a serious relationship. No reason you can’t do either when traveling, volunteering etc

This is true, however I am in the stage of my life where I want to be serious about finding a significant other rather than just dating casually. I certainly would try to date if I could while traveling, but the chances of me being able to maintain such a relationship when I return home to the US are slim, and I do not want to deal with the logistics of long distance.

>TLDR; you can have it all!!

Thank you, and I hope so. For us both! :)"

8939,"Your book is wrong. Do not just trust anyone’s “evidence” in a book unless it is peer reviewed academic work. Which means most of “self-help” books are likely just ideas to think about, and nothing more. They cannot give you the answers they promise. The other advice given by people here is also not that useful for you it seems. 

I think all anyone needs to do is: *date.* just do it, any way you can (online/through friends/whatever). Try and keep the dating numbers up, go on as many as you can, and you will find someone through this “brute force” method. I found my first and current partner at 28 this way. I wouldn’t have cared if I was 30 when I tried either. It just *doesnt matter* whether you’re in your “prime years” or not. You have to find someone and can’t go back in time, right? So then just *go looking for someone and go on dates.* People can and should vent, but anyone constantly complaining that they’re too old/can’t find someone, is wasting their time, because that takes away time from actively searching. I guarantee you all your psychological introspection and amateur sociological reasoning isn’t going to get you the answer you seek. “Society is like X”, “I can’t find someone because of Y” may or may not be true, but as someone in the thick of it, you do not have the tools or time to sort any of it out. Just go looking when you’re ready."

8943,You’re not alone in feeling this way. I struggle with the same thing too
8944,"I definitely feel the same. But traveling and being with people you want, when you want is a freedom you should enjoy while you can. Too many people can get absorbed in the “what’s next” benchmark like graduating college, getting a job, getting married etc. But it’s super important to do what you want. Have fun with your future job and your future money before it becomes a shared asset. But also don’t be shy from meeting new people and if things happen naturally welcome it!"
8945,I mean you could always be 30+ and date someone in their 20s…

8948,"It's ridiculous to not pursue your dreams because of something than might or might not happen. You might meet your SO on your travels, at work, when you volunteer. Sure, statistically you'll have bigger chances to settle down if you stay in one place and do serial dating. But, you'll also be missing out on a lot of things + you might still not find someone compatible. Life is full of coincidences. And the 20's are not your ""prime years"". Adult life is literally just beginning and that is a very toxic mindset. What you should focus on is discovering yourself, polishing your character and making memories that will last you a life-time, so that when you meet your SO you'll be a well rounded and an accomplished person  who won't be slowly eaten up by the thought that they are missing out on life."
8949,"I've always been a more introverted type so I never really stood out to girls right off the bat, until they got to know me a bit more.

Lol. I think like the other poster said it has something to do with confidence."
8950,definitely a possibility! though personally I think I would prefer to date someone closer to my age due to the similarity in maturity and life experience
8951,"That's the tradeoff for living adventurously. You sacrifice security for freedom. If you're OK with being single in your 30s/40s then that's the life for you. But know that the good partners get taken in your 20s and that your 30s/40s can be spent traveling with them

Honestly you should focus on your education and career, your youth will last 10 years but your adulthood will last 50"
8952,"I think you're smart to consider how to balance your time and plan for what you really want. You're suggesting traveling for a couple of years, then starting your career from scratch in your late 20s. You would be able to look for a relationship while building your career. That would give you about 10 years in which to marry and have kids before the biological clock kicks in in your late 30s. (Every pregnancy over age 35 is considered ""high risk"", although I think it really only gets impossible around 45.)

If you skip traveling, you can start your career and spouse search a couple of years earlier. You will have more money and a better career that way, which is useful if you want to start a family, and makes you more attractive for a long term relationship. Traveling/volunteering could make you a more interesting and wise person, though.

I'm an early-imid-30s guy married to a woman in her late 30s, and we're expecting. She was reportedly always family-minded, but focused on her career while younger, and was picky with guys. I had a lot of wanderlust, and goofed off and traveled when younger. By doing so, I came to the conclusion that I don't want to do that stuff, because it is fairly empty compared to pairing up and starting a family. But if I hadn't done it, I might have always fantasized about it. So maybe some people need to scratch that itch. But my career suffered for it.

I also think it's better to start a family sooner. I would rather have met my wife sooner and had kids sooner. The stuff I was doing in my 20s was not as fun as love and family. Just because you can wait until the last minute to start a family doesn't mean you wouldn't be happier if you started sooner. But maybe some people need to figure that out for themselves. 

My wife and I really want a second kid, but due to her age, we will try to have it quickly after the first one. It would be nice to have more breathing room. They say ""try to have all your kids before age 40"" because it might not happen afterwards. And all sorts of health risks are higher with age.

My impression dating in my early 30s was that there were a lot of women in their 30s who were ready to settle down and felt the clock ticking. As a guy, I think I could probably have waited until age 60 to start a family, but as I said, I wouldn't want to do that because I would miss out on having a family during most of my life.

I don't have personal experience with it, but I have a low opinion of those volunteering trips. It sounds more like an extended vacation for you than a real help to the world. And I think, at this point in your life, you should be focused on helping yourself and your family before helping strangers. I know lots of old people who are married with grown kids who volunteer regularly; it feels more natural to do it that way.

I can't really say whether the quality of available men goes down as you age. I suppose that most people who want a family tend to pair up quickly, but people often decide they want a family later in life. All else equal, a younger woman is more physically attractive, but less mentally and fiscally attractive. Most men prefer someone younger than them, so your dating pool will shrink as you age.

Depending on your degree, maybe you can find a job where you travel for work, or in an exotic location. Or travel for a smaller amount of time and see if it scratches the itch.

There is a math method of finding a good partner, called the ""secretary problem"". Basically, of X potential partners, date 30% of them, then marry the next one that is better than any of those 30%. Applied to dating, it just means date a few people before settling down, so that you get an idea of what your options are. 

The downsides are possibly ending up alone if the best one was in that 30%, and possibly waiting too long to find your soulmate (better to marry your 2nd best soulmate when you're 30 than your 1st best when you're 80.) You can mitigate these downsides by either lowering your threshold from 30% (marrying sooner), or, my preferred method, increasing X by dating more people."
8953,"I have my moments, but it's best to not rush dating though, because when you rush it, you are only dating because you want to feel less lonely, and your not doing it for yourself. Don't rush it at all"

8955,"I’m 24 and my fiancé is 28, we both met 5 years ago through a video game. neither of us planned on getting into a relationship, but it happened anyways. Throughout these 5 years we’ve travelled and had fun together, grown into our careers, and plan on buying a house soon. We still have fun and have future trips planned around the world.

I don’t know why being in a relationship in your 20s would somehow prevent you from chasing your dreams or having fun… if it does, then maybe that person isn’t right for you?"
8956,"Same age and just graduated. Broke up with my ex a year ago and was also afriad of spending my life alone. The fear was so intense that I had to watch positive psychology youtube videos, but I eventually convinced myself to believe in a few ideas:

* we're probably not going to spend out lives alone. like another comment said, love will come when its ready.
* This is the point that helped me the most: even if we are alone, it's not a bad thing. Being alone is the default, natural state we are born with. We can explore ourselves and our inner states more. Being in a relationship may or may not be better than being single, depending on how you look at things.

I also know many people with long term relations and getting married. Somehow, even in my worst states, I wasn't jealous of them nor compared myself to them at all. I only felt happy for them. I think a lot of this might come down to dealing with peer pressure in general."
8957,">You can still do those things that you have always wanted to do and it would be great if your partner also supports you with them too.

I think this is true in most circumstances, but for example if I were to meet someone in the US and then go volunteer abroad for 1-2 years, I can't reasonably expect that person to stay happy in a relationship while we are physically separated for that entire time. I've been in a relationship like that before and I could understand if they don't want to endure that."

8959,"Hey, first of all thank you for your perspective, I feel like this is very honest. Just want to mention right off the bat that I'm a guy and not a girl haha. So when I mention the biological clock, I am concerned about not having as much time (or breathing room, as you put it) to comfortably have kids with my future partner. Of course this would depend on her age respective to mine, as well.

>I had a lot of wanderlust, and goofed off and traveled when younger. By doing so, I came to the conclusion that I don't want to do that stuff, because it is fairly empty compared to pairing up and starting a family.

I think this is one big reservation I have to extended traveling as well- my biggest fear is that I commit to a multi-year trip and then end up regretting it and feel like I'm stagnating out there. Although, if you feel comfortable sharing, could you elaborate on what experiences you had?

>I have a low opinion of those volunteering trips. It sounds more like an extended vacation for you than a real help to the world

I'd agree with you in most cases. The trips I'm looking at are programs like the Peace Corps which former volunteers often claim was transformational and shaped the rest of their lives. It would be more for me to get a grounding experience like that under my belt before committing to a career out here in the states. So while I understand what you're saying, I feel like it would be a bit more than an extended vacation for me. Of course, it's hard to say for sure how impactful it would be until I'm actually there, so there is somewhat of a risk in that commitment.

>My impression dating in my early 30s was that there were a lot of women in their 30s who were ready to settle down and felt the clock ticking

Makes sense... Did you feel like this complicated dating in your 30s as opposed to your twenties? And did you find that it was harder/took longer to meet your current wife or ex partners that you clicked with?

BTW... congratulations to you and your wife on the baby!"
8960,"I date when I can, but with some of the things I want to do, like volunteer abroad, dating becomes harder (for example, living in a traditional-minded, rural village in a foreign country) so I guess I'm just not sure if it's worth prioritizing dating now while I'm in my twenties over experiences like that."
8961,"In my experience, people I've dated are so career focused that usually the reason we've broken up is because they're unwilling to compromise on their career for us stay together. For example, my ex got accepted to a multi-year grad school program across the country so it no longer made sense for her to want to maintain our relationship. And I can't really blame a potential partner for wanting to do that. 

Another thing is one of my dreams involves me taking an extended stay abroad and doing something like volunteering for 2 years in a rural village. Not many potential partners would be willing to drop everything and commit to a trip like that- I couldn't expect them to- and I think it's hard to find someone who is, and whose timeline would match up with mine in that sense. And I don't necessarily think this means such a person isn't right for me, but more that it just wouldn't be the right time for a relationship."
8962,"LDRs are difficult and they definitely aren't for everyone. Some people make it happen, while there are others who don't. It's really up to the two people in the relationship and knowing what they want to do in terms of being together or breaking up. If they believe the wait is worth it for this person, then they will continue being together no matter the distance or whatever else strains their relationship."
8963,"that's so strange, I have the exact same rule but it's something I came up with independently of hearing it from elsewhere, so it's funny to hear others like you state the same rule!"
8964,"My traveling was mostly limited to a couple of 2 week trips overseas. I also did a bunch of hiking around the USA. I also goofed off a ton in general in my 20s, partying and pursuing hobbies (and women), barely working or trying to build a life at all.

Since you're a guy, I am surprised you worry about taking a couple of years off. Women are usually willing to date older guys... But especially if those guys have money. It does suck to feel like you are behind in your career as a guy. But I wouldn't worry about an extra year or two.

I felt like it was harder to date in my 20s because I was mentally a mess, and the people I dated were similar, which is also more common when younger.

8971,"Depending on your desired career field there are a lot of certifications that you can self study for. For instance, CompTIA A+ is a common computer one that looks great on resumes. Take some time to google certifications in your field and look into those. 

I saw you mention fiction writing in another comment- it doesn’t matter if you’re “good” at it, spending more time writing leading up to college will help when you’ve got a class with essays due each week. Also, you gotta remember the trashy novels that have managed to become best sellers; you never know what the market will like until you hit submit. Self publishing with ebooks is now easier than ever. 

Lastly, you’re at the perfect age to focus on your health. Have you ever wanted to run a 5k, or get into strength training or yoga or meditation?

There are also jobs that are willing to take interns, apprentices and entry-level people without an education, such as many sales roles. 

This does not apply to specialized careers, like finance, healthcare, engineering, etc. But for those of us who chose an ambiguous degree and started an ambiguous career, you start to realize that that degree just barely gave you a leg up in an interview, when you could have instead found a low-level job those few years and had hands-on work experience by age 22, and made money instead of spending 100k. 

Unfortunately, many people don't really know how careers or businesses even work, so they spend $100K on an education thinking ""well maybe I'll know what to do after I get this degree"". But all the degree really does, so often, is make you to feel more confident in an interview with the school's name on your resume. 

I'm 5 years into my sales/marketing career. Not once has my education come in heavy, besides reaching out to a mutual connection from my college on linkedIn to get a leg up in an interview."
8985,"Good idea I need money for certification exams anyway. Good luck in your job search, we didn't come this far to come this far!"
8986,Check out /r/ITCareerQuestions
8987,"I had the same issue, what helped me was first off browsing the ITcareerquestions sub. Then creating somewhat of a plan of what kinda field I may want to search into. Then once I did that I figured out what basic certifications I needed and then studied towards those to make it feel like I wasn’t just wasting my time."
8988,"Work on certifications. Volunteer to do IT work for your church or some other organization. Make sure your degree, certifications, and experience (like the IT volunteer work) are listed on your LinkedIn profile as well as your resume. Show any projects you completed in both places as well, even those from school. You need to show them that you can hit the ground running and that you work well on teams."
8989,"Yep yep. I had a seasonal job in my desired field and now that that gig ended, I feel conflicted about what to do next. In the meantime, I got a retail job that is in a relatively low-pressure, fun environment. It’s not what I want to do forever, but it pays the bills, and ironically I feel more motivated in my job search now that I technically don’t “need” a job."
8990,"True, in the meantime I'm going to study for AWS and start going to the gym. I moved back to parents and can't use weed as a crutch anymore."
8991,Maybe search out of state? And apply other jobs that are related to IT as a temporal career. Try QA? Some of my friends graduated and could not find job ended up taking QA as a solution. And job searching is not easy. Cheering for you.
8992,"It took me six months after graduation to get _a_ job. Not in the field of my degree, just a part time minimum wage job. It’s tough out there right now. You have to stay busy during the process because it can be a real hit to your self esteem. Now is the time to take on any hobbies you were once too busy to consider. 

I recommend taking on part time work in the meantime. I understand you want to work in IT, and I want to work in my field too, but if the waiting process is taking a toll on you, you can only be so particular. I’m not saying take on a job you’d hate (unless you have to for financial reasons), but maybe something that’s just “okay”. I applied for a lot of jobs I would have hated, had some interviews and never got any of them, and it seems like it was meant to be that way because of all pt/min wage jobs I could have, where I’m at is probably the best for me until my actual career starts to show any promise."
8993,"Work places are a lot like school, you have to be a freshman before you can be a senior. Start small then transfer into your department once you get a foothold with your bosses/supervisors/team leads, because they can help. You said it yourself, it wont happen overnight. Start in a position they have open then see about switching.

&#x200B;

Edit: Added words"
8994,"You are not alone in this, i graduated back in June, and didn't really start actively looking until late July early august, I had an internship offer before i graduated but i didnt take it it was low-paying. On average it takes about 3-8 months for the college graduate to find a job, some of my friends were now just getting jobs, one got a job in late september, another one got a job in october, and some got jobs in november and one of my friends just got a job this month after 7 months. You are not alone in this process, It's not easy getting a job after college, my oldest sibling graduated from med school back in May, but it took her a long time to get a job and she had to take a certification exam, and she's now just getting her first legit job. The unfortunate truth about some of these jobs are that you can be qualified but someone will have better connections, maybe the Boss old high school friends son was applying for the position and they got it instead of you."
8995,Have you gotten any certifications? If not get your a plus and get a desktop support position and start working your way up from there.
8996,"Don’t lose hope! I graduated in May and finally got an entry level IT job. I lack experience and didn’t do internships, super stoked because my new job will pay for my CompTia certification stuff. Good luck to you!"
8997,[deleted]
8998,"I think spingoldrecords and SleeveofThinMints are offering some great advice. Definitely consider applying for entry level jobs in your field (that may not require a degree or certs.) and jobs that are outside of your field. I actually combined the two and applied for jobs that did not require a degree and were outside of my field of study. 

I graduated in May with a general management degree from a somewhat reputable state school in the midwest. I was applying to every management trainee, assistant manager, and management internship position I found; both in and out of state. I could'nt get any call-backs for the life of me. It was super discouraging. I was getting rejection letters (not calls) constantly. I got desperate and applied to a pt cashier job at Lowes and received a rejection call because I was too qualified... I know how you feel brother. I felt like the cycle of job hunt, application, rejection would last forever. It will end...itjust takes some time and careful preperation. 

Like others have said, its tough right now. Ill tell you what I did to land a pretty good gig: (1) I took some time to learn how to market my skills and develop a sound resume; (2) I started thinking about potential career-type positions that I could work into if I were to earn an ""entry level"" job somewhere; and (3) I started applying to jobs outside of my field and areas of interest. I ended up receiving two offers from reputable Fortune 200 companies. One offer was for a QC Tech, they other was for a machinery operator; neither can be considered ""in my field"" or as a career interest...but I knew that if I earned one of the positions, I could work my way into a leadership role that was both ""in my field"" and interesting to me. 

I ended up working as a machinery operator for a large chemical manufacturer...a job I could have landed without a 4 year management degree. HOWEVER, once I was in I moved up quickly to a supervisory role. They pay is good and I like the work. Also, don't be afraid to apply to positions that you think you may not be qualified for. I was not ""technically"" a qualified applicant for the QC tech. job, but I applied and actually received an offer for that job. Wayne Gretzky has an awesome quote that I think may be helpful ""you miss 100% of the shots you don't take."" So take the shots man. You never know until you try. 

As others have said, don't give up. As long as your up and moving your legs, trying to improve your approach and churning out those applications you have a shot at landing something. If you throw in the towel, your chances drop to 0. Definitely commit to some gym time and earning certifications. That will keep you busy and they will both improve your state of mind.

You got this bro!"
8999,Thanks for the advice! I've actually been trying to find volunteer work through bumble bizz lol. I'll see about mass emailing companies around me for volunteering opportunities
9000,"I just put ""willing to relocate"" on job sites and have gotten a couple of emails from recruiting companies, not great reviews but its a positive sign. I think part-time work and certifications are going to be my move. Thanks for the advice and really appreciate the kind words!"
9001,Working on AWS right now and going to find a part-time job to save for more certs.
9002,I've done the same thing. Just updated my resume and recruiting companies have emailed me but the jobs have terrible reviews but best news I've had in the last few weeks.
9003,"Thanks, good luck with your path! Everyone is much nicer on this sub than ITcareerquestions. Yeah I think finding part-time work to pay for bills/save for certs is probably my move. Going to start going to the gym too. Not to sound like a degenerate but not having weed/alcohol as a crutch is something I need to grow from."
9004,"Thanks, makes me feel better. Just going to take care of what is in my control and focus on studying for cert/going to the gym in the meantime."
9005,Thanks for the advice! Yeah just in a weird headspace cause I spent the last four years building a network and being at the top of my fraternity. To being back home where my parents still see me as a kid. They don't understand how the switch can be difficult to adjust to. Just gotta take it one day at a time
9006,Congrats! Thanks homie I know I just gotta give it time. All the comments have been really helpful
9007,"Ah ok. I'm in Australia, could recommend how to go about getting a job over here. I assume you've been applying for positions with the federal government? If not that's definitely a good foot in the door to an IT career. From a quick google it looks like USAJobs.gov is the place to look"
9008,Where do you live mate?
9009,Thanks I have but most want me to get A+ cert which is expensive/feels redundant because I took multiple classes on the info in college. My college gave us a 100 question exam instead of a A+ voucher smh. I think the holiday season is a dry period for hires hoping my luck changes in the spring!
9010,DC area
9011,"Personally, I feel like it's all a matter of perspective.

In my 20s, I fucked up. You could say I virtually wasted by early to mid 20s.

My 30s are way better. Happily married, have money, have hobbies, try my best to hang out with friends.

The thing that always gets me, and maybe it's just American culture, is that we have virtually no interaction with other people post school. There's the internet sure, but it's not like you run into people haphazardly like at school. You constantly have to put yourself out there to make friends and it's exhausting."
9012,"I live alone and feel this 100%, I feel like I’m out of place. I missed the dating scene at 27 and I guess I’ll die alone."
9013,Mmm. You missed me on the high stress job and yet being broke part. No debt is nice tho…
9014,"LOL. Dude noooooo. 27 is so young, and I say that as a 25 year old. I say this lovingly, but you’re acting absolutely crazy if you think 27 is old.

You have 13 more years before you’re 40, where dating definitely does get a little harder. Think: 13 years ago you were 14. How much has changed? That’s how much could change between now and 40.

Also, millennials invented dating apps, so we’re going to keep using them. I bet when you’re 40, there will be plenty of people still on the apps your age.

Don’t give up hope. You are so so so so so so fine. Download the apps and get on it! When I was 23, I was swiping on people up to 28. Now that I’m 25, I’m swiping on people up to 32. 

I cannot say this enough: you are not old. You are fine. In 20 years, you’re going to be kicking yourself for thinking 27 is too old to date."
9015,"Ik I wasn't made to fit the world so I'm just trying my best to get the life i want as much as possible. I'm looking to work the least ours for the most money. If that can't be done, I'm looking for the best job with the day to day activities that I like doing and it's not just at an office all day. I want enough money to travel, go to hobby classes, do side hustles. I'm not having kids cause fuck that"
9016,How did you and your spouse meet?
9017,"College Radio. 

It functioned as a half club, half class so there were a lot of moments to just get to know people. It was to the point where my very Type-A, 18 unit a semester, working 25 hours a week future wife and her future ""slacker""  struggling with 12 units husband, could meet up, become friends, and eventually fall in love.

I still keep in contact with some of the DJs too."
9018,You're only 27. I st download a date g app
9019,"That's where I'm at myself, 28 and live alone with no interest in starting a typical family or having a ton of friends. Just wanna create the life I wanna live like you said. Just finishing trade school and wanted to find an occupation similar to what you mentioned so I'm going into the electrical field hoping to land a position as a maintenance technician. Instead of spending all my earnings on kids I just wanna make my house dope and fund my hobbies. Work on music, my bonsai trees, robotics and maybe get a ps5 as well lol"
9020,I know plenty of women who have no interest in starting a family. My girlfriend has no desire to have kids lol We also both like to have our own spaces and don’t wanna cohabitate. Been dating 7 years and this arrangement has worked well for us. I think the pressure to adhere to the typical adult/family setup stems from social conditioning. But that doesn’t work for everyone and other arrangements/lifestyle choices are just as valid.
9021,"Yeah, I don't have that good of a paying job, I feel like I'm just starting to see growth. I'm building"
9022,I do want love tho. I hope I find someone who is okay with it just being the 2 of us as immediate family
9023,"Hey thank you! I hope I manage to get cool with my boss and some coworkers to the point where we can grab a drink and talk so I can ask him, cause I'd really like to know."
9024,"For me, it was just brought up casually in conversation. I work in HR, and the reason someone gets hired can vary greatly. Some companies only go by technical experience. This is largely the case with fields like IT, pharmaceutical, science, especially if it’s a big company. Others go by the “does this person fit in with our culture and are they trainable” mindset.

I would just wait until it’s brought up. Like someone else said, if you ask outright, you’ll probably get a bullshit, fluff answer."
9025,"This is actually a really great question.

Yes - you should ask.

The time to do it is during your annual review.

You should also ask ""was there anything preventing you from making the offer?""

Don't do it as you start or onboard - you are likely not going to get a fully honest answer"
9026,"It wasn't over some beers, but at least once a week after a day's work I would ask my managed how I was doing. I was hired on as a contractor at first and I really enjoyed my job so was really hoping to be hired on permanently. When I was getting hired on, I did ask what made him pick me? I was job searching for 2 years before getting hired so I kept getting feedback of why I WASN'T hired so I would want to hear some good stuff. 

When I was hired for the contract I had a task to use the platform to create a product for a client of my choice. I had a lot of fun with it and thought I did well. Well turned out the other candidate I was up against, didn't understand the platform or even tried the task. So that was a big factor."
9027,"Engineering. This position is pretty intense and the interview process was strenuous because spots were very limited, but the payout and opportunities are amazing for someone fresh out of school. So I really couldn't believe I actually got the position when they called me lol"
9028,I would only bring this up over a beer
9029,Nursing
9030,That is true. Thanks for the advice!
9031,"Solid idea, thank you!"
9032,"Assume the best of yourself! You got hired because they think you can do the job. Have you heard of imposter syndrome? It sounds like what you might be experiencing.

&#x200B;

You can ask your boss that, but from my experience it's not really a question you ask, you'll kind of find it out along the way :)"
9033,What field is that?
9034,"Wow! That's really great! In that case, I'd want to know too. I would wait until I know them a little better and am somewhat competent  Congratulations, happy for you :)"
9035,I would never ask that because Im afraid of the answer. Cant prove but im pretty sure that girl from HR had a crush on me.
9036,"I like you because, like me, you're also a forward thinker."
9037,I'd say depends on your relationship with your manager. If you are on good terms and your manager is friendly enough I would just ask.
9038,Yeah definitely. And thank you!
9039,"Can’t move out if you don’t have money. I’m 27 and I’m still looking for my first “real job”. 

Idk if it’s just me, but finding an actual job feels impossible."
9040,"I know it’s tough but keep pushing and looking for what YOU want. 

The default in life is suffering but if you’re the hard worker you say you are you will be fine once you start focusing on converting that hard work into good things for you. You’re right that after school people don’t give a crap how hard you worked in school, except you. But that’s ok because that’s a platform from which you can build yourself up because YOU know how much effort you’re capable of.

I’m not comfortable giving advice on your family situation as I don’t know much besides what you’ve shared here, except maybe just communicate what you feel, and be frank and direct. 

Don’t be so paranoid on your perceived racism. The whole situation is tough and all types of business are struggling (and will continue to do so), but that’s why the government is injecting economic relief to businesses like yours. 

If you don’t mind me asking, what did you major in?"
9041,I'm a new grad from the DMV area and I work in political comm. We have openings right now – DM me.
9042,"Major in Communication Studies. Minor in Digital Media Engagement. Yes I know my major is broad. Yes I have applied for a large variety of jobs that could be related to my field, both in my area (Washington DC area) and beyond."
9043,"Field is Communications and Marketing. Have tried applying in person a few times, most times have been told they're not hiring or to apply online. Have personally talked to professional within my field, even they told me that applying in person was a rookie move. I have had many of them look through my resume, have been sold several times that there isn't necessarily anything wrong with my experience, just some reformatting. Like I said, many times one person's advice would contradict another's, so it's hard to really tell what I'm doing wrong. The most consistent advice I've been given was ""It's a numbers game, eventually something will stick"" and it's like cool, I still can't even get interviews though."
9044,I’m in the dc area. Try applying to construction marketing coordinator or contract coordinator/admin jobs.
9045,"I'm doing the ""experience even if it's not related to your studies"" part and it sucks. My employer refuses to see me as anything outside my current job title. I have expertise in problems they are actively having, but what would a XXX know about that? Working harder than my peers has led to them exploiting me because they know I will work when others won't. And so I stay in my present role with no option for advancement other than outside the company. Other companies are understandably leery of hiring a subject matter expert who can't show results. It's a very hard place to be."
9046,"To be honest, reading this just kinda makes me feel worse. I realized a little too late in college that this industry and career line was perceived as something that ""anybody can too"". I figured though, well I already have strong experience in the industry that should help me out with finding a job right? I guess not.

The thing is I just don't really know what other skills I'm interested in. I have some skills in tech but coding wasn't for me. Nor do I really have the time or energy to commit to developing any skills, because I work 9 hours a day (plus 1 hour commute each way) 6 days a week. And if I'm not at work, I'm home usually either dealing with my father's problems or catching up on sleep.

I'm just so tired and drained everyday."
9047,"I was in a similar position a year ago today. I dove into my savings to fly across the country for a convention in the field I wanted to work in and a bunch of resumes. My experience was pretty solid for a college grad (and had a major in a relevant field) - 3 internships, jobs during school, etc.

Got one reply of the ~70+ booths I visited. They offered me $10 an hour in a massive city in California. Lol.

After that I ended up working a contracting job for about a year and 2 months. Decent pay. Fucking hated it though. Started looking for jobs 2 months in. Took me a year to find something. Was super demoralizing.

However, I did meet a lot of people along the way. Some of those people actually helped get me where I am now which is a dream job with incredible benefits.

I’ll be able to pay off my loans soon and finally buy a car.

You can do it. Don’t lose hope. I felt this only two months ago but my life has completely changed."
9048,"So I’m a marketing/comms grad too and yes, it’s a shitty meat-grinder industry in general.  

Even if you are the best of the best, as in your case, they don’t really care about that since it’s still perceived as a career that “anybody can do”. Which is why I’m trying to pivot away from it. 

My suggestion is that you explore what other skills you’re interested in and start developing those. While the marketing/comms/pr/advertising industry as a whole is absolutely shit, you’ll find better opportunities when you combine that background with a new set of skills (tech for example). 

I’m currently working as an in house digital content manager and that’s thanks to adding some coding and IT skills to my repertoire. I’m still not very happy to be in the marketing industry but I’m much better off now than when all I had to offer was a shitty bachelors in marketing. (Yes I’m still exploring other skill sets to develop)."
9049,"All it takes is one good interview and you’ll have a job. I know it seems hopeless, but eventually something will give. 

I was very social in college and had a large friend group. I rarely hear someone getting a job outright and it’s usually someone who refers you that lands you a job. 

My buddy from college got me my current job and I’ve helped 3 people get jobs in my city through networking. 

Connect with old college buddies and see if they have any connections! 

Networking is key."
9050,"Exercise (hard and often) and fix your diet (eat more unprocessed meat and veggies, less sugar and carbs or processed food of any kind) to improve your mood/ depression. Move to a big city, get some experience even if it's unrelated to your studies. You could get work on a ship as a merchant marine or try getting a job in IT. Have you considered joining the military? They have plenty of roles to offer (it's not forever, just keep your head down, work harder than others and always do what's best for the team, put yourself second). Once you get a job work harder than your coworkers, start early and finish late, don't expect promotions, they will come after you've worked your ass off for several years. You know what's good for you (do those things) and what's not good for you (don't do those things). Stay strong."
9051,"Find an industry that is high demand and pretend to be excited about it.  Then use that mindset to tailor your resume to that industry.  Do not be afraid to slightly exaggerate your experience (only because it sounds like you are really underselling yourself ATM).  Just work on getting interviews then work on getting second interviews and at that point you will probably be getting offers as well.

This is all very easy for me to say because although my job situation was much like yours my living situation is not nearly as difficult.  If you would like further clarification or a fresh set of eyes to help you with your resume let me know.  I do hope you find something to restore your outlook in life."
9052,I would say you picked two very broad and saturated fields. That’s why the job search is so hard. I would look into other fields or try to become very specialized in some nuance of that field. Have you looked into HR jobs? Office or administrative assistants?
9053,"I feel you bud. But tough times don’t last forever. 

I didn’t mean you have to learn coding specifically, but maybe some other skill you’re interested in. Take your time and really think about it and try stuff out. 

Also, youre  driven, so use that drive to slowly get out of that situation."
9054,I think the first step is to get on Medicaid and seek mental health counseling. Also what field are you in? Perhaps you can find some remote opportunities to supplement your work and try to get your foot in the door. I had a similar experience post-college and that’s what worked for me. Please reach out if you need any guidance or just someone to talk to.
9055,"So this is a late reply but this post almost made me tear up. Apart from a different ethnic background I myself could have written this.

I graduated last May with a decent degree and it took me nearly 9 months of blood, sweat, and tears to find anything other than food or retail. I went on many interviews, most of which went nowhere because of my lack of experience and my lackluster interviewing skills. I picked up my old job (in food) and worked there for 8 months after college, where it honestly sucked the life right out of me. We were constantly understaffed and I was overworked.

I also never managed to land an internship, which was partially my own fault and out of my reach (I had to be a caregiver for my mother one summer - she had intensive knee surgery and literally no one else would help). I know for a fact my lack of internship experience made it absurdly difficult. 

....and then the Coronavirus happened. I managed to get hired at this new job right before this pandemic really took off, but my training has been postponed. The job doesn't pay well at all and it doesn't even use my degree at all, but I'm afraid I'm all out of options.

Have you considered contacting staffing agencies/recruiting agencies in your area? I'm sure they'll have something for you, even if it's not aligned with your degree. I think that's your best option at this point.

All I gotta say is, I share the same struggles  and I'm deeply sorry for all of this. I wish colleges would do a better job at preparing you for the real world, because I feel like many graduate without anything to go off from."
9056,"I would start trying to apply to jobs in person. I’m not sure what field you are in, obviously it may be a resume issue. You’ve revised, but you need to identify what is wrong with it that you are falling through the cracks 99.9% of the time. 

Go into some organizations and explain that you’re trying to get into xyz field and if it would be possible to see if you could buy a coffee for someone who works in that department and ask them a few questions about the job market and how to break through. The worst they say is no, but if you get someone in person who knows the field and can give you some guidance it’s going to be way better than throwing darts at the board. Is there a subreddit for your field/industry. Redditors might have some good advice. Might agree to a chat, call, Skype, meetup and review your resume. The goal is to get someone heavily involved in that industry to review your resume. They will have the best and updated knowledge of what looks good or bad."
9057,At least you're getting interviews.
9058,I get a new job on average every year. If you or OP is getting subsidized housing via parents you have it better than most people
9059,Good luck!
9060,"Similar situation here. It'll be almost a year since I graduated. Down so many dead end roads to get a job. I'm not giving up though. A job WILL come. Maybe not the dream job, but a starting point. It was a sucky time to be a graduate. You're not alone."
9061,Good luck! I ended up realizing that the field I was trying to break into wasn't for me so now I'm trying to figure out what my next steps will be because I can't work service jobs for the rest of my life.
9062,"I'm in a similar situation, same graduating year. What I've been doing is ""yesing"" every recruiter that contacts me. I've gotten around 6-7 interviews that way, and landed around 3 jobs acceptances, though not one good enough to justify moving yet. Hopefully soon. Good luck to you in your situation, hopefully things get better"
9063,"Do a Google on setting personal or psychological boundaries. Here is one example

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries

You’re an adult now and your parents need to be shown that. 

As for COVID, the end is in sight. Vaccines are starting to be rolled out. Job vacancies should appear over time."
9064,"Something I tell myself, that im gonna tell everyone else here, stop stressing so much, we are only 20 something, we have tons of life to live, ignore all of the negative people who say life ends after college"
9065,"Stop comparing yourself.  Are other people paying your bills? Is your happiness dependent on other people?  Are other people's happiness dependent on you?  If you said no to those questions. You're in a good spot, the whole world is suffering, stay in there, and stand up to your parents...you're 26."
9066,"**[Personal boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal boundaries)**

Personal boundaries are guidelines, rules or limits that a person creates to identify reasonable, safe and permissible ways for other people to behave towards them and how they will respond when someone passes those limits. They are built out of a mix of conclusions, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, past experiences and social learning. This concept or life skill has been widely referenced in self-help books and used in the counseling profession since the mid-1980s.According to some counselors, personal boundaries help to define an individual by outlining likes and dislikes, and setting the distances one allows others to approach.

9067,I mean that’s a lot of money to suggest for a “why not”
9068,"Sorry to hear that man. Do you mind sharing what degree and what field? And good luck, too."
9069,"Do you have any hobbies or things you’ve always been dying to start doing, but never knew when the best time would be? When I graduated, I took about six months off before I felt comfortable searching for a permanent job, and then it took nearly a year post-bachelor to even find the job I’m currently at. In between, I started working on my hobbies and building up support groups. I’ve found that even if some days are terrible at work, I can come home to do all the things I love doing, whether it’s painting or playing board games with friends. If you’re worried about job prospects, could you start doing side projects to build your portfolio? That way you’ll still feel like you’re accomplishing something. I feel like a lot of life is just trying to figure out what to do, and for me, I’ve found peace in hobbies and projects."
9070,"First of all, breathe. Most people are facing the same think as you (like me). This pandemic while bad, allows people to take a pause and reassess things. You have that opportunity as of now. I have no doubt that you have an excellent resume and internships. Being someone who have never did any internships, I feel like you are more qualified than me. 

Here’s my opinion on what you should do: Continue walking your dog and exercising. During those times, think about what do you want to do and how can you reach it. Find five jobs you want to apply for. Four not in your field and one that is. Try to do this every day. Yes it gets repetitive and depressing. If that happens, take a break and refresh yourself. Aside from that, I always say to stream on YouTube or Twitch. That can add some good technical skills to your bag of tricks and you can always use those clips for a reel. Maybe find a hobby you can do like building Gundams or something. The time we all have now will not last forever. Make something out of it.

Listen OP, it is totally okay. I can’t say when it will be better but it will be. I know what you are feeling because I am feeling it as well. You are not alone in this. ❤️"
9071,"And then you’re over qualified for a large amount of the positions who are actively hiring. A masters degree isn’t this golden ticket anymore, why do people keep thinking otherwise???"
9072,"With all due respect sir, as someone currently forced to achieve a higher education diploma to receive entry level work, kindly come off of it."
9073,"If you expect this industry to stagnate for at least a few more months, why not apply to grad school to get an MBA? Unless you don’t want to, which is understandable, especially since it isn’t really necessary at this stage anyways.

But you won’t find motivation staying at home, and you know that. The easiest thing to do is find a hobby that takes you out of the house. Otherwise, perhaps start a little personal project revolving around your field of study? I actually don’t know if business students do these kinds of things but you may know more about that"
9074,"I graduated with three degrees (math, CS, MBA) and I sat around feeling like shit until I realized something: no one was gonna come save me. No one could help. Once you internalize that. And the fear of not making it is deep enough that you’ll claw your way out of this, you’ll find so much strength. And so, I know this is a special case here but I was also in a special case...the entire world economy was collapsing. But I found a way, I kept trying every day. And to get a job, I had to work like 8 hours a day with a consulting agency I found. To apply to jobs. I got it. And that was 13 years ago. My salary went from $13/hr to $24 to $54 to $70 $80...with benefits 90+/hr. I invested, for houses, invested some more. Became a millionaire. And I even teach stuff on [YouTube](http://amanbansil.com) (I woulda laughed at this 13 years ago). 

So, believe me, there is a way out. Also, believe me, light help from others won’t make a dent. You wanna make it? You’re gonna have to claw in this shit economy. You can do this cuz I know that desperation and I know that feeling of being a looser you keep getting in your mind. You need to trust in the fact that there are others who made it and you will too. And you need to realize that NO MATTER the outside factors, YOU are not a statistic. You’re one person trying to get ahead and crush it. You’re gonna have to do the hardest thing you’ve ever done so far. You will find people who will say things like “economy sucks, government sucks, there are no jobs” but again, you choose if you are an individual or are part of that statistic. No matter what you believe is true, that’ll be the truth for you.

Grind now. Contact 25 people a day on linked in with customized messages. Call recruiters. Keep checking in with them. Hound managers of companies. Attack big and wide. Each day, set up a desk area and you go to work, sit down, put some music on and keep hunting for contacts and keep contacting them. Create a small elevator pitch - why should they hire you? And customize it over and over for each email or resume submission. Keep track of what you sent to whom. You think this is too much? I used to completely customize my resume PER SUBMISSION multiple times a day. Every recruiter has a custom version of my resume which addresses their needs. It works man. Trust me, I went through a training mg program where most people quit and they said it was all fake, that no one would ever get jobs. A handful of us kept going and are high earners today. 


So, you are scared already because you know exactly who is out there competing with you. And I’m here to give you a bit of a wake up call if you need it. You’re gonna have to get very uncomfortable for a little bit. I was very scared working initially, I had panic attacks cuz i was so stressed but I pushed through because like you, there was NO BACKUP PLAN. And my parents were poor (negative net worth).

I’m hoping that this made sense. Ask questions, keep in touch on my YouTube and I’ll help as best I can. Seek a consulting agency fast! And start working with them.

9075,"Feeling like you have no agency sucks. But going to the gym and hanging with your dog is not nothing, and commendable! I heard about a book called Power of Agency which might help. What has helped me in the past is exercise, improv and growing plants. Anything that demonstrates to me that I can affect my environment in nontrivial ways."
9076,"Depending on the field, a masters is either a waste of time or...the only way you’re getting in.

To overgeneralize is to lose info."
9077,"I get that 100%. Although my first year out wasn’t nearly as chaotic as this year, I understand that feeling of listless cycling of emotions. I keep reminding myself that we’re going through a global pandemic lol, it’s something the world hasn’t seen in 100 years. Stay strong, you got this"
9078,"Thank you! Gotta keep things in perspective, stay strong as well!"
9079,"I haven’t fully finished my program yet (student teaching right now), but I’m largely in a weird limbo like most people our age. It’s even weirder because my two best friends from college have moved away - one is in Philly, and the other in Arizona. I’m doing the same thing where I cycle between being sad that my friends are gone and everything with COVID, and being grateful that I’m still able to stay with my parents and it’s no issue. It’s made looking for a job frustrating to say the least, especially since it’s a lot harder to go anywhere in person! I keep telling myself that despite everything that’s going on, there will be some kind of normalcy eventually. It may take a while to get there, but eventually things will calm down again. I know it doesn’t help much, but try to keep your head up! You’ll make it through this just like everyone else will."
9080,"I am in a somewhat similar position only I lost my job completely. I graduated at the same time that you did and found a job doing SEO work at a sizable marketing company in November of 2019. It was going great until March rolled around and they furloughed half of the staff including me. They kept sending updates about once a month about how we would all be back soon. So my girlfriend and I went ahead and resigned our lease in the city (Fort Collins, Colorado) we are in. 

June rolls around and half of the furloughed people including myself get emails that their position at the company is no longer available. This is a huge blow but I got pretty lucky in landing that job relatively quickly so I am not too worried about finding another. I was completely wrong. 

Fast forward to October and I have been applying to at least 3 jobs every day. For a while I was mostly looking for professional jobs because I have a degree and some experience but now I am just trying to get a job so I have been applying to retail positions. I mean I worked retail for 7 years prior to getting my degree but it feels like a step back. I worked full time while going to school full time so that I wouldn’t have to work retail again yet a year and a half after getting that degree I probably going to have to do that just to make ends meet. Overall I feel grateful to live in a great city, I have great friends, no one in my family has been hospitalized because of the virus, and I have a roof over my head but it still feels like I am in a weird time where I have no idea what the next 6 months could look like.

One thing that has made me less annoyed about doing this is realizing that there are others in my position. All of my friends from high school are in the same boat. So you aren’t alone in feeling screwed over by the pandemic. Most of us will ride this out and there will be a brighter future ahead as long as we get control of corona sooner rather than later."
9081,"Thank you! I have to keep telling myself that too. I keep expecting normal and keep getting disappointed. Because it technically looks like “normal” life still, it doesn’t have that apocalyptic orange glow to it, but I have to give myself some grace and realize that times are tough rn stop expecting a normal transition."
9082,"Keep email back weekly. It’s not a good look, but it’s only been 2 weeks; someone could be on vacation and have forgotten to put up an out of office auto response. 

Side note - your last question in every interview should be some form of ‘what are the next steps moving forward, and when can I expect a decision?’"
9083,"I'm going through the same thing. I think part of it is where you're applying for. A smaller company can probably get back a lot sooner than a place with hundreds of people. Whoever is in charge of hiring probably has to get in touch with other people about whether you'd be a good fit and they all have other things they have to do for work too.
At least that's how I'm trying to rationalize my radio silence. I hope yours goes better."
9084,"For me it’s been pretty common to apply places and hear nothing back, but to have a few interviews and then hear nothing back is just plain fucked. Assholes man."
9085,"a few things.

They will always say it was positive because that is what Americans do.  

3 times is  pretty much getting up there on contacts, wait a week, try again, once.  But really call HR, this might be sitting on someone's desk who is on vacation or out sick, or on a junket. You don't know what's going on.

As for a bad glassdoor review... that only reflects on you and between you saying that and your 3 contacts, I think it is becoming more clear that the 'positive' experience may have just been a way of getting you to leave.

Finally, the path to getting a job is not to submit resumes to places, the path is to network your ass off.  Go out and hang out where the employees hang out, join a bowling league or soccer clubs, whatever it is they do, do that, so they get to know you, and know you are a nice/fine/smart person, then use those networks to get a job.  generally you want people coming up to you or sending you e-mails recruiting you that say 'hey, we want you'.  If you aren't there, that is where you need to start working toward.  If i had to guess, I'd say you lost the job to someone who took this route.  Now, how do you get the knowledge to even start along this route, you do informational interviews with people in the fields where you want to work. You meet them, professionally, not for a job, but to talk to them and maybe follow them through their work day for a day or two, and be very smart, kind, likeable, etc.  The goal is for you to recruit people to advocate for you, should a job come open."
9086,"Did a 4hr WORKING interview one time, they told me they’d get back to me and pay us (there were two of us) for our time. Never heard back and never received any pay. Think they were just getting free labor from bringing people in for working interviews tbh. This society is a fucked up place for job seekers, that’s for sure."
9087,"That's really discouraging. Why can't they just pick up the phone and say, ""I'm sorry but we decided to go in a different direction""? It sucks, but it doesn't suck as much as going through multiple interviews and thinking you're being seriously considered for a much-needed job, only to be absolutely ghosted."
9088,"Yes. Leave a bad Glassdoor review. Fucking Snapchat did this to me in early January. They didn’t call the first call so rescheduled it to early January. Then they didn’t call me again and just didn’t respond to my email. 

Recruiters are fucking assholes. Don’t even bother with this company. If the recruiting is poison, it’s a symptom of a bigger problem. Leave a bad review and move on."
9089,"I was ghosted after being flown out for an interview.  It was my 4th round, down to the final couple people.  They spent $800 flying me out and putting me up in a hotel.  Sent the reimbursement check but no response.  I followed up and nothing.  Called and nothing.  After a month I gave up."
9090,Because recruiters are unqualified and have low people skills. They couldn’t get a better job so they’re stuck with company dating.
9091,"It varies based on situation. The people who are interviewing you, be it in an HR department or the partners of a small firm, are still human- there are many explanations. Personally, I've had situations where I wouldn't hear back from a place for over a month, even after a few emails, only to get a job offer and an apology later. Turns out the guy managing their HR (smallish office of 30ish people) had a family emergency and dropped out in the middle of the process, and it took them a few weeks until they could get someone else there to man the office. Another place was a similar situation, and this one actually was two months later. Also have had the dick offices that just don't email/call you back if they're not interested after the interview because they don't feel you're worth their time if they don't want you, and still others it was like dating, where the person really doesn't want another date but also doesn't want to hurt your feelings by outright telling you to take a hike.

Regardless of the reason, I've found the best course of action in this case is to just keep on applying to jobs until one sticks. If they do get back to you too late, be gracious for the offer but say during the interim you continued interviewing, and ultimately signed on somewhere else. Doing that is completely understandable given the circumstances, just don't be rude and like ""you f\*\*kers didn't get back to me after two months and 12 emails!"" On the flip side, if you still don't have a job and get that offer late, hey you got a job. But don't leave any bad reviews on Glassdoor until you're securely in a position, for the aforementioned reason that places can have very drawn out hiring schedules."
9092,"Actually, in my experience it's been the reverse, where smaller companies actually would take longer. Typically they had a partner or associate as opposed to a dedicated HR department doing the hiring, and among the milieu of day to day work, sometimes hiring gets lost in the sauce for them when they're busy. Also, I found a lot of smaller firms take hiring to a more personal level, just because the work cultures tend to be more like families than some anonymous 200+ person corporate office."
9093,"Well, that's if life allows you to quit.

I was work at my part-time job that I hated for four years just to have money to use on myself and my family for university. They were the most painful weekends ever. But, I was able to learn to finesse and work around the problems with my job (like colleagues and customers), it didn't help that much but it did enough for me to keep this job till graduation."
9094,"This isn’t r/relationship_advice for many new grads the job search and be very long, immediately quitting might look bad on him. Possibly creating an even longer and harder job search. 

This doesn’t even account for the fact that OP might need the money."
9095,"If everyone else went through the same thing, then her attitude is obviously an open secret and no one higher up cares. All you can do is either sit there and take it, or find a new job."
9096,"Have some self respect. Don't let anyone scream at you in your professional life, period."
9097,"welcome to the real world. everyone lies.

if you do not have a burden. just quit today."
9098,"Exactly, the job market is tough right now. She thinks I’m a smart person so I hope she does give me a good review."
9099,HR is someone related to her. Haha.
9100,"You are right. I was thinking that abusive relationships aren’t necessarily easier but the choice is more clear. Here, I don’t think I can leave after a few weeks. I couldn’t put it on my resume and I’d be praying that future employers understand. Thanks for your replies!"
9101,"Do you have a HR department you can talk to about this? Obviously this should be at your own discretion given she's your boss. 

Sorry for the shit situation you're currently in."
9102,"This, but do it the *right* way. Ask to speak with her privately, and say that her behavior is unacceptable. You do not deserve to be treated like that for making small mistakes while learning on the job. If it is such a big deal for her she needs to organize better training for you. 
Calmly, respectfully and **firmly**setting boundaries can sometimes work wonders for relationships with superiors. Bullies often back off when challenged. 
Just because you are a subordinate does not give her the right to subject you to emotional abuse. If she retaliates against you for this, then I’d say it’s time to get HR/ her boss involved. Like u/1millionbucks said, you are professionals in a professional environment. You can do it."
9103,"My first job out of college paid $35K, and I could just barely afford rent. A few different jobs and a grad degree later, I make $180K at a big tech company, own my home with an amazing view of an iconic city landmark, and have symmetric gigabit internet access.

I was an average student with a 3.1 GPA undergrad and didn't do any internships. I attribute my success to being flexible on relocation, actively maintaining my network, and being in the right place at the right time on two particular occasions."
9104,"Graduated college December 2017 with a 2.9 GPA, low 2.9 so I can’t even round up lol. Couldn’t find any job for 6 months and was failing in interviews. Got a temp data entry job that lasted two months. Then got a job offer in my field from a small company I was previously rejected for. Grinded there for almost 2 years getting experience and was promoted. Now I have a new job that I almost make twice as much as my old job with plenty of growth available at a large tech company.

Moral of the story. Embrace the grind and the ups and downs also DO NOT place your value as a person on whether you have a job or not."
9105,Not paying any rent and looking forward to inheriting generational wealth. There’s no bonus points for playing life on hard mode my friend
9106,"I found out who i wanted to be friends with after college, i've grown as a person, started saving money for the future, and am currently planning on going to graduate school in the fall."
9107,Hey respect on recognising the situation your parents have set you up for. Be grateful for it!
9108,Ay nice that's what a lot of us are looking for. Anything in particular that you can pinpoint was helpful in making the transition smoother?
9109,"Recently graduated with a master’s degree. My boyfriend and I lived off only his income during that time and had a shoestring budget. Our cars were rust buckets, phones outdated, tiny crap apartment. I put off doctor and dentist appointments because I didn’t have insurance. Any unexpected expense felt like a huge set back. I had to use the last of my savings to pay for my licensing, almost every penny. It was a rough time. I am so thankful for my boyfriend supporting us during those times and am thankful for all I learned about life. I found a job right after graduation. I’m not in love with the job, but see it as a first step to where I want to be and I feel like everything is coming together. Now with my income we have a nicer newer place, new car, and a savings. We finally feel financially stable. I worked with a student loan consulting company and they helped me create a plan to pay off my loans and I have a plan that feels manageable and not overwhelming. We love our house and I am so proud of what we have built."
9110,What do u do?
9111,"Found an internship in my junior year that landed me a job and a bunch of new coworker friends when I graduated in December 2019. I moved into my first apartment right before the pandemic started and I've had the time to work remotely and set up a lovely space for myself. Who knew how fun it could be to decorate and clean a whole apartment? That's definitely not what I was expecting to feel after school ended, lol"
9112,This is amazing! Congratulations. Hopefully I can make a shift in my life to be like this. What did you get your masters in?
9113,"I was the definition of a fuck up. I flunked out of college sophomore year and for the next 5 years I did jack all to better my situation. I was terrified of failing again so I kept telling myself I'd go back to school, but never did. Finally was able to do it with the support of family and friends. Graduated at 26 with just barely a 2.4 GPA, but was incredibly fortunate to land a job at a top 5 pharma company. A year later I still have no idea how this company was cool with hiring me but I'm not going to complain about it."
9114,"2 years out of college- first year was rough, I had a summer internship that ended and I didn’t land another job in my field from September until the following March (not that long of a gap but it felt like an eternity). I’m now working that job and making comfortable money (I could have negotiated my salary better, but this was my first go around, so I’ll do better next time) and paying off some of my debt accumulated in college. I have my first real apartment on my own and it feels amazing. I got a puppy! And I also just bought myself a great camera since I see a lot of wildlife, and I’m learning how to use it. I also met a really good guy a bit ago, and I think there’s potential there. It gets better! I realize I was very lucky, and I am appreciative of that every day. I wouldn’t have made it through 8 weeks of self-isolation (right after moving 10 hours from my family) without my pup.

Edit: I just found out they halted payments AND interest on my student loans from March until October! Check your federal loans everyone! I’ve been fortunate enough to have work through the pandemic and it’s helping me cut down the body of what I owe instead of paying interest."
9115,">Embrace the grind and the ups and downs also DO NOT place your value as a person on whether you have a job or not.

I needed to hear this. I just got laid off at my internship (that I've been at since February) yesterday because of COVID."
9116,Industrial Organizational Psychology
9117,I start my first entry level position on Monday making more money than I expected. I plan on hitting my student loans hard with it.
9118,I have a hybrid roll but my title is Business Analyst. I handle requirements gathering for technical projects but I also have a lot of scrum master responsibilities. Technical areas need people who are smart and can understand the work at a high level while also possessing other skills that technical workers tend not to have or prioritize.
9119,"Thats for the response man, very cool!"
9120,Give me the puppy!
9121,Woof 😍
9122,"I'll share mine - I ain't done with school yet. Got one term with one subject left, but I've been working in a grad role for the past 2+ years and had deferred 6mo to work in the industry before. Safe to say, I've felt like I've been out of school for a long time.

It's tough working 9-5 and being switched on with unmedicated ADD but I don't believe in having it drag me down. Since essentially finishing school, I've been able to focus more intentionally on my interests and play in a pub band, as well as pursue my interest in exercise beyond ""pick weight up and put it down"".

How goes the career? It's there. Promotions been pushed back due to the virus. I dont mind :)"
9123,"1 year out of college with a BFA in Illustration, have been working full time since 2 weeks after graduating as a graphic designer and animator! I switched companies in September. Am making a decent salary, up for a raise soon, and have good benefits."
9124,"Struggled for years to finish my degree; never did.  Years later I’m still 2 classes away from completing my degree, after having given up on it. I’m now working in a totally unrelated field which usually required a masters, and clearing a six-figure (US) salary.  All it really took was guile, the ability to sell myself, and the ability to demonstrate that I can get the job done just as good or better than a person with a degree. There is hope, people!"
9125,"Graduated in December, got a job a few weeks after. Job paid us all through the pandemic. Still employed with amazing coworkers and a caring company. Grad school will be paid for. Yay"
9126,"It took me like two years and a full yearish of unemployment to get here but I make more now with better benefits than I ever have. And it's full time. 

I basically spent a year looking for work, found an awful job in my field that was the highest paying job I've ever had, quit immediately and then went back to my summer job (because experience gets you employment right?). From that I stayed for as long as possible and now I've been at my full time job (absolutely not related to my degree) for about half a year now. Things are weird, I'm the most mentally healthy and financially stable I've been in years. I live in my hometown, with my parents, and I'm stuck here with this job. I have probably the most money in my bank account I've ever had but it's still only like 1/3rd of my loans.

It's definitely bittersweet. It's not *bad* but it's not where I thought I would be. All of the best things that have happened to me were through these sorts of shots in the dark where I take action at a down point, it's how I got into the college I wanted and how I got to this goal position (stable job with healthcare). Life is a lot of this I've noticed, it's moreso about whether or not you can make it to these periods of being okay. Leaving college I was in a relationship and moved out of state, looking for work in my career. Now I've met my goals but my life is entirely different. I think it's important to say that because it's easy to intertwine the two, meeting your goals/wants/desires and following the plan. Right now feels like a period of recovery, college was very difficult for me and I wish I took time out before hand to work."
9127,:)
9128,Glad it could help. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. In college I worked for my school reviewing resumes and holding mock interviews.
9129,Lol I’ll post her birthday picture. I post on Instagram @littlefluffmuffin if you can’t wait
9130,"Well, let’s see...

I get as much time off (well, almost) as teachers but I’m not a teacher so I don’t have to deal with whiny kids :P

I don’t have to pay taxes, but I get virtually all the benefits taxpayers get.

On top of the universal health care in my country I get a private health insurance that makes it even cheaper and better (like my wife getting a private room when giving birth and we both getting to stay for 10 days with meals included)

I get to work from home even if it’s not a pandemic, for about 50 workdays every year.

I get an automatic raise of the equivalent of around 6000 USD per year for every kid I have.

I get to travel abroad for about one workweek every month, which is enough that you get to experience a needed break in routine every once in a while, while not so much that traveling becomes tiresome.

Once my son reaches school age he will get to attend a private school for free.

Oh and I get to work with meaningful stuff that I believe in and work hours are normal (well, on average - some days get crazy, some days we don’t show up until lunch or work from home).

And I’m only 29."
9131,"I can relate to your disillusion. I'm about to finish my degree and similar thoughts come to my mind everyday. A really poor advice? Try to do short-term plans, like a year long. That's what I've been doing because is less stressing and more predictable that guessing how your future will be.

Anyways, ask for help if you need it! I saw your post and I was really worried... I feel you, so you're not alone!"
9132,"Exactly this.  Do you like woodworking, cars, motorcycles, or trucks, electrician, plumbing, or welding work?  Trade schools are a great alternative to college."
9133,"Let's call it what it is, man. You're in a dark time right now. But understand there is a difference between where you think you are heading and the way time actually works. You are seeing the future as this brick wall of doom and gloom, and you're in a car headed right towards it. The reality is, there is no brick wall. Regardless of whether you've gone to college, whether you did well in high school, or anything else about you at this particular moment, you're going to wake up every morning knowing just a bit more than you knew the day before, and you will always have the option to take a mental step back and reorient yourself as your situation evolves. 

If you believe you're going to be working at McDonald's your whole life, then you are incorrectly (and unfairly) resigning yourself to a simplified understanding of time, and you are underestimating what you might learn in your first job or two after graduating. At any point in time for the rest of your life, no one will be able to stop you from developing a plan or changing course. No one will be able to stop you from growing spiritually or expanding your network. You will take your life day by day, because everyone does. You will have the option to stagnate or grow as a human being. 

Having not taken the college route, you have admittedly made the beginning of your adult life a bit more difficult and existential. This is why so many people go to college--to make their lives a bit easier, to hopefully avoid financial difficulty. You will need to save your money smarter and for longer than some of your friends. But this difficulty will keep you sharp and hungry in a period of time where many of your friends are sitting around, jerking off, waiting for a diploma to satisfy the basic requirements for what might be a miserably boring office job in four years. They very well might become soft, dull versions of their former selves. If you want to do yourself right, you will use that same span of time to create real value for yourself. If you take it day by day, you can snowball your life into something truly admirable. But you have to show up for it. No one (NO ONE) can do it for you."
9134,"First off, don't believe anything you see on the internet, people here like to complain and whine about life sucking, life is what you make of it. The people here who complain about life don't do anything to improve yourselves. Get off of this pessimisstic negative circlejerk subreddit and site, trust me, this place is not good for your mental health. You can still go to college, go to community college or enlist in trade school if you can."
9135,"Trust me you’ll have some of the best times whether you’re working at McDonald’s or going to an Ivy League college or your local community college. Life is about the journey. You are experiencing the transition to adulthood when you already know that things aren’t so easy out here, and trust me, you’re like ten steps ahead of most people older than you with that mindset. My advice to you it’s dark now, but trust me, your path is yours to make don’t get discouraged just because it isn’t the traditional route to things. The 0s in your bank account don't measure success or the fancy papers on the wall. It’s about your character, your struggles, who you strive to be, and the history you leave behind.


I worked straight out of high school. Found a decent job with tuition assistance, I can take five classes a year on company dime at the local CC. At first, I took blow off classes. But along the way I got interested in a lot of different subjects and now I’m about six classes left to getting an associate that will transfer to a bachelor that I didn’t even pay even my textbooks were covered. 

Compared to my high school classmates that went to great schools have 4 year degrees and are working jobs making about the same amount as me. I have 0 debt while most people I know have 30K easy and they were working and paying off their debt while in school

You aren’t going to work at a dead-end job the rest of your life stop being so dramatic lol"
9136,"I would kill to be a sophomore again.

I'm the opposite as you are. I'm autistic but I'm great at making friends but I can't do any household stuff or pay bills because no one taught me that shit and I always fuck it up"
9137,"If it makes you feel any better, I just graduated college and I’m surprisingly really happy. I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I graduated high school but I figured it out in college via the experience it provided me! And now I’m working at a great internship (paid) while I wait to move to my career job!"
9138,"Your post and messages have been written fairly articulately. You’re clearly not a complete moron.

Even complete morons figure out how to function independently and pay bills. It’s really not very hard once you spend literally a few hours looking it up you’ll be fine.

Seriously you’ll be fine"
9139,"It sounds like you need a moment to just be down, but if you want to brainstorm some options I’m sure anyone in this thread will be happy to help. 

It’s a really rough time to graduate. It sucks to be hitting milestones right now. But college or McDonald’s aren’t the only paths."
9140,My friends parents worked at McDonald’s. Started at the very bottom. Stayed committed and worked their ways up. They now own over 5 McDonald’s. They went from a family in a one bedroom apartment to a giant ass house. If college isn’t for you then it’s not for you. Doesn’t mean you’re damned if you try hard enough.
9141,"Where is all this negativity coming from? You need to go see a therapist. Being 18 and graduating is an exciting time. You got the best years ahead of you. There' so many possibilities. Why haven't you thought about college? Go work minimum wage and maybe that will give you more motivation to give a shit. Idk how else to put it. 

As others have said, this sub is a circle jerk of negativity with people posting to feel better about themselves and then fishing for coping ""me too"" comments. or ""everyone is confused too"". That's BS. Many people have their shit together. 

Feelings are overrated. Get over it and take action to improve yourself. That negative attitude of yours is not going to get you anywhere."
9142,"This isn’t the full story. I’m in college right now and it’s so much better than high school. I have freedom. I make money on the side. I have almost no responsibilities and get to all the fun good parts of life. I also have friends who didn’t want to go to college but they loved horses and work on a farm and love it. Honestly, there is so much more out there in the world. 

I know it’s hard to imagine because I had an incredibly narrow minded view of the world in high school as well, especially as I attended a very small school.

You’ll find what you want to do. There is so many jobs out there that aren’t the standard 9-5 job or the cubicle job. There honestly are so many opproktunies in the world for you to do stuff."
9143,"Dude, you can still go to college! Plenty of people take a gap year! And you don’t even need to go to college to make it in life - just work hard and explore different fields! With enough experience you can get into most fields without a degree. This may sound cliche, but it really is all about your mindset. That, and your work ethic."
9144,People who are doing well after school are likely not going to join a subreddit called life after school because they are done with that and moving on with their lives. This is a biased sample. I think it would give you a better picture to look at subs in a field you’re interested in and see how that looks. I for one am thrilled that school is over because it was very stressful and not fun. But because I did that now I’ll have a stable job for the rest of my life so I guess it’ll pay off.
9145,"Yeah this is how I feel and I’m a sophomore lol. I don’t enjoy high school, and I don’t think I’ll enjoy life outside it. I am pretty independent with household stuff and finances but I’m autistic af and I’m terrible with relationships"
9146,"Took me a while to realise it for myself although you hear it so very often but everyone fucks up all the time. You can’t be scared to fail and that is so essential because everyone does, all the bloody time - although everyone seems capable and great at their jobs it’s just not so until they go through a period of not knowing what on earth is going on.

I’m 22. I was like you, finished high school when I was 17 and fucking hated it. Didn’t know what I wanted out of life and I was depressed and didn’t really care much for anything. So many existential thoughts. Started uni at 18, did half a year and just fell apart. Started smoking weed everyday, partying heaps, was depressed which turned into social anxiety with panic attacks because of the weed making me paranoid and not able to communicate properly, but just didn’t stop. Obviously that fucked up my uni and eventually my part time job too. That was from about the ages of 19-mid22. 

Didn’t think it’d ever get better. But it does. Just keep going through the motions. You’ll see, I promise you, the passing of time and the maturity that comes with it reveals paths you didn’t think existed. Just don’t turn to drugs to make yourself feel occupied... not saying don’t take them, but keep it as a healthy relationship - nothing wrong with that."
9147,"People have mentioned all sorts of things to do, but if you think that college is something you want to try, even if it seems impossible, try going to community college. It's really cheap, and you can really take your time getting through gen ed and prerequisites. From there, you can transfer to a 4 year unviersity"
9148,"no matter where you are, life is the thing you take with you inside your head. just remember that your mindset can completely change how you see your physical surroundings. I always think about how some tv characters have mediocre jobs and mediocre living situations yet their lives are more colourful than mine will ever be."
9149,"If you think you can or can’t do something, you’re right."
9150,"Just because you don't know what you want to do, doesn't mean you never will. I wish I had taken some time to figure stuff out before jumping into a degree, and you have that chance. 

Get a job, any job, live frugally and figure out what is actually worth spending money on to you when you have almost none - that will help you find what's important to you. Get a second job. Volunteer. Learn from your jobs and keep moving so you can learn from new environments. 

Drop your pride and focus on what fulfills you (hint: it won't be other people's approval or your public image). Macdonalds actually has scholarship programs and there are plenty of smaller businesses without the standardized processes that will be much worse to work for. 

Keep track of what you do and don't like. Working hours, commute, type of people, industry standards, etc. Save your money for pursuing what you like (you might eventually need further education and you will never be too old for it, trust me).

Even if you just figure out that you don't want to work in the craziness of retail or food services, this will motivate you to just pick something else with better conditions and power you through the journey to get there. 

And finally, try to stay positive - you literally guarantee your failure by being negative and giving up before you have even begun."

9156,"Economics, not Finance. (I'm Irish, not sure how big a difference Americans have between the two majors.)

I graduated in Sep 19. In October 19, got a job in one of the main private asset managers and worked there for 8 months. I changed jobs recently, by choice, and started in a large MNC that deal primarily with Hedge Fund Administration. 

I haven't been remotely impacted by the Coronavirus and if anything, my career has benefited a lot from it. More work as the Front Office in every institution is trading more to try recoup losses. This increase in work = much more demand for new hires. I changed jobs and got a pretty significant pay rise + better benefits too. Work from home suits me to a T, company sorted me with all the equipment needed. 

Overall, my work life balance has been fantastic. Rarely if ever do overtime, and when I do my managers push me to finish ASAP. I found this stereotype of 60+ hours/week in Finance to be untrue. It's more like 37.5 to 40 on a bad week.

If you had told me in May 19, that I'd be where I am now I wouldn't believe you."
9157,"I got a job as a credit analyst at a regional bank, didn’t love it and wasn’t paid great, so I went back to school after a year and got an MBA, passed the CPA, and work in audit at one of the big firms. Looking back I didn’t appreciate the work/life balance the bank offered and there’s a good argument to be made that I shouldn’t have gone back to school, but my earning  potential is a lot higher now so idk."
9158,"Talks about work life balance, then goes to audit with the big four. Absolute clown hours."
9159,"Still studying, hope it works out. At the moment I’m making 500+ a week doing stocks I wonder if I should even waste my time any more with school and just open a business. But I’ve already got 80 credits might as well finish the last 40. 

To be honest everything I learned about investing,  or running a business. I’ve learned from scum bags, old men, and YouTube.. nothing from school"
9160,Not a finance major but work at one of the largest financial firms as a data analyst. I love working in the field. Amazing work life balance. They pay well and good benefits. The work can be a little dull but I do enjoy the stress free environment.
9161,"Yeah, I’m not saying I didn’t fuck up lol. I’ll be promoted to senior next month and as soon as I get the new title I’ll be exploring exit opportunities."
9162,"FP&A is pretty chill. A little over a year with the company now, getting ready to possibly change up the BU I support. Full P&L responsibility is enjoyable. Trying to pay off some debt before I go back to get my MBA. Thinking a few years of experience + an MBA is the way to go instead of rushing it.

To reiterate on the top comment, if you’re in undergrad now: intern, intern, intern. You’ll likely learn more in 6 months of an internship than your entire time in class."
9163,What school did you go to?
9164,"University College Dublin and also a year in University of Bergen, Norway."
9165,"Great question.

I got really lucky because my company had a student work program where I worked at for 1.5 years before being full time. They assign you a random business unit and you learn from the ground up.

Some companies have a temp job program where you can apply to be whatever position you have and you can work with the business group for 6 months and they can then bring you on. That would be what I recommend you do if you have already graduated. Just look for keywords in the description like SQL"
9166,Accounting grad. Just got a job recently and now I’m wondering if I can change to anything that doesn’t require working with numbers
9167,"How does one start the path of a data analyst? I ended up as a staff accountant but would love to switch to data, I enjoy using SQL"
9168,"I think my Uni followed American style for GPA. Perfect 100% in everything was 4.2. I graduated with about 3.3. I think it averages out to a B standard on average. (A- is 70% in Ireland. Rarely ever hear of anyone getting above an A, never heard of anyone getting an A+ on overall module grade.) 

No relevant experience. I worked in bars/restaurants during college and in my final year worked in a warehouse with SOME experience in office / cash office. 

I networked a lot with my college classmates and really over tailored / prepared my CV + interview skills for whatever job I was applying for. I think this helped a lot.  

Dublin is also a fantastic place to get a job in Finance. (Tech too, they call us Silicon Valley 2 lol) It's a shame the rent is so high here."
9169,"Ended up working for a small audit consulting firm. Base salary isn’t great but quarterly commission is uncapped. After three years my annual commission has averaged ~67% of my base. Benefits are great, between PTO, company holidays, and our health related time off incentive program I have about 7 weeks of time off. I’m single and they pay for my health insurance and cover the bulk of my deductible with an HSA contribution. Also contribute 3% of total comp to 401k annually. 

I haven’t done anything finance related in years, and I have no desire."
9170,Positions?
9171,"Oh shit nice, I just finished my ERASMUS at UCD."
9172,It was really nice. Enjoyed the Econ classes quite a bit. It’s just a shame tho because my Erasmus was supposed to be jan-May 2020 🙃
9173,"Graduated  May 2019. Working in Big 4 in Internal Audit. Honestly, I don't really like the work, a little boring, and the job focuses on risk, compliance, internal controls, etc rather than actual finance.  I took it because it was the highest salary offer I got and it's a good resume builder.

I'm taking my CFA Level I this December. Hopefully, I can pass and see if I can branch out and do something more within actual finance.

EDIT: To talk a bit on the positives, I like my team and I probably work only 40 hours a week on average which is good. It also makes me think critically sometimes, which I like being challenged."

9175,"Hmm that sounds enticing. I’ll have to see, since I’ll be done with my studies this September"
9176,"Adding in: 

> Edit: I don't think it has to be the end of your studies either. People usually do it for internships abroad etc. Most Unis offer it but don't organise it, so you just have to apply yourself.

Regardless, I wish you the best!"
9177,Working security at kaiser. No door open whatsoever in the field :c
9178,"Studying for my CFA, hope it pays off"
9179,"Accounting grad here. IMO, getting a CPA license is overrated. You have to go through a few years pf absolute hell in public accounting and then keep your certification every year. Not to mention the actual test itself.

I got my bachelors, went to a F500, and I’m on the same salary track as most of my peers who went public. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
9180,"Internal controls sucked the life out of me, pays well tho"
9181,Haha no way seriously? How did you find it?
9182,"Ah no! That's awful, I feel so sorry for you! If it is any conciliation to you, there is also an opportunity to do another Erasmus at the end of your studies and you will still receive a certain % of grant money. Maybe you won't come back to Ireland but I would still recommend going somewhere and using this opportunity!

Edit: I don't think it has to be the end of your studies either. People usually do it for internships abroad etc. Most Unis offer it but don't organise it, so you just have to apply yourself."
9183,"Anyone here in financial advising/consulting? 2nd year undergrad that would love to hear from someone in the field. I love helping people without much income manage/grow their wealth to at least get out of the “paycheck to paycheck” cycle. Ideally I would like to do that as a free side project for people whilst managing finances for commissions at a bigger firm. Would anyone know the proper path one should take in that regard? 




As far as my thought process goes I’m looking to become a teller at a bank and shadow other positions to gain experience in the field as a resume builder for an internship over this year (plus the pay is much higher than retail.) however I’ve read that transitioning from commercial to corporate banking is difficult. Unsure about where to start."
9184,I’m a finance major running a small online business. Really the issue in taking that plunge for full-time work is where your next dollar comes from as you are attempting to grow. Looking to work in a bank atm and move up to financial advising whilst still managing this business and investing. Live off dividends when I’m old.
9185,Is moving in with roommates an option? The relationship dynamic is different because you are not living in someone else's home but cohabitating in a shared home. That coukf both address financial and siciak concerns
9186,"As for why moving out isn't an option for me, let's just say that I have to get a different job, before I can move out. 

Thanks for your advice; I appreciate it. I do want to get my own apartment, but that has to wait for now. I agree with what you said, and happy Thanksgiving to you, as well."
9187,Had no idea about friends mode - does that work for any gender?
9188,"Haven’t seen this yet, thanks!"
9189,"I wouldn't mind moving in with roommates, but I can't move out now."
9190,Make a plan then including putting money back
9191,"For making friends, start with our [How To Meet People After School](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/wiki/making_friends) guide."
9192,"I'm in your same boat. Graduated in May and still no job to speak of in my field or otherwise. I've sent out dozens of applications and have only really begun hearing back from two places I'm not excited about. Beyond that, it's a lot of rejections and silence. I can't bring myself to wait tables or work at a store, either; it makes it feel like all that time and money would've been for nothing. The job market is swamped with inexperienced college grads looking for jobs that want several years of experience to get a decent salary. It sucks but I'm holding out hope that something will come along."
9193,"In option 2 you said your degree will not being used. Can I ask how? I am a MIS major and my internship has recently made me a junior business analyst/project manager. That role is exactly why I choose my degree. What job title were you looking to land post grad? 

Also I would pick either option 1 or 2. The best time to search for a job is when you’re already employed. It shows companies you’re employable. Any job would be suffice at showing that. Other wise they will question why you haven’t been working."
9194,Thank you for your help!
9195,"In option 2 I'd be working at a local wholesale business. I'd mostly be working as someone that restocks, as a cashier, etc. As far as I know they don't have anything relevant to management nor information technology I could pursue. I'd have to discuss with my contact more in-depth about this though. 

What was I looking for post grad? Something along the lines of IT support to tell you the truth. Honestly, I just wanted to give people an answer since I was quite in a dark place during my junior and senior year of college. I could have done more. When your motivation and strive is as low as ""hey dude, you got out of bed, went to class, and did some homework"" it's abysmal. Open researching though, I feel Business Analyst seems like something I could be associated with. 

Thank you for the reply. I appreciate it."
9196,"Job hopping is seen as a flag period, your excuse why if asked is what decides it’s color. 

As a employer if you see someone has been job hopping odds are your position is just another stepping stone, so do you want to deal with that? If there good what can you do to try to keep ‘em? There’s a lot of factors that go into it."
9197,Have you tried using a recruiter? I graduated in June and was struggling to get any responses to job applications so finally I just started connecting and messaging recruiters on LinkedIn. Started working with one in San Francisco (I’m in Austin) and had a high paying entry level job landed in 3 weeks because of the recruiter. They make money off of placing us with employers so they’re motivated. I recommend.
9198,"I did meet with him. He was very helpful. Although since I live 2 hours away from my university, I feel that meeting with them may be a challenge. I could send it via email. 

Thank you."
9199,"I would do option 2 since your part time it would give you time to learn all the technology you said you wanted to learn and schedule job interviews. 

then you can keep option 1 as a good reference to have. If you go back and leave after a month they may be upset ( obviously I don’t know for sure)"
9200,"I think option 2 is the best option. I’ve heard that it’s easier to get a job when you have a job (might be a myth, but even a job in a store would help!) I think it won’t make things for you now amazing, but it’ll be better. 

Out of curiosity (because I’m graduating this semester with the same degree) did you not learn hard skills commonly associated with being a business analyst (or just IT in general while you were in school? And were all the resumes you were sending jobs out for only for a business analyst? 

Also, did you already reach out to employees at your previous internship to see if they could connect you with someone else they know at another company that might be hiring?"
9201,"Job experience is king. A degree just shows you have intelligence, a experience shows you know what you are doing and won’t require as much training. Bulk up the resume with applicable experience and then start applying, have at least 2 years of real work experience. That should make it easier. Plus there is a married man effect in play. and that is you will get more job offers if you have one, just like how some women prefer men that are already taken."
9202, Thank you for the reply. Yes I am in America.
9203,"I haven't tried a recruiter yet. I'll see what's around me. Relocation is not something I'd wish to do, so I'd want to stay local."
9204,Thank you for your advice. I don't think I'll be there for a month. It'll probably be a 6 month period before I find anything.
9205,"The other avenue of MIS that was offered does include skills that help people to become a business analyst. That avenue was much more technical. I didn't go with that since I wanted to be out within 4 years, since I was at a very low point in my life. 

The resumes I have been sending out have been related to IT support. So technicians, and specialists.  

I did reach out to previous employees. Big issue was, not knowing what the hell I wanted to do with myself."
9206,Are you in a city or more of a small town?
9207,Small town of 25k. City next to me is 200k.
9208,Option 1 or 2 while doing 3 at the same time.
9209,Look for jobs at Netcracker like a Business Analyst
9210,Option 1 while in your spare time you focus on option 3
9211,"I'd go with the temporary job at the store because the cons of the business you interned at sound horrible, and the store would leave you more time to search for jobs/work on other skills. It doesn't sound like it's much further away, if at all, than the business job, either."
9212,Thank you for the reply!
9213,"I see, interesting. I guess technicians/specialists are positions that usually require technical experience, unless you’re just going for the position that answers the phone and talks people through simple questions.

Did you meet with your school’s career counseling office before you left? I went and found it beneficial because they can tweak everything about your resumes/cover letters and try to help you find a career path. Sometimes they have assessments to take which are kind of fun. Since you’re alumni you can go back since it’s kind of their job to help you lol.

Just a thought, but good luck in the future!"
9214,"I completely agree!! I do NOT miss being a student at all. So much more free time now, plus I have money which is amazing!"
9215,Currently getting my soul sucked out of me by university. Hopefully I'll be done by December and I'll be free as well!
9216,"This is comforting to me. One of my coworkers keeps telling me that things will only get harder after school which is crushing to hear.

But knowing that there could be an end, that it can get easier afterwards, that if I work hard enough I’ll be able to step back and breathe at some point; it helps me keep going."
9217,"Reminds me of architecture school. No sleep. No social life. Work around the clock while being told your highest aspiration is to be a slave once you get out of school for peanuts at an office with a big name. Joke was that in our field, you learn that there are more than 24 hours in a day.

A bit over 3 years out of masters and it's an anomaly that I'm not home by 6 (home being my own apartment in a desirable neighborhood), I have what I need saved up for a down payment, go hiking and to breweries every weekend and have an amazing girlfriend to spend my time with. Suffice to say, school and being in the workforce are worlds apart. Good on you for finally breaking out of the school mentality- may G-d grace you with only good things to come."
9218,This is what i try to remember at timeswhen i am like 'wtf am i doing' compared to college when i was always on the grind :D enjoy it!
9219,"Yeah, it getting harder is definitely not the case for everyone! There are a lot more responsibilities, but they are far less stressful in my experience so far."
9220,"Oh yeah social media has definitely made things a lot worse. Seeing people from college/high school with these seemingly great jobs and just seeming so happy, meanwhile I feel like I’m on the verge of tears all the time. 

I know a lot of people def go through this, but the added isolation of covid is pushing it the extreme. I would love to travel more as soon as this is over, but I just have no plan and I feel so overwhelmed"
9221,"Just here to say I’m also in a similar-ish situation. I graduated in May with a psych degree and had a psych-related job fall through so I worked a retail job for the summer until I quit it around August. I’ve been unemployed ever since, living with my parents, and have generally just felt pretty depressed for a good couple of months. I also haven’t kept in very consistent contact with any of my college friends and I’ve been pretty socially isolated outside of interacting with my family members. I’m just now starting to pick myself back up though, gradually. Trying to just secure any work for the time being so I can save money to move out. 

Anyways, I guess my advice would be to try not to compare yourself to your peers/friends. Definitely easier said than done, but just remember life isn’t a race or a competition. Try your best to focus on yourself rather than worrying about how much “better” you perceive others to be doing. 

As for mental health, have you considered seeing a therapist? I’m seeing a therapist right now and I’ve found it generally helpful. Going has also made me feel a little less isolated, so maybe it could benefit you in some way as well? Also just making sure you’re taking good care of yourself- things like making sure you get enough sleep, eating regular meals, getting some exercise...every bit helps. Also what kind of coping strategies do you have for when you feel stressed out? My go-to is journaling, but I also recently started meditating and doing yoga and it’s honestly really helped improve my overall mood.

Also in terms of wanting to travel and get out there, the peace corps could definitely do that. Also I’m assuming (?) you live in the US (sorry if I’m mistaken), and if so you might want to check out americorps too. They involve volunteering around the US, and I believe you live on-site, wherever your service area happens to be. Sorry I think I’ve rambled enough but I hope something here is helpful!"
9222,"Ireland here, not America - I did pretty much this, it's a fucking handy gig! The best of both worlds, front office be too high stress for me personally, generous salary, no 70+ hour weeks and relatively little stress apart from meeting short term deadlines. Client side is even better"
9223,"Also everyone told us this would be the best time of our lives and so far it's awful! I don't have any plan either but I think it's better to do literally anything than continue doing nothing and thinking about what to do. And I would rather waste my time by doing the wrong thing and making the wrong decisions than waste it by just doing nothing and overthinking all the time. 

The isolation has been hard though. I was using bumble bff to meet some people. It's kind of awkward, but it helps!"
9224,"I like to journal too, I’ve also been seeing a therapist for the past year which does help a little too. I’ll definitely look into AmeriCorps though, that does sound like it could be interesting!"
9225,Get off of social media!! A lot of those people are probably miserable too and just putting on a curated front for people.
9226,"Seems like all the current answers are about how to deal with your current situation instead of how to fix it.

Spend time exploring what you want to do. You're young and majored in a pretty broad field. In a year or two you could go to any kind of grad school you want (if the loans are a concern, look into PSLF programs) or switch careers by picking up the right skills online or through volunteer work.

None of us can tell you what kind of work you want to do, but it sounds like you have friends working jobs you think are amazing so you probably have some idea of where you want to be. Or just think about people you admire or articles you read that were interesting. Once you identify that it's easy to start working toward that goal.

Having long and short term goals fights depression. It gives you something to plan for and hope for. If you don't have any goals, you keep drifting aimlessly."
9227,Love to hear it! I’m in corporate finance myself but just 2 years of experience so a long journey ahead 😎
9228,I’m going to be in that situation soon. I’m looking into teaching English or science in Thailand since I lived there previously for a year and speak a bit of Thai already. They have lots of positions in Korea and in China also . Maybe something that would interest you.
9229,"Yeah, I guess it just comes down to stepping out of your comfort zone which I tend to have trouble doing 😅 but I’m glad you’re pushing yourself to meet new people!"
9230,What's the demand like?
9231,maybe join military as an officer. Do you exercise/run? I saw online it releases endorphins that makes you feel happier and it definitely works
9232,"You gotta have a sit down with your folks. This is a wacky place for everyone and everyone needs to find some middle ground for your situation. I can't comment too much since I don't know your parents, but just try to show them the importance of maintaining your independence while continuing to respect their home."
9233,"I totally get how you're feeling. I worked my ass off through college and graduated in December of 2018, still living at home. Lost my job due to covid and my industry is gone. I feel like I'm 15 again. I have a job I'm waiting on hearing back from, but having things to do every day has helped.
Find anything, literally anything, to do each day. Give yourself a list. Doing that has helped a lot. Keeping busy."
9234,I know this isn’t helpful but I lived with my parents for a year after I graduated and the only thing that helped was moving out :)
9235,But yeah I seriously don't like living with my parents. They treat me like a CHILD. I mean I guess I still am but ya kno. For example they just burst into my room without knocking and it pisses me off. Other things as well.
9236,That's a really good idea. Thanks!
9237,"22 living with parents checking in, glad others are in my position, my mom expects me to come down just to see her like a trained dog whenever she calls my name. OP reverting to bad habits and mindsets due to being treated like a child after moving back in hits uncomfortably close to him no pun intended"
9238,"Make sure you're doing nice little things like helping around the house, making/buying some meals, etc. Will make them feel much better about having you around"
9239,Good to know there's others suffering as well!
9240,"> gotta have a sit down with your folks

I agree this is the pragmatic thing to do, but you have to be willing to listen as much as you speak. And listen to what they're *not* saying just as much as what they are saying. Because, chances are, they value and want to protect their relationship with you, but if they feel you don't value it as much as they do, that could cause some friction, and potentially even resentment."
9241,"Im a filthy 26 yo, graduated from college and burnt out massively even before i looked for work.

Wake up early.
Do a routine that is work/something you dont want to do... like jogging, doing dishes, and study.

Also work on self improvement in general too."
9242,An inconvenient truth we all need to hear
9243,"Start working out, go the gym, fill your time.

Just something to get you out of the house and have some semblance of independence. I moved back in after graduating in 2019, moving out again next month (hopefully for the last time but we'll see)."
9244,"24 years old and i hate it, parents still treat me like a child, when i want to become an adult. Helicopter/controlling parenting is not cute, it's irritating and annoying. They never talk about finances, and think you can't survive adulthood, i can survive adulthood fine, they just want to control you."
9245,I hope OP has a tent.
9246,"A good friend of mine moved back in with his parents at the start of the summer due to COVID. He told me that one of the most important things he does is make his own meals weekday nights. He’ll spend weekends with his parents as though it were a normal visit, but otherwise he still cooks what he’d like with his own groceries in his own time. It’s been a great way for him to maintain a major part of independence you get when moving out. He said he felt like he’d revert to old habits and get lazy if he began to let things like preparing his own food and cleaning up after his own dinner, doing his own laundry, and doing things without letting his parents know. He’s trying to behave as though he’s a roommate, not their child, and it seems to be working pretty well for him."
9247,Wanted to emphasize the walks. Vitamin D and fresh air can do wonders for the mood.
9248,"Similar situation here. I always avoided coming home during college breaks if I could because I just fell into a lot of old bad habits and didn't feel like I had the opportunities I wanted here. (I also had a somewhat tense relationship with my parents though in high school that lingered into college.)

I am somewhat grateful that COVID has given me a chance to stop running away and to actually face the problems I've been having. A few things that have helped:

\- We set up our storage room to be an ""office"" for me (it has a folding chair and a folding table) so I don't have to do work on my bed anymore like a school child. (Though I still do...)

\- We share dinners as a family but I feel like buying my own food made me feel more like a functioning adult with an independent life

\- I started getting back into working out when I was at home and eventually running, and it's been enormously helpful to have a safe way to get out of the house, especially on the longer runs when I've been able to explore new parts of town and feel more independent.

For some time I was also looking into long-term stays at Airbnbs to stay in until grad school starts. It was a little too pricey to be worth it to me but if you're especially antsy it might not be a bad idea. (Especially if you can split the cost with someone else.)"
9249,"It's very helpful. especially if you have old school strict helicopter parents who still try to dictate your life in your 20s, because it's their house, their rules. F that, if you get the chance, move out, i cant wait to move out."
9250,"Yes I was trying to get that across, but you put it in much better words than me."
9251,we're all together in the same horrible pandemic boat. i have a good relationship with my parents when i'm not in the same house as them but the longer i'm here the more suppressed i feel. i'm getting away asap because there's simply no other option and if it's at all possible you should give it serious thought
9252,Yeah I recommend gym + biking + photography.
9253,Ah sometimes I forget most people on this sub are in the US.
9254,"Depends on how your parents treat you, and if they are old school, strict, controlling, and hellicopterish to a point that r/raisedbynarcissists rings a bell, start planning and finding a way out of the house, if you have any money, save it for your future move out date. It's only temporary, it's not forever, just tell yourself that, one day you will be able to move out. Im in the exact same spot as you are in, 24 years old, and living with old school strict controlling parents ain't fun, it destroys your mental health. Most of the times, it's okay, i just do my own thing now, but i can't wait to move out."
9255,"I think trying to have things that your parents know bother you. For example, I’m not always hungry when my mom makes dinner and she doesn’t make me eat dinner with the family if I’m not hungry. It’s weird but it’s like a respect thing for me because I don’t like eating when I’m not hungry. My dad is difficult af and honestly just avoiding him at all costs is the move"
9256,"It really depends on how your parent(s) is/are... Lived with my parents pre-pandemic for a bit and it was tough; I found I didn’t get along with them as well as I used to. Disagreement on my end usually was seen as disrespect, so it was difficult to have productive conversations. On top of that, one of my parents exhibits a few controlling behaviors due to some issues and even though I tried to help out sometimes, they’d want to do things themselves. Constant nagging. I love to cook for example but it was very difficult to do that at home without stepping on toes, so to speak. My family home is also in a rural area so there was nothing to do unless you drove out and I had really only a friend or two back home. I coped really by staying in my space (my room) and avoiding being around them/not engage during times of high tension. Of course there were times I did enjoy their company but it took constant effort to navigate just because I changed a lot after college and became more assertive and I don’t think they were expecting or liked that. They also liked their own space!"
9257,"""go to the gym""? um... we're in a pandemic? We can't do that?

I agree that getting out of the house is very important. The thing is that it is very hard to do that now, while still following pandemic safety guidelines. Can't hang out with friends, go to the gym, etc.  I've found bike riding and walks/running are saving me, but I fear for what I'll do in the winter."
9258,"The irrational mindset of the parents in this situation is highlighted, as you say, by the idea the child does not value the relationship. The only thing causing resentment is unrealistic and and vague expectations that are entirely selfish."
9259,Ahh forgive me for coming across as America-centric!  I didn’t realize other countries were far enough along to be opening gyms safely though
9260,I love this idea! I will be graduating with my second degree very soon and it will be nice to have this subreddit.

I am considering the sales aspect of it, or any aspect really, as I’m about to graduate in a few days with a degree in Biology. I’ve heard recently that my degree isn’t as useful in that realm without a graduate degree so I was wondering if that’s generally true because it was kinda discouraging to hear. But biotech seems interesting and any info would be awesome! No worries if no advice to give, cool to see someone in the field though!"
9263,Same! I’m graduating in ten days and I don’t even know what to put on my cap!
9264,Lol can I mod? I actually have some experience and can add stuff such as an faq?

9275,What kind of FAQ were you thinking of?
9276,"This sub experienced a huge increase in growth over the last two days, so we've had a lot of different people posting their experiences. At this time it seems like there are a lot of positive posts as well (and people commenting good advice). As the sub grows I'm hoping we can strike a balance between the positivity and negativity. :)"
9277,Sorry to hear about the trouble you’re having. It’s good you have a blog and are getting your writing out there. I would recommend creating your own post to get responses!
9278,"It’s a transition, and it can hard, but life isn’t all doom and gloom!"
9279,"There’s a very hard ceiling for many of the management/administrative job levels or the lead roles like PI that require a MS, PhD, MD, etc. However, you can work your way to lab manager with just a BS. There’s also other positions available down the line but they’ll require years Of experience in the industry. 

I have my BS and got a job at a hospital research core after just applying everywhere I could. I got 5 offers in the end at various companies but this was the best offer considering location, the actual work, pay, benefits, etc. 

I’m an associate in a team that manufactures research-grade iPSCs and DiMNs for sale to commercial or academic institutions. We also sell our services in case a group wants custom iPSCs. 

My two cents worth: try to get some lab experience on your resume, preferably not academic. I had about 4 1/2 years worth of academic on mine a that just got me in the door but I still had to start at entry level. 

The pay isn’t great but the hours are decently flexible. The work is also meaningful, if routine, as many of these biotech projects are to study and eventually cure diseases. But the main focus on biotech is manufacturing of technologies (pills, cells, metabolites, reagents, etc)"
9280,"Things like getting a job, stuff to do to get ready for college like finding a roommate and stuff. Pretty much things that come after you get accepted."

To exacerbate my problem, I have ADHD and possibly mild autism.  I have struggled with doing the right thing in interviews and getting places on time.  

The friend I relied on for this type of advice turned out to be emotionally manipulative and we've stopped talking for the time being.  My friends don't know what to do.  My parents don't know either and are not exactly a big help.  

My Dad wants me to live at home forever.  He is emotionally distant, but over-protective and doesn't think I'm capable of taking care of myself despite the fact that I have lived abroad and lived on my college campus (with emotional difficulties but I still made it).  I think he feels guilty for neglecting me for most of my life due to his addiction, but that's another story.

Point is that I have a lot working against me.  God has something for me.  I believe that, but it's not easy.  Advice would be helpful.  I'm almost 26 and worried I'm running out of time.  I just want to be an adult who can financially support herself."
9290,"I always say to be happy, you need 3 things to look forward to: one per day, one per week, one per month or two. 

The daily thing just helps you get through the day. A cup of coffee in the morning, an afternoon walk, a good book to enjoy. 

The weekly thing will help you with sundays Scaries. Maybe having a weekly game night on Monday will mean when it’s Sunday you’re actually excited. You can have multiple of these per week, but you need a balance as well. 

The longer term things breaks up the monotony of life. Take that vacation. Go to the wedding. See that sports game. These are things you can be excited by, that you get to let loose at and enjoy the fruits of your labor. 

Otherwise, keep improving yourself. There’s no end to that, but you always are growing."
9291,"I’m in a similar boat and still trying to figure things out. My parents are great but didn’t encourage me to learn about many career paths when I was younger. I really enjoy the structure school provides. I work full time and ended up going for a master’s a few years ago and am now taking healthcare-related college courses because that’s the field I’ve always wanted to go into. That being said, it’s helpful to be social or have a partner that I can do enjoyable activities with. Of course, it can take work to find good activities and friends, but once you have those you can kind of build your own structure. You really have to help yourself — put yourself in uncomfortable situations where you can grow and learn more about yourself and the world because no one is going to find purpose for you. Best of luck to us both — may we both find something more purposeful soon!"
9292,"You’re not alone, I’m in the exact same boat as you. I graduated in May and I sometimes find myself missing the student life for all the reasons you listed. That, and also because it allowed me to live in a protective bubble. Life after school isn’t talked about enough, and I feel disillusioned that nobody warned me that graduates could feel like this.

I do have goals as I’m trying to get my small business off the ground, but it’s different from school because there aren’t any specific milestones for me to hit (at least, none that I’m aware of at the moment). What I do gives me a sense of fulfillment, but the uncertainty of it all gives me anxiety. I don’t know if I’ll be successful with this small business and eventually earn a comfortable living. But I’m just making it up as I go along, giving myself mini-goals like learning how to create a specific item and completing commissions.

However, it helps for me to know that nobody has their life completely figured out—even the most successful people. Nobody can predict the future, and all we can do is learn to adapt to the current circumstances. I assume you’re not 100% committed to the job you have right now, so it could be beneficial for the both of us to view our period of uncertainty as a time to experiment. Seek out another job, find out what makes you happy, learn that new skill you’ve been putting off, and set goals for yourself. But if long-term goals feel too abstract right now, at least create some short-term goals—even if it’s something as simple as going on a 10-minute walk each day or reading for 5 hours each month.

Best of luck to you. I know you and I can get through this."
9293,You're supposed to create your own artificial goals
9294,"Set goals friend. I don’t have a house yet, that’s my next one lol"
9295,"I had the same issue. It took a while for me to shift from the more goal-oriented mindset of school to a more..I guess everyday enjoyment mindset? I don’t even have a name for it. I find enjoyment in working out after work and feeling stronger, or doing a hobby after work. I value simple things like cooking dinner or taking care of myself. I find that there’s a lot of freedom in adult life. Freedom to explore what makes you happy, what hobbies you want to focus on and improve, or what side hustles you want to do. It’s all up to you! Which friends do you want to hang out with, what do you want to focus on to make your life meaningful, what have you always wanted to do?"
9296,"I gasped when I scrolled and saw this title because I said those exact words to someone last night. I realized I should probably do one of two things:

a) Go into a job that has more structure, specifically something with a ticketing system (Customer Support, Data Analyst, QA Engineer, etc). That way I’d have a queue of things to do and I can measure my progress by the number of tickets completed.

b) Go back to school to get a role that feels like a satisfying end point. Like someone else in this thread, I’m looking into healthcare now because I’m hypothesizing that getting a role in that field will feel more satisfying that continuously climbing up the corpo ladder. Unsure if that’ll be true though, which is why I’m networking and about to start applying for admin roles in healthcare so that I can get a peek inside that world before committing.

Just like you, my biggest worry about staying in corporate is that I’m just going to flounder around because I currently don’t have an end goal, and no role feels like something I want to strive for. I like other people’s advice in this thread about finding a monetary goal to drive your work or just having a goal separate from work entirely. But, I still feel like personally I’d need to find _some_ level of satisfaction with the work itself, so I’m with you in this struggle. I hope you’re able to find what works for you!"
9297,Yes this is me too - and I still havent got a handle of all the adult stuff like mortgages etc. Scary (but fun thing( is you have to xreate that end goal - there is no right or wrong answer and while i dont advocate going fully yolo remember - you never know what tomorrow might bring
9298,"I created structure by prioritizing the gym, setting goals, finding a career that was different from my degree but more enjoyable, and pushing towards goals that are aligned with where I want to be in 5, 10, 15 years."
9299,"It depends. It sounds like you don’t want to live at home but could tolerate it. If you would otherwise be paying $1,000/month in rent (for example) and now won’t be, if you could stomach a year, that’s $12,000 you can put directly towards the principle of the loans. 

On the other hand, me personally, I can’t really put a price tag on not living at home at that age. Even when I was broke as hell I preferred having no money to living at home. I had no freedom, nothing to do in spare time because of where I lived, and I had to deal with getting into arguments constantly with my family. Now I spend a shit-ton on living expenses but don’t have to do that, so it’s worth it to me.

Edit: Also keep in mind there is a lot more to having your own place than just the rent. There’s small things that are easy to overlook such as having to buy furniture, paying for internet/utilities, keeping the house clean, etc."
9300,I’m going to be honest. Reading your post reminded me of myself. I chose to live at home to save money and it was a poor decision. My mental health rapidly deteriorated. Budget things out and make it work and go get your life started. IMO not worth it.
9301,"You're an adult now. Take the advice under consideration, and make the decision on your own. 

Rent a place . The numbers work out fine, and it will make YOU happier."
9302,"I wouldn’t immediately put all income toward debt repayment. You probably want to build a decent chunk of savings and investments first. For example, I waited until I had $20k in cash/cash equivalents and $20k in stocks before I started paying off my undergrad debt, and it worked out really well. Now I have financial security in case I lose my job, and I can focus future income on stocks and property investments.

Of course, this assumes OP is rational and disciplined enough to actually go back and pay off the debt."
9303,"I lived at home during college and a few years after graduating. I believe it gave me a leg up as I didn't have student loans (I worked through college to pay for my tuition) and I was able to save money quicker. 

I finally moved out at 26 right into a house that I bought. I am currently 28 enjoying my freedom and knowing that if I moved out sooner, there is no way I would have been able to buy my house. So weigh your options and see what makes sense for you. A healthy mind is worth a lot and that shouldn't be forgotten too."
9304,"And more productive for the job. I had to move out because my parents have lunch anytime between 11h and 15h, so it gets impossible for me to follow their schedule as I need to eat exactly at 13h as I'm working from home."
9305,"OP, maybe try looking for a friend that want to move out too so you could split the bill.

Saving early is important, but not at the cost of your mental health and work performance"
9306,"I was in a (shockingly) similar situation as you are a year ago. I decided to rent my own place, and for what it's worth I believe 100% this was the right decision. If you are concerned about saving money, rent a cheaper apartment. This will also give you a sense of how much ""actual"" money you have to budget and what your monthly expenses are.

IDK about your family life, but for me living at home was very limiting. Ex: can't bring back significant others, can't host parties for friends, must be cognizant of noise at early hours in the morning, etc.. Living the the parents will be very limiting to you 22 y/o lifestyle IMO.

If the commitment of a year long lease is the concern I would advise looking into month to month leases too!"
9307,"With a salary like that, I’d suggest staying at home, but only for a few months. Get a few months rent saved up and put the rest towards repaying your loan. I’ve had to move home after university and I don’t love it, but it gives you temporary security and a chance to build up savings. All the same, don’t stay any longer than you need to, if it’s gonna impact your mental health. Nothing is worth ruining your brain over"
9308,"Currently I’m in the same boat, just graduated (now that I think about it that was 6 months ago... fuck...), and struggling with living at my parents. I’ve been joking with my mom that it’s like the song from Tangled “when will my life begin.” I think it’s smart to save money up for when you can pay off your debt, but also money management is key. If you know how to manage your money well then I think you’re in a good situation to pay off loans while also moving out. As another person above said, save up money for a few months and then start to begin a conversation with your family about moving out, no surprises. I’ve been dropping hints every so often about looking for an apartment here or there and my parents have become receptive to that. 

Last bit of advice id give: this can be very stressful and hard for people (it is for me at least), so remember to take care of yourself, and find downtime between work and home stress OP!"
9309,"I would strongly recommend living at home for a year or two, if you can manage it. I would at least try it for a month or two. If it doesn’t work, you can always get your own place. If it does, you can save a significant amount of money. You can put a significant amount towards paying off your debt (or pay it off entirely, depending on how smart you are with your money and how long you stay). 

You can also save significantly for an emergency fund and retirement, and afford necessities and luxuries you might otherwise not be able to afford easily if you lived by yourself (new car, new laptop for work, new office-appropriate wardrobe, etc.). 

I don’t know how self-sufficient you are now, but you can also gain help and knowledge from your parents in terms of living by yourself, preparing for retirement, getting ready to move out to an apartment (maybe they have furniture or supplies they can pass down to you), cooking for yourself, dealing with insurance, doing taxes, etc. 

When you’re just starting out, some help in these areas can be crucial. Apartments can be expensive, especially if they’re non furnished, but at the end of the day I also understand what living with your parents is like and that you need to do what you need to do. 

If you move back with them, remember you’re an adult now who has a job and is capable of making your own decisions. I would try to evolve your relationship to one akin to roommates as much as possible if you live there rent-free. Contribute to the household, and buy and do your own things. 

Establish your own routine and lifestyle that is different from your high school one. You are not that person anymore. Use this time to discover new sights and activities in your hometown area, meet new people, develop more hobbies or interests, etc. You don’t have to spend a lot of time at home or with your family. You can be out a lot. That’s fine too. 

I would really try not to judge them for their choices. It’s a waste of your energy, in my opinion. They are their own people and it’s not your responsibility to change them. All you can do is control and change yourself. So if you don’t like how they eat, buy and cook your own food. That’s within your right and capabilities as an adult with an income."
9310,"You seem really thoughtful about the pros and cons about living at home. If you think you can tolerate living at home for a few months, it'll definitely help you save money to put a dent in the debt. But it can definitely be stressful to move back in after college. You're not a kid anymore, but there can be pressure to feel like you are."
9311,"I also got anxiety about living at home after school for the SAME reasons you listed. I did some research and worked on the anxiety and it’s made it much more bearable. 

I would say stay home if you can handle it. I have made net $70k since being home and have put $65k on debt. It’s been great. I’ll be home for another year or 2 before buying my first multi family. 

Granted I had to work on my anxiety because I had less of an option to not stay home. I had $165k in debt when I graduated in May 2019. Luckily at about $108k now"
9312,I am mentally scarred from moving back in with my parents. Avoid.
9313,"From a financial standpoint, it makes perfect sense to live with your parents for a little while to pay down your debt (it isn’t unrealistic to pay off your debt in full in two years without rent). However, if this would be very damaging to your mental health, you should probably get an apartment.

Maybe try living there for a few months, but tell your parents that you intend to leave eventually. If it works out, then don’t leave."
9314,"Move out. The point of an income is to spend it, so use yours to make yourself happy."
9315,"Congrats on getting the job man. 

As far as living on your own, I mean, on that salary you can do it in St. Louis. I was making similar money when I left school, but in Boston I don't think I could've done it with loan debt. I also had the pressure that my parents decided I wasn't coming back once I got my degree, but I was of a like mind with them on that and I got a job in a different state anyways so it was effectively irrelevant. Depends really on cost of living and whether you're willing to have roommates though. If you get roommates and don't live in the center of town, you're probably going to spend less than $900 a month in rent. If that's the case, you'll be able to pay off your loan debt if you're diligent. Also just factor in what your lifestyle is like- if you want to eat out every night or going traveling, it'll eat into whatever cash you save up. If you are spending on personal/lifestyle things, just realize that while you may still be able to pay off your student debt, that's money you haven't been putting into a savings or retirement account- you may be able to have a comfortable lifestyle, but you'll feel it at a certain point.

Sorry if that was verbose. Really though, if I could sum up any advice- ""know thyself"" as far as lifestyle and spending habits go, and think longterm. Everything has its tradeoffs. I can't blame you for not wanting to live at home, but definitely assess your options."
9316,"This maybe a different perspective from the advice some other have given, but it sounds like the issue you’re most focused on is the dynamics with your family. What if the hometown job doesn’t turn out to be what you had hoped? For many people, anxiety caused by a bad work situation is far worse than the examples you’ve given for your experience at home. The most ideal scenario would be that your job is all that you hoped for and you are able to afford your own place. But at 62K, it might be tough considering the average rent for a 1 bedroom apt is $1100 in St Louis. Your worst case scenario is that your job sucks and your apartment sucks leaving you on the hook for whatever lease term you signed up for. Considering these 2 extreme ends, you may want to consider the “middle” options which would give you the most flexibility if things don’t go as you’ve expected for both work and housing. Some people have mentioned getting a roommate. I think this is a good option only if you’ve lived with that person before - so you know what to expect AND you’re ok with that. If you just get any roommate, then the annoyances you listed for your family could also be true for your new roommate and you would still be stuck for your lease term. Then there is moving back home. I understand you hating your past experiences of living at home. But it may help if you keep in mind two things. One is that your Dad, like most Dads, has the best intentions in mind for his daughter. At its core, his advice to save money is a good one. And saving money on your biggest expense (housing) would be what any good financial planner would tell you. The second thing is that it’s not forever. Be grateful that they are offering to have you but also be upfront with your parents and say that your plan is to eventually move out if the opportunity is right. Truth is you don’t know if the job is right yet. You may come across another job opportunity in some other city. You may decide that working for someone else isn’t your thing and you want to start your own thing. The point is that you will have that flexibility if you live at home - but not if you’re on the hook with an apartment lease. Finally, it may help to keep in mind that you’re not alone in having these concerns- your peers are also going thru this. And many people have also gone thru this as well."
9317,I think it depends on your family dynamics. I moved back in at age 24 after living on my own for 6 years. I absolutely hate being treated like a teenager again and I fight with my dad a lot. It took me a while to find a job after graduation but I’m making $50k but I have a $70k debt and didn’t have a car until very recently. I’m moving out after a few months when I’m finished paying off my private loan because I think my quality of life will be much higher with a short commute and living without the added pressure of contributing to a household (aka gender roles bestowed on the oldest daughter). Don’t feel pressured to immediately make a decision but it’s easier to move in with your parents and then rent your place then it is to break your lease and then move in with your parents.
9318,"It’s going to be better to move home for a year and leave financially stable than take the risk of moving out right, something happening to your job with this pandemic, and then still having to move back home and be financially worse off for it. That debt is going to keep accruing interest, so the longer you keep it, the more your future freedom is threatened. You’re not going to feel great about living away from home if you find yourself in a position where you end up with the same $30k in debt, $15k in loan interest, and debt/bad credit from missed bills or late rent after losing your job."
9319,"this is almost the exact situation I found myself in may when I graduated. I chose to live and home and pay my debt (28k). i have 3.5k left that I’m still deciding whether to pay outright, but i have the money to finish my student loans if i wanted.

ngl, staying at home was difficult and frustrating at times. still, it’s worth it to stay at home and pay your debts. i’m moving to austin (where my job is located) in february and feeling absolutely amazing about it considering loans that were supposed to take me 5 years to pay only took 6 months. i will say save yourself some money for a trip with your friends or s/o while you’re at home. you’ll go crazy if you don’t. i ended up going to seattle and minneapolis to visit friends which caused me to take longer to pay my loans but also saved my sanity."
9320,"I think you need to be honest with yourself. How likely would it be that you would suffer any kind of harm if you lived at home for an extended period, including emotional or psychological harm? Would it be bad enough to affect your performance at your job, after you start working there? I think you need to talk to a counselor about this. Can you see a student counselor where you are studying?

As for problems with being a “people pleaser”, here is one YouTube video.

https://youtu.be/8hYTPl7MkiA"
9321,"Really depends on you and your relationship with your parents. That said, I’ve been living with my parent rent-free for the past 5 years since college in a hcol area and have saved a pretty ridiculous amount of money. I’d rather just live at home and buy a 400k house in another year or two than live on my own with more expenses and essentially rent until I’m 40."
9322,I’m also in a similar situation except with one other issue... I kinda no longer have friends in my hometown because I studied in a different city and with the pandemic I haven’t met anyone new. If I move out I’ll be so alone
9323,"Thank you for your advice!! You’re right, I don’t have to make a decision right this moment- I have all spring to weigh my options"
9324,"You’re right, physically I wouldn’t be hurt at all. Now, growing up, there was a lot of childhood trauma in this house because my dad had anger management issues which he went to therapy for. So our relationship is better but i still get anxious and go back to my highschool view of self when I’m here. Seeing a student counseling about this is actually a great idea. 
As far as job performance I think I would be fine. I interned with this company from home this summer and while I wasn’t the most productive, I could always go into the office and be more productive"
9325,"I would stay at home one year then totally move in with my boyfriend if I had one, like that’s the dream haha!! alas"
9326,"Just move out, as long as you keep up your income and keep on growing it, your student debt will get paid off. Lagging behind in savings in 1 year of rent is trivial in the grand scheme of things"
9327,"I’ll have to spend a lot of time getting into arguments with my family too. One of my sisters already lives at home and we clash somewhat. The good news is, both or my younger siblings will be away at college so there would just be 4 of us in the house. But you’re right, I think I could stomach at least a year... I don’t really go out much and party, But I know from my sister living at home that my parents don’t care when she stays the weekend away at her boyfriends and goes to friends etc. I think they are pretty understanding as long as I don’t keep them up late at night or wake them up early in the morning. Thank you for your insight!!"
9328,You’re right! I can cook for them or something too or make my own food if I really don’t like it. Thank you for your response!!
9329,"Yeah unless you have crazy controlling parents that don’t respect you as a fellow adult now the only “rules” you have to live under are honestly just basic human decency and room mate etiquette. With the advantage of more benefits for you usually. Only thing my parents really ask me to do is help around the house, clean, and cook dinner. Which is totally fair since they pay for 99% of the food, I buy one dinner a week. But other than that I’m my own person now. I got out when I want to go out. I come back when I want to come back which is so nice, curfew free, woooo!! I just let them know where I’m going and that’s it, which is good for safety anyway. They don’t give a flip anymore honestly, but then again they raised a responsible, sensible human being for the most part that usually doesn’t do anything stupid. A immature troublemaker still living at home may have a lot less graces from their parents than someone like me."
9330,"I graduated in May if this year, I lived at home for the last two years of my degree and plan on living at home for the next year to pay off my student debt (majored in computer science, so this is a rare chance) I don’t get shit for it from friends but thats cuz my friends who have student debt, get it. My parents are okay with it b/c “we couldn’t help you pay for college, but we can give you a free place to live while you pay it off” . It’s tough adjusting back especially if you lived on your own during college, but in my case it’s just being a good roommate and taking care of somethings for them like babysitting my younger siblings and such when they are busy. It’s not complete freedom but it’s better than being a slave to debt for the next 10 years. It depends on how long you intend to stay I guess."
9331,"I know several people who are living at home after graduation, from people who have been back at home only a few months, to people who have been living at home for several years. 

I've never experienced anyone who's shamed anyone else for this decision. Recent graduates may be unemployed, underemployed, or have a lot of student loans to pay off. Not everyone can afford to live on their own as a fresh graduate, or even sometime after. And others who can may want to live at home still in order to build their savings. 

I think it's a wise decision if living at home would help someone financially, and if someone has a good, healthy, respectful relationship with their parents. A discussion about contributions to the household (financial or otherwise), boundaries, and having good communication should all also make the transition easier (hopefully). 

I do think it's best to have some kind of timeline in mind when living with parents though, as I think the goal should be to have your own place eventually."
9332,"I’ve lived with my parents for over a year since graduating. Student loans are paid off, and at my current rate, I’ll have enough to put 20% down on a house at the start of the new year. Great way to jumpstart your financial standing in a time where it’s getting more and more difficult to start on strong footing."
9333,lol my dad made me pay the whole rent since I started working lol
9334,"This makes total sense and sounds like a good situation, but I still laughed at the “we couldn’t help you pay for college, but we’ll give you a free place to live while you pay it off” because it’s the exact opposite of my dad, who after I got a scholarship to cover my tuition to a nearby university decided he’d pay for my dorm room under the logic of “its worth 10 grand a year to me to not have you live in my house”."
9335,Living at home is pretty common in lot of Asian and some European cultures. It’s mostly a North American thing where it’s a taboo or something discouraged. My opinion is as long as you don’t sit on your ass and smoke weed all day and act as a burden on your parents and you contribute I don’t see it as a problem. Well sometimes you just want your own space but that’s different.
9336,"Is it different around to world compared to how it is with me? Im 17 soon 18 and finishing school. I plan on living with my parents for a while. Gey some savings and maybe then get out. Noones gonna give me shit about that cause its normal and there's no ""rules"" for me. We are all on equal terms. Just act like normal human beings and do basic things to keep everything clean. It seems so much more complicated when other people talk about this sort of thing."
9337,"If your parents are willing to treat you like an adult, there's almost no downside, imo. (Assuming you're on good terms with them.) I think it really just comes down to your own situation. Are you freeloading? Or are you a responsible adult that happens to live with family?"
9338,It’s totally fine. No paying rent and it does help some people settle into adult life easier. Absolutely no shame in staying with your folks post-grad
9339,"I’m back living at home after graduating in May. The job I landed is very close to my parents place so it just makes sense. Plan is to aggressively pay of my student loans, building some experience at my job and then move on.

Only flaw is I can’t bring girls over. I got a little tubby over university anyway so plan is to get real fit in the mean time."
9340,"It’s LA, every native I know who isn’t in software or married is doing it up to and including their 30s."
9341,[deleted]
9342,Post high school graduation? College? Grad school?
9343,Sounds like something my dad would do haha
9344,"it honestly depends on what you value more, having a lot of money or living alone imo"
9345,"Been living at home for 2.5 years after college. I’m 26 and not the only one out of my friend group that still lives at home. I’ve never really been “scolded” by anyone? Honestly I’ve never had anyone think it’s a bad idea, even my older coworkers. You save a ton of money. It’s nice having a 5-figure safety net in case of an emergency or if I decide to buy a house and need a down payment (I live in the Midwest). But it definitely helps to have parents that don’t treat you like a child. I pay for everything on my own, I keep my own schedule, etc — it’s like living with roommates in a way. 

Do I want my own place? Yeah. I’m actually in the process of looking. But I don’t see a problem with taking some time to live at home while you’re still figuring yourself out after school."
9346,"Save your money! If your parents do not hinder you from living as an adult, do not go further into debt because of what other people think of where you live."
9347,"I did this for a year after college while doing a service year. I did get shamed here and there by some older adults (mostly extended family) for it, but not more than I could handle. Most people understood, and some people I worked with were jealous I could do it. Because of that year, I saved enough to move for a summer fellowship and get a place with roommates when I moved back. 

It was tough at times to live with my parents’ house rules again, but I got more freedom than I’d had when I was younger and ended up developing a much healthier, more mature relationship with them as a result of that year. Good decision all around."
9348,"I don't think it's bad to live with your parents, in fact, I still know a lot of people at my age (27) who do it. The cost of living in Silicon Valley is pretty high so everyone I've met in this region is pretty understanding, plus a lot of us belong to cultures where living with your parents are something of the norm so we don't look at it as anything to be ashamed of."
9349,"Exactly.  In most of Asia, not only is this normal, but encouraged, so that you can save $$$.

I don’t want to say that this is uniquely American, but it is a dumb practice that’s routinely practiced in America."
9350,"One thing I haven't seen posted here that maybe you can talk about - do your parents live in the same city that your post grad job will be in? I'm wondering how much this option is limited to people with family in larger cities / cities with lots of job opportunities, because it seems to me that if the above isn't true, then you're SOL with saving money by living at home, unless you were to spend a few years working jobs you're overqualified for in the hopes of building up savings and being able to find a better paying / better suited job in a larger city."
9351,[deleted]
9352,"In regards to your previous two sentences, I understand entirely. I'm looking at a career in consulting, and I think there's a lot of that same sentiment in the field. That being said, be careful you don't overcommit due to the promise of a higher salary or more benefits - you're only young for so long, and if you spend your 20s to 40s with your nose to the grindstone, you might have a ton of money saved up by the end of it but you'll probably have suffered a lot in different areas to make up for it. I've read plenty of horror stories about consultants taking the upgrade to manager or senior manager when they weren't properly prepared, and hating their lives for the next few years as they try and get up to speed. 

It's a trade off, and we're very fortunate that of all the financial/job dilemmas *ours* is one where you choose big paycheck and poor WLB or smaller paycheck with a better balance - but make sure you know what you're getting into, is the advice I've been given."
9353,"I think it depends where you are and what the economic opportunities available and the cost of rent is.

If you're from NYC or Long Island, forget about living on your own where rent is easily 2 grand a month, best to just live with your folks til you make enough to live on your own. Live somewhere like Buffalo, NY where you can get a shitty apartment for 3-600 a month sometimes with utilities, and now you can live on your own even if all you can get is a crappy minimum wage job."
9354,[deleted]
9355,"If there is a mutual respect between you and your parents I think it's a solid option that can really help you land on your feet. I'm 3 months into living with my parents after graduating and I've saved up a decent chunk of change and have actually grown a lot closer with my parents than I used to be.

If your parents are controlling then fuck that, though."
9356,That's really depending on your financial situation. I pay for literally everything so I don't have enough money to afford to rent and save up money and pay for their living costs and my living costs. So It's just our living costs and living together for now until I can buy a house instead of renting since I can't really save money that way.
9357,"It's completely fine. It seems like White American families tend to kick their kids out at 18 and force them to be independent. Black families(African, AA, Carribiean etc), Hispanic, Arab, South & East Asians, and even european families are okay with their kids living at home in adulthood. It's not the norm anymore to have your own place after school is done, times are changing. Having your own place is nice and all, but its not as glamorous as people make it out to be, you have to cook for yourself, take care of yourself and pay your own bills on time."
9358,"Hey this really resonates with me. I’ve been at home for a year, and while there’s really nothing to complain about, my parents are really nice and it really does make sense financially. But my head is all over the place, I’m not sure if I want to stick with my career and I’m dying to start building my life. 
I was mollycoddled as a child and at uni it was tough for me to learn how to look after myself. I did it though and the confidence boost was amazing, now I feel like I’m slipping back. 

Did you make the move? How’s it been?"
9359,Move out with literally anyone and leave that environment. Also take any job you can
9360,"I graduated with my masters in 2020 and had a really good job lined up in Connecticut with pay starting at 80k a year and great benefits doing exactly what I wanted to do, I was one week away from signing a two year lease on a place in March 2020 and the company that hired me went insolvent within weeks and I was left with the shattered remains of a perfect life that took nearly a decade to curate. I subsequently moved back into my parents place in rural PA and took up a job working as a UPS driver for a year until I pulled myself together and figured out what I wanted to do. Eventually I was able to get back on my feet and I managed to find a job in my field, however at a severe pay cut. 

The point of my ramble is that life is so unpredictable, but how we respond to disaster and cope and move on is what defines us. It sounds like what you really need is to just get the hell out of that house and work a decent job and start figuring out what’s important to you. Staying in caged up is not good for you mentally and you should be enjoying your life while you’re young. Everyone has to start somewhere, and starting is the hardest part. Apply to a job, get out of the house, build up a savings and gtfo in time and start to define who you are again. Chase after what makes you interested in life and build skills and you’ll be surprised at how far you get and how naturally things line up for you. I wish you luck OP"
9361,"Um that's fucking psycho.  You're a grown-ass person.  Get the fuck out of there.  You're entitled to protect your own emotional and mental health.

Do you have a trusted person you could stay with?  A relative?  A college friend?"
9362,"Take any job. Whether it has to do with your major or not. Just a job that will allow you to pay rent on even a studio so you can get out. Once you get stabilized then you can think about grad school. 

Btw, that was one of my majors and I ended up going to law school, but I *knew* I wanted to go to law school. Don't go to grad school to escape. Go because you have an inkling of what you want your future to look like."
9363,Yeh what the heck? If that really is the case then you gotta leave once and never go back
9364,"Look into Americorps NCCC. They pay for your housing, food, student loans(you get 6k at the end of the year), you do cool shit helping people. Its a awesome program that gets you out of your comfort zone and your, house."
9365,"Get a job, find a friend and move in together at least an hour away from your family, further if you can manage. Hell, have a friend get you tf out of the house and couch crash while you search for a job, literally anything to pay your part of rent. You need to get out of that house before you lose your sense of self worth or your damned mind."
9366,What's you degree in? Did you have any internships or work ecperience while you were in school? What city are you in or close to?
9367,"International relations and region studies. US south, no real internship experience. Do you think I need to go to grad school?"
9368,"Hey OP, I just graduated with a degree in international relations. There’s a TON of jobs in DC. One of my friends just got a job as a legal aid and she has only 1 or 2 internship experiences. Definitely look into jobs in DC. If moving out is a problem, get a remote job and save money until you’re able to safely move out. Good luck"
9369,"I think you need to find a way to leave and that should be your first priority. It doesn't have to be an amazing job at first, just something to help you get into a new environment. Maybe you can somehow sign up for a credit card to help you do that, although if they check your mail, maybe you could have it mailed to a friend's house or trusted neighbor. Once you are out you will feel much better, and get back on the path towards finding the right job for you. Your environment is so important to your well-being and especially mental health."
9370,"Post this in other subreddits for more good resources -- /r/TrueOffMyChest, /r/raisedbynarcissists, um, I'm sure there are a lot more relevant ones."
9371,"Same, I haven’t left the house in 3 years. It doesn’t help that all my internships are remote. Been trying to get into retail to earn some cash so I can move out but fucking hell this shit is depressing."
9372,"I would argue point #3.  Sleeping and relaxing makes me very happy, but I also enjoy being productive.

I'll agree that social media can be a detriment, especially if abused or over used."
9373,"See, I've tried pushing my comfort zones and tried """"""giving my best in life"""""" for two and a half decades and it's just made me miserable. I think you're someone who's a *natural* go-getter and can't even conceptualize that other people aren't."
9374,"At best this post is full of meaningless fluff advice that only belongs in a Hallmark card. At worst, this post is rooted in privilege and denies the systemic inequalities that exist currently in most societies (and especially those inequalities in western societies like the United States). In order to follow any of these Hallmark-card pieces of advice someone needs to have the mobility provided by being born white, male, upper middle class or upper class, and have gone to upper echelon schools like private prep schools and the ivy league."
9375,How is what you offer any much different than OP?
9376,"Very true. I don't think everything OP says is BS but it is pretty simplistic. No offense, but it's kinda hallmark card schlock.   


Looks, money, and popularity aren't forever. They're transitory."
9377,And some people are natural go getters but are dealt a bad hand in life so they can’t escape situations like generational poverty and end up being miserable.

9394,"Yeah I’m gonna have to disagree with a lot of these takes, particularly #4 and the last"

9396,"Except this advice isn't meaningless and can be applied regardless of race, sex, etc. The post also never denies the presence of systemic inequalities. It's nonsensical to say only rich white males can take advantage of these. If you have better advice then I can't wait to hear it."
9397,Yup I am 20 years old so we are definitely seeing that same group of people lmao
9398,"I personally think this post isn’t helpful, but some people seem to like it. So I’ll ignore the report."
9399,"What you say is true, OP. But it doesn't apply to all of us, obviously.

Speaking for myself, what you said applies to my situation, and those are things I needed to hear and really believe in about 5-6 years ago. 

I would also add that in 3, sleeping, relaxing and social media only become a problem if you do too much of it. When I finished my degree I spent my days just sitting and eating and not doing much else. I did this everyday, all day."
9400,"I liked this, thanks!"
9401,A year late but congratulations! What are those tips? :)
9402,"Agreed. Do what makes you happy and gives you a purpose. If you can find a career that involves one of the 2, you will be happy (that's what I figured out after graduation and multiple jobs later)."
9403,I relate to this so much lol. Except I have no idea how to start learning how to grow wealth. How did you start and end up becoming a CPA?
9404,"I have no idea what I’m going to do. I’m taking life day by day. Eventually I’ll find what I love. And if I don’t, I know I’ll at least have been surrounded by people I love."
9405,"Yo, I’m also a CPA so I can kind of answer this - I just graduated in 2018 though, so still no Rolls-Royce. I came into college as an undeclared business major, and found the required accounting classes to be pretty intuitive so I just followed the path of least resistance and kept taking them until I ended up with an accounting degree. When I graduated, I got an offer for a teaching assistant gig that paid for my Masters and made me CPA eligible (you don’t have to take a Masters to sit for the CPA, you just have to have 150 college hours and 36? (I think) hours of accounting classes). The nice part about accounting is that good jobs are in abundance, and most people in my class had offers from 3-5 CPA firms before they graduated. You need to work for a CPA firm for at least a year to become eligible for the license. You also have to sit through 4 very difficult exams with lower pass rates than the bar, and pass them all in an 18 month period. Once you do that, you have your license, and then the go getters leave for higher paying finance jobs and the people looking to chill go become accounting managers somewhere. A few stick around to try to make partner at a CPA firm, those guys make insane money eventually but their lives suck until they do."
9406,"Nobody knows what to do next my friend. Everyone is trying this for the first time and there is no magic spell to determine the best future for you. Nothing is constant. Everything is malleable. 

The real key is to not be overly dependent upon ""plans"" or ""this is how it's *supposed* to go"" or any other predictive lifestyle. Otherwise you live out your whole life waiting for tomorrow, but every single morning you wake up, it's today. Tomorrow never arrives. 

Find ways to put a smile on your face and on the faces of those that you love. That is the best thing to focus on."
9407,What was your first job after leaving public? Second year B4 auditor asking.
9408,"Doing a B4 internship next summer, as a second year what are your thoughts? Are the horror stories true or overdone for dramatic effect?"
9409,"take day by day and see what catches your interest. I got a few hobbies, collect a few things. Got a friend in Europe that I go to visit or comes here and hangs out for a few weeks. Might go on a road trip after this covid thing. right now I just listen to the podcasts that keep me sane at work and laugh at some wholesome silliness on youtube."
9410,Asian parents - they chose for me
9411,"Yea so I actually went to school for economics, not accounting. So I always have an interest in money and how the market works and all that, but I was doing it for school and with an aim to get a decent-paying job. I never thought I could use the knowledge for my own interest. 

My first job out of college was at this boutique CPA firm that specializes doing taxes for high net worth individuals. We're not talking just your average attorney, engineers and doctor rich. We're talking about Kim K's level with private jets rich. So that's how I got inspired to have this goal. 

Funny thing is school never teaches us how to grow wealth. That's a different ball game and you have to learn it yourself. I read a ton of books like ""the Millionaire Next Door"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" and read up on tax cases and laws to continue to educate myself.  Obviously I'm not there yet so just take everything I said as a grain of salt. But seriously, accounting doesn't seem boring anymore when you get a goal in mind."
9412,"Misunderstood and thought that having a major in ""undeclared business"" was a euphemism for smuggling! Haha."
9413,"Somewhat exaggerated but based on reality. As a 1st year I worked 3 straight 80 hour weeks in bumfuck nowhere Idaho; that was definitely a low point of my life. But I’ve never worked a century and everyone I know that has brought it on themselves. Same with people sleeping in the office; 90% or the time they brought it on themselves and nobody is telling them they have to do that.

Edit; To clarify, it was 2 80 hour weeks and a 65 hour week that ended on Friday morning when we filed. Just because you asked about exaggeration lol. Obviously we all do it a bit."
9414,"I graduated last July and I really relate to this, I feel very purposeless at the moment. I’m hoping to travel after quarantine. Hope you figure it out!"
9415,Re: how does anyone figure out what they want in life or what makes them happy/content? I personally have to try something or I wonder what I’m missing out on
9416,"Embrace the irrationality, the uncertainty, the cloudiness, the dearth of words that you have and accept them as a full sentence.  That's the line.  That's the point.  It doesn't matter.  Once you satisfy a basic level of creature comforts, anything else can be anything else.  So whether you travel far or stay home, you're in the same headspace.  As a fact, you have to occupy your time somehow, and with some level of devotion, why not taste a little bit of everything at the table and let your palate develop a bit?"
9417,"Not quite what you are looking for but here's my two cents. I am going to be a senior in college in the fall and I am so excited to be done and do what I feel is important or exciting instead of menial/tedious assignments just for a grade. Of course not all of classes/assignments are this way but I am looking forward to choosing what I want to focus on! 

&#x200B;

If I were you, I'd travel (after the pandemic), learn a new skill, and do what you enjoy (now that you have some time for that)!"
9418,A senior accountant at a large non profit. I wasn’t from B4 because I had a degree in economics not accounting. B4 didn’t like folks who didn’t go through the accounting route.
9419,"Ahh thanks for sharing! Wow, that’s awesome that you did so well with accounting! Admittedly, I’m doing nursing so honestly I know nothing about accounting and was just curious how OP learned how to build wealth. But it sounds like you’re on your way! :)"
9420,"Whoa, that must have been an interesting experience working with such a wealthy group! Admittedly, I would be happy just having a comfortable life and being financially independent, but reaching even a fraction of that wealth would be a ideal goal (though, unfortunately, probably not realistic considering I’m only in nursing). 

It’s interesting that you day school doesn’t teach us how to be wealthy (lol, perhaps it’s a good thing I didn’t major in business/accounting then). So you recommend reading those books? I guess I’m trying to find out what available resources are so I can educate myself on ways to build wealth, like investing."
9421,How was the money involved? Did you apply for any scholarships?
9422,"Just dust yourself off and go to school. Like others said, start at community and transfer upwards. I went to ASU and I can't even begin to tell you how many transfer students I met and was friends with. People were all across the board with their educational career. Don't overthink your current position because someone has always done much much worse and still turned it around. Your plan should be solidly set once you enroll in comm. college though."
9423, I went to community college after highschool and totally reinvented myself. I have 2 associates and working on a 3rd right now. With one of my 2 year associates degrees I became a licensed Physical therapist assistant and make a decent living for myself. As of right now I'm still in comunity college studying to become a licensed radiographer (people who take xrays). There are many paths than the usual 4 year universities you just gotta keep an eye out an explore your options
9424,"So, my first year, I didn’t exactly have many scholarships. I did get a financial aid though, but even if you don’t financial aid (apply FAFSA!). I think per semester, it’s around $1000 for full time 12-15 units, and honestly most of the time don’t buy the textbook except it’s really necessary or buy used book from website/ facebook trade for your CC.

But I start apply for scholarships from the CC website itself (more reliable than random internet website) and around the school (sometime they have it separately), and I think in total I went to CC I get like 10-12 scholarships (being honestly with you, help a lot with life expense), but again I worked really hard in CC to study, work, balancing stuffs, and making connection with people and my professors (as I don’t have anyone when I move to US).

In University, I do get Financial Aid/ Federal Loan and the University Grant, but not competitive enough/ do not know many information to apply scholarships. It’s definitely one of my regrets though because some of my friends actually get some scholarship and many benefits from some programs."
9425,Yeah tbh I found my community college to be easier than my AP classes in high school.
9426,"Yup. Perfect chance to get your head om straight and have enough spare time to pursue your other interests because the classes will be easy. 

If you get straight A's you should get in almost anywhere thats not Ivy, and have saved a shit load of money to boot"
9427,Where did you you live during your years at ASU? I too live in Arizona currently but am also seeking to really dive into the whole experience.
9428,"Honestly, good on you for realising it. Nothing is set in stone. And you have been given a direction from these other comments."
9429,"I would definitely do a few things: 1.) go to a Community College for 1-2 years and then look at going to a college/university. Try to volunteer a bit and other things that help with scholarship applications. Then when you get to a four year college, join an organization (could be greek life or other clubs) so you can surround yourself with supportive people!"
9430,"I lived in a few different places while at ASU (all in Tempe); ASU dorms, Vista Del Sol and then University House right next to Sun Devil Stadium. I was an out of state student from NY so I kept close to the campus. Here is a [good link](https://admission.asu.edu/transfer/pathway-programs) to have in your back pocket. ASU is partnered with many other schools that will make transfer a smooth process."
9431,I wouldn't waste money going to a four-year college until you know exactly what you want. The community college will probably work with your four-year state school to transfer general education credits.
9432,"COMMUNITY 👏COLLEGE! 
 Essentially the same . i saved soooo much money. 1 semester for me was like 4,000 or less. I made sure to get all my books from cheaptextbooksonline.com put in isbn and boom cheapest books. Also do pdfs when possible. I also built my gpa and joined clubs. Im now heading in to my MS program after transferring to a 4 year. If you’re willing then you can make it happen. And if not community try a trade school"
9433,[deleted]
9434,"I was the same, had a really strong showing my freshman year, eventually fell off. When it came time for higher education, I went for community college and it was by far the best option. I still made mistakes and took time to discover what I wanted to do in life. Fast forward a few years, and I'm going to a prestigious school far better than the people who told me that I was failing because I wasn't at a 4-year. Now I'm going to school with life experience, no debt, and a positive outlook on life while a lot of the people who put me down can't say the same."
9435,[deleted]
9436,Could I go out of state too from a CC?
9437,Absolutely. The best course of action here is to narrow down the top choice of University that you would like to transfer to (your main / end goal) and then use their admissions resources to figure out if they partner with schools near you. You want to do all the research and planning you can when it comes to transferring. This is because some schools won't recognize all the credits you earned at community college and other problems can arise as well.
9438,"I think you need to narrow down what topics and work styles actually interest you and less about the structure of your job.
No job starts out with jetsetting and all sorts of industries can facilitate that. It's like picking a major based on what field makes the most money. It's a viable reason but hardly the best/most effective reason for success."
9439,"People make mistakes, colleges know that. Colleges love inspirational come-back stories and are willing to give second chances. It’s a matter of are you willing to pick yourself up and rewrite your future. Do 2 years at community college to prove yourself worthy. During then, work somewhere to have some sort of income. Then apply to University. Don’t look back, discipline yourself and focus on the road ahead. In 10 years you’ll look back and thank yourself."
9440,"Your story was a 99% match for me growing up. The only real advice here is for you to talk to a therapist. I've tried to fight depression from a teenage relationship for the better part of a decade. It doesn't work, but those therapists/psychologists are trained and educated to help us feel better and accept our lives.

I wish I'd realized or been able to accept that sooner.

Edit: You need to figure out what really matters to you. Make a list of things you love and things you hate. Make a list of goals, long term or short term doesn't matter. You need to question yourself and what motivates you and what you want out of life. Then you can start making moves to further those goals that align with what you love."
9441,"Your general path pretty much describes my path in high school. Smart and started out strong but fizzled out at the end. Went to a decent uni but ended up failing out of that too. Came back to community college, didn’t pick up my grades until my last year and transferred out to a state university. I’m about to graduate and had multiple full time offers , and recently accepted one at a Big 4 firm. 

It’s definitely not too late for you, and it’s great for realizing that now. The most important thing right now is to actually do well in community college. I overlooked that part. Your grades in your first year at community college will essentially determine your gpa when you apply, giving you a second shot to get into whatever university you want."
9442,"You could start at a community college and remain undecided or do something like general studies. You’d still be doing the core classes like almost everybody else is, and if you actually find a degree path then you’ve already started on the core classes you’re gonna need anyways. Community college is also a hell of a lot cheaper than a 4 year uni right off the bat. 

I felt pretty embarrassed that I got into the honors college of a 4 year uni but had to turn it down cuz I literally had no way to pay for it except loans. I also felt embarrassed that I decided to not even pursue an associates but go with certifications instead. I now know that I can still pursue my career goal without having to have a degree or occurring stupid amounts of debt, so I’m grateful I ended up choosing a community college"
9443,"I went to a top 10 school, my sophomore roommate and best bro transferred in from community college. Just fuckin crushed it there.

But honestly, the separation between schools is closer than it has been in years past. Distinguished alum from all walks are teaching now. 

Dude you’re 18 just forget about it. I know people like you who didn’t show up to life until they were 25-30. 

Go somewhere that is in an area you could stay for awhile. Live abroad. Just get out there.

Make yourself proud, your parents will get there if you do that."
9444,"I see a lot of community college suggestions in here but I’m going to give you a different option. Have you considered picking up a trade? I live in Texas and picking up a trade here is just as good as going to a college or university. Trades make great money and they teach you a lot in a shorter time than school. Personally that was my plan B, it still kind of is if I don’t like my field. I have many friends who are already working and have bought/rent their first place to live in. 

Also another back up plan for me is working at an airport for a company like United Airlines. I see you said you like taking pictures and this way you can travel the world for free and basically come back to a job that pays you to be able to travel. They have many positions that open all the time and their salary is not bad. 

Good luck man high school is in the past and your life isn’t over it’s just getting started."
9445,"I'm Canadian and we have a relatively different system so take this for what it's worth: Be honest with yourself, are you sure that you've addressed the factors that lead to your lower grades? It might be worth it to take some time out, work, build some life experience, and really figure out what kind of career you're interested in. I know it doesn't feel so good to feel left behind but it really isn't a huge deal. A lot of people take years off in between their degrees or fuck off and go travelling for years after their graduation (guilty).

Taking the time out might be the better route if you don't have the work ethic for uni right now. People suggesting a transfer to a different university after a solid year or two at an institution like a community college are giving good advice, but if you get bad post-secondary grades then that option is off the table and you'll be sunk."
9446,"I graduated highschool with a 2.3 lol... don't worry too much. I ended up going to a branch campus of a good school, working hard for good grades, then transferring to the main campus. I go to a great college I would have never been able to get into straight out of highschool"
9447,"Don’t be so hard on yourself! We’ve all screwed up. And this isn’t the worst thing. Sounds like you’re ready to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and that is what sets you apart. 

You haven’t said where you see yourself. What jobs would you like to have? And what interests you? 

If you could see yourself as a tradesman, that’s perfect. We are so short on them in this era. My dad works in the plumbing industry (in management and sales) but by 2022 we’ll be 80% short on plumbers and electricians. Meaning, they’ll be calling the shoots and getting paid whatever they want. Right now, too, any tradesmen would be happy to train you, as they are approaching retirement and have no one to take over their customers. I would look into trades, there’s a wealth of them- welder, plastener, mechanics, boilermaker, roofer, heavy equipment operator, HVAC, etc. 

You get to graduate with a trade in 1.5-2 years, with 1/3 of the debt of those uni students and making the same- or more- than them. Don’t be jealous of them, they are just as lost as you are."
9448,I like how you talk. How does tuition workout for out of state however?
9449,"For sure, I know it sounds ballsy but could it be possible to get an associate's all in one year? Seeing as how things are on the outside world and like you said, anyone could blow through online courses."
9450,Makes sense. How much was the tuition however? I have been eyeing on certain programs like WUE to go somewhere like Oregon or Washington but I don't even know if my parents will pay for something like that. I come from a family that owns a small business so income varies for them time to time.
9451,Some companies have Career Relaunch programs that take people with big gaps in their resume and train them for certain jobs. Worth looking into.
9452,"It’s a cliche but everyone does life at their own pace and that is OKAY! If you want something, you have to believe in your ability to obtain it through hard work and honest intentions. And you also shouldn’t have to think of anything as black and white or 2 dimensional. There doesn’t need to be a three year gap in your resume. You could do school, part time job, and apply for internships throughout your degree that you would do throughout the summers. You’re only ever going to get that front end dev job or whatever job it is by going through the steps. And with the job comes all the other comforts of life you want like moving out, the car, anything. If you feel like it’s time for you to live the way you want to live, then just consume yourself with obtaining that and if not your dreams, you’ll at least be in a better position than you might think you are in today. Time moves forward always, there’s never a wrong time to take control of what it is you do in that time."
9453,"I just want to say I’m turning 24 in a few months (yikes we’re old) and I actually dropped out mid college with 26k in student loans, and I feel very similar to how you’re feeling. I don’t think we’re supposed to know what we’re doing lol"
9454,This is some of the most helpful advice I’ve ever read. I am graduating in May with a BS in biology and don’t really want to work as a lab tech or go to grad school rn. I just want to have a good work/life balance and enjoy myself.
9455,You don’t have to list when you graduated
9456,"I don’t have a solution, I’m 24 and living at home and just came to say you’re not alone!"
9457,"Honestly I feel like I’ve had a quarter life crisis every year post college. Now almost being over the edge of mid 20s, I just feel clueless all the time. It sucks. But it’ll get better!"
9458,"just do what you want to do, man"
9459,Wow! I never heard of those before!
9460,"I wasn't looking forward to my 25th birthday at all, but all I can say is ""oh well it's here"". It's better to drop out with $26k than to stay in school and double that."
9461,What is your degree in?
9462,You already seem lazy and mentally unstable to me.
9463,"Dude this is the perfect time for a gap year. Even without a global pandemic, I would reccommend an extra year to mull things over a great idea!"
9464,"Yeh lately I’ve come to realise that nowadays making music like you said is “wearing a lot of hats” which is in a way kinda of exciting. And I totally agree with how university/college is going to be great in terms of networking and developing skills in that area, I guess part of me is just conflicted in whether or not it’s going to be similar to high school I guess, in addition to whether or not a degree is even necessary (which I totally understand nowadays applying for a job most employers look at whether or not you have a degree first off lol). But thanks for talking about your friend and how they managed to continue staying in school and getting their degree whilst pursuing a seperate music career. Definitely something I need to think about! Much appreciated dude!"
9465,"Exactly this. So many bands met in college before they made it, Vulfpeck being my favorite example."
9466,"I’ll let you know now man, it is nowhere close to high school.  Although gen eds aren’t exactly the most conducive to your future goals, they’re great environments to make friends and give different perspectives/grow outside of your areas of interest. 

And further, college is a great place to network! Who knows how much talent is awaiting in the classroom, ready for collaboration, for competition, for inspiration.  You never know - it’s better to (if you can) overdo your commitment to your future than under."
9467,"I am a musician who didn't go to college and I think it would be unwise of you to not attend purely from a networking aspect and to have the fallback of having a degree for other forms of employment should music not work out. Also, if you really want to become the best musician you can be, you would grow more having personal mentorship, teachers, people around you who want to grow in the same craft and offer foils for learning and healthy competition, networking for the future, and other such seeds you can cultivate right now."
9468,As a full time musician who left a music school to pursue it full time. Go. Yes there will be basic courses but music production is such a necessity in the music industry. I learned so much from the people around me not just the classes. I would’ve regretted not going and wouldn’t be half the musician I am now even with the basic classes.
9469,"biased because i went to college lol but if you can afford it, i say go. yes, you will not be able to dedicate 100% of your time to precisely the aspects of your music that you want to, but you will be exposed to new skills, new friends, professors, connections, new perspectives, new environment, new town and more. and in between all that, there’s time to dedicate to what you’re already working on. i went to a college town where a lot of folks actually launched their music career too. 

as a young professional, nothing has shaped me more than the experiences i had in college, both inside and outside the classroom. not everything i learned in class moved me forward professionally, but the whole experience of it did 1000%."
9470,"I would only go to university if you got a scholarship or can afford it without going into debt, otherwise, don’t go. If music production is something you can figure out how to do on your own, you have no need for college. Something to consider is to get private lessons from an audio instructor at the the college you applied to, but these days, everyone has a college degree, it really doesn’t mean much unless you also have a lot of your own work to show off, which college projects would get you to do, but you could just also do them yourself."
9471,"University was a place for me to solidify who I was, I needed it, not for the degree (I don’t even use it), but to figure myself out. Working full time and completing my classes, joining social groups, mixing with people I wouldn’t normally mix with was something I could ONLY experience in college. Now that I am working full time my circle has shrunk, a lot, but I’m okay with that because I did the exploration, I saw what was out there and this is where I fit. 

College/university is SO MUCH MORE than a degree, and I think missing out on it to work, something you’ll literally be doing the rest of your life...shrinks your circle before you really have to and you miss out on a lot of things you can’t truly experience as you get older. 

You’ve already been accepted...I would go, you can always change your mind later."
9472,"I can understand why you would feel reluctant, school is a big commitment. To speak to one of your comments I wanted to let you know that college is not like high school. Your peers are still close to your age and they will still behave that way for awhile, but you are much more independent and your schedule/aspirations are largely up to you. Don’t avoid college for the people- except for classes, you choose who you are around from here on out. 

I also wanted to tell you about a friend of mine. Their career of choice was in the arts and they didn’t see the point of going to college for it. At first I didn’t see the point either, until I met people in college who were majoring in her preferred career. While she was still working on her craft on the side of her full time job and really making improvements, she wasn’t making connections like they were, or getting outside feedback on her work. When it comes to art you should absolutely avoid only getting opinions from people who love you. Having guidance from teachers who want to see you perform at your best means that they will tell you when something might not work for a broad audience, or at least push you in directions you might not have thought of on your own. All of my friends who went to college for their craft ended up getting jobs in their field because of their connections and experience that they got from their degree. So that is really more the benefit, rather than learning the craft which can be done alone by a motivated person. My friend was motivated and talented, but after a decade stopped trying to make her craft her career. 

The last thing I wanted to gently point out is that not going to college won’t always mean more free time to work on your music. The specifics of what you will be doing (working, finding a place to live etc) will depend entirely on your situation of course! But I do think spending at least a semester/quarter at the school you’ve already been accepted to would be really beneficial to help you decide if it’s for you or not. It will actually be more of a transition into being independent, seeing what kinds of jobs you like, meeting new people and learning more about your profession. Then you can make an informed decision that works best for you, whether that is school or focusing full time on your music again! 

Best of luck!"
9473,"I'm in law school and my entertainment law professor asked us if we'd ever heard of some client of his. None of us had, and he said that several years ago this guy was THE guy about to become the Hot New Musician. He was well connected in the industry, friends with Lady Gaga, good looking, incredibly talented.... and for some reason the stars just didn't align for him. He had everything going for him, but he wasn't lucky. 

My point is, it would be incredibly naive to not go to college because you want to be a musician. It's like betting that the stars will align in just the right way, and you're very likely going to end up burned. I don't mean to be negative! There's lots of really great programs for music, and like someone else mentioned, the more you know about production the better your chances of success will be!"
9474,"Agreed. Use the gap year to do whatever. Travel, work on your music. Do both and go on your!"
9475,"Yeah, the thing about music college is you have to do some basic stuff like theory and sight singing before getting to hunker down on what you really wanna do, if you have a scholarship, you could see about going for like a year maybe and find out whether you can handpick the classes you think would actually be beneficial. Music colleges have an extremely regimented plan to get you to graduate their way, but to do that you’d have to take asinine courses like music history and basic keyboard (which I’m sure you probably already know how to navigate, and even if you don’t, just watch YouTube videos). If you have the ambition and motivation to do exactly what you want, you don’t need a full college ride. If I were you I’d look into going for one year, but maybe not this fall depending on where you live..."
9476,Yeh I was actually considering this as I think another year (hopefully with less travel restrictions and overall better safety for the world lol) could be an option to simply try things out and work on stuff as I can always go back and start the degree next September instead of this coming September :) thanks dude!
9477,Yeh this is something I’ve been thinking a lot about too. I do however have a partial scholarship which is definitely going to help if I decide to go. I have been self teaching music production for 2-3 years now and what bugs me is whether or not a degree would even be worth my time in terms of skillset as I have been going over the course and there seems to be a whole semester covering the basics LMAO. Definitely still got something thinking to do lol!!
9478,"Depending on what you major in, college + a masters gave me a job that pays well and didn’t suck up all my time so I can keep releasing music.  However, everyone is different and college finances can be a huge burden."
9479,"Definitely something to consider, a lot of good points here. Networking would be a huge aspect as well as overall just having a degree as I understand from personal experience nowadays employers seem to be wanting a degree over skill sets and work experience lol. And yeah that’s true, balancing the two is definitely an option I didn’t really think about (Ik how stupid of me yikes lmao) I guess I was just getting caught up on separating the two things (personal music and university degree) rather than using them to support each other). Thanks dude, lots to think about!"
9480,Is this a job that you got after college?
9481,"Take the job and immediately start looking for better jobs. That’s very low pay. But you’ll need to find a roommate situation, likely budget on food, clothing, and expense, etc. and more. Just write out a plan. See how much money you’ll make post-tax and budget accordingly."
9482,It seems like they’re probably going to graduate high school as minimum wage is 12 dollars in arizona
9483,That’s insane. Even places like Target and 7Eleven pay more than that. I think you’re setting yourself up for unnecessary hardship by taking 10$ an hour.
9484,r/personalfinance is a good place to post for stuff like this.
9485,"I lived off $33k in Tempe for a bit until my career grew in 2015-2016. It then grew to $40k in 2016-2017.

Find a place in southern Tempe near baseline. I’d pass on the Mesa area north-East of the 101 n the 60. A lot of sketchy areas out there. 

STAY AWAY from Guadalupe area. The crime is unreal there. 

Chandler is a little more expensive and more of a suburb area. 

Try to find a townhouse. Usually a little nicer than apartments. Cheaper too and more space. 

Learn to cook. I couldn’t afford to eat out and now I can cook about anything. Use public transport. Tempe is a lot better than most other places in Phoenix greater area.

Depending on your field of work, look on UpWork for side gigs. Find a recruiter for freelancing / contract jobs to find more side work for experience."
9486,"That is minimum wage here in Arizona. I suggest looking harder if this is your first job after college, and if after high school look at perhaps places that offer overtime or above minimum wage. Luckily many places are offering around 15 an hour starting. I would suggest to live in Glendale or the outskirts of Mesa, it is next to impossible to want to live in the Tempe area where ASU is as rent is astronomical; much less Chandler, the cheapest you can do in Chandler is 750 rent. 
Many places in the west valley are much cheaper than wanting to live in the cities you listed. I would suggest going on apartments . com and finding the cheapest place to live that will be within driving distance (assuming you have a car) to your potential job. Roommates will certainly be a must if you want to live anywhere near the various campuses in Tempe and Mesa."
9487,East valley rents are going insane FYI
9488,Start a business. No one will ever pay you what your worth. Fuck corporate America.
9489,"I grew up in AZ and lived in Tempe when I moved out at 18, definitely roommates, the more the better. I lived with 4-5 roommates at a time in a 2 story house with a pool and it was about $425 - $480 at the highest (this was usually summer when the AC was on high all the time). It can be done. But I couldn’t eat out all the time and I was only a few blocks from campus (the neighborhood with the LA fitness and the Venezia’s). There is a lot of public transit. I would stay south side of ASU only, north side is new apartment building and new building developments."
9490,Reality check that I am in this reddit post and I forgot I was a broke mf.
9491,"You gotta increase your income. I’ve had a lot of family in similar situations. They always went with three options. 1) do nothing and remain in the same situation. 2) work two jobs, get roommates, save like crazy, then invest in real estate/a business. 3) work full time and learn a skill i.e degree or trades. 

Avoid debt as much as you can and you’ll be fine. Make smart financial decisions and this could be a solid foundation for your future. I know people who are making 6 figures and have worse debt to income ratio than someone making 30k a year. You got this."
9492,"Pretty sure OP means after tax. Otherwise, yikes."
9493,Hustle bro you can make it. Find a side hustle that maximizes $$ spent working. It’s a tough world out there
9494,I didn't mean literally during the pandemic.
9495,"I mean, I kind of did that if you want to talk about it. Short answer: Not the worst life, not the best."
9496,Stay your ass at home.
9497,"Yeah, a lot of us feel the same way but the reality of living in our capitalist hellscape nightmare (if you're in the US) is that unless you have rich parents or a sugar-daddy, you are doomed to become a wage-slave and won't really be able to live those travel dreams once you start working. 

Do a road trip if you can, before you really start your working life. They are tons of fun and they create very unique memories that you will treasure. Even the ""bad"" parts, or the challenges, turn into hilarious memories later on. I did a couple road trips right after college and oh god do I miss those days. Don't hesitate - do it now and make a plan along the way. Stop at every stupid roadside attraction you find (bonus points if it claims to be the ""World's Largest \_\_\_\_\_\_""). Bring camping gear and a tent - campsites are a fraction of the price of hotels. Try to find an event at your final destination, like a festival, or a concert, or something along those lines. It makes for a perfect punctuation mark and solidifies the memory of that place."
9498,"Go hiking or some shit

I felt the same way (I'm in school) so I just went outside and kept on walking in nature, well away from civilisation"
9499,"Lots of people travel for decades on very little money by working odd jobs, teaching English, couch surfing, etc.

There’s nothing damning you to a desk in this “capitalist hellscape.” In fact, minus the current Coronavirus situation , times have pretty much never been better for travelers. Relatively cheap and fast regional transportation, globalization increasing the demand for language tutors, internet connectivity providing opportunties for remote employment.. the list goes on.

It’s easy to blame the world. If that makes people feel better about their choices, fine. But if OP is really serious about, there are certainly a wide variety of options."
9500,What a kind message!
9501,"You still live in a capitalist hellscape, I don't like how OP whitewashes this material fact. You should blame the world for 40 hours minimum that's gone from your life 5 days a week. It's socially irresponsible to think that one person can overcome such an oppressive system.

You can travel and believe that it's a capitalist hellscape, and if you have the privilege to do it, you should."
9502,"If you like the outdoors and aren’t afraid of some hard work, check out wildland firefighting. At the entry level with a fed agency you work 6-7 months of the year and generally make enough to support yourself in the off-season when you can travel wherever your heart desires. I got my degree last spring and am comin on for my second season as a firefighter out west this month.

Check out r/wildfire"
9503,I feel after a while you want to go back to normal living. You only can do so much travel.
9504,"Your experience reminds me of someone's post in r/simpleliving where the op of the post shared his experience of quitting his well-paid actuarial job and moved to Thailand, where living expenses are cheap. He was able to live on doing freelance writing while living the dream life with nice weather and beaches, yet he still has his doubts if his life was not fulfilled to the full extent. 

There's always the FOMO, because you only live once. However, I don't think you have to be able to return to your hometown to have ""roots"" and settle down happily. You're 27 and after traveling to so many places, you would have the adaptability and resilience to grow your roots somewhere you actually enjoy living. It's not too late to start a career either. I would personally recommend try going to some kind of high-demand trade school like nursing or engineering. When you're at an interview, think about your strengths and what you learned from traveling-it's more than just cool."
9505,"I took a hiatus 2 years into my career to do a 3 month trip to Asia. It’s definitely achievable if you’re not looking to stay in ritzy places. I was averaging about $20-$30 a day for everything. I blew all my savings up until that point, but don’t regret it in the least bit. Maybe look into an extended trip and the feasibility of it with your financial situation. It might help get some of the travel bug out of you! Or just make you more of one.. who knows"
9506,"I have absolutely felt this and acted on it. At one point in my life, I loaded up my car with all that would fit and drove 1500 miles away to start a new life. It was amazing but I would not do it again. My life is much different now. I have a stable job, a family, a home, and I'm well integrated into my social circle including taking care of family members. I never expected to be a 9 to 5er but here I am. And you know what? I don't hate it. It has its moments, but I shifted how I think about life. Work is not my identity. It isn't my passion. It is simply a way for me to do what I want in life which includes traveling. Now, my family are my traveling partners and since I have a good job we can act on our travel dreams. Best luck to you, man. If you hang in there and put up with some of the bullshit, you will make it."
9507,1500 miles is 2414.02 km
9508,Do it before you settle down with a job for sure. You can travel and do seasonal work.
9509,"It's not even I think that I want to go back to 'normal living,' it's more that I can't. I could go back to my home town tomorrow, and it's another place, as is every other place I have ever lived. I don't really have roots anywhere and at 27 that bothers me a lot.

It also bothers me a lot that at 27, I somewhat feel that I have had my glory days. There are more places to travel that I haven't been of course, but the rush of something totally new is gone because there aren't many places left that would be brand new screaming new to me left that I haven't been if that makes sense. After so many you can kind of imagine places you haven't been based on recipes of places you have. It's reductionist sure, and not 100% accurate, but my point is that the rush really fades away. 

Besides that, it gets to be really polarizing. Some people think it's the coolest thing ever and lament that they couldn't have a life as cool as yours. Typically they aren't the people interviewing you for work though and those people just look at your resume and sneer and then ask why they should hire someone that they might invest a year or two into and then leaves. I hate being looked at like 'a failure.' 

And lastly I guess, it was a dream that was easily enough achieved that afterwards, I felt lost, like I didn't and still don't know what to do. My measures of success were never the same as other folks and having achieved what I set out to achieve, I feel like I'm still here with another sixty years or so wondering what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing.

But I suppose these problems occur to other people in other positions or that different derivations of these themes are possible anyways and fuck it do what you want.

Oh, there's also really high costs in terms of family. Funerals, weddings, major moments, say goodbye to those and kiss many of your relationships goodbye realistically speaking. They will be there if and when you return, but they will be changed."
9510,"you right, I need to adjust the way I view my situation"
9511,"Thank you for this response, it was so well put. The commenter is basically implying that no one ever gets to live out their dreams of traveling and are doomed to work in a job they hate, no exceptions. It surely seems like a projection of their feelings about the choices they made with their own lives. There are plenty of people, including myself, who graduated college and started trying to make a career out of traveling. It was going quite well up until the virus. It’s not by any means impossible or, to be honest, even that difficult to achieve if you make the right choices early on and do your research like OP is trying to do."
9512,"That sounds pretty familiar haha. I'm a musician doing music full time and living in Poland where the COL isn't as cheap as Thailand but same idea. And yeah, the main cost that gets you is family. The question: ""Will I have spent enough time with my loved ones when they pass? Am I really only going to see my mother ten more times maybe and my grandma once more?"""
9513,"The job search wasn't terrible when I got back. Honestly, I waited a couple months before really buckling down because I was debating if I wanted to go travel some more. So from the time I really started looking until I found a position was about a month and a half. It all depends on what field(s) you're in, past work experience, etc. But I've had good reactions to it if it comes up in an interview. Most people think it's interesting, and a lot of people don't even notice the gap.
I was 25 and had been working for about 2 years out of college before I left."
9514,"I figured out the hack. Get paid to do it... 

Choose professions like Consultants (EY, PwC, Morgan S)

Or become a Pilot.

Or many others... There are careers where you are paid to travel. I have friends who are 21 flying to a new country every week and getting paid thousands for it. You just have to choose the right trajectory.

Then again... its not all sunshine. I am a pilot, not a professional one, but my other pilot friends say it takes a toll on a lot of personal life. You may think that you can survive without that now, however, personal life, family & friends are important for us all."
9515,"Lots of people there talked about travelling as something separated from job, but your talk about wanting to live your life all around the world reminds me of what I've read on a sub, r/digitalnomad. The lifestyle is probably very chaotic and it ain't the best time to begin it, but I think you may want to look into it."
9516,"Well, traveling costs money, and you need a stable career to travel (comfortably at least). Work flexibility comes with time. That’s rather a pessimistic view of an office job. It’s common to see 3-4 weeks of vacation time on top of holidays. You can always take long trips in between jobs, too. You also got like what, 30-40 years to see the world?"
9517,"As other people had pointed out, you need money to travel--especially if you are planning to go to faraway destinations and for a long period. I live in a country where tourism was booming, and while tourism in general is good for the economy, but, I had seen a lot of tourists ended up doing various stuffs because they needed more funds to pay for their travel or return home. I'd suggest you to be a *traveller* and not a *tourist*.

Alternatively, you can search for a job that enables you to travel everywhere, like photographer or journalist/reporter for, say, travel or lifestyle media."
9518,When you did this did you quit your job outright? Or did you plan this with them? I would like to do something similar but don’t really want to risk my job.
9519,"I talked with them about my plans for my trip about 2-3 months before leaving just because I was in the middle of a project, and wanted to give them time to figure out what they wanted to do. They took a couple weeks to figure out if I could come back to the job after I returned, or if they would have to find someone else. They decided they would have to find someone, so I ended up leaving the position completely. I kind of left them in a difficult spot with leaving in the middle of a project, but there's never really a good time to quit. I figured this is something I needed to do for myself, and the older I get, the less likely I would ever do it. So for me, it was a career risk I was willing to take for personal gains. I would say mull it over for a bit, and if you are serious and almost certain you'll go, then talk to your job about your plans. 
Also, if you go, don't plan too much of the trip before-hand. Just have ideas of roughly where you want to go and roughly when you want to be there. Your plans will be shattered within a couple weeks most likely when you meet some people you want to travel with for a week or two. Also also, don't go travel to the other side of the world just to drink yourself half to death. I met some people that went travelling just to party, and it seemed like a boring, mediocre experience that they could have achieved 10 miles from where they lived back home... Party, but don't JUST party"
9520,Not now converter-bot!
9521,"I see, yeah I’ve been debating doing this and risking my career right now as well. A few more questions, how was the job search when you came back? And how old were you when you decided to do this?"
9522,"Okay, I’m 23 rn and have been working for a year in the IT field, what field was your job in?"
9523,"Ah, nice. I would think IT would be fairly easy to get back into after a trip. Jobs are pretty easy to come by for it, but don't take my word for it haha You would know better. 
I'm a Mechanical Engineer mainly in design roles. So in STEM also."

9525,"Free college 100% 

Fuck debt


Future self will thank you when you can move where ever the hell you want after graduation. Debt is so crushing."
9526,psychiatrist
9527,"I’ve always been told that doing good and standing out at regular university is better than going to an Ivy League and doing average. 

If I were in your shoes, I’d probably choose the free college."
9528,"That’s vastly different. Does the in-state school have a good bio program? Paying extra money to an out of state school for a psychology degree doesn’t make sense, the RoI is probably abysmal due to needing a masters to do anything actually psychology oriented besides HR."
9529,What would you be majoring in?
9530,"I’m sorry if this comes off blunt:

This shouldn’t be a question. Go to college for free. The lack of debt coming out of school will help you avoid so much stress post grad and give you more freedom after you graduate. Set yourself up to where you won’t be complaining about debt and bad life decisions on this sub four years from now. 

You’re overthinking this, take the free degree."
9531,"well, technically a major in biology with a minor in psyvhology"
9532,"A big misconception of Ivys is how expensive it is: it is only expensive if you can afford to pay for it.

I was mid-low income, and I ended up making a little money from H every year with my financial aid and merit scholarships after my tuition, room/board, and books and fees are paid for.

I also had an offer from my state uni where they give me 15k/yr in cash (beyond free everything) to go there (happy to specify which program privately)— and I was not sure which choice was better at the time. It is obvious to pick Harvard in hindsight: the connections and opportunities are unparalleled, and it got me a job that pays three times as much as my parents were making, combined (not in finance).

It is very case dependent, but I found it very easy to get a job coming from Harvard, in a field I have little experience and no connections to otherwise. The employers throw themselves at you. It may be case by case, but I’m speaking as a bio major/concentrator in industry.

P.s. different ivys have different mileage, and I don’t mean this in a pretentious way. Also it depends on your program
P.p.s. Even if you want to go to a med school, in my exp, the H name goes a long way. 95%+ students get into at least one med school, and often times there are well developed advisers here that know how to give you an extra oomf through connections or recommendations."
9533,"As someone with an Oxbridge degree (Oxford/ Cambridge degree), I think that those questions are excellent to reflect upon. 

Can you get in? If so, you really are a special candidate. 

In which case, there is a strong argument for bypassing the university decision and looking at what you would like to do with your life and career to help you work backwards towards the decision. 

If you want to be an academic or have a highly paid profession, see if having that university on your resumé would make a difference. 

You need to use it to open doors and leverage opportunities for you if you are going to make it pay for itself. 

Then again, you could treat it as a folly if you have the spare money. 

Finally, there is an equally compelling case to argue that if you have the capability to get in to a good university then you should fulfill your potential and do so. 

In the case of investing in the expensive degree without just going when you simply can afford it, you must have a plan as to how you are going to make it earn the additional fees for you over your career. That could be emotionally as well as financially."
9534,Ikr? This thread is fucking delusional.
9535,"I agree. Plus, with psychiatry, you’re going to need an advanced degree afterwards and you’ll save money for grad school. As long as you have materials to study, you should be fine in free college. In addition, Ivy leagues will most likely drop your grades and it’s likely that the free school is smaller, meaning more time to work with professors (although that might not be true since I don’t know where you’re going).  And lastly, if you decide psychiatry isn’t for you, the free school will be cheaper to switch degree plans (it won’t be as expensive if you have to stay an extra year or two because of it). 

The only reason I’d ever advocate for an Ivy League is if you aren’t worried about money and you want the connections an Ivy League can offer."
9536,"If you are serious about becoming a psychiatrist I suggest you hit an Ivy. Better chance to get into an elite medical school. I used to work in college administration and worked at an elite college in New England. The networking and connections are incredible! Also, if you think you may be inclined to pursue research I’m the field of psychiatry or be clinical faculty at some point the names take on (too much) importance"
9537,"If your family makes below $60k a year, you’d get a need-based financial aid package at most, if not all, of the Ivies that would cover everything - tuition, room, and board. Only thing you’d need to do is pirate your textbooks, which for most courses isn’t hard.

Source: went to an Ivy; I had friends whose parents made below that amount, and paid nothing. Also [this link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/how-ivy-league-financial-aid-packages-stack-up-2017-3). 

If that’s not your situation, stay in state, because fuck debt."
9538,"Do you have a full ride to the Ivy League? Go ivy. 

Will you take out any loans? State school. 

Also keep in mind that expectations at ivy will be higher and you will spend more time on academics. It could be especially stressful, especially if you’re coming in with any existing mental illness."
9539,Your really asking about free vs paying..
9540,"“Ivy League means nothing”

What?"
9541,go to the big ass ivy league.
9542,I have a friend with a biology degree from Cornell who currently works at the food court in Costco so there’s no guarantee that you’ll be super successful if you go to an Ivy League school. It just depends on if you’re going to a school after or what exactly you’re trying to do. Biology and Psychology are both degrees you can’t do a lot with straight out of graduation. I have friends with both. You usually have to go to some kind of graduate school with those.
9543,Only go Ivy if you're going to finance. If you're doing health to become a doctor then free college all the way.
9544,"My wife is currently in medical school, and I asked her what she thinks. She says:

It depends on the school. If the free school has no opportunities for research, go to Ivy League. Ivy league schools will also offer a ton of resources, alumni connections, etc that are priceless when it comes to building a resume. I would say OP should find out if their free school has a pre-health coordinator and how the percentages of students from each school getting into med school compares."
9545,"I’m going to go against the grain here and say go to the Ivy League, especially for a job like psychiatry. People on Reddit underestimate the weight that an Ivy on your resume carries. When an employer is looking at potential candidates, they look for things that make you stand out from others, and a great school is one hell of a standout. Ivy League schools have pretty good financial aid too. Even if they only reduce your tuition by half, I’d say you’re definitely better off taking the financial hit and taking out some loans, especially since you are going into a well-paying major like psychiatry."
9546,I think it also depends on finances to. If he cant really afford the Ivy league it is probably best to take the free college.
9547,Elite colleges guarantee to meet financial need and tend to be need blind in their admissions system
9548,It definitely takes a strong sense of self worth not to be swallowed up by it. The most common phrase I heard from entitled students was “I pay full tuition” I didn’t take that shit from day 1. Had a student say in response the the college paid him to go there so who’s the smart one?
9549,"You have 6 months post graduation until monthly loan payments begin.  You could be a jobless graduate, but even if you’re employed, paying back an unnecessary loan for the first half of your life will suck.   Free.  Go somewhere cool for grad school."
9550,We're gonna need some names.
9551,"Wait, what is this mythical “free” college you speak of?"
9552,"i'm late to the party but wanted to chime in. without more details on your career goals etc, I'd recommend the state school. 

an Ivy League school will give you an edge in a small number of careers. if you want to be a CPA and have the goal of working at a top national firm, Ivy League will be a big plus. but it will also be 4x the cost. if you don't aim at a top-10 firm, a state school will be just as good."
9553,Ivy League means absolutely nothing nowadays. Free college? That value is almost intangible
9554,"I started my job after college a couple months ago. I feel like life really slows down when you start working. It just isn't in the same pace as you are used to in college or anytime before in your life. You do not have to run around like crazy because you have an essay due, rather you have open deadlines for your projects at work (unless its a really critical role) and you do it at your own pace. It sort of becomes monotonous unless you bring the change and do cool things outside of work and have a fun workplace. Most work places are not fun and most people do not love their job."
9555,"in short, I had no time to spend the money I was making. 

you start feeling guilty doing activities that you used to enjoy but are a total waste of time, bc now you feel you could be using your time more wisely.

exercise before work, or after ( just being consistent) really helped get my spirits up and helped me be more diligent and reduce stress.

I really enjoy my job but I noticed I was working my life away - couldn't go out with friends at night to drink or stay up late gaming etc. With time you lose those friendships and develop ones that are healthy and beneficial (and fun!). But that time period and transition of losing touch with your old self and your new self is uneasy. Like shedding your old shell. Just know it is temporary.

being financially stable is liberating, I do more things I used to never even think about - not expensive just much more possibilities.

oh and don't make long to-do lists in and out of work. set 2 goals and cap it there. You will feel more accomplished. once you start noticing you finished your to-do list and still have more time, then add another item and cap it at 3, and so on

you'll be fine kiddo"

9559,"As a 53yo who dropped out after his junior year, my opinion does not align with what ""They say...."".

My personal experiences are that life will be what you make of it after college.

What I mean by this is that you have much more freedom (than you had growing up) to dictate how your life will be after college.  Ultimately, your happiness will be determined, largely, by the decisions you make with this type of freedom.

As my 11yo grandson hears from me since he was 2yo....

Good decisions will generally lead to ggod things in your life while badsions will generally lead to bad things in your life."
9560,"Been out of college for a little over a year now. I had an incredible internship last summer catching and banding hummingbirds, tracking turkeys, and catching lizards (and getting paid for it!!!). Now I have a “real” job as an environmental consultant and it’s really awesome! Last winter was rough and I had a pretty negative outlook, as my internship only lasted through October and even though I had been applying for jobs all summer for after my internship, I never got a call back. I ended up working at Costco pushing carts to make ends meet and I was pretty miserable. I ran into someone I knew in college who I hadn’t thought of, they own a lab doing research, so I went in and got a second job with them doing microscope work. Then I ran into my old boss from the gear shop I worked at in college and they needed some help covering shifts for the winter also, so I had 3 jobs, but I made everything work out. Costco became my least favorite job but it paid the best of the three at the time. I interviewed for the job I have now in January and started in March, and it’s a great place to be. I still pick up shifts at the gear shop now and then, and I drop in on the lab I worked at to visit with my coworkers and see if they need any help. Overall, I think life got much better after college. I miss seeing my friends every day/three times a week, but I definitely don’t miss the stress."
9561,"I absolutely love my job, I can’t believe I get paid for it sometimes. You know you have a good job when it makes you want to work full time, and not necessarily for the money. But I’m taking it easy while I can(still living with parents once I save up for a car I’ll probably be moving out) as long as you have an okay job that’s not ridiculously stressful and you’re not having to work your butt off to make ends meet life after school is soooo much better. I’m relishing the fact I have no school or homework, my time at home is my own. I can do more hobbies I enjoy, such as reading and writing. Heck I saved up my cash tips for a piano in three weeks of working and I’m buying a used piano to get back to playing hopefully. I can’t imagine how thrilling it’s going to be driving a car I own that I save up for, and then moving into an apartment or house that’s truly my own, it’s gonna be freaking awesome. Yeah there’s bills and taxes, and life will always suck sometimes, but I think the benefits and the true feeling your life is your own is totally worth it!"
9562,"I was functionally depressed during college.  After college I became clinically depressed.  I definitely preferred college to life afterward, because the jobs I've had after college have been completely soul-destroying.  It depends on what you did in college and what you're gonna do afterwards I suppose.  

Also, I made the bad decision of moving back in with my parents.  I didn't start searching for a job until after I graduated, so I ended up not having the money to live on my own, and let me tell you, moving back in with your parents after having lived on your own is hell."
9563,"> Ready to graduate and get into the real world by senior year

If they have something set up, yeah. Else it's just a race against time to plot out a decent spot under the highway."

Yeah it's a challenging job, but I worked way hard in college and I still had fun then, too. 3+ jobs and 18 credit hours feels like nothing compared to my new office and the new experiences I'll gather. I haven't heard anyone say life gets worse after college though, so I don't know! I'm sure it's all in how you look at it."
9567,"It’s hit and miss, like many things. When you have a good job with a solid salary, it’s a good time and you can do anything you’d like outside of work hours. When you don’t have a job though, it’s watching your savings slowly dwindle away and scrambling to pay your bills and do anything without breaking the bank. Enjoy the highs for sure, but be vigilant to make sure you have a plan if the job goes south."

9589,"I guess you can’t win, huh"
9590,"Saying your degree is useless, is saying the last four years or so you spent obtaining that degree was invaluable. It's not about the degree. It's about the experience and learning. The connections you made, reputation you built. No one utilizes their degree once they graduate, but you left with a multitude of connections, people you know, programs you were a part of. Start looking at your degree as an entry point and facilitation of conversation, not one that determines your expertise in any one area. Besides you were 20/21 when you decided whatever major and degree was for you. Did you actually think getting a piece of paper was a guaranteed to a job?"
9591,"It’s more about your experience than your degree for a lot of fields. Any degree the communications field isn’t much without an internship or part time job (realistically, multiple) to show your skill set. 

I would look for an internship or part time/temp job now in your field. They’re usually part time so you can keep a part time job too. I honestly don’t know much about your degree, so sorry if this is super out there. But don’t you study people essentially? Any part time jobs in your health department? Something at a school?"

I know my brain is geared towards analyzing large data sets to understand certain trends that can help or hurt the bank I am currently working at. When you’re applying for a job, jobs are looking at what you offer THEM and the skills you get with a social science degree help in a WIDE variety of fields. Governments, corporate, nonprofit, academic - they all have to do with people and that’s what our degree has set us up for tbh, even if we are all interested in different aspects of people ha. 

I am planning on going back to school to study religion amongst LGBTQ+ refugees. I was supposed to start a year ago but covid progressively got worse at that point and I didn’t feel comfortable moving across the world if I didn’t even know if where I would be moving to would be open."

I’m in a different field of liberal arts for my path but this is what one my friends was inspired to do while living in the Bay Area with a Soc degree.

Also +1 on the advice of going to a staff agency like Robert Half. Often if you’re educated with a decent resume, they can place you in some type of full time office work, and if nothings available they sometimes offer event work. Won’t be super fulfilling but will pay the bills and treat you better than food service. I’ve had great luck with those gigs."

9603,I’ll look into that
9604,Yeah it’s crazy! I applied for jobs that only require a HS diploma cause I was getting desperate and I never heard back either!
9605,After I graduated I went to the career center on campus and got advice from them. I went to career fairs and had an internship during college. I was pretty social in college and even went abroad. Asking for advice on the internet was literally my last resort. Last year I got a event planning certification because I felt like I needed to learn something new. Obviously I know events aren’t really happening because of covid but I needed something to show that I was still learning.

9607,"Unfortunately, associates degrees don’t open as many doors as you’d think. I’ve heard professors say that even a Bachelors is considered to be the new HS diploma. Sociology is not a far stretch from public health, you could intern at a HD and go for a bachelors. Trade school is also a good option for a skill. What kind of job would you like to have?"
9608,"Consider a business / IT consulting firm like Accenture, Ernst & Young, or PWC.  They routinely take smart people from disparate backgrounds, train them in whatever field they are needing consultants, and they'll put you to work.  Especially in this tight job market, that might be a good option, especially if you are young and can travel, and they are great companies to work for.  My brother worked for Accenture out of college, and he had an Economics degrees, but job options were limited at that time.  So he joined Accenture out of their Chicago office and they trained him to do IT work and eventually he went into their mainline consulting practice, went on to get an MBA that they paid for, and stayed with them for almost ten years before he left to work for a biotech startup in Boston in an executive capacity."
9609,What did you major in?
9610,"It is basically that, yeah. I am looking into jobs at schools and in HR."

9612,interesting. why don’t you become a archeologist?
9613,"Yes, go do a trade and join a union."

The job market in my area is absolutely saturated. So much so that I can't even land interviews. I feel like such a waste.

9622,Woah. Are you looking into remote roles? Got a LinkedIn profile? I know the job market is ass right now but you are pretty in demand
9623,What’s your target role?
9624,"yep i definitely did, i spent about 7 months after graduation from college just feeling useless at home and guilty. I didn’t have the confidence to figure out what I want to do and look for a job that I would somewhat enjoy or could handle, until one day my relative’s past coworker was needing new hires in a field i have pretty much no experience in. I felt kinda obligated to take the offer and tbh i was excited i got my first full time job and it’s even close to home. 

However, I’m less than a week in and I’m rethinking everything, suddenly feeling major anxiety about my life and the job and wishing I appreciated the time I spent doing pretty much nothing at home. Long story short, i wish i could go back and enjoy the free time instead of spending it thinking how useless i was. I wish i could run from my new job bc its all so overwhelming and i’m suffering from major imposter syndrome and anxiety, but i don’t wanna burn this bridge right away as i know i’m lucky to have this opportunity right now and it’s only been less than a week. 

Appreciate the free time and know I totally went through what you’re feeling, but also make the best of it while you can"

9629,"Well this is an absolutely bizarre post.

>People bounce around, stay for a year, and switch jobs frequently. 

Yeah because people realized that working at the Hormel factory for 19 years gets you a 10$/hour raise and no retirement. How un-company-like of them to go elsewhere to make more money!

>They have ulterior motives. Their in jobs less frequently, or don't like to work.

lol. When your CEO is a billionaire and you make $15/hr with a degree, what do you expect? Do you expect them to serve your coffee with a reach-around? You really have to be exceptionally stupid to not have ulterior motives the second you walk into your job.

>When my parents were my age, they had and held jobs for many years. Some even retired in that first job of theirs. 

Yeah no shit. Those jobs don't even exist anymore since we hire monkeys to do them now. Your parents were uneducated, unskilled laborers. They couldn't change jobs if they *wanted* to.  Again, you have to be unusually docile and slow to be a ""company man."" We *know* these companies don't care about you. The days of sucking the company's dick are over. 

>they were simply full of bliss.

 What?

This post is shameful coming from a 27 year old. Ask your parents why so many of them started unionizing and go watch F is for Family."
9630,"I think the internet made the job application process worse. All these tests, filling in jobs that are already shown on your resume, psych tests, etc. It's made it so over-complicated.

But also gone are the days like our parents where you could work at one company and work your way up and be rewarded. I don't see much company loyalty to employees anymore, so people are simply going to not be loyal to companies. Why should they? Especially if a company is going to underpay or not offer good health benefits."

I don't think OP is saying the current situation is good, just trying to get a discussion around why it's harder now to make a career rather than job hop, and it seems OP thinks the internet is part of the problem (disagree myself with the latter)"
9634,"100% yes, just based on the fact that my parents made less money and could afford so much more. I have more education and experience in my field, making ~$10k more annually than my mother did pre-my conception. Still, I can’t buy a new car, let alone a home (she had both). The inflation and cost of living has increased to where master’s levels education is going to be the new “standard”. 

Shit, I can’t even become a Navy officer in my field, because I’ve got a BS, not MS. We are being forced to do more with less. We’ve gone backwards"
9635,Do millennial bears shit in deforested woods?
9636,"“We hire monkeys to do them now”

Phrasing, man. Seriously."
9637,"Well, the nature of work certainly has changed. More contract work. Also hustle culture, where millennials and gen z are encouraged, if not expected to constantly jumping ship from company to company, city to city every few years on the hunt for a bigger salary and more prestige amongst their degreed compatriots. Certainly feels like people with college degrees bounce around way more, but by the same token, far too many people are getting college degrees now, and are thus filling roles that would've been considered more transient/unskilled in prior generations. So there's a case to be made that it's not that work has become more ephemeral, so much as what used to be the pathway to stable work has become devalued, and now is simply required for entry level, more temporary jobs. 

That said, it also depends what industry you're in and the workplace. I've generally found people with professional degrees tend to have pretty stable careers and move around a lot less. Also, there's a much higher rate turnover rate, generally speaking, if you're working for a large corporation (the extent to which a professional degree makes a difference to how long you stay at one place in these settings is up for debate)

Like as an example, my dad runs a small, local law firm- he has millennial employees who have been there since graduating bachelors, through to becoming minted lawyers. Same with my office (I'm an architect)- pretty common for millennials like myself to have been interns there in college and stuck through 10+ years there. Get that impression of people in medicine as well (though needless to say, their work environment is different).

Granted, these are small to midsize professional offices I'm talking about (typically 15-30ish people), but such places where you'll hang on a long time certainly exist. These are places where you want a relatively relaxed, stable work experience, as opposed to being able to name drop your office's name and working 80 hour weeks because you wanted to make a six figure salary fresh out of school. Healthy work/life balance type places for people who I wouldn't say are unambitious, but certainly whom aren't interested in the rat race.

So yeah- I think your assessment on the whole of working conditions for younger folks is correct. That said, your work life is what you make of it, and there are a fair number of places where you can stay at your job for years on end."
9638,yeah this is some top tier boomer shit. I'd rather die than work the same job every day for decades so no I will not be building any company loyalty anywhere lol fuck that
9639,"Yeah, as someone who wants to eventually settle into a place permanently, the idea of having to job hop for the rest of my life sounds awful.  I don't mind doing it for my 20s, but after that I wanna establish roots and be done, I haven't lived in the same place for more than a year in 4 years, and moving is so stressful."
9640,Turning 28 in a month and wow you took the feelings/thoughts right out of my soul with this. Cheers
9641,I’ve recently had the exact same realization. My anxiety and depression have been getting to an almost unmanageable point over this. I’m trying to figure out what to do and how to do it that will be fulfilling to me without losing health insurance etc. and also without sounding ungrateful for the stability I do have that comes with my salaried position.
9642,"I think it all just depends on the industry and your own personal situation. I’m in a job that has doubled my yearly income after just a year and has transitioned me into new roles for learning more skills whenever I requested it. 

I’m now transitioning again into a new role where I’ll be learning major new skills. Eventually I should get a promotion as I’m going to be the most experienced employee in that department as a whole. I’ve discussed this with the management and they’re pretty open about their policies. I have been working for the same company for nearly three years and I don’t intend to quit for a few more to come. 


It really all just depends on the company, the opportunities, and your own goals."
9643,"I think so. Our parents could get a bachelors degree and it would mean the world. Today the same degree doesn’t mean as much

Not to mention that it was so easy for them to pay off their student loans. And someone making barely above minimum wage could buy a house in a few years. Today, student loans are fucking insane. And at least where I live, you can make 5 times minimum wage and still struggle to buy an old and shitty house"

9645,"The US seems to be recovering less and less from its economical crashes. Post 2008/2009 is what we're still recovering from, and many companies have made commitments that have entrenched us further in reminding us of the recession, rather than pull us out. The rise of the ATS is a big one. I read somewhere that the ATS bullshit we all put up with today was a post 09 thing, due to how people were desperately applying to all kinds of jobs (as you do when your life and society just got flipped turned upside down), and in response, the companies took a more draconic turn towards vetting. Ya see it boils down to this. Companies and corps need to be made more responsible for giving people jobs, and moreso, being in the position where they NEED people. The current power dynamic is such that companies always feel like they're bestowing us such a treat (see, white savior), rather than feeling like they need a new employee. We expect them to need us. They expect us to need them. And currently, they have way too much say in that matter. The reality is, ""owing"" someone is a lot like power. If you remove it, you don't fully get rid of it, you just create a vacuum. (see, power vacuum) Hence, we have to decide: Who do we want to feel entitled in this country? The working man, or the corporate, employing ghouls?"

of course it’s different"
9647,"100% yes. Technology and other factors have caused employers to expect more work out of their employees, wages have not raised to match the COL, job security is worse, job benefits are worse, you are competing against more people due to the job application process being online and therefore accessible to more people, employers are less likely to hire people with little to no experience, etc. 

I honestly think the only advantages we have is the ability to work from home and freelancing/working for yourself is more common."

I graduated in May and work as a digital project manager.

I majored in marketing and heavily regret it and wish I had gone into something more technical. Maybe it will be different for your school but, out of every major in the business school, it taught the least tangible skills. If you do go marketing, you still need a good grasp on numbers because the field is leaning into data-driven practices. Get a minor in analytics or something tangible. 

No matter your major, I got a job I liked and was way more technical than my major because of the experience I gained during internships. I used each to pivot more into what I wanted to do and worked a ton in product development before graduating. I got a job that usually isn't open to college grads because of my internship experience. Trust me, the sleeping in you have on your summer break isn't worth it when you have no marketable experience when you graduate."

IMO, minors are a great way to supplement your degree and get a job you really enjoy. My minor is digital marketing and analytics. 

My job is actually more closely aligned to my minor rather than my major. I got an internship based off of my minor and then subsequently a job, once I graduated.

In college I was heavily involved with orgs on campus, and held leadership positions in most of them. Through the orgs, I had experience handling budgets for orgs in the range of $5-15k annually, plus our rollover account funds. I was able to run social media accounts/campaigns, I wrote articles, did PR work, submitted and reviewed proposals/budget requests. 

I also purposefully took courses where the final project would result in some sort of deliverable. In one we conducted and analyzed a national survey, in one I created a full marketing plan for a loca business, and in another I created a Communications plan for a loca health organization. Showing a potential employer my Communications Strategy did a lot more for me than showing them “hey I made an A+ in Visual Communication.”

Your degree shows you know how to learn, experience shows you know how to actually do something. As long as you focus on building experience you’ll be fine."
9660,"Well, they say accounting and finance are the hardest majors in business. If you barely managed through to the program, the minor counts as part of your overall GPA and you can take easy classes to elevate it."
9661,"I interned at Enterprise Rent-a-car which was a much more sales focused position. During my time in school the companies that were looking for Marketing majors were either looking for sales positions, or digital marketing. I was testing both out as I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.

I did not like the Enterprise position at all. The goal was to sell supplemental insurance to anyone that rented a car. There were many unethical habits that the ""high performers"" had developed to coerce people into getting it.

Working conditions also weren't great. They expect you to wear a suit all day getting into hot cars that have been sitting in the sun. The office temp was controlled by corporate and was usually set pretty high, and inventory was run very tight so we frequently wouldn't have the car someone has reserved which meant a lot of angry customers.

Edit: To finish answering your question I did not intern at this company. It's a fairly small company so no internships. I found them at a job fair at the school the semester I was graduating and set up an interview."
9662,"Chicago, IL

Communications major(2017)

Been a bit hit and miss for me. I can get interviews but never land the job. I’m freelance as of now just to make some money. I mostly deal with social media communications issues. I wanted to be a journalist but you need an internship or something to breakthrough. Something I never did, I focused on schoolwork.

Assuming you stick with Finance, you should be on a good path. Make sure to get an internship and network. I totally regret that I never done that and feel the repercussions of it."
9663,"Chicago, IL

I graduated this spring (2019) with a BA, double majored in Music and Communication Arts. I'm using both of my majors as parts of my job. I interned for a mid-size church (900-1000 regular attenders) the summer of my freshman year on the music/worship side. After the internship ended, I continued to free-lance with the church as a musician. 3 years later, an expansion position was created, and I got hired full-time to do Worship Leading and Web Design. 

Not raking it in with a non-profit organization of course, but I'm loving the work I'm doing. And I'm working full-time in my fields of studied (which can be rare for a musician who's by no means a prodigy!)

Like others have said, internships and connections are so key. My employer and I both felt good about bringing me on full time, as we already had a positive working relationship. Anyone in finance is going to be making more than me, but the sorts of tasks I get to do on a weekly basis allow me to flex my creative and collaborative muscles. And working for a non-profit cause I believe in allows me to feel invested and fulfilled from my job."
9664,"From my experience, entry level marketing jobs are all about social media, so I really encourage learning these tools in college. Most classes haven’t gotten with the program and it was a major disadvantage in the job search. You’re going to learn very cool stuff in your upper division classes, like product development. These are mainly NOT entry level jobs and you will not be able to get a job like this out of college. I love marketing but was only offered one marketing job in a city I didn’t like with a company with little upwards mobility, so I took a job in consulting instead. If you truly want a marketing job I encourage to learn Wordpress, google analytics, tableau, and Facebook ads. That is more valuable than a lot of classes you will be taking.

For reference: I went to UT Austin which has a top 10 marketing program nationwide."
9665,"As in with marketing experience? It's not impossible, you just need to know how to beef your resume the right ways on your own.

9669,"Communications (semantics only, really film/tv production) from and in LA right now, of all places.

Life is hard if you don't actively establish connections. Your degree is essentially proof that you can do the bare minimum required in a job. Internships, schmoozing, getting to know professors, etc. will be what gets you a good place. Firms would much rather hire someone that their employee(s) know and recommend rather than someone who showed up on a list online if they have the choice - and indeed, they usually do.

You should obviously still do well in academics and train as much as you can through your courses, because that is still very important to *maintaining* your job and advancing in your career, but your real key in the door is the human inevitably of nepotism. This is coming from an unemployed movie man in the country's City of Cinema. So, if you don't think it relates enough to your situation and throw this advice out the window, that's your own bad luck."
9670,"Comm major with a double minor in marketing & psychology in NYC.

I’ve always believed that comm majors are important because you can go into any field with a comm degree because people always need to know how to interact and solve problems. I just graduated in May & don’t have a job in my field BUT a chunk of that is my fault because I haven’t been looking too hard. 

I’m working 2 summer jobs (that end next week) & my usual part time job to save $$ for my rent so I can start looking adamantly in sept. I did get one of my summer jobs b/c of my degree and am one of the people “in charge” w no experience just bc of my degree. I also had an offer from a full time competitive pay marketing internship, but it fell through because I signed a 7wk contract somewhere else and they couldn’t push back the start date :/. 

Anyways, moral is (at least in my heart) that you should do what interests you. There’s no point in working a job if you hate what you do when you can do something you love, even if it takes a little more time to get there. Also, do LOTS of internships, don’t worry about them being paid or not (unless you really need the $$). 

I have so many friends that have majored in art or in English & we’ve all heard time and time again that they’ll never get a job. But they’re trying to find something they love and that’s all that matters."
9671,"Another Communications grad here. I work in marketing. Most of my internships were in marketing. I enjoy my job. I think I get compensated well enough for an entry-level position. I'm happy with where I am now, but I know I probably wouldn't be here without my internships and networking."
9672,"I was a business administration major with a concentrations in organizational behavior and marketing. I also majored in social psychology. Naturally, I went into marketing. Been working in marketing for 3.5 years. I live and went to school in southern CA.

Honestly marketing is more boring than I expected in college. It's fun sometimes, but I don't get as much contact with other people as I would like. But I have a good job and there are a lot of marketing jobs around!

I would recommend shadowing people on the job. You can reach out to people on LinkedIn and ask if you can come see what they do at work for a few hours sometime. I know it's scary, but I really wish I would have done this more while I was in college! I did it once when I shadowed my friend who worked in PR and it was sooo boring I'm so glad I didn't go into it, haha.

I can't speak for finance, but if you can go more general business with your major, that might serve you best. Good luck!"
9673,"Finance major here. I would absolutely pick finance. You'll share some of the same classes as marketing and so you'll learn how to market, but you'll get hard skills and a deeper understanding of business on top of it"
9674,"Calgary, Alberta. Graduated with a marketing degree 18 months ago. 

Went through the same debate as you until I decided at the start of my 3rd year to pursue my passion in marketing. Got a couple internships and the second one kept me on after graduation. 

I would highly recommend equipping yourself with some additional skills to wow your internships with. And start now if you haven’t. Specifically video production helped me with my role, but consider learning (and practicing) photoshop, illustrator, photography, videography, SEO etc. These things make you much more valuable than someone who can just recommend a strategy. Execution is also very key. 

Good luck!"

It is not enough to do a hobby especially when you have less TIME! That doesn’t even take into account how exhausted you may be. SOOO how are we suppose to just be content with this. Plus we have to spend the majority of the best time of the day when the sun is out. Companies barely want to give PTO etc. I am talking about the US work culture which is nothing further from sh\*\*\*.  I also find that people who say this don’t have much hobbies to speak off and are content being a working drone. I guess it great to have a minimalist mindset but if you want like pursuing art, travel, sports, game, and learning enriching skillset like learning a language etc then you don’t have enough TIME!!!"

White collar and heavy industry are a large chunk of jobs honestly. Something outdoors or blue collar might be something up your alley. 

I mean, every job becomes somewhat mundane eventually. My job is pretty cool (small vintage car shop) but I can’t say I’ve never been bored doing it. Maybe the first few months, but after I figured shit out, it can sometimes get…mundane. If anything, you’ve got to seek out an interesting life. It won’t always come to you.

9696,"This is me. I just don’t understand how people do it I just get so understimulated. And don’t get me started on how there’s only 2 days of week to actually relax. I know people always say “oh people just have a job to pay the bills” but to me when u are taught all your life that the end goal is your career, that basically becomes your goal and it’s more than money-making on that note. Hobbies were always secondary to me rather than primary growing up so when all your life you are striving for career and you finally get there you actually realize how bad it truly is. I guess as a recent grad I’m also trying to find my purpose now."
9697,"While I agree, it’s just a shame that most jobs could be done more efficiently and in less time. I’d say more than 60% of jobs don’t require 8 hours of actual working time. 
For instance I have timed my actual working hours and it’s around 4 hours. But due to mundane meetings, worthless “training” and team building time they keep us for 8 hours/ day. 
If someone came in with half a brain cell and reworked our schedules and got rid of unnecessary tasks we’d have a higher efficiency rate, happier employees, and larger profit margins. But instead they lock us up in cubicles, keep us away from our families, and waist our time. Studies prove efficient focus time is between 25-30 minutes. And 99.9% of the shit that’s said in meetins could be broken down into 5 minutes or an email 🤷🏼‍♀️"

9716,"Forget what these dudes are saying. If you're *getting lots of interviews*, the problem isn't what's on your resume. It's that your interview prep isn't right.

If you're in a field that does technical interviews, you'll have to practice those skills more, but I assume you're not since you'd know that. So, you should get an interview coach to help you practice your intrapersonal skills-- answering interview questions, talking about yourself and your background, body language. There are people like that online, or often you can find them through your university's career resource center (which remains available to alumni).

You should also look for some organization you can attend, a young professionals club or something related to your field. This will help with your network and with practicing social skills so they don't atrophy while you're in job limbo."
9717,"I had the opposite sentiment, I finally feel happy when I got out of school. I developed terrible habits when I was going to school. Now, that I am done, I just started meditating, reading fun titles, listening to great music, teaching myself to cook different foods, tried dancing here and there, and helping my community with volunteering my time. 

It's all mental, but I just have found a brighter side to life, being away from university, but I did meet a lot of great friends from school. It just sucked the life from me, looking back on it was fun though, nonetheless."

I also did my master's in the Netherlands, btw. Being an international student I HAD to complete it in a year, unlike my Dutch and European classmates. They managed to include Aisec, foreign exchange programs, internships + god knows what and extended their degrees to more than two years. 

So yeah, I totally get that. I didn't even have a choice, which was the worst part.

At the same time though, your friends are not wrong/stupid to be student clubs presidents and all that. For people wanting to get corporate jobs and all it is useful to have that kind of experience.

As for the job market, yes it sucks. As an international graduate who spoke less than fluent Dutch, it was a nightmare. But I did manage to get a job there and things were a lot better when I was working. It's a numbers game, you have to keep at it and use each rejection to improve yourself.

I’ve stayed in touch with my friends for the most part, we’re just more distant and don’t see each other as much. And I still have my same values and personality but I’ve grown into myself more if that makes sense. I’m still me but I have a deeper understanding of myself, my passions, and my understanding of the world. I feel like I’ve experienced a genuine evolution from the high school student that could careless about societal issues/politics, or about budgeting my paychecks to make sure i’m saving enough and have enough for food and clothes without splurging, into the adult that cares about those things, has a deeper understanding of the world around me, myself as a person, both my flaws and gifts, and person with a better sense of responsibility and even better work ethic. Some of those things were things instilled in me as child that I just had to cast away childish whims to take advantage of, but some of those I’ve come to as i’ve grown from each challenge adult life, work, and college has thrown at me. 

I’m a little older, and a little wiser now, basically. And there’s still plenty of room to grow here. Change can be a good thing ya’ll! It forces you to grow into yourself, rise to the challenges you come across and you’ll come out the other side usually a better person for it."

9750,What job did you get at starting level to work up?
9751,"It’s a fucking luck and numbers game, my friend. Set daily or weekly goals now on how many gigs you’re going to apply to months before graduating. I lucked out with a great job right out of college, but when applying for it it didn’t stand out as special or “the one.” No way to know I was going to get it or that it’d actually be a healthy, happy work environment. You just gotta stay positive (I know easier said than done but still) and just try your best on every app. Can’t win them all and rejections will come and they will hurt, but you only need one win. It’s grind but the more potential opportunities you try for, the better your stats for success will be, right?

There’s no science to it and it’s all subjective bullshit and it all gets easier once you get some real experience in the work force so just do whatever you gotta to get your foot in the door. GPA doesn’t matter at all (and if it does to an employer and not to you then it’s probably not a place you wanna work at anyways), but it especially doesn’t matter once you can prove you can do the thing.

I had a garbage GPA, technically didn’t finish because I ran out of money and owe one elective credit, and was applying from out of state to many places so I had to do digital interviews so the deck felt pretty stacked against me, but I applied to like 60 jobs in my last semester and got one. Now I feel like I have real options almost a year into this job. You can do it, dude. Stay hungry and apply to more jobs than even seems rational. You only need one to say yes."
9752,"It feels weird to say, but the ""education system"" is a scam. Not in the way where its not useful. Its very useful. But the name itself is very misleading. Its less about education and more about shelling out money to get a degree."

There are \*tons\* of jobs outside of school and a Bachelor's Degree in the US will get you in the door. I crossed the 6 figure mark when I was 29 (though this is also based on living in a high cost of living area) and have navigated a successful and lucrative career within HR over the last 17 years. My GPA was like 3.1 from some random school that specializes in Education. I promise you will absolutely be fine"
9754,"Nope you’re screwed and you’re going to be homeless. 

But seriously you’ll be fine. Just relax. No one gives a shit about your gpa anyway. Some do of course but barely. You have a degree, that’s typically enough. What do you want to do with yourself?"
9755,"I'd say worry about graduating first. You're too far in NOT to get that degree. Worry about the job search after that.

Now as far as the GPA, mind my asking where you went to school? Most jobs typically don't ask your GPA when you apply or in interviews, and if it does come up, there are those degree that are tough where people understand why you might have a low GPA as well as schools that are notoriously tough. As an architect for instance, it's pretty normal for us to be pulling flat C's, which is why people don't bat an eyelash in interviews at a low GPA. Or going to a place like CalTech- people would be impressed you simply got out of there with a degree- they're probably not going to focus on GPA. Even where I went, bio is tough. I had friends who came out with under 3.0 GPAs and got jobs as lab technicians and the like. Med school was out of the question, but they were in a tough field and we went to a top 40 undergrad school, so there definitely were people who would employ them.

What really matters in the job search are your practical skills and references. The workplace is wildly different from school, and as such, most people really don't raise an eyebrow at your GPA, even if it does come up. Do you have strong references? Have you worked any bio related jobs? Those are the tough parts in this, not the GPA"
9756,"If you focus more on yourself and the skills you do have, you won't have a problem."
9757,Have you applied anywhere yet?
9758,"I am about 11 years out of college, and I didn't have a great GPA.  I think the true value in a college education is the friends you make and the relationships that you build during that time.  Finding work through those connections are better/more reliable than sending resumes to hundreds of places."
9759,Wasn't really my experience with Computer Science (graduated with a 2.98 GPA with no internships). Could not find a job for a year and a half that was development related. Ended up with a Software QA job.
9760,are you getting a masters in cyber security?
9761,I really want to go into the wildlife conservation route but take some time to focus on real estate before I focus on finding a time demanding job.
9762,"I graduated like 5 years ago and have been in my career since graduation, no problems"
9763,"Currently I am, but taking it pretty slowly as my work can only pay for 9 credits per year. Got about 1.5 years left. Not the most necessary degree in my field but it definitely isn’t a negative."
9764,Yes.
9765,"Start looking, applying, and weighing your prospects immediately.  Make those connections, burnish your resume and start to solve how you can approach the job market, what niche you can fill, and which skills you can sell.  There's a better than minimal chance that a global recession is tightening the market for new grads and you want to get out ahead of this."
9766,"Up! Just keep studying, learning and going through your dreams. Don’t give a shit to anxiety, trust in yourself and trust in your goals because you’re gonna achieve it!!! Praying for you, man 👊🏻"
9767,"What do I do if they do require it for a grad program. I currently finished getting my bachelor’s in Psychology with a gpa. Not good, I know, but I feel stuck like I won’t be able to get into a master’s program or be able to get job( a lot require that you have a master’s, or at least clinical experience)"
9768,"Applying early is absolutely important, especially if you have a lower GPA like OP to get the most advantage as possible"
9769,Go for it. Do you have an idea for how you could get that kind of job?
9770,"It really depends on your life goal. If you wish to apply to where GPA matters, such as academic fields, then it might be though for you. However, if you wish to apply to private companies or found your own business, then you don't need to worry about one."
9771,"> ask them what they hate doing the most and see if you can take it off their plate. Think about what would help the company most from your field. 

Yeah so /u/10pumpsclassic do not do this. This is the worst advice I've ever seen on this sub

For sure keep learning, on your own, and look for a different job if you really want something to do. Having this job is going to make that easier. Learn to do something new AND look for a different job.. while getting paid! You could also just chill and see what happens, find different ways to discretely entertain yourself while on the clock

Anything like that quotation is just going to get you abused. You're already bored; you don't want to be doing ""whatever management hates doing."" It's not your company; just move on"
9772,"May I ask how you found/got this job? I have a degree in advertising and haven’t been able to find entry level work at an agency, I have interned at one but I disliked the management. Your job sounds perfect even if it’s starting off slow 

I don’t have much to add other than to just wait it out like your director said, which is what I would do. And in the meantime maybe think about what position you want to move up to and start researching and learning about it to get a head start while you have the time"
9773,"They don’t sound bitter, it’s just that your advice is a recipe for disaster. I’m glad it worked out for you and you have a good employer, but you shouldn’t do that with just any employer"
9774,I was expecting work to be so hard. Its actually somewhat of a disappointment that its not and the bigger problem it being too easy or mundane. I often ask myself did I really go to college for this?

9776,"There are six major holding companies that specialize in advertising media. If you want to try working for a creative agency, there is no big 6. But if you want to do media, then look into the big 6.

Otherwise, you can try Googling job searches in digital marketing, like paid search, paid social, media planning, media buying, assistant negotiator, sem associate, seo coordinator etc."
9777,"As you get more senior, you're paid for your knowledge/skills more than your time.

At entry level, it may be that they have enough grads to keep things chugging along without putting too much pressure on a few people."
9778,"Learn new skills, try your hand at anything interesting, passion projects etc. I recommend “real world” stuff like how to work with soil to successfully grow food — after a decade of agency/computer work, I’m finding this way more fulfilling!"
9779,"Nah this is some Gen-X yuppie shit. Weird, baseless optimism guided by survivorship bias"
9780,"as someone who's been in the workforce for a while, this is a lucky position to be in. the longer you stay at this job, the more responsibilities you'll pick up. try not to say yes to too many things because eventually it will be more than you can handle."
9781,OP probably just applied and killed it at the fairly extensive interview. Big 6 are hiring constantly especially with all the layoffs.
9782,"What I’m about to say isn’t necessarily true across every single vertical, but I found that there is this kind of curve in a lot of corporate structures in terms of how much work you actually do and your position/title     In the company. What you’re saying/your experience mirrored mine in a lot of ways.

Basically you start out not having that much responsibility. And sometimes there’s a lot of tactical work you have to do day, other times there isn’t - but at the end of the day there is probably someone over you who actually is responsible for the stuff that you’re working on. 

After about year 3 -4 you start to have ownership and your work gets a lot harder because now you still do a lot of the tactical work but you also own it. Not to mention you might have one to three direct reports at this point. 

From then on a lot of corporate structures want you to focus more on managing team members and less on day-to-day execution of work. This isn’t everyone’s cup of tea but you spend more time in meetings and emails than anything else. You also can tell people to do stuff more and if you are really good at delegating you don’t have to worry about too much actual work. If you are bad at delegating, you will spend way too much of your time worrying about stuff below your pay grade while also being responsible for too many people and too many things for your work life balance to be sustainable, so many people plateau here I think. 

I would try to find a company that challenges you more at the lower levels so that when it comes to having a few years under your belt, you’re really good and knowledgeable at what you do. Also I have found myself in a company at the early stages of my career where I could absolutely coast. It was great for work life balance but I was also making little money and it took forever to get promoted. Also I felt it attracted coworkers who were not very motivated and enjoyed having an easy job, which basically provided this vicious circle effect of acting like children and being treated like children. 

When I left this company, the first six months of my next job were a huge challenge. That said my expertise, confidence in my work, and career trajectory would not have been anything like it turned out had  I not jumped ship from the easy job. 

I recommend if you are feeling unfulfilled with your work:

1. Find something other than work which gives you purpose.
2. Actively seek a company with people who impress you, and try and become one of them.

People say number one all the time - it’s not a novel sentiment to say that you shouldn’t get your fulfillment from work. My guess is that people amplify that to make themselves feel better about not liking their jobs. Work is not the most important thing in life, but most people are going to spend a whole goddamn lot of their day working. To me, it’s too much of your life to spend completely unfulfilled."
9783,"Also in media and I’m assuming you’re working on a single account? Those multi account kids are slammed and so are the busy accounts, but your account is probably responding to the economic uncertainty atm,

 But digital marketing is notorious for ebbs and flows - slow days and then days when you are fucked."
9784,"I have a similar type of job but lower pay. It's 10 hour shifts and it's boring af and customer service. We're not supposed to, but luckily for me I read books. But I'm getting tired of reading books day in and out so I'm looking for another job."
9785,Just dont forget to ask for proper compensation once you're good at it and they cant afford to take you off the team
9786,But how did you get your job specifically?
9787,Just apply to every agency's open roles. Entry-level is in demand right now.
9788,">A bit rude on the response there bud, just because you don't agree doesn't mean it's the wrong decision. 

I disagree, because I absolutely believe it to be the wrong decision (in this case, by an enormous margin). That's why I disagree. That's what disagreement is. That's how that works."

9790,"Lol recipe for disaster is a bit of a stretch. He loves his job but you think advice to ""look for a different job"" or ""just chill and see what happens"" is better? 

If you love your job then you should put in the effort to grow and thrive. If you're taking care of difficult stuff that gives you leverage to ask for promotions and raises, it makes you a more valuable asset that they won't want to lose. Obviously if they don't appreciate him down the road it's not the right place to be but he just started and showing your value is way better than finding ways to entertain yourself while on the clock 🙄"
9791,"graduated in june of 2020, didn't get a full time position till june of 2021.

find some other things to do in your extra free time. pick up a hobby, exercise as much as you can, work on projects related to your field to bolster your resume if possible. anything you can do to keep busy and feel good about yourself. being on the job search definitely sucks and those things helped me mitigate those negative feelings. try to not let the constant rejection get to you and find as many ways to automate the process of applying as possible."
9792,I’m on the same boat as well. I always see a lot “go out ! Find activities to do!” Kind of hard to do that when it’s hard to get around and the public transportation is a joke where I’m at.
9793,"I agree with another commenter, we place too much focus on goals. Once we achieve those goals…. Then what?

I’ve been out of college for 2 years now. It took me 6.5 to graduate so I spent more time in than most. Once I graduated I fell into that same thought process. Got myself a job that was so mundane and repetitive and i just kind of accepted that this is what life is. Recently accepted a job offer for a more exciting job, more pay, and more responsibilities. So exciting, right? I should be happy, right? But I’m not. In fact since I’ve gotten the offer I’ve spiraled more out of control than I have in a while. Because all my work up until this point was getting a job like this. Now I have it (haven’t started yet) but now what???? 

I agree that you need to find something outside of work and school. Some goal that’s completely unrelated. It’s important to find something outside of it that will fulfill you when work doesn’t. For me, I had my social group. Well that eventually fell apart and I had nothing to keep me satisfied outside of work. I’m not sure what your interests are but it’s worth looking into things you might like, and things you can do alone if you don’t have anyone to do it with you."
9794,"Take it from someone in the corporate grind 18+ years - enjoy the time. Sleep in, do what you enjoy, go to the beach, read some books, feel no guilt- you completed your higher education, enjoy it.
Once you start working, these breaks are elusive.
Congratulations."
9795,"I graduated 6 years ago and I remember feeling the exact same way. It was hard to get out of bed and even harder to look for a job. I think I spent 3 months doing absolutely nothing of value before a family member basically set up an interview for me. 

The first real change in my mental state was when I stopped thinking about goals as a finish line to cross, but more as a spot to rest before continuing on. Think about it like this: you're 18. You have hopefully 4 more lifetimes ahead to experience (and you don't have to deal with the growing up part that took the first 16 years to slog through). Why worry about what's going to happen in a month besides food, water, and shelter?"
9796,"I graduated in 2020 and have had a few different entry level jobs since then, and now I finally have one thats more long term. My advice is to just focus on exploring your interests/passions in the meantime, and when it comes to jobs, after shaping up your resume and making an easily copy pasted cover letter, it just a numbers game. keep applying, even though it can be soul sucking (I’d apply to 25 everyday at some points in time, I know the feeling well)

It’s also  important to not be hard on yourself though. Millions of other graduates are in the same exact position, and the job market is still reeling from the pandemic. There will probably be some shite interviews, I know i has a good few, but it’s better to learn and make changes than give up or beat yourself up over it.

Last piece of advice regarding interviews, they’re simply ways for both parties to put everything on the table and see if there’s a match. Make sure you know what you’re looking for (benefits, wfh vs in office, salary, etc) and feel free to explain why, it shows them that you’ve thought about this/are taking it seriously.

Anyways those are my morning ramblings about jobs after college, feel free to dm me if you have questions!"
9797,"I so agree with this! We define so much of ourselves by our goals, and a lot of times those goals are tied to achievements that are coveted by our cultures, societies, and communities.

So much of my early adulthood has been about reconnecting with my childhood and reminding myself about the experience in the journey.

""Why did I make this goal in the first place?""

""Do I truly feel like I was the one who set the expectations for this goal I made?""

""Am I being reasonable when holding myself accountable for my capabilities, but also the aspirations I want out of this goal/experience?""


I find it funny that you use the black belt example, because that was my experience growing up with Taekwondo. I originally wanted to do Taekwondo as a child just because I thought it'd be fun. Getting a black belt was a side reward for my love and dedication to a sport and culture I grew to love.

All the time I would see other students quit. It was hard for me to watch, especially if they were someone I had trained alongside for a long time. I never really understood why they quit when it happened. I knew they had other things to do, and surely other things they'd rather do, but as a kid it was hard for me to fathom myself not loving the experience of the journey so much. These days I'm working to not be so hard on myself when I don't achieve a goal or a moment that I tie a perfect expectation or satisfaction to.

In my study of Psychology I learned a lot about identity, and how identity is even tied to our goals in some ways. The example I remember most from my studies is one of two different runners that each lose the ability to run in an accident. Both of these runners had lifelong passions for running, but both had different reactions when told by their doctors that their running careers would be over. While both were devastated, one had an extremely tough time mentally recovering. To him, running was his life. It was what got him up every day, it's what got him to work, it was what he took vacations to do, and how he couldn't have ""any of it anymore."" The second man had his difficulties, but his relationship with running was different in that to him running was a way that he could also live out his identity and passions conveniently. Running was a way to give him a space to clear his head when he was stressed, a way to connect with new people, and a way to improve his physical health. If your passions are interwoven with your goals tightly, there's definitely a lot of cognitive reframing that needs to be done in order to find other ways to enjoy the feelings that those goals and that identity gave you.


Do you think that it is maybe an education issue? Have we forgot to teach our children to value practice, or have our cultures made us forget too easily? I loved reading your thoughts, and am very grateful for them today!"
9798,"I'm happy you found my comment useful. I don't want to sound too authoritative, because I'm still trying to work this stuff out myself. As it stands, I have final year exams in two weeks that I haven't put in enough work for. I kept procrastinating on studying for them, and it's put me in a bad situation.

What I realised from my situation is that I'm constantly worrying about grades and always trying to calculate the bare-minimum effort I need to put in to get the required grades, and it's been a terrible and lazy strategy. The solution, to me, seems to be to not see my course modules as a bunch of study material that I 'just need to get through', but to see the material as something to be practised with my attention in the moment.

It's still difficult for me to put it elegantly, but I've only recently come to appreciate the value of treating my tasks and activities as 'things to be practised with focus in the moment', rather than just trying to get through my activities as fast as possible, worried about all the other work I need to do, and not giving the activities the focus that they deserve.

In terms of education issues, I hadn't thought about it much until you said it. To me, I think that it's a mistake to send a child to a school run by the state and to expect the state-run school to be providing a sophisticated and rounded education that will carry them through life. That said, the fact that we have free schooling is great considering that only ~150 years ago so few people were able to access any school education at all.

I think that schools are great for teaching core skills like maths, English, and maybe IT skills, but they don't really teach life skills, and I don't think that they ever will in any meaningful sense. Hopefully many life skills come from the parents of children, but this is often not the case. Otherwise, for the skills and knowledge that we need, we will have to find them for ourselves by talking to the right people, reading good books, and best of all, the internet. If you can learn to manage your attention, the wealth of information that can be acquired online is historically unprecedented.

For myself, I believe that the most important skills are the ability to focus, which can be practised with meditation. Concentration meditation helps build the power of focus, and I think that mindfulness meditation helps build the ability to 1) know where your focus is at any one given time and 2) to shift your focus to the area of your choosing.

I think it's important to learn how to study properly. I was never taught the proper way to study at school, so this is a skill we must discover ourselves.

I think it's important to learn how to write an essay properly, so that you can organise your thoughts properly.

And of course, like my original comment, I think it's good to choose meaningful goals, break down the goals into activities that you can practise regularly, and to focus your attention on the practice of these meaningful activities. Practise practising! Get used to the idea of focusing on and giving your all to the process itself, rather than seeing the process as a boring thing to be grinded through until you attain your goal.

I think a good source of similar (and more coherent!) ideas on this topic would be James Clear. He wrote the book Atomic Habits, and the way he wrote his book was by regularly writing posts to his blog over a few years, and then he combined them into a best selling book. In essence, his goal was writing a book, but rather than focusing on writing a book, he focused on writing two blog posts a week. By practising writing twice a week, he eventually wrote enough to combine it all into a book. I recommend his blog, there are lot of interesting things about habits on there, among other ideas."
9799,Experiencing it rn
9800,Lol literally same
9801,Thank you. What do you do?
9802,"If I would've chosen anything other than my liberal arts major, I likely wouldn't have gotten into my college. Stem and business majors are impacted due to demand for those degrees. Given my experience since college, I wouldn't have gone anyway. I just did the math and I can't afford a studio apartment next to my job, like at all. The apartment would cost $50 more per month than I would bring home after taxes, and it's at least a 30 year old mediocre building, not some crazy nice place."
9803,"Life pro tip, probably not really that useful to anyone here but if you're ever in that situation: major in math and then switch out later. 

Most stem major prereqs require a lot of math so you can get those classes easily but the major itself is never an impacted one."
9804,"I have classmates that are in their 40's, changing careers, and some even have kids. It's never too late! I also had that feeling of ""well then what was the past 4 years of schooling for"" but the thing is the past is the past, and our lives are still ways ahead of us :)"
9805,"Lets assume for a second that that didn't sound so absurd. Do you genuinely think there's enough rich people out there for every person the system failed??? Especially in California where one parent who make 6 figures still isn't enough and both parents actually need to work. Its 2022, get out of that mindset."
9806,I wish I had done nursing too. I transferred to a school for sophmore year that was way too competitive for nursing. But I only started thinking abt it the summer before I started there. So after my junior year I dropped out and went back home to community college but never pursued nursing. I thought I wanted to do pt but realized that would be too hard. Now I’m in my ‘fifth’ year and still years away form graduating my pta program. But still wondering if nursing would have been best.
9807,"Exactly! Thankfully I don't have any loans. But most people that take them out when they're 18 don't truly understand what a 15k loan vs 80k loan means. They're 18, how can they? Some high school and college counselors do educate students about income outlook but at that age any number sounds amazing. They fail to provide the important numbers such as average housing cost, interest rates, and cost of living."
9808,Sorry I don’t have any advice though I do agree. I wish I was taught better but wishing won’t change the past. Thank you for your insight on what jobs are available.
9809,Work to get a higher paying recruiter job at a different company OR start learning skills for other jobs you can do as a Comm major. Sales is an option.
9810,Dental hygiene does require licensure and usually at least an associates degree in dental hygiene. Extremely high demand for them right now.
9811,Actually useful advice. I did this completely by accident because I wasn’t able to do engineering or business. I ended up graduating with a public policy degree. Now I’m in a Data Science master’s program and those undergraduate courses in Math and Statistics I did actually became really useful.
9812,[deleted]
9813,"I'd like to add that there was just simply more healthcare jobs to go around than business jobs. For every 20 nursing jobs I was hiring for, I was hiring one business job."
9814,"Yeah I'd be happy to answer any questions you have, feel free to message me too.
Physical Therapists are doctorate level degrees so yes they're expected to make that. Though licensing is a must for them, Dental Hygiene and Nursing only need their associates degree (they can get their bachelors for director, extensive care, and research level positions)"
9815,"thanks for the advice! I actually quit my job two months ago in search for a higher paying job and got a lot of higher offers, but none that made a substantial difference. Did the math and with those offers, yes I can afford an apartment. But that's probably as far as I'd get. Still only making enough to make ends meet, the only way I could afford a house in California one day is going this route. Plus sales/commission based jobs are not for me, worst case scenario I didn't make a sale in a month then I'd have no income, and so many factors in sales too that aren't in our control such as demand oh and a pandemic."
9816,Move? I was born here lol
9817,"Yeah blame the commonfolk lol. I think the main problem is greedy corporations who keeps finding ways to pay people less by wage discretion. And by that logic, you're saying everyone who doesn't make 200k should move out. Now who will work the restaurants, the malls, street sweepers, or jobs that actually help society: fire fighters, nurses, etc. The CEO who just sits in meetings all day doesn't deserve to live in LA anymore than those people"
9818,what do you do and how much is it paying
9819,"Im assuming you also did communications. Feeling like you chose the wrong major is a mindset, Im glad you're happy but personally I'm not (even though based on your last post you're getting into coding now) I also recruited for public relations and social media positions all of which paid scrap in comparison to science and engineering jobs. Again what is this mystery communications field that makes bank?"
9820,"I know you’re right, but mental health stuff keeps me from being able to focus on schoolwork and stuff like that:( just feels like there’s so much pressure to graduate and start life. But also even then, the outlook for the future seems bleak. Sorry abt the rant on top of ur rant. More so just givin a full picture on it."
9821,"I'm currently trying to switch fields from what I studied in university, so I understand. It's not really easy, but I'm currently doing an internship in another field."
9822,"No, I didn't. I studied Speech-Language Pathology, you need a masters to become a Speech-Language Pathologist though. Getting into that program is notoriously hard and I'm also not that passionate about it. Although, I loved working with children and helping others improve their communication. 

I'm not necessarily ""happy"" with my choice, I'm in a totally different field right now. I got into it because I already had internships in a totally different field, so that could be your way of pivoting."
9823,"Then housing prices and cost of living will drop then these low wage jobs wouldn't be too bad and other people will move in to work said jobs. Also the rich politicians who pocket our tax money should be the one to tackle these issues by maybe increasing minimum wage or maybe by capping the wage difference between the CEO and the lowest paid employee. Big corporations donate to politician campaigns which is why politicians wouldn't dare do any of that. But also why should the people who just want to work, live comfortably, and go about their day pack their things and move just to tackle these greed and power issues caused by evil people at the top. I know its comfortable and gives the mind some ease to comment these simple solutions on reddit and assume its helpful, but its just way too complex of a problem, so maybe try not to."
9824,You live in la and you got a communications degree and only made 24hr. No one moves to la unless they're trying to be famous or get a job that will lead to a 200k salary. I think that was the main problem.
9825,"I didn’t choose the wrong major, it’s a profitable field if you can get into the graduate program. But hey, you can always do internships in some other field"
9826,Yall could send a message to la by moving and not having anyone work those jobs unless they pay more.

9828,"This. I graduated with a BA in psych, sort of a useless major, but i transferred my skills into becoming an IT Project Manager."
9829,"If someone had told me that there was more to life than school, I’d probably be in a different place by now.  Alas, I am blocked by my mother who seems to think that if I don’t eat, sleep, and breathe something, I must not be interested in it."
9830,"Thanks for sharing OP. Life after school is hard and id be lying if i said I was never in your position. Nonetheless, you’ll notice life can go in cycles, with highs and lows. Best of luck in your future and if you’d like some career consulting, know that we’re all here for you. From one stranger to another, dont quit on yourself"
9831,"You mention chronic headaches. Have you seen a doctor/therapist for it? I've heard chronic headache can be related to ADHD. Do you struggle in other ways in life? Being treated for ADHD changed my life and is underdiagnosed. Otherwise I hope you take care of yourself, OP. Life is too short to worry about money."
9832,"I did the same for the same reasons. I decided to major in computer science because i thought it would 1) be better than it was, 2) make me employable, 3) make others perceive me as smart. I graduated in 3 years, and immediately had a crisis. So many of my goals were built on the foundation of proving myself, and even upon hearing validation, it all felt so empty and undeserved.
I had an internship in the field, and eventually, I left to pursue game design, which was originally what i was interested in. Battling with depression it’s been really hard to get into, and I still have my doubts of whether I’m capable of it. But I’m doing my masters for it and i have an internship with a studio and despite a lot of days feeling monotonous (also living at home) at least now i have some type of goal i care about.
It’s not too late, we’re still young. There’s no need to pigeonhole ourselves into a lifelong career yet, you know? Maybe work as a waiter, bartender, something completely different from what you’re doing. I may try that myself tbh, not meeting a ton of people out here.
life isn’t without it’s huge share of rough days lately, but i have a goal now that is so much more true to what i want to do and it’s not too late for you either.
Hang in there, friend. This time after college, all these regrets of what we could have or should have done, it sucks. It’s so confusing. But keep taking the next breath, and as my dad tells me, “it’s the next decision that matters, so focus on that.” I’m rooting for you, and I hope we both make it out the other side."
9833,"Why the rush? Is someone telling you that you HAVE to go back to school right now? Your number one focus should be a nice stable job that you said needs to support you. Go and do that first, apply to the many of places that need people right now. Our country is in a spot right now where wages are going up and benefits are becoming better because businesses need workers. Now is the time to find a good job. Stick with it for a while until your comfortable, then start by thinking of taking 1 or 2 courses a semester alongside your job. Doesn’t have to be a university or anything, can be simple community colleges classes. It really doesn’t matter where your degree is from, if a job sees that you have a degree in the field your applying for, they’ll certainly be happy. Just try to take from this, there’s no rush, you have all of the time right now to make decisions, nobody knows for sure what they want to do until they’ve actually worked the job firsthand. So never think it’s too late, your young and still have all the time in the world to figure it out."
9834,"I know it's hard, but please, don't give up on life. I know how it feels. I've been there, feeling like I just want to end my life. I've been hospitalized for those thoughts. But it's not worth it. Nothing is worth taking your own life. Talk to a therapist or psychologist. If you have trouble getting set up with one, talk to your boss about your thoughts and issues you've been having. In the jobs I've gone through, I have yet to see a boss who will not help you get set up. It may not always feel like it, but your boss does care about you and your health. People do care about you. Hell, I care about you, and I'm a total stranger. And I mean that sincerely.

It may take time and patience, but you can always turn your life toward where you want to go. My brother was a teacher and found he didn't enjoy it. He's now working toward a degree in computer sciences. One of my college professors taught communications and got sick of the politics of teaching college. He's now a pilot. It takes time, but there is no reason you cannot work your way toward the career you feel will make you happy.

But please, first and foremost, talk to a professional to help fight your ideation. Take it from someone who has spent the last decade learning how to fight it and is on an antidepressant and mood stabilizer for aid. They are there to help. They can even help you find a way to get back on the path you want. I know the therapists and counselors I've had have done that. Multiple times in many areas, in fact, whether it be trying to get myself being more productive in my interests (music), creating plans to eat healthier (still working on that one), finding a way to enjoy my job more, exercising better (also still working on that one), etc.

But all in all, don't end it. It is never worth it. Take it from a stranger who has both thought about going through with it and who has experience with losing classmates through suicide. It is never worth it for any reason."
9835,Soft skills. I usually take charge of group projects in college and enjoy scheduling and monitoring/pushing project milestones. The IT side of it was super difficult as I had no experience in IT but you learn it in the job too. Id recommend starting your own projects or getting a PMI cert if you’re serious. Look for JR PM roles and try to learn about data ingestion through cloud. PM can be a super stressful position so i dont recommend for the faint of heart or the lazy
9836,Can you tell me how you transitioned into bring a PM? I have a similar degree and can’t get a job
9837,"I’m in a somewhat similar situation, as I got a STEM degree (Digital Media Innovation) and I’m now making about $37,000 per year. Now this isn’t terrible, but I also can’t afford to move out of my parents’ house because I have a car payment and other payments that would prevent me from being able to afford rent and a comfortable lifestyle. 

Because of this, I decided to sign up for a coding bootcamp to pursue a skill set that would hopefully get me into a higher paying job. 

My suggestion to you would be to pursue graphic design, which doesn’t necessarily mean going back to school because there’s tons of online resources to help you build a portfolio. As someone who did graphic design internships I can tell you that the main thing hiring managers are looking for is a good portfolio. I also don’t think that graphic design is super low paying, depending on where you live I’ve seen salaries from $40,000-$60,000 which really isn’t bad. In addition you can do freelance work or you can make designs and start an Etsy shop with passive income. 

I think that pursing something that you’re passionate about could really help with your mental health. I’d recommend searching YouTube for graphic design courses and building a portfolio that you can add on a resume. 

I’m really sorry you’re going through this but please know that you’re not alone. I think about my friends who are so much better off than me and who are out of their parents house and I can’t help but compare my life and my job to theirs. I’m pursing coding because I am passionate about it but I also want to do it to show people I’m capable of it. 

If you need someone to talk to please don’t hesitate to message me :)"
9838,"Don't kill yourself man. what do you think your parents will do when they heard their only child committed suicide.

Try Google IT certificate and CompTIA A+. Since you have a bachelor degree, you just gotta slap these two certificates on top of it, then you can get a decent helpdesk job pay around $18 - $22/h.  

I am going to get myself Google IT certificate. It cost $40/month for 6 months = $240."
9839,"Let me just say that there are soooo many people who feel the same as you. You are not alone. A lot of us got screwed. Don't be hard on yourself for that. There were a lot of lies given to us, and at 18 years old it was easy to fall for them."
9840,"Focus on what you like doing in your spare time. If you focus on it enough, it can give you enough of a portfolio to potentially get a job doing graphic designs at a company. When I graduated I wasn’t doing exactly what I wanted, so I quit and formed a business centered around automation and microelectronics. This side business helped me get the position I am in now which is more automation and development focused, where in the past I was never given an opportunity to learn and do the things I wanted. I had to do it myself and show I was capable before anyone trusted me. Once you get your foot in the door, experience trumps a degree especially with something like graphic design. You don’t necessarily need a degree if you have experience in the field. Good luck, you still have a ton of time to turn your situation into a good one."
9841,"When was time to choose a college course, I went into Social Sciences. EVERYONE said that I would struggle to find a job, that I would be poor, etc. And they were right. After school, I came back to my parents house. Got a minimum wage job, just to have some change to spare. Ended up into another field (education). A great opportunity presented itself, and Monday I'm moving out with a good paying job (not great, but waaaay better that what I have), and prospect of increasing in the next years. For a time, all seemed lost. It seemed like I made all the wrong choices. And sometimes we do choose wrong, and that's ok. If we keep exploring, keep grinding, and accept that we are not perfect, eventually we'll find our way. I know that there's no light right now. But don't give up. It'll come a day when you look back, maybe in a whole different path that what you envisioned, and wonder why you were so worried at the time. It's cheesy but it happens, more often than not."
9842,"Your college years were not a waste! I was in a very similar situation and also went into a STEM major because I wanted a stable job after school without actually thinking about whether I would like working in my field. Well, I ended up not doing anything close to what I studied and was lost for a few years after graduating but I kept exploring my interests through  classes on edX, connecting with people, and getting admin jobs in areas I was interested in but didn’t have the right qualifications for. I found that I had so many transferable skills from my STEM training - leadership, problem solving, attention to detail. I am still making very little money and cannot move out yet but I am doing a master’s program at my local city university and am optimistic about finding a job I love after graduation. I would highly recommend looking into free classes to explore your interest in graphic design more and eventually, if you think it’s where you want to go, apply to a local state or city college because it will be much cheaper to attend. This isn’t going to be a quick or easy journey but you have so much life ahead of you! One thing that helped me a lot was not thinking about being on a timeline or comparing myself to my peers. Everyone is at different places and paces in life. Please don’t take your own life. You can get through this. Sending you all my best."
9843,"I will tell you what this one stranger in the gym once told me.

""Don't cheat yourself.""

Usually, I ignore strangers, but his random interruption during my set was what I needed to finish what I started. 

Please apply that same mentality to your situation. Just because your major said one thing doesn't mean your major is you, the individual.

Mr. Bean received a degree in Electrical Engineering; the world doesn't even know him as an Engineer! He's an actor! 

I hope my words were enough to get you to see the bigger picture.
 
Godspeed"
9844,as someone struggling with their current path in college right now this means a lot to me
9845,Same here
9846,💕💕
9847,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts, and I'm really sorry to hear that. The beauty of graphic design is that there are so many tools online to learn it that you don't necessarily have to go back to school. Udemy has a course for learning graphic design and it may be of use for you. Just remember that you can't be a pro graphic designer overnight, its gonna take a lot of dedication."
9848,"DM me if you need to speak about the mental health issues.

As for career, and graphic design specifically, I have a friend who is in much the same situation as you. He graduated with me in Mechanical Engineering, with absolutely no passion for it. Did a boot camp in UI/UX design, built a website as well as some other projects to get a portfolio going, and now he's applying and getting interviews and offers. It took him about 6 months for the boot camp, 3 months later he had got his first ever offer.

You have space to grow, thats the beautiful thing about life. Don't give up."
9849,"I promise you this gets better. I went to school for microbiology and I haven't done anything science related since school. My job now is in a different dimension from microbiology. What's important is that you went to school. I've also done hiring for positions that prefer degrees, and do you know how much we care about what that degree is? Zero. It could be astrophysics or it could be interdisciplinary studies and it counts just the same. 

One foot in front of the other one day at a time. Try different things and you will eventually land in a place that makes you happy. I'm old now compared to most of the people in this sub and it makes me so sad to think that you and I are living parallel lives at different points in time. If I had killed myself when I was going through what you're going through, I would have missed so much happiness just for the sake of ending a temporary problem. You are clearly a hard worker to get a science degree. Keep saying yes to new experiences and you will be ok."
9850,"Hi. Went into it as a electrical engineer, then finished as a geologist. Full time benefits stable career. 

Then changed my mind again 4 years into a career took a job as a technician at a biotech as a contractor, no benefits. 

Found one aspect in that field and pursued it. Now I have a MS in biotech and a great career great pay and great co workers and friends.

Anyways it’s 2022, graduated with bachelors in 2009, tried to commit suicide in 2017, got help through IOP and PHP programs and graduated with an MS in 2019. The dark days faded and I just love my life now. Also, got a dog and then two dogs and that helped. 

Anyways, job and work and career don’t define you. Don’t let something that your only suppose to do for 40hrs a week take your whole life."
9851,"so sorry if this posted multiple times, it wasn’t sending so i kept trying to because i thought it was important, just in case it helps"

9853,"I never seen myself going into education. If you told me that when I was in school I'd probably laugh, or despair. Maybe your next path is a strange one, just keep and opened mind and eyes. As someone else said here, many skills are transferable. You may find yourself in a non-STEM field using you STEM skills.

Edit: also, just saying, I have zero regrets going into Social Sciences. Maybe I can't get a job now in that field, but it was something I am still passionate about, and it opened my eyes to many things. Don't regret the path you took, even if it seemed like a mistake. It'll all make sense when you find your way, and you will."
9854,what is your job i may ask? and how did you get there and where to start?
9855,How do you get a resume to look like that when it's a psych resume?
9856,"Woah, this is referencing an old post. And trust me, i do consider myself lucky still. But honestly, nothing really matters when you feel suicidal. Whether you’ve set yourself up for success or not, it doesn’t feel worth making it to the next day regardless. I also don’t mean to complain or say by any means my experiences are worse than others, just to say that i took a different path and still ended up in the same place. It sounds really tough what you’re doing, but also i think your skills in business or other areas will actually help your design career as well. Something cool i saw a while back was how “creativity is forming new paths between seemingly unrelated things” and i fully believe that to be true. Considering you wound up on this old post i’m guessing you’re feeling similarly and searching for some type of answer, and i truly hope you’re able to find it. This time in life is so fucking tough for anyone and i hope you’re able to find your footing in design, and feel free to DM me if you ever want to talk."
9857,Thank you for the info! I will look into those things
9858,"Susan Cain writes about being an introvert.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Cain"
9859,"**Susan Cain**

Susan Horowitz Cain (born 1968) is an American writer and lecturer, and author of the 2012 non-fiction book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, which argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people. In 2015, Cain co-founded Quiet Revolution, a mission-based company with initiatives in the areas of children (parenting and education), lifestyle, and the workplace."
9860,"As an introvert myself, I find it helpful to professionalize the work you want to do in your head but are too afraid to do in your heart. Maybe as an introvert you probably aren't the one to organize a rally or cause a big ruckus. But if that's a part of your job, you tell yourself really quickly that that's the way it must be done. Sure, it may be uncomfortable or downright awful at first, but you'll get better and learn and hopefully get more comfortable with it after all is said and done"
9861,Don’t be an arsehole.
9862,"I can vouch for this 100%. Always been a loner introvert, got a fortunate professional opportunity that requires me to be outgoing and I just do it. Yeah it’s nerve-wracking but it’s getting wayyy better very quickly. Just gotta get out there and face it."

9865,"The fact that you're able to sit down, reflect and realize that you're motivated to make an impact is a very valuable quality. It's showing that you have thought about your beliefs and aspirations and recognized your weaknesses. Many people cannot do this, so give yourself some credit.

9871,Change yourself or forever live in irrelevancy
9872,Legal and profitable businesses can provide legitimate services for their customers while scamming their employees - a good thing to keep in mind
9873,"I don’t know if this helps, but I have a job that requires me to be on call after-hours in case of an emergency. Every time I answer the phone, it is an automatic 30 minutes of pay no matter how short the phone call is. If the call goes over 30 minutes, then it is an hour of pay. 

This was all clearly laid out to me during my interview process, along with the rate for my regular hourly pay. It feels very sketchy that they can’t/won’t give you a straight answer for how much you will be compensated and the red flag was raised for me reading that."
9874,Sounds like a scam.
9875,"Your gut is right - this is sketchy and I wouldn’t be surprised if some of those policies were actually illegal. Being on-call, unpaid and only guaranteed 15 min of pay if you do get a call is absurd. So many other red flags too. Keep looking you’ll find something!"
9876,"My gut's never been wrong when it comes to job offers (and every time I've ignored it, I've had to endure the very things my gut anticipated). Listen to your instincts – they have your best interests in mind! 

I understand you may urgently need work, but if you can keep looking, I would try to do that first."
9877,"Listen to your gut 100%. I know a lot of people in this sub would say take the job, but a bad job can really make your life hell. If you have a feeling you’ll hate working for this boss, then don’t do it.

Also, the fact that the boss mentioned firing people during your interview is always a red flag for me. Last company I worked for mentioned that they fired their entire marketing team during the interview, and I stupidly chose to ignore it. Once I joined, they also fired the CEO, and the development team. A year later, they chose to fire me. Whenever a company so casually mentions firing people, interpret that as they won’t be afraid to fire you."
9878,See.... this is what I thought she was implying at first with the whole 15 minutes thing. Then her going back on that and saying “we need to talk about it” made me cringe. So reading this comment makes me feel even more uncomfortable with what she said.
9879,"I’m a physical therapist that isn’t in private practice (we’re “corporate”) so we don’t operate like that. Front desk staff is hourly and working in office. To be on call 8 hrs a day without gaurenteed work seems frustrating and would cause me anxiety bc I would feel like I wouldn’t be able to get away from work. Your potential future boss seems really demanding and I wouldn’t want to work for them personally. From what you’ve said, she’s checking off some major red flags in my book. It seems like it is hitting some of your red flags as well since you already “dread” the job offer"
9880,"Definitely wouldn’t wanna work for the one boss, sounds like a nightmare. The job also sounds sketch, I’d look elsewhere. Source: am a therapist"
9881,"No I googled them, they’re real. It’s two therapists’ offices who I’d be working for as an intake coordinator if that helps give a clear picture."
9882,">> Source: am a therapist 

Amazing! So let me ask you, how do you pay your staff? (Especially if you have staff that work from home due to the pandemic?) 

I’d love to have something to compare this job offer to, and your opinion on why you think the job is sketchy."
9883,"honestly I think taking the job so that you can get a little bit of income, but continuing to look for a better job elsewhere could be a good move. Make sure to be clear that you will not agree to employment until you receive an offer letter/paperwork that explains exactly what your pay to look like. I’ve been at places that are great to work at but I ended up not knowing what my pay was until I had worked there for 3 weeks."
9884,"I was a senior in college and a small family owned business was hiring a copywriter/editor position. My degree is in English, so it sounded up my alley. I interviewed with one of the co-owners (the husband) and he was laid back and friendly. He seemed to like me and I walked away feeling good about it. Then his wife called me the next day and interviewed me as well. She spoke ill of her husband, saying, ""He goes off and hires students without even talking to me about it."" I felt like he had done that with me, which of course wasn't my fault, but she made me feel that way. I'm female, by the way, and I've always wondered if that's why she hated me? I did get the job, but she continued to give me bad vibes, the same way you're feeling. She hovered over me at work and was extremely harsh in reprimanding my work. She stood over me when I was doing things as simple as working a copy machine ""to make sure you do it exactly right."" One morning after working there for about a month, I walked in and she was waiting for me. She fired me. She said she didn't think I fit in well with the company and she also called into question whether I was actually going to school (???... I later got my masters degree, so I have no idea what that conspiracy was about). 

If I had to do it over again, I wish that I'd listened to my gut. It really sounds like the lady you've been interviewing with has interpersonal issues and I would not want to work with her or under her with her as my superior. I just think you need to take a step back and consider if this is really worth it as your first job. It sounds shady to begin with, but as I continued reading about her emails and talking about a past employee, I just really got a bad feeling about her. I'd run away and keep looking for the perfect fit."
9885,She smells blood in the water and knows you are a target that is accustom to being abused.
9886,What???? That’s insanity to me that you didn’t end up knowing until 3 weeks. I think I’m definitely gonna take your advice on that offer letter. It’ll buy me more time anyway.
9887,"I work in HR and have seen several instances of the kind of company you're describing - I empathise with your home situation but some of these guys can be so damn miserable to deal with.  There tends to be legislation around how much you have to be paid for taking a call or coming into work.  Also, you should be compensated for any time you're on call.  You're very right that this is sketchy.  When you see red flags in an interview like that or your questions aren't being answered consistently, you're right to trust your gut, and honestly they're looking for people who can't see the red flags or are vulnerable enough to take advantage of.  You don't want to deal with these guys, although I understand if you need to.  I wish you the best in your search."
9888,"Your potential boss is giving off a lot of red flags and trust if this is her behavior now when they’re supposed to be at their best (because of first impressions and because you’re interviewing them as much as they’re interviewing you) then you can have trust that it’s only gonna be worse once your livelihood depends on it.

Trust your gut!"
9889,"No, that sounds extremely fishy. Run, don't accept it."
9890,"Usually if you’re on call for anything, you should be paid for the time you’re on call, whether there are calls coming in or not, it’s not like you’re completely free to do other things"
9891,Oh!  That’s something I didn’t know.
9892,Thanks. 🎉 🎊
9893,Yep! That’s the plan. Looking forward to getting enough sleep again.

9910,ya'll in for a world of hurt
9911,I’m definitely less stressed working a full time office job than when I was in university. I love having weekends and evenings to myself without that feeling of “guilt” you mentioned. I hope you enjoy it too :)
9912,I understand especially after this year but at the same time; I am still not sure if I am even ready for the 9-5 boring grind. Like yes school sucks and it would be nice to be paid for the work I do instead of paying for it. But ehh idk yet..
9913,"Life is so much better outside of college. No more stressful tests, projects, and presentations. I go to work, and when I get off that time is mine. I don’t have to study afterwards or take my work home. It’s so freeing. I’m so thankful to be done with college."
9914,"Working a 9-5 office job has been SO MUCH easier than stressing pretty much every hour of every day in college. Senior year I’d wake up with nightmares that my thesis wasn’t going to get done. Now I spend 7 hours writing easy emails and 1 hour being worried, and then I watch TV, read books, exercise, and be happy!"
9915,"I can guarantee the economy never recovered from 2008. Graduated a few years ago, and STILL haven't landed anything permanent. Granted, I did teach abroad for a couple of years, but upon returning in '19, I learned the hard way the economy simply sucked. The pandemic made it even more competitive, but it's a bit easier to land a job since more places are hiring and remote interviews."
9916,"Yes life is what you make of it. If you keep a positive attitude and maintain a good work life balance, you’ll have a good time. 

Welcome to the real world."
9917,"This guy. I’ve waited for my bachelors for 8 years now. “I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready”-spongebob
And me probably"
9918,"That really depends on the person and the degree. Some people peak in high school, some in college, some in the \[right\] workplace, some in none of the above.

Personally, I couldn't wait to get out of school. The amount of hours I put into my architecture degree made me miserable, because it consumed my life. I also didn't like the culture- there was definitely a pervasive academic culture of what it ""meant"" to be a good designer, not to even get into the political attitudes of the people. I had the reputation in architecture school of being very counterculture to both the academic and prevailing social mindsets. Also the competitiveness- ugh. Ripping out pages from text books, crushing peoples' models. I remember I came to my studio desk one night and someone wrote ""my a\*\*hole hurts"" in sharpie all over one of my models. I felt a lot of social alienation, but I always worked hard and there were professors who acknowledged that and respected how I thought and it paid off in the end.

On the complete flip side, my girlfriend is in finance, and I'm regularly dealing with finance folks through her. She works long hours, her coworkers and friends work longer hours. Many partied it up in college and now are suffering through 80 hour work weeks, constantly chasing the ""prestige"" of a promotion and the large paycheck. It's a hollow existence, and many have openly said that and that they hate their current life, loved college, and are in the rat race for image and money.

This all hinges on what you want out of your life, your education, your work. I was thrilled about leaving school. Many others aren't. Really varies based on the person. You sound like you're in a good position though, and have the right mindset. I have no doubt you'll do great. And you're going into this with a growth mindset, which is the right way to think about things. Remember- you have agency. Give yourself credit for the amount of control you have for your outcomes, and remember that your happiness is a choice in this regard."
9919,"You should be excited! Like you mention, leaving work and focusing on your own thing is such a relief that you just don't get when you're studying. 
And also making your own money and not feeling guilty if you splurge on stuff like take away or pricey shampoos etc.. it's so nice!! 
But working comes with s new set of problems that I wasn't totally prepared for, like coworker dramas / feeling like you've sold yourself to cheap die to the current job market and such.

Still graduating is a total upgrade, congrats on getting there!"
9920,Yes. My college experience has been trash. Can’t wait to get in the real world.
9921,"In my last semester of college, I was ready to move on to the next stage of life, the post grad life, such as getting a 9-5 job, having stable income etc. My last semester i was just ready to leave college.

You generally have evenings and weekends to yourself, you have money, and if you live in a major metropolitan area, you can meet tons of new people.

Don't listen to the doomer propaganda here, saying ""Adulthood sucks"" etc. Adulthood is what you make of it, is it challenging yes, but it's soo worth it at the end."
9922,same!! 8 years now on april 1st. I'll probably graduate in the next 6 months. I'm so ready to move to a next chapter
9923,"School is a structured and controlled environment. Some people cannot function outside of that. 

At least you get paid to work."
9924,"I’ve been looking forward to graduating since I started. Part of it is my fault, I partied when I was 18 and then I was over it, I can’t play sports, and wasn’t super interested in any clubs.  So I didn’t continue to have the “college experience.” I’ve worked throughout all of it, and the idea of just working and not worrying about homework sounds incredible. And making better money. 

I have a lot of loans, but I’m not too worried about them! I picked a degree with quite a bit of job opportunity and I’m working in my field right now, so I feel pretty confident."
9925,I’m a project manager! Basically I ensure timelines and deliverables are on track.
9926,"I’m glad, congratulations!!

Yeah. I also went through my path at school with (and in no small part, for) my ex. She left two years ago or so.

I’m ready to move on to something my own. I’ve hated the campus because it always reminds me of her."
9927,Enjoy it while you can
9928,"Oh fuck yeah. I loved it but was really starting to burn downwards, I don’t know if I could have done another year. Working has been so enjoyable and much more simple."
9929,I don't know if I'm excited to graduate or just happy to be done with the work. I don't feel motivated right now.
9930,I felt the same way when I graduated until I discovered that companies tend to try to suck up all your free time too. It takes a lot of time management and boundary setting to do what you are talking about. Good luck!!
9931,I really want to fucking graduate. The constant stress of uni on your back is outrages.
9932,"It's really nice seeing people excited to graduate! I'm graduating in a few weeks and I can't wait to have a 9-5 schedule! The crazy, non-consistent schedule college provides makes me so stressed and I'm ready to be able to actually (roughly) know what I'm doing every week!"
9933,"Yes, but the 9 to 5 isn’t that great lol. Enjoy your time in college.. I like the 9 to 5 more than college since I spent most of my time drowning in work with some fun on the side — but in reality, just enjoy the ride. Some day you’ll be 60 and think back on these times with a smile."
9934,Ooh what kind of office job do you have?
9935,"i wasnt expecting such a well measured response like this, but i appreciate it! :)"
9936,Are you enjoying it more than your last semester of college?
9937,"My former manager said the same. All companies started do this thing, doing more work with less. They let go or let people retire and then give their job to existing employees. The job that 50 people used to do, 40 people now do."
9938,"I would say so, not at the current moment because of the pandemic, but once it's all over, i can get back to meeting new people, making new experiences, and having money!"
9939,"As an engineering major with some project management experience, thats cool to hear :)"
9940,"I don't keep up with everyone; that'd be insane. But I do have 4-5 friends that I chat with every week, and I'm in a few group chats as well that are a little larger. It's certainly harder after college, but it's not impossible. Both parties just have to put in the effort."
9941,"Unfortunately, I never made friends or acquaintances in college."
9942,"I met my best friend in college and to this day we talk every 3 to 4 days. Long conversations of at least 2 hours. We still travel together on vacations with no girlfriends or any other people. Last time we did a 4k miles road trip on the US; awesome trip.

I use to hang out with other people during college but I lost contact with them which I don’t regret since for that to happened means they were not real friends of mine."
9943,i don’t talk to anyone
9944,"I met so many people in college that a lot fell off, but I’d say they’re still my primary group of friends. I live in NY though so it’s a bit easier to maintain"
9945,"I still talk to some of my fraternity brothers, but, just like high school, that phase of my life is over and I only talk to the “best friends” from the given phase from time to time."
9946,"I did but the ongoing pandemic eviscerated most if not all of my connections. I found once I couldn’t be around physically anymore in people’s lives, I was dropped fairly quickly."
9947,"I keep in touch with a few of my friends from college, maybe like 3 out of my group of 6 close friends lol. We have each others socials so thats how we keep up. We are all spread out across the map now and busy doing our own things. The friends I truly valued I definitely will make the effort to reach out to them and keep in contact.

But now I am trying to make friends at work and in my area so I can get some action and fun in my life, like I had in college."
9948,:(
9949,"I keep up with the ones that matter from time to time, the ones who weren't all that important will fade away, but thats life, and it is what it is."
9950,"I do so with close friends from uni and from high school, and whenever I'm in town I try to see them. Granted, I've pruned down the number of people I'm in touch with somewhat. But I've always tended to be someone who goes for a few close relationships as opposed to many more shallow ones in school, so my social circles really haven't decreased with distance since these are people whom I actively want in my life and vice versa. 

Also helps in the case of college friends that I went to school in a thriving coastal city, so many of us just stayed here when we graduated. All of us were paranoid about getting jobs since we thought Trump's trade war would create the next recession, so many of us didn't look far afield (some folks went to nearby NYC or out to Portland), and wound up taking the best offers we could get before or shortly after graduation in our college town. And then COVID hit, so now we're really not moving about. We've made efforts to keep in touch through the quarantines and see each other now that things in the city opened up though. 

Just remember that it doesn't have to be that you lose all your friends into oblivion upon graduation. Keeping in touch is a choice, though one that many of us neglect because we're busy. It's important to reach out to the closest people in your life- the lifelong friends types- because those are the relationships that really are valuable in tough times. And to this day, there are those few friends from even childhood where we see each other for drinks whenever I'm back in my old home neighborhood in NYC and if we can't see each other we send gifts for each other's birthdays and call each other up for special occasions. Focus on fostering a few of those close relationships above all else."
9951,"I tend to do so in bulk—I message ten or so people at once a few times a year, and some get back to me more often than others but the overall response rate is good enough that I don't have to feel too upset about any individual who doesn't reply back."
9952,"Certainly easier to maintain in NYC, yes"
9953,How do you meet people?
9954,I’ve honestly only been able to meet my coworkers at work. Everything is virtual but I’m in a group chat with them and we talk and plan hangouts. Those are the only people I have had the chance to meet during this pandemic. I may end up using bumble to meet more people in my area
9955,I came here to say the same thing. Fill up those skills you can put in with anything and everything you can possibly do. After I did that I started having recruiters reach out to me. Indeed just sucks out any confidence you have..
9956,I’ve had no success using Indeed. It sadly has been a go-to for tech support jobs for me but I don’t ever get any calls or emails after applying. I’m not sure if it’s that way for everyone but I have really only used it for tech jobs.
9957,What kind of jobs are you looking for? What are the desired qualifications?
9958,"Look for people who work at companies or have jobs that interest you. Send them a connection on LinkedIn **WITH A MESSAGE** saying that you'd like to chat with them to learn more about their job, career, how they got there, etc. Schedule coffee chat/phone call with them. Ask good questions. At the end ask for advice or someone else they think you should talk to.

Highly recommend reading [The 2-hour job search](https://www.amazon.com/2-Hour-Job-Search-Technology-Faster/dp/1607741709), which includes practical examples and how-to guides. It's more geared towards the MBA job search (which has heavily revolved around networking for decades), but given the job search climate that's developed over the last 5-10 years, it's really relevant to any corporate job search."
9959,"I personally think LinkedIn is better. Or if you can find the hiring manager, also connect with them on LinkedIn after you apply"
9960,How are you connecting with people? I need to utilize LinkedIn far more than I currently am. It’s just a foreign concept to me atm.
9961,Are you dropping blind resumes or are you actually networking with people? You should focus on the latter.
9962,"Indeed, LinkedIn, Seek, all have been total and complete flops. After hundreds of applications as a Data Scientist with PM internships and certifications under my belt, I haven't gotten a single request for an interview since the end of February."
9963,Neither from LinkedIn or indeed. I look at job boards specific to my line of work. There's a surprising amount of listings that aren't covered by LinkedIn or indeed
9964,I use indeed and other sites to find companies then go to their company sites and apply there. The jobs on indeed tend to be very old by the time you apply.
9965,"I haven't even been able to find anything to apply for there in over a month, sure the virus is partiually to blame but still, you would think I could find something"
9966,What kind of jobs are you applying to? Just wondering if maybe some fields are more responsive to Indeed applications than others?
9967,"not the same person, but i was looking for jobs in programming/software and was getting good responses"
9968,Really? indeed works so well for me. Everyone is attentive and I get notifications/emails from recruiters daily
9969,"Same, lucky to got this minimum wage internship for the summer rn. But after this I gotta find a real PT Job too. wherever."
9970,Yea that’s exactly what I was thinking
9971,Does that work?
9972,This has absolutely never worked for me. This might work in some industries or in some regions but the advice is not end all be all
9973,I personally have very little success with LinkedIn and Indeed. My best results have been applying directly on the company’s website!
9974,"Same. Indeed sucks!!! I was just on it yesterday applying to entry level work because I have a Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology and I applied to a position that was wanting recent science grads entry level. The job posting was wanting hard science grads well, I have an associate in a hard science, but even my BS in a science not considered for what they were looking for. 

I got a notification saying the company viewed my profile and that's it. 

I mean come on, the job posting did say any science field was welcomed. No experience needed. We will train. 

Geez I'm wanting experience outside of exercise science. Getting that degree in that field was a mistake."
9975,"Interesting. I’ve had great success with indeed, my current job is actually from indeed.

What field are you applying in? Are you submitting resumes to the company site or hitting quick apply? How is your resume?"
9976,"If you find a job via Indeed, go to the company's website and try to find it on there. Then you can apply directly to the company website. I almost never apply to jobs via LinkedIn or Indeed. It is easier for your resume to get lost if you don't go directly to the source."
9977,I’m a recruiter bro. pm me for my email and I’m happy to help out with your resume.
9978,"The problem is not indeed, the problem is your resume getting lost in a hundred others, applying on websites wouldn’t be any different. To better your odds of getting an interview try to get internal referrals or through networking"
9979,"I feel like most of my interviews have been because of Indeed or Ziprecruiter, it might be a regional/luck-of-the-draw thing then."
9980,"Depends on what your field is. I'm a Registered Massage Therapist ( I even took 2 and half years off after graduating) and still had 2 interview requests in 12 hours. I only posted on Indeed. I was shocked at the super fast response. I'm pretty sure that I would have had more responses if I kept applying and checking, but I interviewed and got the job I was looking for."
9981,[deleted]
9982,Just pm’d you
9983,Hard to swallow pills lol ^
9984,I am in the nursing field and it’s always been like this since before the pandemic
9985,"Yeah figuring out what to do during college is just a big lie to get you to go. IMO you should decide before making that financial/time commitment. When I was choosing a career I went for something that had my interest and great career prospects. Fortunately I swiveled from Computer Engineering to Software Development as I enjoyed the latter a lot more. I'm lucky to have interests that align with a good job market, I know it's hard to figure out where to go in life but you should remember you have a drive that most people don't. I hope you figure out what you want to do, whatever it is. I would suggest you start by at least getting a job with a little more direction, as I find a bad job can cause complacency. Whatever it is you do, I hope the best for you."
9986,"Just wanted to throw this out there but with your background in psychology, have you looked into user experience research? Some of my coworkers are UX Architects/Researchers and were psych majors. The role is generally a tech/office job but it’s a growing field and there’s lots of bootcamps and free resources online about UX if you were interested."
9987,He didn't say he had 50k debt he just said he doesn't want to put himself through grad school to get that much debt
9988,"Hi! 

I’m currently graduating this June with a BA in psych. Something that has helped me tremendously in having a few ideas of what I want to do after college has been doing informational interviews with people in varying positions.

Either on LinkedIn or from people I know in real life, I’ll see if their job title/company interests me at all and people are usually more than happy talking to someone about their job/how they got there and any advice they could offer you.

Don’t be afraid to cold-message anyone on LinkedIn, 9/10 times they’ll get back to you and be open to exchanging some emails or even a call.

Something else is just reflecting back on college and paying attention to any classes/skills that really interested you/got you excited at all and see how you can apply those long term in a job."
9989,I have an MA in counseling and was accepted into a PsyD program before deciding to work in community mental health for a few years. Let me know if you have any questions regarding this path of psych (I double majored in Fine Arts and Behavioral Sciences in undergrad).
9990,This is good advice even for something without great career prospects. I went into college knowing I wanted to study politics and that an employment situation with that degree is not guaranteed. For that reason I knew I had to work harder to do internships and found a well paying job in the field before graduation. People who study things without a plan to make it work are hopeless
9991,Yep- you're right. Misread that bit.
9992,"It really depresses me when people say ""oh, I don't have that much debt"" and then throw out a number like $50k- kudos for keeping optimistic, and fortunately, that still is a number that can be dealt with. 

Now as to your personal feelings about your work, it's pretty natural to want more in life and be aspirational, even if you're content with your current situation. It's fortunate that you enjoy working at Trader Joes (I actually remember back when I was growing up in NYC, there were issues there with labor rights abuses), but you're also not really using your degree (to my knowledge) and it's pretty reasonable that you'd want to utilize it for a career or grad school. 

Personally, I was actually pretty focused on what I wanted to do when I went to school. I knew I was into transportation and cities, and architecture felt like a good blend of my interests and tends to be a great degree and career math for polymath, ""renaissance-man"" type individuals.  Going straight for masters was the logical path, since architects can't get licensed without it, so I did mine straight after finishing my BS Arch. The fact that I wound up working for a great office that specifically designs transit facilities was pure luck, although I was keeping my eyes open for any opportunities to get into the line of work in school. 

If I could offer you advice, I'd say first think about what classes in your major you most liked, and then reach out to those former professors you had. Your professors often have a better idea of your trajectory since they've seen you develop from a third person perspective, and can help you brainstorm career and educational moves moving forward. See possibly if they themselves or people they know have internship or research opportunities you can partake in, to get your foot in the door and sample the aspects of psychology that interest you. This doesn't even need to be full time, just enough to give you a taste and let you try out some things before making the big commitment that is a masters degree. Having a part time gig at least will let you keep the income of your current job, while allowing you to branch out prior to more education. And if it turns out you like what you're doing, you can always see about shifting into it full time"
9993,"I graduated with a BS in psychology 2 years ago. Since then, I have been working in state government in a public-facing role. Like you, I found myself drawn to customer service jobs and while in school I worked as a waitress, barista, etc. 

Then a year ago, I decided I wanted something a bit more fulfilling so I chose to pursue nursing. I will be starting a 15 month accelerated program soon. After getting work experience, I hope to go back to school to become a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. 

A psychology degree has a lot of different avenues you can take beside just grad school, although that is a great option too! For example, other careers I considered were social worker, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, I/O psychologist, and UX/UI researcher. I also thought about staying in state government and advancing to leadership or policy-making roles.

And some things that helped me decide on nursing were the client interactions I had at work, reading books, volunteering in a hospital, taking the prerequisites for the nursing program, and just talking to nurses. Although reading career descriptions online is a good place to start, I think you kind of have to get your feet wet a little bit in order to figure out what you really want to do :)"
9994,This would be a great pivot
9995,"It's great that you have experience in Figma! I'd also look into Sketch. For online resources, look into [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/), [UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/), and [UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/), they have a ton of great free articles. I highly recommend Don Norman's book [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=sr_1_1?crid=200D3D7Z1595F&dchild=1&keywords=the+design+of+everyday+things&qid=1588369085&sprefix=the+design+of+%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-1) and Steve Krug's [Don't Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=ux+book&qid=1588369114&sr=8-3). For bootcamps, I've heard good things about Springboard and General Assembly. Udemy has good online courses as well. Also look into UX meetups (when they resume in person, some places are also running online meetups) — networking is important if you're looking to break into the industry (as well a strong portfolio). Look up people on LinkedIn and try to connect and ask them questions about their jobs."
9996,Thanks for all the resources!
9997,"for a bit of a fresh perspective, dig deep into who you are. you really have to find a way to build passions. this video might help a bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSPrQoVgVaA"
9998,"Stop trying to figure out the job you want and figure out what companies you want to work for.  In many cases people find that their ""dream job"" really isn't, because they don't like the company, the culture, etc.  

Find a few companies and see what it takes to get hired.  If you have it, great.  If not, it should give you a path forward.  Do they want people with Master's degrees? Go for that.  They want more background in X field?  Take some online courses and be ready to speak and talk details in an interview.

Bringing in someone for an interview is low risk, but it's still a time commitment. One of the main things I (or anyone) look for is what sets someone apart. after the obviously qualified candidates, there's a tier 2 that's interesting but not traditional.  For me, the tier 2 I call in has unique work/life experience, or demonstrate in some clear way they are highly intelligent even if it wasn't in the field at hand.  

What gets ignored is the 3.0 GPA and no job development post college.  Neither of those things are dealbreakers, but they don't have anything that's grabbing someone's interest on their own.  Find a way to stand out."

10001,"Avoid drop shipping. It may have been profitable at one point or another in the past, but in recent years it has become nearly pointless. This is due to the poor return/earnings compared to the amount of time you put in. You'd be much better just getting a job instead. 

Come over to r/personalfinance and r/financialindependence for a bit of a financial guidance."
10002,"Yeah, it would be very hard work and dedication. If I do find myself there in a year or two. I hope it's with a good plan and a great mindset. I have no idea what action future me takes but let's hope it's a good one"

Which they're bound to be some but I just want to make sure I spend my time wisely. I'll take everything you said into consideration and thank you for the reply.

10007,"Why does it have to be New York? I guarantee the skills you’re seeking to attain could be done in another cheaper city/ while you’re cutting you chops, the connections won’t matter as much.  When you start showing progress, that’s when you’ll bank connections.

Learn the skills elsewhere, then should you still wish, cut your teeth on NYC.(don’t do it because it’s the thing to do, most people don’t “cut it “ in ny because they get wise, skip the middle man and live happy literally anywhere else."
10008,[deleted]
10009,Can you explain to me what drop shipping is?
10010,Some people don’t believe in birth control bc it’s not natural.
10011,"Check out your local community college. Mine has a lot of classes that aren’t classes per se, but labeled as “personal enrichment”. They cover a variety of subjects and skills. If your community college has these types of classes, research them. If any seem to catch your eye, consider taking said class. At the very least you’ll walk away knowing something that you don’t want to do, but you might also just find an area that you are extremely interested and passionate about.

If you do want to go to college at some point, you might also want to take some gen-Ed classes. I know you said you don’t want to go to college just to go to college, but certain classes are going to be required of basically any degree. Taking those classes now will get them out of the way, and will most likely save you money if you transfer to another college/university.

You might also consider a trade school of some sort. College isn’t for everyone. Research your options. Another option is the military. That is obviously a huge commitment, but it could be for you. If you do want to research that route, don’t talk to recruiters, they are looking for numbers. Ask people you know and trust for their honest opinion. 

The number one thing is to research though. Maybe the police or fire department sounds interesting. If so, ask your local departments if you can do a ride along. You can also use the internet to see what different fields are all about. Just do research, especially in person if possible.

Hope this helps, and best of luck to you"
10012,"Here in Denmark we usually take a break from school for a year after highschool, it’s called a “sabbatår”. You can learn a lot of things in that year about yourself, and it also stops you from rushing into something you might regret later on."
10013,"Man I did drop shipping for a little bit, the amount of scammers is crazy. Really educate yourself on how it works and the scams that come along with it."
10014,"First off, there’s nothing wrong with not knowing what you want to do after you graduate. The US is weird in this aspect, they expect you to know what you want to do with the rest of your life at the ripe age of 16. I hosted my couch to a guy from couch surfers from Israel and we talked a lot about this. In Israel they join the military right after high school for four years, then at age 23 they take a year off and travel then start college at around 24. I’m not saying to join the military nor sit at home wondering what to do next. 

In your current situation I would recommend going to a junior college. You don’t even need to major in anything, just do your general Ed. Which makes it so you can transfer to a state college. This does a couple things, first it introduces you to a wide array of subjects, from sciences, liberal arts, to fun electives. You’ll be introduced to topics you haven’t had a chance to study and you might find your calling. You’re going to change a lot as an individual over these next few years. When you’re 20 you’ll be a very different person than when you were 18. And when your 24 you’ll be a very different person than when you were 20. Early twenties are such an interesting and fun time of self discovery, try not to stress too much and enjoy the ride my dude/dudette!
But don’t waste it! If you have nothing planned go to a JC and sign up for some classes, talk to a counselor!"
10015,"What I wish I could help you understand is that you are so much younger than you think and you have so much time to figure out what to do with your life. The answers don’t come overnight. I didn’t end up getting my bachelors degree until I turned 30. I’m 31 now and just finally got a job doing something I love. 

As an artist, NYC was/has been/still is my dream as well, but I’m just not there yet. It’s a goal I have for myself for the future though and so every day I try to think “okay, how is the way I live my life today going to help get me where I want to go?” I had an opportunity to sell my artwork at a gallery in the Chelsea Arts district in NYC but I had to let it pass me by at the time because I didn’t have the funds to prepare and transport the installations they were asking from me and with art, you don’t get paid until someone buys your work... you have to invest your own money into it and risk the fact that people might not even buy it. I could have gotten a grant, but I was also going to school at the time and you cannot get certain grants for art if you’re also in school. 

Anyways, sorry if I’m rambling. You love acting, so you need to incorporate that passion into your life somehow. Many bigger cities have actors clubs/groups/guilds you can become apart of. Find people like you. I know where I live in Charlotte, NC there are a TON. Many people I worked with in the service industry were working at their acting career on the side and some of them were very successful. 

I work at a science museum now and my job is a public presenter, so basically I’m doing live chemistry projects, blowing stuff up and lighting stuff on fire in front of big audiences. We actually do hire people as actors who do more of the bigger shows. You could look for something like that to start. Honestly any type of job that makes you talk to customers on a regular basis can also help with acting skills as well. 

Keep the end goal in mind, but don’t kick yourself if it takes time to get there. Focus on the present... how you’re going to move forward and incorporate your passion into your life. Surround yourself with positivity and people who support your goals... people can be negative and toxic as hell, stomp on your dreams and make you feel stupid for even wanting them, but remember that those people are NOT a reflection of you, they are simply just unhappy people trying to make others feel just as crappy as they feel. 

Don’t ever give up on yourself. I wish I could give you a hug. Don’t fear the future because it’s coming whether you’re ready or not. You have the tools you need, you just have to figure out how to use them to help you get there. Best of luck, friend. It’s a big world out there and there’s a place for you. Don’t quit until you find it."
10016,Yep. Seen people skip multiple rungs on the corporate ladder based on who they know over actual competence.
10017,Thanks I actually wasn't sure about drop shipping so I'll look into these.
10018,"You're essentially the middleman. You sell a product without actually having to have the product. So I create a store for a product , promote it, sell it. Then you order the product from your supplier straight to the customer."
10019,"OP, you remind me so much of myself.

I'm from a tiny no-name place in Kansas. Grew up on a farm in the country outside of a small town. I wanted to go to school to be a visual artist. I applied and submitted a portfolio to the University of Art in Kansas City, got accepted, and pondered this same question.

I decided not to pursue art. That was twelve years ago or thereabouts.

I thought about it for a long time, but honestly what finally changed my mind was that like you, I had no familial support, no mentors, and my family was dirt poor. While I was very good for my area the truth is that in the city there is such an unbelievably higher level of competition that those kids from good families with decent money who had the opportunities to develop, the confidence, and the connections; I didn't think I could compete with them.

That said, I wouldn't tell you not to pursue art. But I think that going to NY is probably a bad idea. I could be wrong and would invite you to prove me wrong if you think you can. But I wouldn't recommend it. 

Now let's move on to staying in the home town. You absolutely don't have to do that. You're eighteen, you have the rest of your life ahead of you, you're healthy I hope, and if you are actually savvy and intelligent, the world is your oyster. You could literally leave home with a cloth sack and make it if you really tried.

You have options: FAFSA for uni, Job Corps (if you don't know what this is please, please, please look it up, it's specifically for young people), trade school, Peace Corps, military. If you research and write people you can open up doors further away. Have family living other places that you would rather be? Hit them up and ask about work.

To give some background: I moved out of the house at fifteen, just left with a backpack one day (not great family situation). Until eighteen I attended high school and lived with a family friend in exchange for housework, yard work, maintenance, etc. I applied for FAFSA but because of complications from my situation (father didn't declare me as dependent on taxes, wasn't emancipated, wasn't fostered or adopted or anything like that) I was denied FAFSA and college didn't happen.

Like any 18 years old male from a Podunk midwest town, I joined the military. I went Navy because that worked for me. The Air Force is super light and not at all like the Army, Marines, or Navy. If you need options but want a light one, that's one right there. Navy YMMV, and Marines and Army it's a really personal thing if you want to be a POG or a Grunt or whatever. I personally wouldn't advise it to artsy kids. 

The Navy sent me to Japan where I did my four years toting around the Pacific and exploring SE Asia and Oceana, got out with money and a Post 9-11 GI bill to pay for school, and I had always wanted to live in Washington state so I did that. Told the Navy to belay my ticket to KS and drop me off at Sea-Tac instead.

Spent three years, started in Seattle, decided I didn't like the big city and feeling so anonymous and went further south to Tacoma. I liked it there but got itchy feet and left for Hawaii to see what that was like and spent half a year there before deciding that Oahu was not for me (big city again).

At that point, I had gotten a bit older and missed my brother and wanted to spend some quality time with him so I went back to Kansas and spent another three years there.

Then again I got itchy feet and wound up moving to Poland where I have been the last two years. I have travelled all over Europe. Still have more to see but I feel good about what I have seen here so far.

So, somewhere between our wildest fantasy dreams and our fears of failure there is reality and plenty of room for a reality where you aren't in your home town if that's not where you want to be. I did all of this with no degree, and still don't have one (please go to school if you can, I'm not saying don't get a degree, I'm saying I didn't have this as a resource). If I did that, you can.

And oh, I didn't go to school for art, and I put down visual arts but picked up music in its stead. I make music every single day. I have managed to find a way to divorce the art I make from being my source of income and I still have plenty of time for making music. I have finished two albums in the past year and am tucking away number three at the moment. If you look for and create opportunities, I think that you can find a way to act even if you can't make it to school in NYC.

People are so much more powerful than they think, and if you learn how to take care of yourself in any situation, you can be as powerful as you need."
10020,Welcome to the real world brother we all in the same spot
10021,Yeah my grandmother (age 60) has been in debt her entire life basically. She's worked a 9-5 job since she was about my age. Hopefully someone in my family (hopefully me) can help her when she goes to retire. She doesn't have many funds in her retirement so it'd be nice to help her. I'll be sure to steer clear of debt unless absolutely necessary/certain and only use credit cards to build my credit.
10022,"Always fuel your curiosity. Always remember there is something new to learn. An associates degree will get you a better job than just a high school diploma and you can do that through community college... I got my general education requirements all completed through community college and then transferred to university when I was ready... much later on down the road. 

Don’t compare yourself to what everyone else is doing, everyone does life at a different pace. Yeah there are the few that know exactly what they want to do and get straight to it, but a lot of people go to college and get bachelors degrees straight after high school because it’s what everyone expected them to do, and they just end up lost. Take your time if you need to. 

I had a terrible habit of comparing myself to other people. I would beat myself up for not being farther along in life while everyone I went to high school with were starting careers, getting married and having kids. But I’m on a different path. My life is different, and that’s okay. You learn to accept your differences. 

Getting away from the town I went to high school in was one of my big goals too. I moved south the first chance I got. Save money and make it happen if you really want it. 

I know you’ll figure it out."
10023,"I have considered it, people have mentioned that I should do it before, many times; but truthfully, I think that in-between the adventures my life has been banal enough that I don't feel I have anything of weight to add to the human record compared to say, Czelow Milosz for instance. I don't know.

I think that if you want to be an entrepreneur, the earlier you start, the more rewards you will find. Most of the 'successful' people I have met in specialised fields started quite young. I don't think you should drop the idea. The idea that I dropped when your age was purchasing bitcoin lmao. It was cents on the coin. Don't let people tell you what to do because you may have insight into factors that they don't because the landscape shifts so much.

If you want to pursue entrepreneurship, I think a logical way to go would probably be studying business. If anything, it will open up the doors for you to effectively self manage whatever enterprise you choose to pursue."
10024,"Come to Chicago. It’s a nice “in between” city I feel. Gives you the feel of a busy city, not as expensive as LA or NYC, and still has plenty of opportunity. Public transit is amazing and everything is pretty close.

However, education, connections, networking, and a sprinkle of right time right place play in to the matter.

Chicago is a great place to pursue an artistic career I believe, there’s a huge indie scene in almost every art community as well as some great building blocks for a bigger career. For stage acting it might take a little bit to break in but there’s a lot of experimental/storefront theaters to audition for - I’m currently in Theater Audio and i love every minute of it. Then, after while, you can join a union.

If stage acting is not your forte. There’s a pretty decently sized indie scene (however, little for payment) and a bustling film/tv scene.

If you want to pursue acting (and can afford some classes/schooling) I’d def recommend sharpening those skills. There’s the big universities but also a lot of people take a class or two at Second City. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not easy and requires a lot of hard work and dedication but it’s possible.

If you’d like any more info I’d be happy to help where I can!  Best of luck friend!"
10025,"Hey OP!  There’s nothing wrong with not knowing what you want.  Just don’t go into stupid debt quite yet!  Personally, I did a gap year, moved abroad, and a number of other things before I started my degree this year.  There are plenty of options for you.  You could do a working holiday visa in Australia or a number of other countries.  Do a gap year program.  Peace corps or any other more short-term volunteer program.  These experiences will help you get to know yourself.  After a couple of years of adventure, I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted to do.  Now I’m studying something I didn’t even know existed four years ago.  I’m so glad I didn’t go straight for international relations like I thought I wanted.  Good luck!"
10026,Honestly taking theater classes at a community college has changed my life
10027,"Going to New York is most certainly possible. 
I moved after college and really enjoyed it, especially as I was also someone who wanted to live in Nyc since I was around your age (in my 30’s now.)

A few things you should keep in mind. 

New York is expensive. Don’t let this deter you, so is every other city. I’m from Boston, it’s where I went to school and found New York to be much more affordable for one simple reason. Space. It’s much bigger than many other cities, you have five boroughs and a well established transportation system. So while it may be more expensive for many things, you have a larger pool of options to chose from a majority of the time. This is especially true for things like jobs and housing. 

I’m not sure exactly what the cost is at the moment but It was cheaper for me to ride the train in NY than it was in Boston many of the years I lived there. 

New York is a very established city in many industries. The exposure, opportunities, and the people you’ll meet are certainly worth the sacrifices you’ll make along the way. Long hours and an often grueling commute from the affordable neighborhood to which you’ll most likely be living at first are some things to be prepared for. 

You really need some sort of plan in place but don’t overthink it too much. Start small, be practical. 
You need a place to live and a job at the least. 

School could be a great way to get there, but unless you’re going to take out loans you’re better off establishing yourself first and educating yourself afterwards. This is coming from someone who is paying their loans off currently. 

I think saving up to visit first would be a smart move. Take a venture through the different boroughs and get acclimated. 

Realistically you’ll be looking for a place with roommates somewhere in Brooklyn or Queens. Manhattan is very cost prohibitive, especially if you just moved there. It’s a better place to look for a job than a place to live, at least at first. 

Speaking of jobs there. Think about what you want to do long term and what you need to do to get there. If you want to act you’ll need your days free to be available for the classes, workshops, castings ect. A retail job wouldn’t be a good fit as you’d be required to work during the times you’re going to want to pursue your craft. Waiting tables or any food industry job could really work in your favor. I have a ton of friends who still do that in NY and are able to pursue a lot of their passions because of it. 

Some things you could do in the meantime are research, plan, and just save as much money as you can working right now. Also getting a job now that could either give you the skills for a job there, or potentially transfer you there might be worth your time. I worked a retail job in Boston while finishing up school and was able to transfer to a Manhattan location so I had a job when I moved there. 

Online groups could really benefit your knowledge and also score you some potential new friends when you get there. Gypsy housing on Facebook has saved my butt several times looking for a place when I was living there. 
You might also find some local acting groups on Facebook as well. That’s not my industry so I’m not too sure. Like I said though if you’re looking for bigger things than the small town in which you grew up in NYC most likely has it for you. 

Definitely learn about the boroughs and transportation. It’s not as cut and dry as looking at the map. There is always a train not working or delayed. I remember planning out my route for a week before I moved, only to find out that the train I planned to use wasn’t running on nights and weekends that summer due to maintenance and those were the two times I needed it for work. A lot of the boroughs are very easy to navigate walking. 

It’s certainly possible to walk from one borough to another as well in many cases. You can go from Brooklyn over the Bridge to Manhattan on nicer days when you want to save money and avoid paying for the train.

I really want to stress one last thing. Many people you meet in NY are not from there either. They are moving there to chase something, just like you. Use this to your advantage, and make connections. This is really what is going to help you to establish yourself there. I found both jobs and apartments though new friends I’ve met while out and about. 

You’d be surprised how far a lot of people have traveled to live there and how much you have in common with many of them. 

Just be prepared to work hard and don’t expect what you see on tv. You’ll be lucky if you can fit a full size bed in your first room. I moved with an air mattress, that I slept on for the first month until I could afford a bed. You have to hustle. It’s all very doable if you’re willing to be a problem solver. 

Best of luck in your endeavors!"
10028,"Whatever you do, make up your mind and put your whole self into it. If you move to New York and go into tons of debt and back out, you’ll live with the debt for a long time. If you go to a university and never finish, you’ll have debt without the higher marketability of a degree. Just whatever you do, follow it through.

Personally, I think it would be smarter to choose a cheaper city that has local theater. Where I live in Salt Lake City, there are pretty active local theaters, and I can guarantee you’d get in way less debt here or a similar city while you figure out if that dream is worth pursuing. A lot of people I know have a career and do theater on the side.

Just remember that most people have self doubt. I went to college and changed my major 5 or 6 times, and even when I stuck with one, I was super uncertain. But I ended up graduating and working and loving my job. Find something you enjoy and can reliably support yourself with, but you will have doubts and that’s normal. 

There’s also no perfect job - every job has something about it that you would probably dread doing, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good choice. The thing I live by is “I work to live, I don’t live to work.” But I still enjoy what I do!

I think a good choice would be to choose a cheaper 2-year community school that you can work yourself through. Use that time to explore your options, try to get internships, shadow people in careers you might be interested in. Even if you don’t end up transferring to a 4-year when you’re done, you can explore career paths while avoiding the debt."
10029,"one idea is to look on [workaday.com](https://workaday.com) and see if there is something in NYC that u like. they will provide u a place to stay and sometimes pay. but if they don't provide pay u can get a job for a while to save money and then after however long, try to go to acting school there. don't let fear and discouragement stop u from doing something great!! :)"
10030,In some ways I feel what you’re saying but it’s never too late to live somewhere else.
10031,"As an adult you realize how little money you have and how hard you have to work to save the money you do have. 

I’d hate myself to go abroad and pursue my dream just to get back and find my bank account is drained."
10032,"And that’s honestly a super legitimate reason

It’s just not that you CANT live abroad the way you would in university 

It’s that as an adult you’d not willingly subject yourself to a university lifestyle anymore knowing how expenses work and the value of your money 

That being said, I do hope that you somehow manage to get lucky and score a really cool well paying job abroad. Would be awesome to have your cake and eat it too"
10033,Software Engineering
10034,"Excuse me? It’s my dream to live abroad and I’ll make that happens by any means necessary!

But is it really that hard to live and work in another country? Please tell me."
10035,"yeah if you have a knack and passion for it, it can be very rewarding. More than half of my class didn't make it to graduation from college"
10036,I work digitally living abroad. It's not really that uncommon.
10037,It pains me to say i hate coding with a passion.
10038,"Would taking a sabbatical or even just a gap year work? I’ve heard of and even personally know multiple people who take an extended period of time off from work to recover from burnout and to recharge. Taking a year off right after graduating university and sometimes between jobs isn’t extremely uncommon, either. If you’re still relatively young and have the right passport, working holiday visas are an option, too.

If cost and logistics are the biggest issues, then may I suggest some sort of volunteer work? There are several organizations that I can think of that will offer you basic meals and a place to stay in exchange for some help. Usually just you have to cover your own plane ticket and any other expenses (like if you want to travel to another city in your free time). And if you’re okay with kids, au pairing is definitely something to consider."
10039,"I never went abroad in college but I can’t imagine that you’re getting paid to be abroad in college either, right? Is it all out of pocket then too? So what’s the difference between your expenses then and your expenses now? Honestly, why can’t you just save up and then take a week off from work to go abroad? Maybe I’m confused?"
10040,Working holiday visa u gronk
10041,"I spent a month abroad this year and last….. it’s not enough. 

Six months to a year would be perfect but I just can’t figure out how I’d make that happen.

Glad I’m not the only one who feels this way at least."
10042,"Yeah, plus even if you do spend 6+ months somewhere, it’s still not as great as being in a college campus where there are activities and the such. 

The closes I ever got was when I spent a week and a half in a university (I was a senior in HS) for an Erasmus program. It was awesome. 

I guess for that kind of experience you would just need to go and study for a masters or doctorate degree in another country? Or at least another state? My dad essentially did that, went to study to New York for a doctorate for 3 years. Lived like a college student in campus and everything. It was certainly unorthodox since he was in his 50’s but he’s always told me it was his dream and had the time of his life."
10043,Exactly. Thanks!
10044,"The university I attended had excellent & affordable study abroad opportunities. I am so glad I took the opportunity to study abroad because just like you’re saying, not sure if I’ll ever be able to live in Europe for 6 months for the price that I did."
10045,"I’m 26.

I moved a few months ago and started a new job abroad. Next year I might move again, depending on my next career step.

There are opportunities out there. Go get ‘em. Money is relative to where you live."
10046,"I 100% feel exactly the same as you. 

I’m considering looking into couch surfing or something similar. It’s not the same but I would like to, even if just for a month, to actually live somewhere, make friends and experience culture and life from another country. I don’t know if couch surfing is the ideal way tondo that but I’m still looking around."
10047,"I never had the opportunity while in college, and that surprised me and disappointed me. I also never had an opportunity to *travel* abroad in college, and that was also surprising and disappointing. My husband and I met very late in our college careers, and, because he was a part of our college band, he had the opportunity to travel to Spain and Russia. I never had a similar opportunity and it's always been sad to me. (We went to a small private university). 

Sorry for dumping my own pity party. Take the opportunities that you get in college! If you aren't offered any, ask questions! Find clubs and organizations that offer travel! Go and see the world. I finished with a masters and I have never left the US."

10051,What’s ur job??
10052,Depends where you’re coming from and where you’re going
10053,What do you do? Do you work for an American company and do you get an American salary?
10054,"Not always? I mean some young adults have to work still and can’t afford to go. Some don’t have parents who can afford to pay or are willing to. It would’ve been too expensive for my family to pay had I wanted to go abroad. 

But if you wanna live in a country for a year, then get a job there and move there on a work visa or something! Experience another culture for a whole year or five. 

You’re still an adult in college. There are tons of older people in college too, older people who can only afford to go to college."
10055,Would you advise people to get into the field?
10056,I’m in college now and I can’t afford to study abroad so I feel kind of similar? :( Sucks to see so many people do it and rave about it and knowing I’ll never be able to
10057,"Same. I wanted to study abroad a semester in Europe but COVID ruined everything. Now I’ve been thrust into the adult world with no adventures, experience, anything."
10058,"You were smart. I was an idiot. Told myself it would be easier to travel as an adult. Boy was I wrong.

Where did you go?"
10059,You can’t get a grant or funding or something?
10060,"same thing happening to me rn, and the pandemic is definitely not helping. my plan is to keep my network of friends and earn enough to afford visiting them lol

I'm extra salty about this because I had it clear in my head that this was going to be the outcome if I graduated in my hometown, but my parents bribed/emotionally blackmailed me into it

I don't have a solution because I'm on the same, but I hope everything goes well for both of us"
10061,"Don’t worry too much on this. I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree and realized I wasn’t interested in it.

The degree alone is impressive in most fields as proof of mental capacity. I ended up getting a consulting job.

I’d recommend first looking into what you’d like to do and see what actual qualifications are needed for it. If you’re good at talking through an interview, you can position the degree as how capable you are at learning anything...

I went from consultant to club promoter to dating coach to marketing specialist (having never taken a marketing class in college btw) all by reviewing the qualifications for each job, the companies values, doing some research to make myself competent enough for the interview and confident I could learn the rest along the way.

If you got a mechanical engineering degree—no matter how hopeless things feel—you are in a great position!

STEM would obviously involve more study bc they test for competence and it’s a competitive field, but you can do a LOT with the degree you have and get many jobs you wouldn’t think your major would suggest you should. Everyone wants someone knowledgeable and competent.

You can largely catch up on the stuff taught for humanities majors since it’s just Google-able information and most of what you learn in college will not directly translate to career anyhow...

So deep breaths. Allow yourself to search jobs or do whatever to have ideas come to mind of a direction you’d like to go and go from there. All is not lost. Far from it"
10062,What is a PR?
10063,Permanent residency
10064,"I've actually worked on some biomed projects, so I might look into it more seriously.   
Thanks for your input mate.

And good luck with whatever you pick to study in university. Happy to tell you more about engineering if you have any specific questions."
10065,"Dude I feel you, also graduated this May but majored in operation & supply chain mgmt with a minor in marketing which was a total last minute change (literally last semester-had to take max units) because I was sucking/had little motivation for accounting. Chose supply chain because I heard it pays well and I was okay in the classes, didn't necessarily enjoy it though. Like you I didn't have any career goals so I just chose something ""safe"". I've also been putting off looking for jobs because I feel I'm under qualified and not passionate enough for supply chain to make a career out of it... 😔 A lil motivation I found was that a lot of my older friends found jobs they enjoyed they never expected themselves doing that was completely different from their major. Hopefully, we'll both find that one day and that you'll get your PR sorted out so you can stay in Australia."
10066,"For sure I can relate with this, sometimes it is a lot of stuff to digest and figure out.

Have you worked with any professionals on this? I find it super helpful to work with a therapist / coach / mentor and get some practical one-on-one guidance here for a few weeks. Trying to figure it out on your own can only go so far; a personal relationship with the right person can help you solve any concerns quickly and support you to get on the path which is right for you."
10067,Can you explain more about your background and why you would have to go back to a country that you don’t speak the language of? Are you Swedish?
10068,[deleted]
10069,"I actually did my previous internship in supply chain. Particularly in analytics and procurement, it was a mixed role. Didn't mind it I suppose. Would have random existential crisis because it would be dry and slow. But I also struggle with anxiety and depression so maybe that was clouding my judgement.  


Do your older friends have any advice?  


Yeah I hope so too. Pretty much I've settled on the fact that I need a job so I can make money to pay for hobbies and that way maybe life will be fulfilling. I don't know."
10070,"If I’m being completely honest, all I knew is that I wanted to try something different. I wasn’t convinced that engineering was the right career path for me and I didn’t want to spend 30+ years in a career path I wasn’t 100% sure about. I decided on teaching because it seemed like a field where I could still use my degree, I could help people, plus my wife is a teacher so now we are on the same schedule. The final push for me to switch fields was realizing that I didn’t want to look back on my life in the future and regret not trying something different. The worst that can happen is that it just doesn’t work out and I go do something different. 

The key here is to live your life at your own pace. You’re not behind, you’re just on a different path right now than everyone else. And there’s nothing wrong with that."
10071,"No problem at all, like I said, I was in the exact same position as you and felt the same way. So far I enjoy it, but I’ve only been doing it for 4 days, haha! 

I like interacting with the students and talking with them. I teach a wide range of courses since I’m the only science teacher at my school, but that really tests my knowledge because I haven’t seen some of the content in a while! It’s certainly a new challenge and I can tell it will keep me busy. 

Don’t be afraid to try something new and/or different. The worst thing that happens is you end up going back to whatever you were doing before. The best part is that it’s never wasted time, because you are always gaining skills that could transfer into something else."
10072,"I had some cool jobs with a mech e degree (toy design, construction, now robot babysitting). The best thing about it is its so versatile and youre in the engineering sense a jack of all trades. Try to find a company youre interested in and see if they need project engineer/sales engineer if youre looking for a more nontechnical role"
10073,"This doesn't answer your question at all but I'm looking at schools in australia, where did you go, did you like it?"
10074,"I WISH I had done an engineering degree! Congratulations! I think if I was young and looking for something, I'd look for some kind of non-offshoreable job, like a trade or firefighting or something, and then also maybe develop some ""digital"" skills like coding etc. I have found some of the writings of Scott Adams helpful in honing in on which career skills to learn too."
10075,"> I don't know what I'd want to do. I've no goals or career interests. 

You don't have a job problem, or a career problem, you have a coming of age problem. You need to figure out what you want from your life before you can make progress in other areas because ultimately you will not be happy until you do that. Ordinarily I would recommend traveling to find yourself but since that's difficult now, see if you can find a mentor, father figure, spiritual person, etc that can help you understand yourself."
10076,Hey are you me in the future?? I have a matsci degree and don't know what I want to do...
10077,"That last sentence very particularly true, I worked as a civil engineer and actually enjoyed most of the beginning, but then realized I had other goals that started to develop in mind, things I always wanted to do, like travel, build a social life, pursue my hobbies. It was hard to do this limited to 2-weeks of vacation a year, in a dominantly all male, relatively introverted industry. 

I quit cold and many talked about how much of it was a waste, but I never saw it that way, because I knew deep down engineering was the right decision at the time, it was something I was really into, but as I got older, goals shifted. Many athletes retire in their 20s/30s, few would say they wasted their time, if they genuinely enjoyed the sport they played. I have another friend who left a computer engineering job to become a teacher funny enough lol, he just started, so still tbd, but I think knowing him, he'd enjoy it much more, being able to finally have more social interaction, help people directly, and be back in the classroom lifestyle."
10078,"Thanks! Yeah that's how I do it. I did my internship in supply chain just by positioning myself otherwise. I just feel extra hopeless because of the pandemic and feeling like I'm not good enough. And every career advising seminars I have checked out, they just throw buzzwords of all things in tech so my mechanical engineering feels worthless, also they pretty much ask you to be knowledgeable in everything and set unrealistic expectations. So it's all just been frustrating.  
With actually job applications, I can't apply to major corporations because of no PR and mid sized companies have been scrapped positions I've applied for so it's all been difficult like that."
10079,[deleted]
10080,[deleted]
10081,"Haha, I might be! I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of engineering, but the corporate world just wasn’t for me. I’m only four days into teaching, and while it’s a ton of work (even more so this year and I’m at a small school so I’m the only science teacher), I enjoy the daily interactions with my students and I already feel more fulfilled in my work."
10082,"Yeah the career advising stuff gets old quick... it’s all basically the same. Tougher time than usual for work given everything... and I remember many mech eng jobs wanting licenses which I hadn’t gotten yet... so could be an interesting opportunity to study for whatever those are if you want to pursue that more.

You might need to do a bit of independent study but with a mech e degree, you’re set well for many more jobs than you might realize. Landing that first gig is sort of the hardest since employers tend to like to see work experience, but obviously we all start without it"
10083,"I had a job in digital/social media marketing and that's why I took on that minor since it was doable. Never had an internship or experience with supply chain and that's why I'm so afraid of stepping in that industry, like what if I end up not liking it and I get stuck? Classes don't necessarily reflect irl jobs... I know mid-life career changes are a thing but easier said than done! I also struggle with anxiety & depression so lol I totally get ur existential crisis. 

My older friends just told me to apply to anything that remotely interests you even if you don't have the experience or apply to roles in companies/specific industries you like. If your role has something to do with what you're interested in maybe you'll enjoy doing it or at least the company culture. Or even countries... I have a couple of friends who went to Japan & Korea to teach English and they LOVE it there even if pay isn't that good."
10084,"Glad to hear it, wish you much success."
10085,"You traveled for 11 months total and didn't enjoy any of it? Why? What did you do?

Note I know this may feel like an interrogation over text but I *am* trying to help you here."
10086,"How are you liking it so far?  


Thanks for all your input."
10087,"I’m no relationship pro or anything, but it sounds to me like you’re not going to anything regular, like a hobby club. 

An important part of interpersonal attraction is being around the person a lot. I can’t remember the name for it, but regularly and consistently being around someone can pretty easily cause you to develop feelings for someone you might not have otherwise approached, romantically or platonically"
10088,Mere exposure effect I believe.
10089,Tis me
10090,"I’m the same way. I meet new people at a one time situation and we hit it off great and have lots in common, but then we don’t seem to hang out more than a couple of times afterwards (if at all) and we pretty much ghost each other. I get kind of nervous I’ll come off as an annoying clingy friend if I reach out first all the time."
10091,Your going to see a lot of that. People don’t make effort or can’t because they have to work long hours
10092,Yup I’ve always had trouble with this. I lack initiative :/ In school/college it was easy to build friendships because of the daily interaction and proximity
10093,Yup I think that’s it
10094,"Graduated at 17 and had no clue what I wanted to do with my life. Decided to find out what I liked/disliked (through a series of high pressure commissioned sales jobs) and returned to school at 22 with a sharpened focus and more maturity. I got a lot of the partying and teenaged idiocy out of my system. I ended up graduating at 27 with an engineering degree and $100k/yr.

Consequently, friends I had that went to school right after high school without much of a plan either dropped out or work in a career very different than what their education was meant for (usually construction or sales). My message is if you don't have motivation to go to school now, getting a glimpse of the ghost of Christmas future through a series of jobs can often help give motivation and a broader view of your goals."
10095,"Not me but my sister took a gap year to decide if she wanted to go to college and what degree she’d get. She moved to Colorado and worked as a live on rancher and had a cafe job to get by. She really figured out what she wanted and went into college confident in the degree she wanted to pursue and with an extra year of maturity on her classmates.

She does sometimes express frustrations how we’re only a year apart and I’m already graduated and working. I remind her that my freshman year was really tough since I was going through a lot mentally and got placed with some less than nice suitemates who didn’t help. Going into that while 17 was really tough. In the end we’re both happy with our choice in the long run (I wanted to get financially independent and secure ASAP while she wanted to make sure she was 100 percent sure if her college decision)"
10096,"I feel like one of the hardest aspects of someone in that position is making new friends, because your high school friends went to college and there's no campus life to make new friends. Of course, the upside is still being close to your family. I've even noticed this with my friends who chose to go to CC for the first year or two. So you feel more isolated (this is just my assumption).

Glad to hear about your career advancement! You're in a really great spot at such a young age."
10097,"My husband graduated high school early and worked as a carpenter for a few years. Then he permanently injured his back and went to college since he couldn’t work as a carpenter anymore.  He struggles with back pain and there’s really nothing to do about it besides drugs, which he didn’t want to start so early in life."
10098,"Unless you live on campus, there is no ""campus life"". If you live in the same city you go to school in, paying thousands of dollars extra to live on campus is fucking stupid imo.

People hype up university so much that it's ridiculous. Once I'm done my marginally useful history BA, I'm going to college for something more practical unless I have the grades for grad school and I've gotten over the issue of seeing going to school as a joyless chore.

There's also the army reserve I guess. They'll at least train you and there's a lot in the way of hours and increased pay if you want it."
10099,"I was always super independent at home during my time in high school. Divorced parents and a split household made that super easy, but even before that happened (freshman year of hs) I was more mature and responsible than other people my age. Near the end of school, I was interested in a lot of different things and was already working close to 30hrs a week in a kitchen job. I was mostly self-teaching myself music and film my senior year and almost dropped out to get a fulltime job and continue selfteaching myself. I almost dropped out because senioritis hit me middle of junior year and most of the classes I was taking my senior year were pointless because I was already pursuing what I wanted. At the same time though, I had a bunch of other interests and wasn't entirely sure if I should continue pursuing music and film or go to college for those other interests. I ended up taking a gap year to figure that out. During the gap year I started work full-time, still just the kitchen job but as an assistant manager at 18/19, and really dived deep into music making and filmmaking. I ended up spending more time filmmaking and on the audio engineering side of music, rather than the music making, and right about that same time I discovered a cool little program at my local cc that covered pretty much everything I was pursuing and teaching myself. Decided if I was going to learn it might as well make it easy on myself and pay 550 per class for someone else to teach me lol. That program ended up being a lot more in depth than I envisioned and the instructors way cooler and more helpful than I thought possible. Now I'll be graduating in the spring with an AAA in digital media and I'll never look back because I love what I'm learning."
10100,"Instead of immediately after, I started about 3 months later"
10101,"Didn’t go to college after graduating despite getting in. Figured it wouldn’t help me at all in my industry of choice (music journalism and booking) and I believe I made the right choice. 

I did odd jobs including teaching a recreational program at an elementary school with some seasonal stints in warehouses here and there while picking up as much journalism and booking work as possible. Currently, with COVID-19s decimating effects on the live music industry I’ve been working on opening up a production studio for live streams and live sessions for bands. If I had went to college I wouldn’t be in the place to continue working in the now fractured music industry. Spending my time working hard in music versus in college has paid off as I now have enough connections and experience to tread into the future of the music industry."
10102,"I dropped out of high school when my parents self deported back to Venezuela. I got my GED from the state of maine through some international program in Venezuela. Spun my wheels in the mud of Venezuela’s crashing economy. During this time I learned a lot about investing and Bitcoin. I was really depressed and thought I was falling behind in life. I couldn’t figure out how to get out of the Venezuela situation. I would read a lot about investing but couldn’t act on it because Venezuela was insane. 

Eventually I returned to the USA at 20 and started working two jobs in the hospitality sector. Invested early on in Bitcoin ($300) and ethereum ($11) and also got a technical certification which got me a better paying 9-5. Later I got my undergraduate (Cybersecurity and information assurance), now at 26 I am wrapping up my masters this semester (leadership & technology innovation). As for my job, I couldn’t be happier I make over 100k a year. My investments in both crypto and stocks have grown my wife and I’s net worth to nearly a quarter of a million dollars. We have a nice home with significant equity in it and no student loan debt whatsoever. This is mostly thanks to investing. 

I don’t think I would have gotten into investing so much if I hadn’t gone through my Venezuela experiences of being so fucking poor. Now all I want is to never have my children live through what I went through."
10103,"I was deleting a bunch of old emails the other day and I found one from 2013 wherein someone at the job bank had got me a connection with a solar panel installer.

No experience necessary, will train. And I passed it up because I was an idiot.

I was working as a part time landscaper at the time and my family was hassling me about applying for university. If I had taken the job I'd be better off today, no question about it."
10104,"I actually wanted to go to college right after HS, but being from a rather poor immigrant family,  I felt the military’s college benefits would be worth it. 

I leaned a lot about myself, and to be completely honest, it really gave me a different perspective on life. 

It’s totally okay to not go straight to college after high school in my opinion. People can really benefit from gaining “ real world” experience by taking their own paths outside of the traditional college one. It can make you appreciate higher education that much more as well as help you grow as a person."
10105,"I have not gone to college since graduating high school and I’m 23. I would absolutely not change one thing about my choices as I listen to peers and people a decade or more above me complain about drowning in debt or getting jobs only marginally better than what I’ve been able to work. Most importantly, with $20k in the bank and no debt whatsoever, I am wealthier than most people my age but I was only able to save like that because I didn’t have debt and didn’t spend 4 years in school that I instead spent working."
10106,"2017 I dropped out of college when I lost my scholarship due to attempting suicide almost successfully. School didn’t like someone on their presidential scholarship doing that, and I didn’t want to rack up even more debt so I just left.

2018-2019 Spent some time in inpatient, went back to community college but wasn’t really ready for that right away. Took a year to take care of my nona who was really close to dying at the time, and got a job in IT. 

In 2020 I kept on with the IT job, but ended up losing it last September because I had to take a lot of time off due to needing a kidney surgery and my company wasn’t doing so hot with the whole covid thing."
10107,I took a year long break from school mainly cause I didn’t know what I wanted to do and I didn’t want to jump straight into a course I didn’t care about. In my country you can’t change majors in between so I wanted to figure my shit out. But I really enjoyed my year off learnt a lot about myself and figured out what I wanted to do
10108,"I had plans to go right after graduation but no actual plan to make it happen. Instead I married my high school sweetheart and became a housewife. It was a bad decision at such a young age but some mistakes have to be made. I got divorced, got a job, bought my own car and made a friend that helped get me enrolled in college, 4 years later than my original plan. 

Today I am 3 months away from graduating with a degree in Communications. I have had the opportunity to work in radio, news and social media management and I love it! I had no idea my path would take such an odd detour but here we are!"
10109,"I think one thing to accept is that life is extremely uncertain. It sucks but it is what it is. 

The best thing to do is give it 100%, no matter what you are doing. That not only grows you as a person but opens up more opportunities."
10110,[deleted]
10111,"I have been in such situations. I will just say, that stop comparing yourself from others. I know it's difficult, but find some little Goals in your path to See some light of success so that you can think of your path in the future in straight way instead of Looking into others. 

You know, we compare ourselves with people when we are not doing good in the things we are involved in. If we are satisfied from ourselves, then we do not compare ourselves to others because we are busy and happy with ourselves. 

So leave all the things distracting you, focus on what you are Doing, believe in that degree/University and start putting efforts at that side. Do not think too much, First have some grasp and understanding of your path in some time. So after that, you will See positivity around yourself.

May be try yoga/meditation for anxiety issues if any. It really helps."
10112,"Coming from a senior in high school who’s dealing with this anxiety,I totally get that, my options are less but for different reasons, but still, I’m learning if you can’t decide on one thing that’s totally okay! Life for example I can’t decide between a baking class or art school, but see there’s so many options and different arts which I never knew but you can always do a class for one option then your second do it on the side if you can. I hope that makes a little sense"
10113,"Look freshman year is the time for reflection let alone most of college. What’s your major? And what are your interests? Also look and see what you’re good at? Engineering is hard bc most people don’t like math, biology is hard bc most people don’t like science and for some people English is hard bc they don’t want to write an essay every week so it’s subjective, your first year you’re usually taking your basics along with one or two classes from your major. If you end up changing it’s still not a waste because it’s helped you grow, but so keep in mind gpa does matter for certain careers so if you’re ever in a situation that you’re going to get a D or fail definitely drop the class! It’s normal to have anxiety but you still have time, it’s almost inevitable to fuck up your freshman year, you’re young and still learning."
10114,"Try comparing yourself to who you were yesterday and not somebody else today. Everybody is completely unique and comes from a unique background, so it’s basically impossible to even find someone to compare yourself to. But to do this you need to be moving towards your own goal, so you need to define it.

I didn’t experience what you’re experiencing during college, but right after college, when I basically said “Now what?” The best thing I found you can do is talk to someone you truly trust about what you want in life and then meditate on the conversation later. Figuring out where you’re going in life is really hard to do, and often I’ve found that talking to someone makes my goals more concrete in my mind. And then it gives you someone to talk to when you’ve made progress towards those goals, and assuming they’re a good person, they’ll be happy for you.

Be exploratory as well, search for your interests. But be careful and weary about college debt because that’s no joke either.

Hopefully that helps :)"

10118,"Just try to stay away for comparing yourself. May be it's good to sit back and compare present from the past, and in positive way. But comparing with others, it's a thing I try to stay away for my mental Peace because it doesn't gives any worthy results and the people we compare with ourselves, don't give a damn about us mostly times."
10119,"Okay so Pre-PT, think about it this way you can get a major in kinesiology but I would get a minor in something you want, either como sciences, business , graphic design, biology, chem anything you’re interested so you can at least have the basic classes to know if you like it. Talk to your advisor, the most important is to see if you can get B+ or better in your Pre reqs bc that’s what ultimately when you apply the schools will look at."
10120,[deleted]
10121,[deleted]
10122,Definitely ask about minoring in another field because usually you get a minor is like 10 hrs which is 3-5 classes depending on how the program works.
10123,"Yes certificates hold value! That also “sounds” better when it comes to getting jobs and even applying to PT schools! They want you to be well rounded so actually that might make you stand out, because you could work with a partner or even your own practice or in hospitals and know a little bit of the business side whether it’s specifics to comp sciences , marketing etc."
10124,"Definitely just keep trying things there’s no harm in that, choose something you enjoy not just something to get you by day to day"
10125,What’s your major now? Web design?
10126,"You can always minor in computer science instead of switch the whole major and degree, you can take classes in what you like, í double minored in Spanish and chemistry, my major was biology. Minoring gives you options on classes you like"
10127,Duuuuuuude I really feel ya on this. I graduate in December and just want to pick up and move and have a start over for my life in a fun city
10128,"The common advice is to switch companies in a few years so you could always get that in with some experience and cash later on, when we’re not in a pandemic."
10129,"Don't think of this as changed plans, just delayed ones. It's always easy to find a job when you have one, so take this time to kick off your career and get some money in your savings bank, and then in a two or three years you can move.

I personally didn't get a chance to move cross country, from the mid Atlantic to the Pacific Northwest until I was thirty, but it all happened in just a three month period, when a company approved me about a job. Just keep it top of mine and some get comfortable. I've got so many friends just like you, but a year or two after college they got too comfortable which is easy with friends, family, and familiarity so close by. Set a time limit your self and hold yourself to it."
10130,Currently having the same feeling. Tbh no matter what you choose you will always be looking for greener pastures. Focus on what you got. Find happiness.
10131,"I'm an engineer that works globally on mega projects. I basically live out of a suitcase and get to see my family for about 30 to 40 days out if the year. 

In my opinion, Americans have an very romantic view of what expat work is like, especially in the EU economic zone. It always seems like Americans picture guest workers being treated like Anthony Bourdain on his travel show.

In reality, your more like to be treated like the central American farm laborers that America temporarily imports. 

Get experience. Experience supercedes everything else when it comes to securing overseas work. 

As per working in Cali, whatever your personal spending budget is how, cut it in half. Yeah you might get paid more but your cost of living goes through the roof. 

I seriously do not understand why tech companies and their employees want to live in the Bay area. I dread every time I have an assignment remotely close to that hellscape. Terrible food, expensive as fuck, horrific pollution, insane traffic. 

Like tech jobs are literally borderless. You could put them anywhere. It's so silly."
10132,"I fully planned on moving across the country after I graduated, the the virus hit and the job market shriveled up. At this point I'll be happy to move across town, anything is better than living at home rn"
10133,"Well, from my experience when I graduated, my parents suggested many things for me to do (other people as well). I tried their direction (which was based on how much money I'd make in the long run); however, after a semester, I recognized I couldn't even concentrate, I found myself doing everything but my work. I waited to the last minute because I was so focused and day dreaming about what could be.

After that semester, I ended up not being able to go back. The door shut ( I was sad at the beginning, however, I realized that it was the best thing that could have ever happened). Following that, I finally had the courage to move to LA (etc, etc) Which led me on a completely crazy journey, but I followed the vision that I was given.

I say all this to say, if you have a vision that you want to see play out then do it. It's when we take a dive on the deep on that we begin to see our dreams come into fruition. We are all given God given talents and visions, it won't happen over night but you DON'T want to leave this earth wishing you did this or did that.

I hope this helps... :)

P.s When you are paving a path that has yet been paved, you will have to do things most people would think is irresponsible. But, if you look at even COVID-19 or even death of Kobe, anything thing uncontrollable could happen that could throw  off our plans, leaving us with nothing. We don't know how much time we have on this earth, so as long as you have a plan and that you are implementing it, it may seem crazy now, but at the end of it you would be proud of yourself. Lastly, you don't be the person saying, ""what if...""

For me, writing a book is what I stepped out to do. It's about my journey of navigating. I dropped it all, started something new, to follow this vision this dream (otherwise, I would be stuck in comfort)."
10134,"Hm... that's interesting... right after I graduated high school I moved out to NYC for college to study art  (I'm from Ohio) so in my own weird way I kind of did what you are saying. Honestly, from my perspective, it was totally worth it. Living there was beyond what anything  I could have dreamed of, and I loved it. The experiences were truly life changing. 

But now 10 years later I've actually found myself back in Ohio. I'm glad I did that whole move across the country thing (albeit I was going to school so its a bit different than just up and moving somewhere) - what I find interesting about it is that I'm actually in the exact opposite situation you are. I followed my dreams when I was young(er) and now I'm in the position where being in my home city and working my current more career oriented job/saving money is what I want to do. 

I lot of my friends are artists/musicians, so I know a couple who have literally moved to LA or New York with less than $1,000 and made it work. The one piece of advice one of them told me was to just do it, because you never know the connections you'll make in a new city and you can never take back the experiences you're bound to gain there. However this might be a little more pressing in the art/music field than in other fields, I would guess. 

Yah, sorry- not sure if this helps. I would guess that staying in Chicago would be good to get experience, but if you really want to live in L.A., don't settle in Chicago. Just make sure that when those 2 years are up, you move to California without hesitation. Because the experiences you will gain there are what is truly valuable at the end of the day."
10135,"take it one step at a time, everything you want to do in your early 20's, you can do in your mid 20's and late 20's, and you will/should have more money. The only thing that gets worse are the hangovers.

Focus on getting work experience and improving your skills, whatever they maybe. The more career leverage and financial freedom you pick up now, the more you can move to different cities and live different experiences.

You want to move to SF? Land a job in Tech and you will have plenty of money left over even after paying expensive ass rent. Move to Europe? you got money in the bank and work experience to leverage, find a job or ask for a transfer, and buy a one way plane ticket, bam, you're there

Anyone can take a video on a beach and blast it on social. What you want to build is a 6 digit net worth and solid work experience that will make people headhunt you.

Focus on doing your first job well, and then things will build on top of each other. And tbh, I visited Chicago for the first time last year and it was pretty nice. Super clean but pretty cold though."
10136,if you're going to come here please be respectful
10137,"1. U can always go to grad school instead of getting another undergrad. 

2. I wouldnt get a degree in design if u already have a degree. Just take some online classes or watch youtube videos. Build ur skills and portfolio as those speak for themselves."
10138,"I disagree with number 1, simply because Grad school would cost way more than a few extra credits.

However, that point is moot because I agree with number 2 so hard. As a communications major who’s taken plenty of graphic design classes, I can tell ya there is no point in getting a degree in it. People in communications/marketing/advertising/design/etc. don’t care that you have a degree specifically in graphic design. As long as you can do it and have some sort of degree, you’re good, and it’s nothing you  can’t learn from the internet."
10139,"You need to analyze this from a career standpoint, a financial standpoint, and 'happiness' standpoint.

From a career standpoint, you need to figure out your long term goals - you don't need to know exactly what you want to do, but a ballpark idea. From there...

* Use LinkedIn to search for people who have careers/jobs that interest you. Look at their work history. What type of degrees do they have? What type of certifications do they have? How did they enter the field? 
* Look for trends - if all the graphic design graduates from your school are working as baristas at Starbucks, then you can conclude that the degree probably isn't that valuable. If you find a bunch of people with really cool graphic design jobs, and none of them have degrees in graphic design, then that probably means they're self taught. 
* Finally, when you find someone on LinkedIn with an interesting role, reach out to them and ask for advice!

Looking at the financial side, you have to answer a few questions first:

* How much do you have in student loan debt?
* How much are you making at your current role?
* How much will you have to pay in tuition fees to go back to school?
* How much does an entry level graphic designer make? What about after 5 years? If the career trajectory doesn't make enough to pay off your loans, then I'd consider other avenues.

From a happiness standpoint, you need to understand what makes you happy, what makes you unhappy, and why. What specifically do you dislike about your job - the work? the people? the location? the pay? Why do you dislike it? How much of that is tied to your current employer, not your role? How confident are you that *this* new career path will fix that?

TBH - I think you should probably just teach yourself graphic design, build a portfolio from scratch, start freelancing (all while still working your current job), and (if you want to stop freelancing) get a job somewhere. But I can't make that choice for you."
10140,I graduated a couple years ago. Couldn’t get a job in my field plus it’s just ridiculously hard to unless I was to go into more debt by moving into a city that I can’t afford. So I found a passion in teaching and am getting certified in it. As we grow our interests change - no shame in changing with them! I would highly suggest that you don’t quit a job before you have another one lined up. Unless you can afford a long time without a job then go for it!
10141,After my second year exams I told myself if I failed those I’d drop out. But I didn’t and had a year left so it would’ve been stupid to drop out. I placed all my time and effort into the final year. So in conclusion I wouldn’t have dropped out because I was 60% into my degree and by then i just wanted to get my moneys worth.
10142,"I appreciate the input! I definitely don't want to get stuck in this before it's too late. I'm going to start trying to plan for this and hopefully start in the coming semester!

What about aviation sucked? That was another option I contemplated before safety."
10143,December 2020? Time travel confirmed
10144,Are you glad you finished your engineering degree or would you have dropped out if you could turn back time?
10145,"Honestly, this is the exact post I was hoping for. I really appreciate this, Thank you! I'm going to take all of this into consideration."
10146,Can you break the lease? You can do that if it fits your situation
10147,"I went to school for psychology and work as a commodities trader. Often times, the subject on your degree is totally immaterial; all that matters is that you have a degree to begin with. All you need to do is have a convincing resume."
10148,"I didn't really think about that! I'll start looking into online classes and videos to try and build a portfolio of sorts. Or at the very least decide if this is what I'd want to get into, thanks!"
10149,"Yeah, that's what I've been told. If for some reason I find out graphic design also isn't for me, I'll hopefully be able to get something I somewhat enjoy just by having a degree."
10150,"That'd be really good to cut costs. Other people suggested looking into self-teaching. If self-teaching doesn't work out, I'll definitely see if my local community college offers any classes worthwhile. Thanks!"
10151,I second this. Portfolio is more valuable than the degree in it
10152,If that’s what they are asking then yes it has.
10153,[deleted]
10154,"If you’re interested in graphic design, I’d recommend looking into a program at a community college. That way you can choose a certification or a degree program, and with the credits you’ve already finished, it would only take you 1 year to finish the program. A bachelor’s is very unnecessary in the graphic design field so there’s no use in taking more money out in loans and spending 2 years over one when you don’t need to. That’s my opinion, anyway! Good luck."
10155,"100%.  I interview people for a range of entry-level professional roles.  All else equal, if I was looking at someone with two undergrad degrees vs someone with a degree, decent portfolio, and evidence they applied themself w/ free classes/getting certifications I will take the second one without any hesitation.  Just make sure you are comfortable speaking about your free classes in a way that shows you really engaged with them."
10156,I'm a fool. Please don't patronize me lol
10157,"That's not a bad idea. I'll see if there are any schools that offer any in my area, thanks!"
10158,I think they’re asking if finishing your degree and presumably having a steady paycheck to fall back on helped you make the pivot to a different career path.
10159,[removed]
10160,Thanks for this! I'm definitely going to be staying in this field to be able to financially support a different career path and maybe in that time I'll find what I actually want I'm this area.
10161,"Yeah, I'm not sure what I expected when I was working towards this, but what I'm doing isn't it. Someone else commented saying to try and find what I want with my degree/career and work towards that, which I'm going to try and do while looking into graphic design or something else. And yeah it's super soul crushing when the career/degree you worked hard for 4-5 years kind of just falls limp. I will say, it's only been a few months for me so things could change! But it just doesn't look that way atm. Hopefully, mine and your situation change with our current positions and the experiences get better, but I just don't see it happening."
10162,[deleted]
10163,Exactly :)
10164,"I spent 3 years getting a degree in exercise science. The last year of that degree I hated it and knew that I didn't want a career in that field. So when I graduated I almost immediately used my GPA to apply for a Bachelor of nursing and I just started that this year and I'm super happy. I say go for it, what's 3 or 4 more years of your life in the grand scheme of things?"
10165,"If you’re interested in graphic deign, I think it’s best to learn the basics and how to use Adobe CC from someone (so classes, or even non college related courses). Also, internships are also great. Even though you’ve graduated I’d still try. You might not get paid, but you’re not paying for a class. I’m a graphic designer and learned from just messing around with the programs. Then in college through some internships I learned how to work on projects and new skills and got some experience. I also volunteered and was the non profit organization’s designer. Good way to just try and learn and you will need actual work examples to get a job"
10166,"I'm on the same boat, unfortunately where I live having a job during this pandemic is a blessing so I choose to stay and save as much as I can. Only quit if you have another job lined up."
10167,"Who tf has 5 year reunions? My 10 year reunion is coming up in a couple years and I don’t even really see a point in going to that, let alone a 5 year. 

It might be interesting to go to the 20 year reunion, but once that time comes I probably won’t care."
10168,"Obligatory not me, but a relative of mine went to theirs recently. They seemed to enjoy catching up and reconnecting with people they hadn’t seen in years, and seeing how their lives were going. 

Personally I’m not sure I formed enough strong bonds in high school to care about going or what people in my class are up to, but I suppose it comes down to what you think and how you feel (and I could very well change my mind by the time mine comes around)."
10169,"I just know the crowd from high school didn’t really contribute anything of value to my life as much as my college peers did. Despite being on the “courts” like homecoming and prom, it was all pretty useless and petty in the end."
10170,That’s how I feel! My best friend is from my college and some of my closest friends are nurses and docs from my hospital
10171,I don’t want to see anyone from high school and the ones I do I already see😂😂
10172,[deleted]
10173,"I never wanted to attend any class reunions from high school and my colleges. I have kept in touch with a few people over the years but I have moved on. My life is not about high school nor is it about my college years. Besides, I was pretty miserable in high school. Have less than zero interest in attending"
10174,"I plan on trying to go to as many reunions as possible. For me, high school was an incredible experience and I know many people in my class pretty well and can’t imagine not being able to catch up every couple of years. If that cost isn’t an issue, I don’t see any point in not going."
10175,"My old scout master met his second wife at a high school reunion. My dad just went to his and said he has a blast. The first one will be a flex fest but anyone flexing isn't worth the time of day. 5 years does seem too early, though. I would have gone to that last year if my school did that. If its too much resources to go seems like not worth but if it's not too bad, seems like the worst case is you're just out an evening. All to gain and not really much to lose imo"
10176,"imagine the hair competition, who kept it, who didn't

haha ;/"
10177,"I just feel like paying to see those I like vs see those I don’t makes no sense, and the odd flexes and shit. Meh."
10178,"I went to my 5 year, but I had moved out of state the year prior and hadn’t lived in my hometown the 4 years before that. I’m only really close friends with one person from my high school friend group now but during college we were all in town on the same breaks so could sometimes catch up. For me, it was worth going to properly catch up with that friend group (or those who came), it was good to see what they were up to!

I will say I had a couple of really nice and unexpected conversations (like beyond polite small talk) with acquaintances I wasn’t close to in high school. For everybody else it was who’s fat, who’s married, who’s in which grad program, etc.

All that being said, I think I would go to my 10 year reunion which is in like a year lol."
10179,I was emotionally abused for 10 years by my alcoholic dad. My mom has bpd and would get crazy sometimes. My high school was my home.
10180,"unfortunately yeah, and for most its the Male Pattern, but in my case - rare autoimmune disease - Lichen Planopilaris - no cure so ye wooo"
10181,No pros. Only cons. Go on an actual vacation instead.
10182,Just wanted to remind you that Reddit is mostly introverts so the advice here is heavily biased towards not going or going and not having a good time
10183,"Exactly these crazy situations make me realize once again how good life is in Germany.
I can only talk for myself, but im 100% sure my class reunion is not primarily about flexing, but about knowing what random things happened in others lifes and getting to talk with each other in a more...responsible way"
10184,"It's been 5 years, and people can change. Assuming you've lost touch with these people, how do you know who you like and don't like? They may not be the same people you remember (and that could be a good thing)."
10185,I got lucky with the people I met and became friends with. They are truly extraordinary people and very patient with all of my problems. Our guidance counselor is also very good at what he does and helped me learn to trust my peers more.
10186,"Skip it. Nothing important happens in only 5 years since graduation, and you already see anyone you’re interested in seeing regularly. Most people are going to be doing either entry level work or just getting out of college, thats pretty much it.

I skipped my 10 year, but I may go to a 15 year. By then, people could have dramatically changed, careers are pretty well established, families already started... maybe it’ll be more interesting."
10187,my 5th year reunion is coming up as well and im sure I dont want to go too much meaningless flexing
10188,"Pros: you get to see a bunch of people that you went to school with that you haven’t seen in a long time 
Cons: the things you listed I guess

I don’t see it as a big deal. Go if you want to go. Don’t go if you don’t. It doesn’t matter beyond that."
10189,Yeah I don’t think it’s worth it. I seriously don’t see any pros to it. I feel like if you seriously want to meet a specific person from high school you could politely ask to see if they want to meet up on social media instead.
10190,People at my HS graduation were very excited about having a reunion. I don't think we even had one. I still text a few of my old friends occasionally and it's good to know I'm not the only one who wouldn't go.
10191,"You should go to your 5 year reunion to support those that are organizing it. The 5 year reunion I don’t think can ever truly be great, but by supporting the 5 year one, you have a better chance of having a great 10/20/30 year reunion later."
10192,"I didn’t mind high school, yes it had its issues but the people I truly want to see and be around, are"
10193,"That's all that matters is how you feel. Everyone is living their own lives and the ones trying to show you up probably feel exactly how everyone else feels, worried about what people think."
10194,Yeah. I overshared with a couple people about stuff in my life but they accepted me for it and now we’re fantastic friends. I learned how to trust again through them
10195,"Most are going just to see what everyone is doing. It’s called “being sociable and friendly”, not flexing. Here’s a hint: if you imagine everyone else is going there to compare themselves and brag, you’re actually projecting. Normal people don’t do that."
10196,Aka obsessive comparison disorder.
10197,"I am a serial job hopper, on job 5 and a bit less than 6 years out of college. I’ve left 3 of them at the 9 month period. Tbh, your market value is going to dictate if employers care or not. My last 3 jobs were all because someone from the company (recruiter or previous manager) came to me asking if I’d be interested in the job, because my experience is valuable and my market is hot. If people pursue you, they generally don’t then halt everything and make themselves look stupid by saying “hey this super obvious thing on your LinkedIn/resume isn’t what we want!” They came to me asking for my attention and consideration, not the other way around. Beggars and choosers dude"
10198,"Personally, I don't think the year-long mark really matters. My first job out of college was an absolute nightmare, and I accepted an offer to a better-paying job about 7 months in that role. Essentially, if your job makes you miserable, then by all means start looking at other options, get out, and don't worry with time limit. If the companies you are interviewing for ask why you're looking for new a new role ""so soon"" (rare but it can happen), then explain in the most corporate-speak way of why your current company is awful. Example: ""I don't agree with how they handle business"" or ""I think their processes are inefficient, but they don't listen to alternative ideas."" I've been in the white collar world for a few years so maybe my experience is different from yours (not sure if you're in a service or trade role), so I hope this helps at least a little."
10199,"When I'm hiring a candidate I prefer to see that they stay at a single location for several years. Job-hopping every year or more shows that you are probably not worth investing in because you'll leave anyway.  

  

If you hate your job, find one that you can tolerate for 2+ years."
10200,We got burned by someone flaking out after 6 months (lots of training involved) and now that gets brought up everytime someone applies with a spotty resume.  Not worth the wasted effort.
10201,"There is definitely a bias amongst hiring managers to prefer candidates who were at their previous jobs for more than 1 year. That's not to say if you have one a couple of positions where you were there for less than a year that it will hurt you because it probably will not, especially early on (also as long as you have a reason for it won't be a big deal). The problem comes from having 6 jobs in 5 years, for example, might send up red flags that you won't stay there very long and instead jump ship as soon as possible, which most places do not like."
10202,"Right, but I just want to point out that by definition those kinds of candidates, the ones that nest at one company for years, are not the type you'll find in a timely manner after posting your job ad."
10203,"It also depends heavily on the industry. 

In tech at least, some companies don’t even expect you to stay a year or longer. The changing nature of technology just changes so fast. 

It’s good of course to show you have commitment. But they’re are no hard and fast rules per se. one commenter put it well that you just don’t wanna seem like you jump too often for too long. But again, it depends highly on industry, location, and just general circumstances."
10204,"I’m in the same boat. I’m gonna be at 2 years with my current job come October, and that’s not anything I can celebrate about. Actually coming to work at the time I’m scheduled for and actually doing the job I get paid to do makes me one of the most reliable workers there now, but at the end of the day the job sucks. I genuinely hate having to be there each and every single day, and the best part of my work day by far is when I get to clock out. If I know I have the next day off, even better. Either way once the pandemic dies I’m gonna do everything I can to find a much better job"
10205,"Really depends on the person and the field. Certainly know people who are constantly jumping around (primarily in media, finance, or marketing). Personally, I love my job and have been there for a couple years- I'd been an intern during undergrad and got offered a job upon finishing my masters, worked for a short bit at different place upon finishing undergrad (I'm in architecture if you're wondering field). Plenty of people at my office had been there as interns, and are now project managers, having worked there 10+ years.

One thing I do notice is people with professional degrees tend to hop around less. Not sure the extent to which it's the workplace culture (lawyers are more biased towards smaller offices, doctors obviously towards hospitals) where there's less benefit to trying to make jumps between places since you're less likely to work for a large corporation (or have fairly universal pay if you're in a hospital network for people in medicine), or the massive debt burdens of professional programs make it more difficult to hop around from city to city chasing jobs. Could even be that going into a profession means you're pretty focused, and tend to be looking for a more linear career path and are older, and thus you're more likely to want to settle down and have stability."
10206,"Construction management, DC area"
10207,"A good candidate is always worth waiting for, and reputable companies with good retention won't hire the first person who walks through the door if there's red flags on his or her resume."
10208,"Yeah so what I was saying was, if you can afford to wait until that kind of candidate comes along, great, more power to you. That's definitely not always the case and the company has to weigh whether the work not getting done is worth waiting for the good candidate to join. It's a tradeoff like any other."
10209,"lots of good answers in the replies here. I agree that there are some different expectations based on field. also dependent on where you're applying to, in terms of their own corporate culture and the people reviewing your resume. if it gets to an interview with the new place you will of course be asked about your most recent job, and if it's a current position almost definitely they'll want to know why you're interested in leaving, so be ready for that question. I've heard occasionally some people may consider it a red flag if somebody has a resume full of short stays at a ton of different companies, but again, there's no rule about this and it's more important to be able to tell the story of your resume at each stage.  


if this is a first job out of college, they are probably *hoping* that you're going to be sticking around for a while. hopefully you are still challenged and feel like you can continue to learn and grow. unless there's a contract actually obligating a time commitment it's up to you. loyalty is admirable but shouldn't be the sole factor. ultimately it shouldn't be considered taboo to take a chance on a new job: if you see something that seems like a great opportunity, no harm in going for it.  there's no commitment until you actually get to the point where you have an offer on the table. if it doesn't pan out, no harm no foul"
10210,"What's your ""market"" in?"
10211,"Yes!! I feel like 22, and especially 23 is such an odd age. We’re trying to be looked at as more grown up and find our footing in the world since we’re starting to head into the adult world, but we’re also seen as babies. Similar to what you said, it seems 23 is more of a transitional period for most people as we move away from our post-grad college mindset and move towards becoming mature adults."
10212,"Totally there with you. I’m 23 and about a year into my first job. Being the youngest on my team I’ve been getting assigned the more monotonous tasks, which I guess is typical for most jobs. I’m also feeling a bit lost on my career path, and I can’t tell if I got here from my own volition or by following the path that would impress the adults in my life. I am trying to focus more on hobbies outside of work, and also trying to shift my perspective of reaching goals more in the long-term. I feel like school makes you think only year-to-year, and now we’re shifting to almost decade long periods. In work I’m trying to climb out of the imposter syndrome hole and looking for a mentor to coach me in some direction (any direction at all would be great!). I hope we all feel a bit better when we’re 24."
10213,Thanks for the advice! Been thinking of taking up photography again or painting
10214,Are the gyms open? You can still meet people in the gym pretty easily.
10215,"Hey, if you ever want to just chat and talk about our life experiences feel free to DM me!"
10216,"hahah dude I have definitely felt this way! and I am so sure that covid is exacerbating the whole situation 

I'm from the midwest too and I know how hard it gets this time of year. just know you are not alone - id definitely reach out to your community (online groups in your town/nearest city) and see if they have any events coming up..or if there is a young professionals group near you. it will get better I'm sorry things are hard right now"
10217,"Holy shit  I think we are the same person?? LOL I also am 23, live with my parents in the Midwest. Thinking about being a city girl but in this pandemic it is harder to move out with the fear of being lonely and not being able to explore the city as much as I would like."
10218,"Wanted to add to this, I’m also from the Midwest and struggling not seeing people. I’m lucky to still live with my parents so I get some interaction but in all honesty I am terrified to move out with Covid because I know how lonely I will feel. If you have a pet, dog parks are also a nice place to meet new people! I would recommend maybe a pet (even a small one)"
10219,"Ow, that’s really weird because that’s exactly the same thing I want! I’m 24 but we may just be the same person a year apart 😂"
10220,I’m in the same boat sort of. I am an engineer at a manufacturing company in my old college town. All of my friends have left and my family is really far away. I a couple bad days away from just quitting my job and moving back in with my parents because the isolation is killing me.
10221,"22 here. I'm doing an internship this term and I'll be back to uni next year. Your story sounds more or less similar to how I feel now adays... I also feel burnt out, unmotivated and very lonely. So here's another stranger on internet who can relate. I know we can overcome!"
10222,"No idea why you had a downvote, the gym is where I met my friend group after moving back home earlier this year. Started talking to one girl at the desk and turns out she knew a ton of people there and now we all hang out and I’m dating one of the guys she introduced me to. It was a lifesaver, I would be miserable and lonely if I hadn’t met them. 

I get that some people may not feel safe going to or socializing at the gym right now but if you do it can be an awesome place, just try to find one with people your age. Mine is the only good gym in a smaller community so everybody goes there and all are very friendly and know everyone, and there’s always someone to talk to. 

I also oddly enough met a few friends on dating apps, we’d go out and there was no romantic connection but we still wanted to hang out as friends, a bit awkward at first but still friends are friends regardless of the circumstances in which you meet. Met another friend when I bought my car from him. I found that once I put an effort into being friendly and meeting people it happened pretty easily even now during covid.  Remember masks and distancing don’t take away the fact that many people still want to talk to and be around others. It can be a bit harder to find places to meet people right now or events to go to to do so but it’s possible."
10223,"Sure thing boss, though i’ll be honest i’m not a talker. Don’t take offense to it."
10224,"definitely recommend photography - can make a nice chunk of change doing free lancing - ive netted about 1k this year in my freelancing journey with photography, videography and graphic design ( I enjoy many different things) it isnt much money of course but its 1000 more than I had lol. photography can be expensive starting out but a very very rewarding skill to take up."
10225,Get used to it buddy
10226,"graduated last year, didn’t even have a graduation bc of covid and just zipped from having classes to finishing. My mind still thinks I’m on break and working in an internship, while in reality I’m working ft wfh, which makes meeting new people even harder.

I was pretty social in uni so I miss that aspect once fully online classes hit and then working hit. But, thank you for this reminded, I’ve started hitting up old college friends who want to hang. And i definitely do believe age groups don’t exist for friends, my school had a huge age range so some of my friends were 4/5 yrs older  and some were younger but you never even think about it when ur having a good time, I really like that.

Thanks again for the supporting words, I needed it (:"
10227,"Hey! Not going to lie. A reality is making friends post grad is tough, but the rewards are limitless. You're going to have to put yourself out there, go to events, farmers markets, bars, clubs, all alone and that's totally okay. You have to realize that other people at these events are simply going to meet people as well. There's like a mutual agreement that we're all here to socialize and mingle. For me, post grad life is awesome. I always had a hard time relating to people my own age and being forced to only hang out with young people was tough. I'm not able to meet individuals who match my maturity or higher and that makes for more of a friendship. I had to grow up fast due to early difficulties, but the people I meet now are awesome. It's scary, but the rewards are awesome. God speed"
10228,or deal with immature 20 year old frat boys. Your perspective lol. There's shitty people in all age groups
10229,"Thanks for the advice! Its very uplifting. What are your more in-depth thoughts on a post grad social life? I really like looking back and knowing I was terrified going into college too, but I'm concerned a major difference between then and now is then I still had the ability to make close friends and hang out with them daily, and that I won't be able to do that ever again. I'm really worried the best years of my life are behind me for good and it really brings me down"
10230,everything will be fine :)
10231,"One thing that helped me was going to social events alone. Yes it's fucking terrifying, but you have to realize there are also other adults trying to meet people as well. Your fear is only one inch deep!"
10232,"Hey!  Glad I could help. I graduated in 2020 without a graduation as well. One thing that helped me was to recreate my own graduation speech. I would highly recommend reading ""10 1/2 things no commencement speaker has ever said"" by Charles Wheelan! Find the inspiring words you need to move on. Search youtube etc!"
10233,Dude you are all over this sub depressing tf outta me. Gotta block youuu before I kms no offense
10234,"I currently feel this so much. I love your advice but I find it really hard to do anything I want until I get a stable job. I also find it harder because I’m a girl and it’s hard to tell the authentic people to the ones who just want to hit on me. Even harder, I haven’t gotten a good friend from university and they just see me as a networking contact when I’ve wanted deeper friendships. Everyone’s got groups so I’m just here trying to carve my own space.

I’m also a great budget saver, I love saving, that habit has stuck with me since I started uni but my weakness is that I am frightened to spend my money on anything. Especially because I’m from a poor family. I need money to meet people with activities that enrich my personal goals of happiness. I am so deathly afraid of spending money on myself, it’s self sabotaging"
10235,"I think it's a balance of being frugal vs cheap. Frugal is alright until it degrades your quality of life. It's a psych thing. Money is seen as security, but you have to realize that one day you'll day. I'm not saying YOLO, but it's a balance. Spend on things that will make your life easier or more pleasant. Invest in quality clothing vs cheap. Sometimes cheaping out will only lead to more expenses later on. I moved to a new city not knowing anyone. Terrified in the beginning, but as time went on. You will find your stride :)"
10236,"I'm not complaining about it because they're shitty people, but because they're boring.  People become significantly more boring as they get older.  Life gets worse and more boring as you get older."
10237,">The stress of finals, projects, and homework are gone. Yes you have work, but you get paid.

Wow, that's fucking inspiring.  Yes, getting paid totally makes up for not getting to hang out with my friends every day, not getting to have interesting, intellectually-stimulating discussions on a regular basis, and not getting four months of vacation a year.  

>The greatest thing about adulthood is you don't have to hangout with people in your age group.

That isn't a positive.  Being in an environment with people of a similar age who have overlapping interests is the best thing about high school and college.  In an office environment, you have to deal with people like Mary in accounting who's 65 and thinks tattoos are sinful, or your 50-year-old supervisor Thomas who doesn't know how to talk about anything unrelated to work other than his lawn.  That and the stifling nature of a work environment won't leave you anything to talk about other than mundane bullshit like the weather."
10238,Thank you! Best of luck to you ji
10239,Thank you!!!
10240,thank you!
10241,Congratulations!!
10242,🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
10243,Congrats!
10244,"Change is scary for sure. Starting a career isn’t a death sentence. Make sure to keep the things you enjoy as a high priority. Begin to think about investing so that you can enjoy financial freedom sooner rather than later. You’re on the right path. Don’t be afraid to take those risks though, you’re young and can afford to fail—embrace it!"
10245,"It’s going to be ok. Jobs aren’t bad if you have good co-workers. Just make sure whatever job you’re at is a step “forward” towards something you want to do. You want to retire early? Get a job that pays well, and save up or start a side hustle. Or work at a company/field that is intriguing to you. My brother in law just finished his engineering degree. He loves cars, and actually got a job working for a large auto manufacturer in their battery division. 

I totally get that you’re stressed out now, but once you have a job that pays well, and you have more discretionary income, it’s a good feeling. 

Lastly, definitely take the advice of others here and find a good circle of friends or some kind of group to belong to (networking group, alumni group, faith group, whatever, doesn’t matter). We are social creatures and we need a support system. 

A lot of people on r/selfimprovement recommended Toastmasters and I have a friend who joined and said it’s been great."
10246,"Look dude, life after college is gonna suck if you think it’ll suck. 
On the flip side, if you think life after college will be great (as it should be) — then make it a reality. 

Don’t compromise, don’t “cope” just make that money and do what you want to do!"
10247,My advice is WHAT U DO AFTER YOUR 9-5 CREATES YOUR EMPIRE DO THINGS LIKE start a YouTube channel so u don’t just soley rely on work all the time
10248,"Its a rough transition. The first year out of college for me, although I was just transitioning to medical school, was rough as I lost touch with close friends, had less time for fun and hobbies, went through a lot of interpersonal trauma, etc. But overall after finding my footing as an adult I have to say I'm a lot happier than I was in undergrad. Life is overall less exciting, I have a lot less drama in my life and in my friend groups, things are more stable, and my friend group has shrunk significantly but the friendships I do have are more meaningful. Finding happiness in your work is critical imo, and making time for your hobbies when you can, as well as finding fulfillment in your friendships/relationships.

It's a different life, but that's all a part of growing up. It doesn't have to be miserable if you don't want it to be."
10249,"Thanks man, it feels good to hear I’m not the only one going thru this… and yeah I’ve got a solid circle of people (friends, family) to lean on… hopefully it’ll get better"
10250,An engineering student that had time for hobbies )!!!?
10251,"It's not going to be easy, you're going to feel ""home-sick"" for college/school (I know it sounds weird - but that's the best way I can describe it lmao) - you're not going to enjoy it at first, however with time you'll get used to it. 

Have hobbies, have a side-hustle, have goals - that'll help you keep pushing through the bleakness of a 9-5."
10252,Thank you so much! I believe I’m surrounded by good people who care about me (friends and family)
10253,I read this as someone raising their voice mid sentence and then lowering it again abruptly
10254,"What I don’t get, why not focus on making your life better? Like drugs only help you for a temporary bit while real changes are permanent."
10255,"My buddy’s a nurse and got put on anti depressants after dealing with more pandemic shit. I’m an EMT looking to go into nursing since my job blows, and I couldn’t get into PA school this cycle. 

I feel the same way as you. It just all seems so bleak, but using my degree I’ve already got won’t really land me where I need to be. 

As others have said, really try to explore what hobbies interest you. I’d recommend starting a club or group of friends that gather around a hobby, and meet regularly. That’ll give you something to look forward to. Having nothing to look forward to is the most depressing thing I’ve experienced as far as post-grad life goes, I’d say. Aside from breakups and typical life shit."
10256,"THANK YOU. I don’t have any advice since I’m in the same boat, I’ve been feeling this way the whole semester (last one like you). I just hope I find my place in this world."
10257,"This is why I ask myself if there is anyone that is truly happy. The thought of working a normal job gives me brain cancer. I'm planning to be a psychiatrist. Hard work, but worth it."
10258,"What do you do now, if you don't mind me asking?"
10259,"We’re not alone man, that’s a start :)"
10260,I work in equipment sales now but I used to do pharmaceutical manufacturing and R&D
10261,">life ahead sounds depressing

It is.

>Is everybody really that unhappy?

Not *everybody*.  But yeah, a lot of people become deeply unhappy once they start working, myself included.  There's a reason why drugs are so popular."
10262,"Time, energy, and money, you get two of the three. You're about to move from time & energy to energy & money. So do your best to prioritize self care, and make some time to spend some money on worthwhile experiences and hobbies you enjoy, and you'll do fine. If you reach out to your friends your age or older, I'm sure you'll find they are or have gone through something similar too. You're not alone."
10263,"I graduated this past spring. I graduated with a degree and career prospects I realized didn't make me happy but because of the pandemic and online school, I was sort of forced into just focusing on finishing college. Now I work in book publishing and I did not study english or any humanities. Life after college works in mysterious and exciting ways too. That's why it was so scary for me, but nothing worthwhile will be built in a day."
10264,"Thanks for your advice! I’ve actually got some money saved up from my college scholarship so I could look into putting it to good use, and travelling lol"
10265,"Thank you VERY MUCH

Just kidding, really, thanks!"
10266,"Do it. Travel, join the peace corp, travel the country, work in Alaska. Do something interesting because it will do far more for you then immediately getting into the rat race"
10267,"Yeah, I actually bought a ticket to go to Europe next March with 2 college friends, that’ll keep me going for a while :)"
10268,"Oh, I don't do drugs anymore myself.  I quit drinking five years ago, and it's been something like six or seven years since I quit dabbling in other drugs.  I just live in a state of sober misery now.  My point was that a lot of people use drugs because life after you start working is nothing but a grind unless you make a lot of money.  Most people can't do much about that.  There are winners and losers in the economy, and which side you end up on is largely outside of your control."
10269,I don’t have any debt. My degree is in economics.
10270,"I spent 8 months sitting on the couch calling a superintendent trying to get sponsored for a union job. I called once every two weeks until he hired me and continued looking elsewhere too to no avail. He said he hired me because I kept calling him, never giving up and he figured he needed to hire me. It’s going pretty good now but those 8 months were long and stressful, every call I was so hopeful this would be my chance but every time it wasn’t. Then one day, it was. Just take it easy, always call after an interview, multiple times. Annoy them, until they pick up and be positive that they’ll hire you this time. I got two other superintendents to say they’ll hire me when they get more work because I called them each 6 times until they picked up and I plead my case and they said when they get work they’ll hire me. I spent 8 months always leaving a voice message but never following through. After I started calling multiple times and being persistent I got those 3 offers  in 2 weeks."
10271,"The reason I think an econ graduate will have a harder time finding a job during an economic downturn is due to the nature of most econ related jobs. Market research work, analytical work, and even some accounting work is superfluous for businesses when compared to their cash intake ventures if they already have an established enterprise. Once there is growth again, these jobs are back to hiring."
10272,"Hey, why do you think it would be harder to get a job in econ?"
10273,"Yeah, nobody really responds to voicemails in my opinion and they won’t pick up a number they don’t recognize on the first ring because they think it’s a spam call so just call multiple times over 1-3 days until they recognize the number and decide to pick up. My advice is to use this time in between applying to do stuff you’ve always wanted to do because once you get the job you won’t have time or energy to do those things anymore."
10274,"You are in no frame of mind to do grad school. Don’t use it to put off real life. Once you get a job and get settled in, it absolutely gets better. You’ll reach equilibrium eventually."
10275,Thanks for the advice. I’m 22 so I guess I shouldn’t freak out about never finding an opportunity. I just need to focus on being better at interviews cause it’s really holding me back
10276,"Thanks for the advice, it really is inspiring for me right now in this low point"
10277,I completely understand how you feel. Being a grad myself and in debt. Can’t find a job for shit.... this is not a good time for us :(
10278,"Work on your interviews, but please don't put yourself at a disadvantage and do literally nothing but sit at home (even with COVID ongoing). Find volunteer opportunities, low-key non-profit work, *anything* to put on a resume and point at during an interview. The amount of horror stories on reddit of people with already below average resumes who then took 4 years off to live at home and play video games and then found themselves eternally unemployable is too damn high."
10279,"In college I interned with the federal government and worked doing some very mundane admin work right after graduation. The federal government is (informally) structured so that certain jobs are off limits until you have X amount of experience. I put in for a position that I thought was the bee's knees and had in mind while in college despite only having less than a year of experience, landed it, and am now contemplating ""now what"" cause it has been a few years and it is not what I expected despite being the only ""dream job"" I had."
10280,I graduated with an Econ degree a couple years ago and work in the financial sector now. Honestly though I think I was hired because of my personal projects that I had done in college. So maybe take the opportunity to explore an interest and use it to build your resume?
10281,[deleted]
10282,Bruv what kind of roles are you applying for? DM me and I can help you out with some interview tips.
10283,"i didnt change majors or anything, but as a undergrad comp sci major i was able to get two well paid internships (the 2nd one paid >$30/hr) and now im just about to finish my degree and a full time salary at a company for a SWE is usually much more than that, however i did have to grind to study/interview but i think it is worth it for a comp sci degree, without one youd have to start very entry level and it will be hard to even get the entry level position, and have some trouble getting promoted depending on the company, in fact, two people in my major who are a decade older than me said they dropped out of college and worked at some companies but couldnt get promoted anymore cus they didnt have a degree so they went back for a comp sci degree :)"
10284,Awesome! Let me know!
10285,Did you go to grad school?
10286,"Yes. Best decision ever.
I had a very well paid job with good conditions and everything but I didn’t like it. (Accounting)
I went back to uni for 3 years in graphic design. I’m in my 30s and at the beginning of my career, I have more debt, but I enjoy every workday. Now my job is my passion."
10287,Thanks for the input! I’m trying to “get it right” the second go around and I want as much info as possible  so I can make an informed decision.
10288,"I’m currently going back to school part time for a degree in kinesiology/exercise science and at another school I’m 1/2 done a postgraduate certificate in Arts Administration and Management. Both have been incredibly helpful in my work as a dance artist and teacher/choreographer. I have able to negotiate higher pay, pick up extra admin work, and because I have a deeper understanding on sports anatomy, I’ve been better at teaching safely, drastically lowering injury rates for my dancers. I have also been able to offer private conditioning sessions that make me about $75-80 per 45 min session. 

A friend of mine did the same and timed her exit from physiotherapy school with her retirement from performing and ended up with a super successful private practice that only treats dancers, and almost of her clientele are former students. I’m hoping to do the same."
10289,Defo worth it! I graduated at 22 and then worked for about 3 years and really didn't enjoy it. I knew there was more I could offer so I went back to uni to study a masters and that gave me the knowledge and skills to launch my own business as well as work in a sector that is more enjoyable and I can utilise my postgrad degree more.
10290,"I graduated in December 2019 from a top engineering school. I really miss the high pace and intellectual stimulation of school, so I am also going back for a degree in CS.

I still have an engineering job full time, so I am doing Oregon State's CS program online after work. I recommend it, they have a post-bacc version for people like you and I that already have bachelor's. It only takes 2 years to finish! Definitely check it out, but like another poster said, be prepared to go the extra mile outside of class too. You'll need to make some side projects, study leetcode (technical interview questions in the CS industry), and get an internship if possible. If you have any more questions about OSU let me know."
10291,"Nope, grad school isn't worth it. Go into trade work"
10292,"Yes. I doubles my income and reached a decent level of job stability. However, I’m in school yet again (while working) for a masters degree that will allow me to move up considerably."
10293,"Computer Science is very worth it, regardless of undergrad or postgrad."
10294,"Im a biochem major, I was 2 years into it and have 2 years left to finish it, I was supposed to graduate in 2016. I see my friends who graduated with chem degrees struggling to make 18$ an hour or even find jobs. My friends with math degrees are working in banks or Amazon warehouses and my bio friend is a supervisor at a Marshall’s warehouse. My electrical engineer friend had a very hard time finding an opportunity after a few years but is making a decent living. I took the hiatus and joined the Air Force reserves and am doing civil service now and making almost double my non engineer friends are. I don’t want to do what I am doing now for a lifetime, even though it pays really well but taking a huge payout makes me question what I should do. Should I finish my biochemistry degree or do something in chemical engineering or mechanical engineering and start the whole process over?"
10295,Goodluck ! You got this 💪🏾
10296,"Yes, I have a MA in Art Therapy & Counseling"
10297,"If you CAN live at home for a little while longer, you can save a lot of money.

With that being said, don't forget about first and last months rent (not sure where you live but that's a thing we need in Ontario when renting). Money for furniture if the place isn't furnished. I would split the food budget into groceries and eating out so you have better control over your money. Ideally an emergency fund of some sort (whatever amount you deem is appropriate although 3-6 months is the ""standard""). Budget for toiletries and home stuff like dish soap and toilet paper. And any healthcare costs you may have."
10298,Youre not going to be able to afford much more than $500 a month comfortably. I still live on that amount of rent on 96k a year lol. Rent is always what will blow your budget and dont consider it at your salary without many roomates.
10299,The apartment I have picked out luckily covers water and electric in the rent so that's mostly all grouped up. Thank you for everything else though!
10300,"My parents want me outta there so this helps, thank you"
10301,You make 6k a month hush
10302,Furniture unless you want to use a cardboard box as a table and sleep on the floor.
10303,"Toilet paper, cleaning supplies, towels, linens, shower curtain, toiletries, laundry detergent, dishes, dish soap. All are relatively cheap but they add up quickly. You may be able to find some of this at a thrift store. Good luck :)"
10304,"Of course. Anyway you can reduce expenses and save AGGRESSIVELY until you have an emergency fund is essential. You don't want to be one hospital bill or one delayed paycheque to being in a bad situation. If I was in your situation, I would do ""rice and beans"" and poverty level scrimp until I have an emergency fund in place.

As soon as you get that in place, you can readjust to a normal state of living. This is all what I would do of course."
10305,You should start an emergency fund that is 3-6 months worth of paychecks. Especially since you are responsible for paying rent. Even if you are a essential worker
10306,I'm not understanding your budget here. You should be able to afford much more than $500/mo on 96k.
10307,"I also don’t understand. You will be left with much more than 500 dollars a month even if you’re spending 1k a month on rent, unless you’re living outside your budget like you just said."
10308,"I also highly recommend buying as much as you can used from thrift stores, estate sales, FB marketplace, Craigslist etc. so many people are constantly moving and getting rid of like-new things, if you’re on a budget and have some time to look around you’ll save a lot of money"
10309,"Any subscription service you may have, laundry (if you won't have a washer/dryer in the apt or if you do and that utility isn't covered by the landlord), internet, transportation, furniture and decor, all new kitchen stuff (silverware, cups, mugs, plates, pots, pans, knives, measuring cups and baking supplies, cooking utensils like spatulas), bathroom stuff like a plunger, toilet paper, and shower curtain, a garbage can, appliances like a toaster or coffee maker, curtains."
10310,"Good answers here. I'd like to make a suggestion from my experience: start a spreadsheet tracking your expenses each month. Put everything in it - big stuff like furniture, and little stuff like laundry. It'll help you develop financial discipline and give you a reference for the next time when you'll move to a new place or when your circumstances change (and there will be a next time)."
10311,"If you don’t cook, would HIGHLY recommend you start learning. You would save SO MUCH more for cooking at home. 

Some monthly bills I could think of are water/electricity(but you said apt covers it), rent(it’s common for apt to have you pay first and last month at front), internet, phone service, car related(gas, maintenance), insurance(car and renters insurance(not sure if this is apply to everywhere but Texas we’re required to have them), and groceries."
10312,"Yeah, 96k minus tax is around 75-85k and if your having only 500 after everything you need to spend it on, your living out side your budget, if you just talking about that much after savings and such, then thats a different story."
10313,"Yes, definitely. People will basically give away their furniture on fb marketplace when they move."
10314,"Super random but also how much car registration costs (that snuck up on me one year, at least the smog test didn't). Some states are every year, while other states like Oregon are every couple of years for registration."
10315,"Side note on this one, see if you can find a reputable local mechanic to do mechanical work on your car. Auto shops usually have good service, but the prices they charge can be borderline insane."
10316,"the fuck is this comment, he was literally trying to explain the point that it’s hard to even live off that budget with a salary like his"
10317,Health insurance. Car payment. Subscription services ie..Netflix..etc. utilities. Pay yourself! Put money in a savings each month if you can.
10318,"Do not move out.  
  
You don't make jack for money which means you will need to live with roommates and other people in this situation are also all fuckballs that will make your life more difficult. You need to make >$25/hr to ""make it"".
  
If you are worried about having a place to fuck your girlfriend, the cost of rent will buy you *very nice* hotel rooms multiple times a month.  
  
Let's suppose you have uber strict parents. This is now an exercise of will between you and them. Continue asserting your independence. Maybe they will ask for rent money. Have the budge together for moving out to give you leverage for negotiating. The more you pay the fewer responsibilities and more freedoms you demand. Make a chart. Once it comes to an impasse make your Dad evict you. This will be an invaluable lesson in negotiating and conflict resolution."
10319,Nows the beSt time. While you still know everything.
10320,"I moved out with a $15 hour full time job. Paid 600 in rent with 4 other roommates (please! Do your research, I found a bunch of nice mates, not THE cleanest but easy going people) downtown area. It took me months of searching but finally found Craigslist to be best."
10321,Great point! Inspection too
10322,"Tbh, the first quote you gave just sounds like people being nice. If someone told me they were majoring in French, I would be nice too; no point saying ""ew what a useless degree."" Your second quote sounds certified Boomer though.

Apply for jobs where you meet half or more of the requirements. Some will say no because their requirements are firm, but plenty are indeed flexible for the right candidate.

For work advice, where do you live? (Country, state)"
10323,"Most Europeans speak their native language and English fluently plus good knowledge of another EU language. It makes it hard for Americans to be competitive in that aspect.

My advice would be to look into a company that does international work and try to get your foot in the door in those places even if you have to do something you feel you are underqualified for."
10324,"I mean most people16-17-18 aren’t super passionate about Finance or Mechanical engineering but they do it because they have skills in math and know they could have a career. 

Electricians and line workers etc are a noble career path with high union rates. They are generally very stable and have a strong outlook for the future right now. Definitely something to look into."
10325,"Seriously! This is what I did. I’m 25 and having a hard time finding something in my wheelhouse, but once you get in at some level with the government you’re only way to go is up!"
10326,Yeah I probably should've been smarter than that at 16/17/18 when I was deciding what I wanted to do with my life but I'm gullible as shit oops 😬 I'll look into that thanks!
10327,"Couple thoughts on jobs: I have many friends with similar humanities degrees who have found lucrative office jobs. One is working at a law firm as a paralegal, which in my state requires a bachelor's degree in any subject + working under the supervision of an attorney. They care about your writing skills, work ethic & attention to detail more than what you majored in. Another friend making a lot of money with a similar major is a Salesforce administrator (she got a certification online for that after graduating college). Neither had to go to grad school and both are paid quite well. If you are tech-minded, definitely look up certificate programs (one example is Google's program: [https://grow.google/certificates/](https://grow.google/certificates/))."
10328,That’s just shitty advice. You can easily look up what degrees are in demand in the job market and language is no where near the top ones. This may sound cliche’ but you can consider joining a coding boot camp if you have the aptitude for it. You will hit 6 figures in 2-3 years if you go down that path and work hard.
10329,"i feel sorry that people gave you advice like this. i was always told to study what you think you would want to do, sprinkled in with stuff you love. for example, my sister was a computer science major, but loved photography so she had a photography minor. 

I  loved science so i pursued science in college to be able to pursue a career in the medical field eventually, but i also take psych classes bc thats my other passion. it’s all about finding a healthy balance of a degree you could use and a degree you would love to get. i loved psych but i knew getting a bachelors in psych was very over saturated and i would need to pursue up to a PhD to get a job in that field. Then i started looked into the medical aspect of psych, and got hooked on the idea of being a psychiatrist or psych nurse, or something related to those jobs. 
it just takes a lot of looking around at jobs you can get and qualify for and seeing if you would like them. A good way is to look up possible routes you can take with a particular degree. if you don’t like the jobs that pertain to that degree, maybe find a similar, but different degree to pursue. 

What are your passions? If the jobs you’re seeing want business degrees, ask if an mba would help or something and maybe pursue that. but if that’s not what you want to do, then you gotta do some more brainstorming.  

It’s a sad reality these days that a lot of college degrees are useless and the idea that you can just get a degree and get a job bc you simply have a degree, is just completely wrong these days. yeah you probably could get a job that isn’t correlated to your degree but so many places want higher education now that it’s like a must have to have some type of specialized education. 
I would say look into the business thing if you really wanted to, or you could pursue teaching or tutoring. Or look into a different type of higher education, maybe a trade school if you feel like doing any of those jobs bc they really need people in those fields right now!!! Or, take a course that’s set up for certification in something after a few weeks or months, like my school has a certification for cyber security and that’s getting pretty big right now too. or if you’re tech savvy or want to be, learn coding. coding can open a lot of doors for people to be very successful, and a lot of the times you can self teach yourself on top of certifications or programs. 
good luck !"
10330,They don't take into account that a language degree alone will probably not be enough. I've often been told that they'd need my language skills in combination with something business oriented.
10331,"That advice was probably true when they entered the workforce but it's not true now...(Gen X here)... Like dating, somehow it seems easier to get a job when youre already in one!!! My advice is get a job to demonstrate your worth, learn some soft skills and earn a little bit of coin along the way, every 1-2 years cash in your chips and move to something some challenging or interesting to demonstrate your new value to an employer, develop more recognition and value and move on... For example, I was a health inspector who became a paramedic who learned to teach, puis, à 30ans jai commencé apprendre le français, and now I am a part time uni lecturer who also works part time for a French based organisation where I use my health, education, French and life skills. Bon courage!"
10332,"I totally agree. If someone I don't know tells me they are majoring in something I think is useless I just say ""oh that's cool! Sounds like you are doing something you love"" because I don't want to tell a stranger their degree makes minimum wage immediately out of college"
10333,"Also, just remember to keep your head up! You sound really smart and I'm sure you will find success. Remember to not let your job define your worth as a person. Even if your major doesn't line up with what you end up doing for money, if you found French interesting and fulfilling that should be enough reason to be proud of what you studied.

I see how you feel it was a ""useless major"" right now, but the soft skills you learned in college- writing, attention to detail, working with others on time-sensitive group projects, etc.- will be applicable in so many work settings. Even if all your work during a paid job is in English, your skills from your major will help tremendously, and you can always use your French language skills in other parts of your life.

I hope this helps. You've got this!!"
10334,that’s what i was saying!! i have a few friends that learned how to code and landed good jobs after a few years and it changed their lives! it’s also something you could possibly teach yourself with the right dedication.
10335,Ngl rn if you live in Murfreesboro or Nashville there are a ton of job opportunities. Don't know much about the French degree but I'm sure if nothing else there are a ton of tutoring opportunities. Did you have a minor in anything it could combo with?
10336,"Thank you so much! My bf is actually looking at paralegal stuff (he majored in history) so that is definitely something that is popping up more and more on my radar of possible career paths. And ooh google certificates, I forgot about those!! Yeah, I'll look into that too. Thanks again!"
10337,"US, relocating to Tennessee to live with my parents :/"
10338,Yeah a second language can be useful if paired with the correct degree but by itself isn't going to land a great job out of college. There are some translating jobs but as op pointed out you need to be fluent not just conversational. Who ever said those things is either delusional or just being polite
10339,"Linesman, electrician, plumber, dock worker, conductor, anything with sewage/gas that’s technical pays well, carpenter, road construction, anything with heavy machinery, I mean I could go on. 

Basically be willing to move and be open to learning something and there’s millions of opportunities in the trades to make a good living and even go independent after you have a clientele or savings built up."
10340,"Honestly I’d try to get a job in recruiting. It can be pretty lucrative, but it’ll take work. From what I understand they will ACTUALLY take any degree, just need to be good working with people."
10341,Just about in the world has been yelling “stem degree or don’t go” and “useless degrees are useless” for the past decade or two. Come on.
10342,"Apparently MTSU has one of the best concrete mixing majors in the world. I'd never heard of it but apparently those guys make BANK.

&#x200B;

Instead I just went with Computer Science lol."
10343,"Studying English Literature (fromn't US) and always heard similar stuff. ""Wow so you know English!? You can land a nice job with that!"" or ""Just focus on getting that degree"". Good thing is that my grades suck and I'm on the fifth year retaking courses so do not have the problem of having an useless degree"
10344,What trade?
10345,Especially while OP is (as far as I can tell) living with parents and doesn't have to pay rent
10346,My minor was Japanese lol
10347,"Ah. Well, username checks out.

A language tutor is about all I got in terms of suggestions lol. 

If you are looking for another chance at school, MTSU is a really good college, especially for how cheap it is."
10348,"Huh that's cool never realized you could major in concrete mixing 🤔🤔🤔 food for thought, thanks!"
10349,"Boomers don't know shit about what it's like right now.

Our generation(s) was sold/told lies and we're just left to fend for ourselves.

It isn't the same as it used to be. Shit is fucked.

/r/recruitinghell"
10350,"Lol yeah 

Yeah I was looking at mtsu, just not sure if I'm down mentally and financially for more school :/"
10351,I’m a female with also barely any close female friendships too :( I graduated from college last spring and it has been rough adjusting to the “real world”. I’ve felt incredibly lonely and these past couple of months it has seemed to hit me harder than ever before. I really do feel your pain. It makes me sad to think that life is ticking along and here I am with a skeletal social network and no one to share my greatest joys or worst fears or etc with. Life is not so fun when you lead a near-exclusively solitary existence- at least not for me. 😕
10352,"I definitely agree with all your points. One thing I would suggest is to try to use the mentality you wish you would've used in college now. Obviously, it's a lot harder now but it's better late than never.

At one point I felt the same way you did but I figured the only way to change is if I start doing something. So try anything that remotely interests you and be the person you wish you once were. Hope it all works out!"
10353,I think I enjoyed the surface level friendships way too much and should’ve put more effort into the closest group of friends. This would’ve been the best way to transition to post university life.
10354,"This is so true. Yes, we may have our family to help us with our needs. But it's actually our friends who keep us in check. Me being an overly introverted person, struggled to make friends in college. The only friend i had was an extrovert. Now that they are going to get jobs cuz they had that connections with people. 
I just regret not making an extra effort in making friends. I took advantage of my college life, and now i feel miserable as i just graduated college. Covid has made it even worse"
10355,"I’m a guy, so my experience will be a bit different, but finding clubs centered around physical activity is a great great way to make friends. I play basketball at the local LA fitness, and it’s super easy to meet people there. Maybe there is some hobby you like where you can meet people. Swimming or rock climbing or things of the sort"
10356,"Tbh you should look starting a hobby that requires you to be at a place consistently. I.e a gym...if you consistently go to a gym and work out for 1 hour or even 30 min. you will see the same people over and over again. I think for women it is a little bit easier to make friends that are female if that is what you are looking for. For a guy it is different because, and this is my opinion of why I don't just go up to random women, (1) I do not want to be another one of those guys that come up to you (2) some women think there is some other anterior motive (3) I don't have that much game...and I'm 5'6 soooo. With all that to say check out going to a gym or going to the same coffee shop oh oh or check out a local farmers market. Key is to be at a place that has ""regulars"" so that way you can build rapport and also don't be afraid to talk. Remember that the other person is probably thinkin that same thing you are: ""How do I spark up a convo with that person.""

&#x200B;

Good Luck :3"
10357,"Honestly same, I feel like I’m a part of a bunch of small groups but I don’t really feel super connected to any of them tbh"
10358,"About to graduate next week and I too have already been dreading the loneliness aspect of post-graduation depression.

Much of my time at college was filled with dysphoria, as I felt anxiety being around students in an academic atmosphere where people view each other as measuring sticks and befriend those that they think will help them get that leg up, despite being on pace to graduating Summa Cum Laude. 

As a result, I did not have many friends. I had a handful of people, students and faculty, that I felt comfortable interacting with on a 1-on-1 basis, but I've been feeling grief ever since early June with how I did not get closure with them, thanks to this pandemic. Seeing them proceed with their lives anyways has instead made me feel melancholy instead of happiness for them.

I'll be entering the job search phase after graduating (well I'll actually take a break first between those 2 phases), so I won't get a new stream of people to meet to get my mind off these recently expired relationships for quite some time.

I too wonder when I'll rediscover new company."
10359,Message me I did a podcast episode about this and how to make friends after uni.
10360,"My longest and best relationship started off a tinder date lol. We went to the same school, but met over summer on tinder, cause we were in separate colleges that kind of kept us on opposite corners of our campus. 

But yeah, life in general has just been a downhill snowball for me too. It’s really cool"
10361,I hope we both find better socials! As women we really need our close girlfriends to keep us in check.
10362,Me in a nutshell. I’m trying to not complain and throw myself out there but covid threw a wrench in my plans.
10363,I honestly agree that physical activities are the best. I think music events are a hit or miss
10364,That’s a really good tip. Thanks!
10365,Hey! Could I have the link for it?
10366,"Don't get disheartened. I know this is a clichéd response, but make most of what you have. I too am trying to improve things on my own pace. After all,  we're all here not to make any difference to the world. We ought to be different than our old self. I hope we can make it happen!"
10367,PM’d you
10368,"I guess the wording’s got me confused. We both enjoyed similar humor, we liked live music and had similar tastes in music. She was always willing to put in effort to see me, and liked to go just burn a night having fun with me. 

Sounds simple enough, but I haven’t hit it off with anyone like that since."
10369,"hey if you acknowledge your past mistakes and realise you need to take more risks then it’s never too late!! it’s much harder, sure, but you know what there is to gain and you’ve got nothing to lose!"
10370,"I feel this. I’m fortunate in a way in that I didn’t move after college. I live in my college town and work where I did my co-op rotations, where I know a good amount of people. I’ve tried to stay busy with seeing work friends outside of work, to varying degrees of success. They definitely feel like lonelier friendships, if that makes sense, than my college ones did, but they’re still worthwhile. 

I joined a co-ed sports league and became close friends with one of the guys I met there. Figures, he’s moving soon. Oh well. I also struggle like you do, as a female with very few female friends. I’ve always been good at being friends with men and only occasionally had issues in high school/college with them expecting something else from me. I’ve found that that happens way more now that I’m out of college, so I’m wary of getting platonically close with men as well. 

And tinder sucks."
10371,I'm sending you positive vibes friend...remember there are people that do care for your well being :)
10372,Hey! Can I ask what kind of things you started doing? I'm having trouble finding things going on in my town
10373,Gimmie your podcast episode.
10374,"I relate to this so much, especially the being platonic friends with men. A lot of them want more and I always have to rely on gut feeling (usually never wrong) to see if they want more.

And yea tinder, all dating and friend apps suck"
10375,That’s amazing and pure luck. What do you guys bond over if you’re just friends?
10376,"Thank you for leaving such a kind reply. I am trying to take time each day to really, truly believe that there are people out there who care about me. I hope one day it will genuinely sink in."
10377,"For sure. Okay so I enjoy playing sports. So I go to the gym regularly and play basketball and even joined a local league. I met some friends in that league and we started hanging out outside of just the gym. So whether that’s movies, skydiving, mini golfing, paintball, concerts etc. The reason I was able to do so tho is becuz I was able to click with those ppl when playing ball  That may not be the case for everyone and if it’s not just find another thing that you enjoy and see if you can meet people. 

I’ve also heard people meeting new people on bumble. I’ve never done it but i’ve heard some people find success with it. Personally when meeting new people i’m pretty extroverted so I don’t mind walking up to random people and talking. If u find that hard to do one thing i would suggest is make yourself be afraid of regret rather than rejection. What I mean by that is if u see someone you like or wanna talk to don’t be afraid of them not liking you rather be afraid of not knowing if they would’ve liked you. 

For me it was a physical activity depending on your interests it may be different."
10378,Sure! Messaging you now
10379,Dude honestly you will! Humans are inherently caring people...just give it time friend :)
10380,Thanks for the detailed response! Did you find the league from somewhere?
10381,"Move to the city, the parties will be just as good or better. Plus you’ll have a lot more entertainment options outside of parties (festivals, great restaurants, museums etc.). You’ll also get to meet a lot of interesting people"
10382,"I tried to go to graduate school, but it didn't work out. Thanks for the advice!"
10383,Making this decision based on what parties you can attend is absolutely stupid and you’ll regret it
10384,"I think this really depends on which place offers the most personal and job growth. Pretty much any big city you go to will offer plenty of socializing, partying, and culture- you just need to work your way into the social scene, which, while tough at the beginning is completely doable.

I ultimately chose to stay in my college town (Boston) as opposed to returning to my home in NYC for work, just because out of school the job prospects I had here were more in line with what I wanted to do in life. I'll move out of the city eventually- don't intend on using the place as a crutch so I can retain the comfort of my college social circles. But the point is that it was a choice to stay, not a desire for continuity and comfort

Just remember, choosing to stay put is as much of a change as is moving to a new place. People you went to school with all have their own career and life ambitions and will eventually move to new places. Nothing is static, and things will change around you. So I usually find it best to try to have some agency and make conscious decisions, based on what I want life to be like 5-10 years down the road. Base any decision on that, not the current situation."
10385,"I've personally never been to Brazil, but I feel like if there's one place on earth you could party your heart out, it's either Rio or Sao Paulo. 

I know what you mean though, Senior year was when I finally figured out how to have fun in college, but since graduating, I've definitely had my fair share of fun, so I wouldn't worry.

Best of luck."
10386,"Move to the city. Otherwise you may wake up one day when you're 28-30 and think ""oh god why am I still spending so much time with 20 year olds"" and probably regret not taking the better job."
10387,[deleted]
10388,Take the job. I stayed back in my colleges town and got a job to wait for my girlfriend at the time to graduate. I waited 2 years and we broke up right before she graduated. I made friends in my post grad and partied hard. But they eventually left and it was horrible. Don’t stick around longer than you have to.
10389,"If you like the environment, you can always get a job on campus, too. Lots of institutions include free classes for employees. You won't make the money with an EE like you would for HP but every university has a huge IT department and countless nonprofits, financial aid services, and other entities that constantly require tech people to operate. The online grading system your school uses employs probably at least a dozen full-time staffers to keep running, for instance. So I mean there's options out there if you want to stay in an academic setting. Working at a university is generally less stressful than corporate life since schools are flush with money, and with the transition to virtual learning I'm sure someone has to keep the lights on."
10390,"thanks man, that was sweet! hahaha"
10391,Maybe the real party was all the friends we made along the way.
10392,That's one of my fears hahaha
10393,"I don’t wanna say regret, because I got to pay off all my loans, got a car, build a very solid base for myself, but I do feel like I missed out on my post grad 20s when all my friends graduated and all moved to a similar area and I’m stuck in this college town. My advice is to leave. Q"
10394,I mean if you’re in America shit won’t start to really open up and get back to normal for 2 or more years so I’d take the job
10395,"Yeah, I have a feeling that a big city life will be interesting. However, it seems to me that meeting new people is harder."
10396,"That's one of the best advices I got, thanks man!"
10397,"that's funny hahah. It seems that a lot of people struggle with this kind of situation. 

What did you do after it became clear that holding on to college life didn't work out?"
10398,"I already live in Brazil, currently I live in Campinas, a city close to São Paulo, about 1 hour distance."
10399,Why not spend a week in the city to see what it's like?
10400,"Normally I would say the big city, but I don't know how COVID is in your country. Does São Paulo have tons of cases compared to where you live? I know big city life is great and tempting(I miss it), but if COVID is bad in São Paulo, you might want to wait it out a year or two.

Idk, I'm from the US, so I'm not familiar with the situation in Brazil"
10401,"a lot of people have good points but i want to emphasize that your friends will all graduate and leave your city (and you, truth be told) to continue their lives. not being pessimistic, my dear friends dipped out of my state asap too. what im saying is don’t live your life around your friends, cause they won’t for you (again, not in a mean way! just true). live for you, man."
10402,Go to Brazil. You can drink there and do the same thing.
10403,"thanks man, that's reassuring hahaha"
10404,"Damn, that's rough. What did you do after that? I mean, do you regret your decision or it was a worthwhile experience?"
10405,Perhaps you're right hahah
10406,"That’s what I thought when I moved from a small suburb to a big city but I found the exact opposite, you just have to put yourself out there"
10407,"Yeah it might be a little tough at first, and you have to be willing to put yourself out there. When I moved from my college town to New York City, I joined a local sports league and made a lot of friends that way. You can also make friends with co-workers through happy hours."
10408,Appreciate it! Hope this was of some help to you
10409,"I see what you mean, thanks for the advice!"
10410,Lol she probably sell courses mate.
10411,"Sorry I do not have good advice to give, but I do want to say you aren't alone. I also graduated last year and have had no luck starting a career.

The only slight difference is that I always knew what I want to do in my social science field, but after a year of looking, I have come to accept that no one wants to give me a chance to do it. Since coming up on the one year mark, I have been trying to adopt a new attitude about a career and be content with employment that gives me enough leisure time and financial stability to enjoy life outside of work.

Easier said than done, I know. And I am not at all recommending that you follow my attitude, a degree in CS puts you in a better place than me anyways. But even if I'm not in a happy place in my life right now, I am starting to see more paths to happiness than I was before, and I wish that for you too."
10412,"Emphasis on DESIGN. UI/UX programming is just as much code, and sometimes excessively tedious code.

Source: Worked as a UI/UX developer for 3 months."
10413,"I can imagine how lost and purposeless you must feel right now. As someone who earned three college degrees and ended up pursuing a job that had nothing to do with any of them I can really empathize with what your going through. 

If your interested in learning more about how I found my career passion and how to do the same for yourself send me a DM so we can connect!"
10414,"Speaking on working out. I’ve lost alittle over 100 lbs, but gained about 30 lbs back and I’m still struggling to get back to it. That only adds to my frustration and hopelessness."
10415,"None of them are tutorials. 

Even the “100 days” one isn’t a tutorial. They show you the concepts you need, tell you what goals are for the project, then you stop the lessons and do it yourself. 

Learning is lifelong. There’s always going to be something to brush up on, get more comfortable with. If you’re not comfortable with that - then CS maybe isn’t for you."
10416,What did you do?
10417,"I mean, congratulations on the weight loss, even if you gained some back. Ultimately, I think that happens sometimes. Joining another subreddit for weight loss may help motivate you. Thinking about what led to the weight gain may help you avoid it."
10418,"Are you doing udemy courses?

I graduated in May of this year with a CS degree, jobless, and no internships (although I also have research experience).  

I’m focusing pretty heavily on some udemy courses right now (100 days of code, and then a “leetcode in python” course, mainly).  

I *really* suggest doing the “100 days of code” (at least) course, as it starts at the beginning and builds some pretty nice projects at the end."
10419,"Wtf, you’re still doing udemt courses after you graduate in cs? Ur the legend of tutorial hell."
10420,"No, if you like coding, definitely try it."
10421,"I know for me the idea of doing personal projects just to get a job sounded exhausting and I never wanted to do it. What worked for me at the end of the day was to meet as many people as possible and tell them how you don’t know what you want to do. Because nearly every person you meet will have some sort of suggestion and you never know if there’s a path that you haven’t looked at or somebody you could get connected with. I graduated during the pandemic and lived at home before moving to live to my relatives in another state. If that’s an option for you, you could try that! Even just another environment is sometimes enough to get going again."
10422,So would you say NOT to try for UI/UX as a design major? Hmhm
10423,"Hey dude, just wanting to put a word in for cycling. Recording segments and rides on strava feels quite like a game to get the fastest times / longest rides. It’s just fun as hell and with the right gearing you can really trust it won’t feel like a workout until you’re actually having fun and the endorphins are pumping anyway"
10424,It didn’t make you think of your own ideas. They lay down the concepts you need to know to get the job done. Pretty much a tutorial. Real world coding doesn’t work like this.
10425,"Lol no, that’s definitely not “pretty much a tutorial.” 

The grind is what matters in programming. “Tutorial hell” refers to when people skip out on that process by essentially copy/pasting what a tutorial tells them.

You’re mistaking that with directed learning. 

I don’t know if you’ve ever answered any questions in the CLRS textbook or K&R C (or literally ANY textbook) - but those certainly are not “tutorials.”  They give you the building blocks to answer questions, give you something specific to do, but it’s on you to figure out how."
10426,"You can hook up with temp agencies that will find jobs for you, that’ll help you get into the doors of company’s. Who knows, you might like the job. If not, on to the next."
10427,"We’re talking about projects, not doing questions."
10428,"I graduated in 2017 so I remember those feelings very well and I didn't even have a pandemic to contend with.

In terms of the anxiety I can understand. It's like you were given a map and once you get to the end and go up to a guide for the next one he/she pulls it out but instead of giving it to you the guide sets it on fire. You might want to look into meditation. Here are some apps you might want to check out: [https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g25178771/best-meditation-apps/](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g25178771/best-meditation-apps/). Also keep in mind that HR departments and college graduation dates don't always line up so don't be too hard on yourself.

Regarding not knowing what you want to do that's totally fine! As I like to mention to people my dad went to school to study either marine ecology or biology but ended up working in the theater industry. Something you might want to think about is what you **don't** like to do. As an example I work in media production, but I never had the patience for editing or interest in sound work. Sometimes it can be easier to form a list based on what you eliminate rather than what you add.

Also look into using Shapr: [https://shapr.co/](https://shapr.co/). I was able to meet some cool people from it.

Additionally this is a great article I found earlier today that you might want to read: [https://getpocket.com/explore/item/on-getting-rejected-a-lot-and-liking-it?utm\_source=pocket-newtab](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/on-getting-rejected-a-lot-and-liking-it?utm_source=pocket-newtab)."
10429,"I graduated college in 2018 with 2 B.A.’s and I did not land my dream job until two years later. Apply for you dreams jobs, and in the meantime work whatever you can to put food on the table and get bills paid. It sucks massively but it’s easier to get started where you want to be when you’re doing something you’d rather not do. I had career anxiety for years until just this last august when I got THE job. I stil do from time to time because it’s my default setting at this point. You’ll find the perfect job - so much is out of your control and has everything to do with timing."
10430,"Suck it up and accept the fact that there will be uncertainty, and be comfortable with it. I think the expectation that you know what you want to do is bullshit. What you want to do changes over time and it's dynamic. What's more important is that take whatever opportunity that's given to you and just put in your best effort. Your first job won't be anywhere perfect, but if you put you best self forward, doors will open up. I lived in NYC my first year out of of undergrad (and the next two), saved almost nothing after rent+expenses, but I had a ton of fun. Learn to hustle and things will only get better from there.

In terms of actual career tips, if your resume/school is not prestigious enough for companies to give you an interview, cold email/call recruiters on linkedin and ask for interviews. If you do this 100 times, at least someone will respond. You have plenty of time for 2021 recruiting. Someone at a company putting your resume in is worth 10x than you submitting it through their website."

10435,"I was in a similar situation (graduated with a music degree in June) and have really struggled over the last few months due to moving around with my parents non stop and not being able to get a job. Now we’ve settled I’ve bitten the bullet and just got a temp sales job with a great shop in my city. 

Ive had to accept that I’m not going to get a music job right out of the gate, so I went for a job that would fill a gap in my skill set and cv. That’s the best way to approach the job search. 

You might not get a job in your field immediately, so I suggest taking jobs that will make you more employable. Get a temp job, and treat it as important as you would your dream job. Get a great reference, then move on to a better job. It won’t take you long until you’re where you want. Never feel lesser because some of your course mates have got good jobs earlier than you, everyone is in a different situation. Good luck!!"
10436,"I've been taught that most jobs aren't advertised. Do a google on ""the hidden job market"". That should give you links on how to look for jobs that aren't advertised."
10437,"Action will take your anxiety away.
Sleep early. Get up early and do some physical exercise outside (just brisk walking is fine too). This gets rich oxygen into your body first thing. Then, shower, eat and spend 8 hours looking for a job. Treat it like a job. Talk to people on linked in, start talking to recruiters. Within 1 month of doing this daily, I’d be surprised if you don’t have a job."

10443,"Apply for more jobs, most of us need to apply for 100 jobs to get offered 1. Just keep applying..."
10444,"First, you are not alone in how you feel. Thousands of your peers across the country and world feel just like you. In fact, thousands of students before you also felt the same way. And thousands after you will also feel that way. Instead of thinking you have to land a job (high paying or otherwise) try thinking about it a different way. Perhaps focus your time and energy into starting your own business. That may sound intimidating but it doesn’t have to be. I’m not talking about the next high flying startup. We have been conditioned for far too long to believe that success after college means getting your dream job. This pandemic has shown that people and jobs are not immune to its effects. The best way for you to ensure your future is to build it on your own back- not on anyone else’s. Think about what problems exist in your view of the world and how you can contribute to solving them. Really focus your energy on this and with persistence you will meet people, find direction, and ultimately the one thing that gets you fired up. You are at a point in your life where you have the most freedom to take some risks. But the window won’t stay open for long, so don’t squander this opportunity."

If you keep applying you'll get something, at least then you'll have an income stream and can afford to eat/ go out and stuff. Then you keep your resume updated and apply for better jobs / increasing your salary, and just keep doing that until you're happy or just keep shifting as you can/ want"

10463,"I agree with that but I also think that can be applied to lots of things, in that there are many things that get real old real fast but still worth trying. Idk, a comfortable life can get boring sometimes."
10464,I think a commute to work so you can go home and enjoy Netflix with your money gets old in a very different way to not having running water or access to a doctor if you sprain your ankle in the middle of the forest. It’s more than boredom it’s literally all the conveniences that you don’t realize
10465,"I don't agree. Many people have to survive in order to be able to pay for food, housing, raise their kids, live as a care taker, are going through some disease or have chronical issues, have to live in war zones, etc etc. While Maslow's pyramid of needs is a simplified way to look at reality, it's what comes to mind. One is having a good time in life if they don't have to worry or overcome any problems or obstacles. Most people don't have the opportunity to live their life like that. Perhaps if you are really rich, can pay for everything you want and need?"
10466,"I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd definitely prefer to live as a farmer in some small rural community, not just a place where people live in proximity to others, but an actual community, where everyone cares for each other and you don't need a paycheque to eat or have a roof over your head"

10471,"I don’t think the point is saying do more then just survive, but more so don’t just simply survive. 

If you the big breadwinner in a household of say a wife and one child, you feel like you gotta bring home that check to survive, and any overtime is just icing on the cake. So you work and work and work and your family is able to not just survive but actually thrive..... but your over here working 7 days a week 10+ hours a day, you don’t have the energy to go and benefit and live life.... you just work and work intill you cant and your kids on there way moving out. 
You missed it, life. Your now sad because your family is nothing more then strangers living in your home. 
You gotta do what you gotta do.... but take some time, stop and smell the roses! Every day is a fight for survival ( one that can end instantly ) you gotta take time and be a human, go socialize, take a me day, take the family out for a day, go on a day-cation, hell throw in taking the dog for a long walk.

It took me two years after graduating to regain my footing and find a job that doesn’t make me completely hate my life. Entry level roles can feel mind numbing - once you move up the ladder, you’ll have a greater sense of purpose. Hang in there and remember that there’s nothing wrong with feeling this way.

10477,"I feel you, 10 months into my first real job post undergrad. It’s pretty much remote which is cool but i often get into my head about the monotony of each day. Sitting on my ass all day, working out, going to the store just to sneakily smoke a cigarette in the car (i live with my dad/stepmom), take shower, watch law n order, pass out from exhaustion. Day in day out. I often times feel like I’m really unqualified at my job and everyone around me is much smarter (they all have post grad degrees, PHDs, or extensive work experience. I often think about my dreams of being an actress or traveling the world and how I’m so scared of getting stuck in the corporate cycle until I die and never seeing these dreams come true. However, after getting on much needed bupropion and beta blockers, it’s made it easier to recognize and feel good about the small wins. Whether that be getting up and having a really good workout, meeting up with some old/new friends in free time, having a laugh, enjoying your favorite food, watching your favorite movie, meeting someone new. These things help, but if you’re able to, start saving as much as you can. Each paycheck, put a little aside if possible. With the money I save, it reminds me that “hey, this isn’t the end. After enough saving, you could literally pack up and start a new life if u wanted to. You could move to the beach and work a job at a surf shop. You can backpack across Europe and do all that eat pray love shit lol. You could move to another city and try to pursue your acting dreams”. Think about it like this, your working these draining jobs right now but it will provide you the money to eventually pursue the things you actually want to do in life to make you happy. I know that’s easier said than done, but in the grand a scheme of things, this is your life. No job is worth ending your life forever for. No job is worth that stress. There will always be other jobs, there will always be people who want to control your life path, just remember this is about what YOU want in this life.

10480,"My situation is a bit different from yours.

I’m 32, and only recently got my degree for IT (graduated with a BS last summer - 6 credit hours a semester was covered through work, so I took advantage of it as one of my “extended benefits”), however I’ve done IT for 9 years. Before doing IT, I had never done anything related to technology aside from casually use a computer, plug in a printer via USB or set up a console on the home wifi. Now, I’m considered one of the go-to people in my group and do research on long-standing issues so we can discuss them with vendors to try and reach a long-term solution, despite that not officially being my current role. I’m almost a middle manager, of sorts as well, because I offer continued training to anyone who asks and engage in talks with my fellow coworkers, along with developing fixes for issues alongside them. 

My experience the has always been try to learn what I can while working because who knows the next time I’ll need to remember what I just used or saw, but keeping it mentally pocketed in the back of my mind for later has saved me in quite a few situations. That being said, I’ve had almost no formal training for my job (despite always offering to train others in my current role), but have learned everything I can while working. The very little I’ve learned while working and doing IT has been related to Active Directory management, and that was mostly so I wouldn’t screw up other peoples already established work in AD.

I don’t really use anything I’ve learned from my degree, and my current job normally consists of hands-on tier 2 support with the occasional large project in between, which I’ve done for 6 years with my current employer, and a similar experience with a school district 3 years before that (so 9 years total). Anything else extra I’ve mentioned, I do because I care about my coworkers and making sure our group has what it needs to function properly, along with my bosses. **To me, it sounds like you’re stuck in a position where everyone is looking out for themselves and your supervisory chain have dropped the ball on making sure you’re doing okay.**

Another thing that’s different in my situation is that I work for government and the expectations are much more lenient, but so is the pay (I currently make $53k, which is about $11k higher than what I started at 6 years ago) and I know I could be somewhere making $70k-$80k doing this exact job… but I wouldn’t have the freedom to do what I do outside of work, like not respond to e-mails. Or pick up the phone on weekends. After hours and my time off is respected in my position, and if I do decide to work, I’m compensated with OT or Comp Time at my choice.

Now, I’m beginning a new position in the same bureau I currently work in at the end of this month, but it’s more enterprise/tier 3 level and I know for a fact that my workload will be cut down by close to 60%-70%, my pay is being increased and my overall cap will be higher should I decide to continue down this career path.

IT is one of those fields where if you bust your ass long enough, the work slows down eventually and you only get called for the most important matters, like servers or large projects. The more menial tasks are left to the lower tiered supports because they’re common, but usually should also be easy to fix. If not, they’re escalated until they are. At that point, it’s out of your hands.

The TL;DR - I’m happy, but it took time to get there and I had to earn my degree while working full time. It’s thanks to having a great supervisory staff and stepping up when my group needed me so others didn’t have to go through what I did when I first began that made my position better for me personally. It started terrible at my old job until I moved and made it work at my new one doing similar work, mostly self-taught and motivated."
10481,"Yeah big time. 


I dropped out of college at 18, and worked full time until this year (I’m now 22) 


Never worked a job in my life that I’ve liked, in fact i fantasize about offing myself every time I work some shit job I don’t care about. 


Quit working full time a few months ago, just following my passions for now until I run out of money. I have 0 prospects for my future, and no marketable skills, but weirdly I’m quite happy at the moment."
10482,"Being 22 is so overrated. From someone who is the same age who didn't do great in college and is now struggling to get any kind of job, don't worry about coming off as whiny. It's so hard to find our directions in life at this point. Hope you find something you're passionate about and is less stressful eventually:)"
10483,As someone who is trying to go into that field. This was a real eye opener
10484,"That was me, but I ran out of money and now I'm homeless and looking to get back into the workforce since I ran out of money. OH and I didn't kill myself so I'm stuck with the consequences of my actions."
10485,I used mine before I even had it earned lol
10486,I’m in construction management (owners rep / consultant would probably explain it better in layman’s terms). Before I was in general contracting after college.

10488,"Sounds like the problem with your job is that its based in coding. Coding can't be taught on the job. You already have to know how to do it before you get hired and then after that you build up your skills vis the projects they give you. Youre looking for guidance and and really know what to do in your tech role as you should,, but when you're dealing with code you should be at a slightly above average level when you get hired bc it'd a whole language and the job can't teach you a whole language so you can pull data from the cloud and whatnot. They easy paying jobs are jobs like content creator or a job that is project based or managment based with competent workers where you don't really have to do anything. These managment positions are naturally positions you get after putting in the years of work. Or unorthodox ways, You can also create passive income, like writing a book or creating a print that ppl like.  Yes, but then I realized I wasn't gonna kill myself, hence actually giving up on life, so I've come up with workarounds to deal with it and make It as least painless as possible. Striving for a remote career that will support me until my passive income takes off, using said money to eat the best food, get hobbies, etc. No kids bc liability etc."
10489,I have before but the trick is just getting a different job if youre not happy.. go get a job at a fast food place while u find another job.. its like a reset button
10490,omg the surf shack dream is giving obama yass ~~immaculate vibes
10491,"Glad you got a job with reasonable hours!
I know lots of entry level CM jobs have nightmarish hours"
10492,That’s more of a project management (GC) side thing. Owners reps CM) are usually more of a regular 9-5 and no evenings/weekends like on the other side.
10493,As someone who is trying to go into that field. This was a real eye opener.
10494,"This person is not wrong. People demonize 9-5s. I do too lol, but in reality they aren’t the end of the world. Like this person said, as long as you love a self-fulfilling life, you’ll be fine. 

That doesn’t mean that you have to change the world or anything, simply find joy and be genuinely happy and you can still enjoy life with a 9-5."
10495,I think it may be worth considering you may be a project-based worker. I used to dread the thought of office life but engineering consultancy offices are quite different to what you're describing.
10496,Yeah it’s draining. Idk how I’m supposed to do this forever.
10497,"Honestly you just have to learn to love work, not what work you do. If it provides for you and keeps you from having to pave roads all day then it isn't all that bad. Just do what you love in your off time and know that you could always jump out on a limb and try to do something crazy like streaming/woodworking/photography etc full time once you get good at them. Being middle class just doesn't come free"
10498,"Most 9-5 jobs that require college education are just about trying to look busy. You actually work 1-5 hours and then go home. It fucking sucks. If you're paying me for the work that I complete, then let me go home once I'm done so I'm not wasting most of my day at this office."
10499,"I started to find it very draining about 6 months into my sales role at a startup. Thankfully I was pretty good at poker and got lucky enough to get funding so I now get to play poker for a living. My advice would be to really start thinking of a way to monetize a true interest of yours, or look for alternatives to the 915 grind, one of those could be seasonal work - where you could work a few months at a place like a national park, ski resort, lots of options, and then you could even take some time to yourself before your next job. Best of luck, just know you do have options even if people make it seem like you just need to learn to accept/like it. Sure; that’s one option that could be a useful coping strategy, but not the only option 

EVERYBODY WHO RELATES TO THIS THREAD SHOULD CHECK OUT TIMOTHY WARD ON YOUTUBE"
10500,this was why getting a WFH role was so crucial. my job isn’t very busy most of the time and i lost my mind when in office. then the pandemic started and we shifted to remote work and it makes all the difference
10501,"The first comment helps with boosting the spirits, it’s not just an optimistic point of view, it’s actual life experience and i think very reasonable advice"
10502,r/antiwork
10503,"After working several jobs that forced me to work 60-70 hours a week on my feet, a comfortable 9-5 with little to do would be a godsend. I agree that they are soul draining, but a good reprieve would be to have a side hustle that you enjoy more. My mom used to work a factory job that she hated, but on the weekends she sold fruit at the flea market. For me, I've got a little bookbinding business and I get to make books for a little spare change. I think that's how most people keep their sanity when working those incredibly draining jobs"
10504,The only thing I got from your comment is that you should find a different job lol.
10505,"I think it depends on your lifestyle and what job you're doing. Most places that have ""fixed"" hours like my office are 9-6 for starters (although we have a flex period for when we start and end, which is start anywhere from 7-10:30, leave from 3ish to 7 depending on when we start). That said, I personally prefer fixed hours, since I like the sanctity of having quitting time and separating my personal life from my work. I'd be going bonkers if I was always on call since I need the structure and the dedicated ""me time."" Like there is no way in heck I could be a free lancer, even as I know many in my profession who do that. 

Some people don't do well under routine and structure though. I think it's important to know yourself well enough to know how you work, as well as to recognize whether the structure of your work day is what you don't like versus the type of work itself. 

As far as being ""excited"" to say you work a 9 to 5 and that's the ""American Dream,"" I'd actually beg to differ in the assessment. You'd be right when we're talking about older generations. But amongst millennials and younger, honestly it seems like there's this constant focus on novelty in one's job, finding an unconventional or super prestigious career path, loving and finding fulfilling every moment of your work. 

Frankly people look at me like I have two heads with how linear and focused I wanted my career path to be in school- get your bachelors, go directly to grad school for my professional degree, then find a 9-6 job and immediately work towards licensure. A lot of people in our age group think I'm some robot or weirdo for not being super libertine and constantly seeking out new experiences, but there's something to be said for just liking order in your life. Plus I'm in a design field, so the nature of my work is already plenty of novelty for me. As far as I'm concerned, yeah I'd be miserable if I was a pencil pushing robot day in and day out. But I'd be equally stressed if I didn't have a very structured work day.

All this is to say is that it just depends on the person. I'd avoid comparing my job expectations to others though- that's a recipe for misery. Nothing wrong with liking or disliking the 9-5. What is wrong is deciding you should or shouldn't like it based on the people around you."
10506,I've been wondering if a majority of people feel this way for tech/software 9-5 jobs or any mid-upper level 9-5 hours where you're not doing THAT much work so you feel kinda pointless?
10507,"Do you have examples of other project based work? I’m a year into my current job already (BI analyst) and I’m starting to get bored. Working with the same colleagues, same data, same routine ☹️"
10508,"I work in tech and I’m mid-upper level, so that’s the perspective i’m bringing. I’m sure others may feel they contribute to something much larger than themselves but in my career that has spanned almost 20 years, I haven’t found it.

I think you may be on to something."
10509,"I'm not sure what project-based work someone with a background in BI gets into (not too familiar with the industry), but a general understanding of big data could lend you into modelling expertise in the engineering field (specifically for transport, working with AIMSUN models)."
10510,"Thanks, I’ve never thought of the engineering industry before. I’ll have a look into this!"
10511,"Wait wait wait... Who the fuck is being allowed to work a 9-5 shift? As in 8 hours including a paid break? What kind of magical anachronism is that shit?

It's 8-5 at any job this side of 2010 that I've ever heard of. If you're you're complaining about working 9-5 (aka an hour less than everyone) you're a fuggin prissy princess bitch.

Not even sure if /s

Edit: I forgot some people aren't American. Are you French? Scandinavian? I suppose it's really rough getting only 8 weeks vacation a year as well, huh?"
10512,I'm feeling pretty much the same way right now and I've graduated college
10513,"Man, I was in this exact position a year ago. Honestly, jt was a little scary at first. I’m currently attending a university an hour away from home. But I set up a system to call my mom for at least an hour every week to keep both her and me updated on life, and I made sure to text my dad as often as I could. The independence and boundaries formed by my experience has honestly helped our relationship grow stronger.

You’ve got this, OP. You can handle whatever life throws your way."
10514,I feel like this every single day. Wish I could go back
10515,Welcome to the real world. It will get better as long as you stay on top of things
10516,don’t forget to live in your present as well
10517,[deleted]
10518,You leave or you work in a meaningless depressed state forever like me!
10519,"Thanks man for the words. It’s tough, like I feel like shit every night I get out of work. But at the same time I’m thankful for the job. I’ve spent since January looking for a job and this is the one that I got. Not to mention the pandemic has made things complicated and a lot of people have lost there jobs. I may wine and bitch some times, but I’m sure as hell I ain’t giving in!"
10520,I was gonna try mushrooms but work has ruined those plans.
10521,"Most people I know who’ve worked hotel jobs (including me) list it as one of the worst they’d ever done. I used to work cleaning rooms in a hotel; it was my second ever job and because of the fact that you got paid per room you cleaned I usually made well below the minimum wage. Hotel work is ruthless and  unforgiving. 

I think just start applying for jobs that are completely different, even if you don’t think you’d get them. Hotel work is very different to say office work, retail, etc. But if you simply have to stick it out, maybe just have some indicator in your life reminding you of the date you’re gonna leave; maybe just get a countdown going and make a plan to hand your notice in 3 weeks in advance so there’s a light at the end of the tunnel there. You’ve got this! And congrats on you imminent departure."
10522,Crack a beer at the end of the day...
10523,"Thanks man! Honestly I’m giving it my all. I’ll check out therapy and see what the doc can recommend me. I won’t give up until I accomplish what I intend to do: saving up at least $1,500 and be on a one way ticket out of my country!"
10524,"Worst part of it is when you have to work back to back weeks with no days off. I was waiting for the weekend because I thought I was gonna get it off, but once I saw the new schedule... I felt deflated. The light at the end of the tunnel got pretty far away. 

And thanks for the kind words! I already have a somewhat of a countdown. That and my constant reminding of what I’m working are helping a lot. I’ll apply for other jobs to. Again, thank you and good luck to you too!"
10525,Do you think you could make a fundraising thermometer for savings goals? It helps me with student loans when I think I'm not making a difference.
10526,Do you have any hobbies? What calms your mind when you get stressed out?
10527,Probably better to just leave while you still have good connections. I stayed at a job I hated for to long once. It feels so good to leave and I'm in a way better place now.
10528,"The things I can’t do because of time. Playing video games, watching anime and stuff like that. I think I need new hobbies that don’t require a lot of time. Do you have any suggestions?"
10529,"That’s the attitude!  I know a lot of psychologists will disagree (since I don’t know shit about psychology) but I think giving into your frustration is a healthy part of coping with your pent-up anger.  Humans weren’t meant to just deal with shit (look up the frustration-aggression hypothesis).
It doesn’t matter where you are, as long as you’re actively moving forward.  Keep it up, you’ll get there eventually"
10530,"Well, that's rough. I'm going to echo a couple other posts and say that if something is costing you that much of your mental health, then it may be helpful to take a step back and assess all your opportunities. 

As for hobbies. First thing that comes to mind is writing and poetry. Your phone has a notepad, just jott down any random thoughts you have and when you have free time see how far you can take them.

And it's not really a ""hobby"", but something that used to help me was guided meditation. It's something that doesn't even have to take 5 mins and can help ground you (if anything). 

Hope that helps."
10531,"There's plenty of other jobs that are just as shitty as the one you're doing but you haven't done them yet.  Try finding another non-permanent job like the one you're in, it'll doubtfully be any worse."
10532,"Thanks a mil! I graduated college 3 years ago and after doing a lot of menial jobs in the time being I’ve wound up in an e-commerce job which, for the first time ever, I really like and have a lot of satisfaction in! 

It takes a while but I’ve no doubt you’ll find your nice. Similarly, I have friends who could never do the repetitive job I have and much prefer a high octane life in a restaurant or in a different customer facing environment but you’ll fall into a role you’re comfortable with eventually.

Good luck!"
10533,"That sounds like a good idea, but I doubt I can pull it off. My fam is in a tight spot and the pandemic is still a thing. But still, thanks. I’ll check it out just in case."
10534,"Glad to hear it man. I think I won’t end up with good connections, if any at all."
10535,😂Ice tea for me.
10536,It does and thanks. I’ve been wanting to start writing this little project I have on mind. And I check out meditation too. Again thanks for the recommendations!
10537,I moved out for the same(ish) reasons. Definitely worth not saving as much money
10538,If you're working full time I presume you can afford to move out? If it's negatively impacting your mental health as much as you say it is I recommend you move out.
10539,"well, thinking about it, the extra money does make the difference for me. If you dont mind me asking, how long have you been living at home?"
10540,"If you make enough money to help with the bills you make enough to move out. No amount of savings is worth your mental health. 

From my experience, during a 3 month period after college where I had to live at home my relationship with my parents got really, really bad. I figured out that I would never be seen as an adult if I was living in their house. Now that I live 1,000 miles away we actually get along pretty well. For me, the only way I’d ever move back home is if it was literally a binary choice between that and homelessness. YMMV, but that’s my experience."
10541,"Could move out definitely, but in my city rent is ridiculous on top of other bills and my loans I’d be having a rough time financially. Even if I got a roommate, it would still be rough and then dealing with a stranger..just sounds like more of a hassle than anything. That’s why Im trying to just save up as much as possible to just buy a home. But it is worth looking around for places just in case. Could find a good deal"
10542,~ 5 years. Probably buying a house in another year or so.
10543,"I’m in the same boat, but they make it to where I can’t save to move out. They force me to buy them things and buy groceries which then they won’t allow me to cook and they refuse to cook have the time. So then I end up buying everyone dinner because they would get mad at me if I don’t. So if you have the funds, move out. You don’t have to put up with the toxicity of that."
10544,"Yeah except a “stranger” is not going to care what you do with your life as long as you’re not a jerk to live with. 

Move out and only talk with your parents about the weather or other general topics. Visit for holidays if you want, but you’re an adult and so are they...... you’re allowed to have your own lives."
10545,Are you me? Same exact situation.
10546,"Ugh sorry to hear man. I hope things turn around for you, for the better"
10547,Virtual therapy has been huge for getting me through SIP/quarantine I highly recommend it! PM me if u have Qs
10548,"I’d put your mental health over finances. If you can tolerate this living situation, go for it, but if it’s driving you to see a therapist I don’t think it’s worth it. But that’s just my two cents."
10549,[deleted]
10550,Same
10551,Check your pm
10552,"I feel this, it’s been hard transitioning from college back to home. Planning on moving out one of these days. Hope things get better for you"
10553,"Im 24 and in the same boat, count yourself lucky you're finished college because I have one more year left and my mental health just gets worse and worse living here. so insanely toxic"
10554,"If your paying your share and you are a grown adult, why do they treat you with such disrespect and like you're a child? You should tell them how you feel, and if they can't respect you, then you should move out or atleast with a friend."
10555,"That last sentence really drove it home for me. Im too young to deal with this, I’ve got to appreciate and cherish my 20s not be miserable. You’ve really got me thinking man"
10556,What’s your job
10557,Familiarity breeds resentment
10558,"Hey man, listen. If you got the money it's not worth it to be unhappy just to save up some more cash. Rent out a small space for yourself, doesn't have to be expensive. Make sure you save up money with your lifestyle and other choices in general. Take the steps necessary to be happy!"
10559,"I guess they treat me like a child because I am their only child who still lives in the house. So they are quite protective over me and the disrespect part, I really don’t know. It’s not the environment I deserve to live in that is for sure. I’ll definitely have a conversation about that with them, because I have kept my feelings bottled up for some time. This post is the first time I ever really talked about it (hence why I wanted to start therapy)"
10560,"It's possible. One of the ABM's at the huge CPG I interned at had a masters in Biology. He got the job because he did a very general internship with them first and they were like, well, he knows the business so lets hire him for this open marketing role we have."
10561,"this might be a stretch but if you’re looking at marketing or graphic design, it might be good to consider roles or internships in social media. from what i’ve seen, because social media is pretty imagery heavy and since those teams tend to be smaller, it could be a good opportunity to try it out, network, and potentially leverage that experience to get the exact position you want. good luck!!"
10562,"I can't speak for your situation but I can speak about mine. I'm a mechanical engineer, or so I like to think, and I'm trying to switch into automation. Right now, every night on the weekdays excluding Fridays, I take an hour or two learning about programmable logic controllers and after certain courses, I list that course onto my LinkedIn sorta like a badge. I'm sure with enough courses I can get started in the automation industry. How did I start figuring out what courses to take? I looked at my mom's company which is a large factory and saw they had an automation engineering opening. I know I don't have the skills right now to even think of applying but the job listing posted their ideal candidate and the program languages expected for applicants to know. So right now, I am on a journey of teaching myself one of the programming languages. I think jumping to a different industry will take time and so I'm preparing myself to make that jump."
10563,"I mean you already have a biology degree going for you, so that’s great. I think it’s totally doable and comes down to how badly you want to switch and how lucky you get. 

I switched from teaching to financial planning. I didn’t have the technical knowledge but I think the following helped me:
•I paid for my own online coursework to show I was serious about making the switch
•I paid for and attended a financial planning conference
•I started working for a really shitty financial advisor doing paperwork and filing...for real she was crazy though. I was like any related experience is better than none. I brought up that I was trying to find a better opportunity than this at the conference (without overplaying it for sympathy) and I felt like it helped people want to find me a better role
•I joined as many financial planning related orgs as possible
•I asked for informational interviews - I just emailed people saying hello, I’m gabbi, I’m a teacher interested in becoming a financial planner, but I’m not sure what it really means to be one. would you mind setting up a quick call with me so I can learn what a financial planner actually does? — I have gotten a good amount of people to talk to me this way (I’m estimating at least 15+) and while I’m not looking for a new role now, there are a few who I think I could find a role with pretty easily 
•I have continued to pay for workshops/seminars to help me learn more technical knowledge 
•At another conference I went to, I was able to join a group that meets once a month to talk about industry topics and what they need help with/have questions on. This has been really helpful to gain insight into what people might be looking for when they hire me. 

I got lucky at the conference and I found a job as a part time intern at the first conference I went to (from just genuinely being curious about what other people did and sharing that I was changing careers) and accepted it to escape my real awful job (that I had only been at for a few months). At the conference I was offered An interview for a full time role but I would’ve had to move far, so I declined. After 3 months I was offered  full time role at a different company but liked where I was at (even though it was full time). The company I was part time at grew enough to be able to support me in a full time role after 6-7months and during that in between time I lived off of savings and did part time work elsewhere (that was still financial related to help me continue to gain experience).
I would be making more at the other company than I am right now but the quality of experience where I’m at is better, and it was a hard choice but I trusted my instincts. I had been planning to switch for about 6 months (the last 6 months of the school year lol) so I had saved up a fair emergency fund which really helped allow me to be somewhat picky. 

I hope this helps!"
10564,"I just graduated with a degree in marketing and it sounds like it would be a good choice for you. Degrees are pretty essential if you’re trying to get a nice paying job out of the gate but if you’re willing to do some dirty work, there would be plenty if companies who you could help for free on the side. It would add experience where education is lacking.

Also the good thing about marketing is that it is practically universal. If you have the right skillset, you can change to an industry that excites you. In your case medical marketing might fit cause of your bio degree. Medical jobs pay well too! Whereas a lot of other careers are technical are and take time, you can build experience with marketing and create proven results with enough effort.

Theres plenty of free courses like Google Skillshop and HubSpot to teach some basics and add something to your resume."
10565,"Seems like my best bet to get in environmentally with a company or non-profit and move around from there, that’s comforting to hear, thank you!"
10566,"I’ve been out of school eight years and very few of my jobs have had the same career path. I’ve worked in manufacturing, property management, and insurance.

My current company and the three previous ones were all places where I already knew someone.

So in my experience, just ask your friends."
10567,You can change whenever you want. Nothing is holding you back except yourself.
10568,"Hi! I am a graphic designer, illustrator and motion graphic designer professionally. I broke into the field by having internships in college, a good portfolio and networking. I also have a BFA in Illustration and Design. Let me know if you have any questions!"

10570,Right there with you man. Trying to find a way out of  editing right now
10571,"WOW! This is amazing. Good for you for doing all of that, and thanks for typing it all out. I am totally going to take the advice of reaching out to people in the field and setting up a call to speak about positions.. and your entire experience made me feel like it is doable. Because that is my biggest issue to overcome and my biggest paralyzing factor, that maybe I should’ve gotten a marketing degree and I thought I screwed myself by going the Bio route so it’s good to know that you can potentially completely switch careers without a second degree because I 10000% can not afford that right now."
10572,"Oh a career coach, I had never heard of that! Love that idea. I will be looking for one. Thank you for the link!"
10573,Working at a CPG is my dream!!
10574,"That is a great idea, thank you!!"
10575,"That is a great option too! And thank you for the specific course websites, I have been considering this and wondering which ones are good places to start."
10576,"This is so thorough thank you, I was wondering if that is my best first step, looking at something like skillshare or something similar to learn and build up some knowledge. Good for you for taking initiative to do all of that too! Starting is the hardest (for me at least)."
10577,"Amazing, I’m going to do that. I’ve told a few of them about this interest and they are creatives who either own their own small clothing businesses or they are artists themselves, they always boost me up but I think once I show them I’m serious about transitioning they would be able to help out in some way."
10578,"If I created things on my own, in addition to taking some online graphics classes to re-learn some basic graphic design skills, could I use these works in a portfolio that would actually be worth someone’s time to look at? Like if I created art/marketing content that was solving a hypothetical problem and presented that in a sort of portfolio of my work would that help chances at a job or do you think they would shrug it off? If that makes sense..."
10579,Lol thanks! And I’m happy you’re moving forward. I also definitely couldn’t afford a new degree and realized you really don’t need one 😀 good luck!! You can do it! It took me a long time but it’s worked out great. Patience is key haha
10580,Np. I read another comment and they said that they were switching out of creative. Creative jobs def are competitive and hard to land. But just thought to clarify that marketing is different from advertising. Uses a lot more critical thinking than design skills in terms of creativity.
10581,I like being lost at this age. Tried a lot of things Ive never done before. Its quite an experience.
10582,Appreciate the feedback :) I will make a video addressing your points. Thank you for the ideas!
10583,This!!!
10584,I so needed this. Thank you

10589,"If you are applying to lots of jobs and consider yourself lucky to get 1 response, then your resume isn’t as good as you think and you are learning the true value of a 4.0 gpa in the real world… which generally is “no one cares that much”. 
 
You should give it some time but at a certain point you may have to come to a decision about just finding a totally unrelated job with an actual career ladder to climb or doubling down on using this degree you’ve never actually applied in a full time salaried position."
10590,Any interest in marketing? A psychology degree puts you in a stronger position for marketing jobs than an actual marketing degree—particularly jobs related to market research.
10591,"Look into the field of business. We hire people with any degrees. A degree in psych could get you a job as a business analyst. Or HR! Especially HR! So many people in HR have so many different backgrounds. 

You could run the HR thing for 1-2 years until you find something more psych related, orrrr you could get in a company for 3-5 and run up $5750 in tuition reimbursement every year to pay for your masters 😉"
10592,I heard most physcology jobs need masters or PhD
10593,"PS, I worked 9+ years in food service, got my BA in psych, transitioned to health care and went from there."
10594,"Have you tried applying to your state agencies and even jobs within your city? Look into your state agencies usually they like to help students. You could probably get on with CPS or APS. Idk what state you are in or if you are even in the US, but if you are look into it. Most positions require bachelor's with state benefits. Also look into state mental health hospitals you could possibly look for care coordinator and case management positions."
10595,"I’ve looked into grad programs but I don’t want to get a degree just to get one. I felt like I got my bachelors for nothing in a way. I don’t know 100% what my end goal is right now. I totally understand what your saying though! thanks so much for the tip, i’ll definitely look Into it!"
10596,thanks so much! it’s sad but your right about the bachelors being like a high school diploma ):
10597,Abbreviations mean Child Protective Services and Adult Protective Services. You're welcome and good luck!
10598,"As the other commenter said, I'd consider grad school. I am sure there may be some tangential ways to use your psych undergrad. However, I believe to directly use your psych degree, you need to at least have a masters. The nice thing about psychology is there are many different ways you could go. Personally, Id do organisational psychology for masters. Take some time to look into how your degree can be applied. That way, you can get some ideas of where you want to go. Then you'll know if you can make a lateral move into a different job or if you need to go back to school to get into whatever your chosen career field is.

Stay at the job you have for now if you can. It's easier to get another job when you are employed. Speaking from experience. I do recognize that there are jobs that are so bad or toxic that you have to get out right away. Be careful not to make a move from one situation only to end up in an equally bad new job situation."
10599,thanks for the tips!
10600,"There’s usually plenty of jobs for Bachs in psych in research labs (non institutional ones) like places where they do randomized controlled trials or clinical drug trials. Research assistant work usually pays decently too once you work your way up. Other than that there are plenty of other jobs to look into since many jobs just look for college level education. Such as: copywriting, secretary/assistant work, marketing, etc."
