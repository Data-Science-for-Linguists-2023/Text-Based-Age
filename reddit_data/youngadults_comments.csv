13,"Why are you being booed; you're right.

DFAC food is sad (sometimes) but it's filling. Dorms are free. You can get around just fine even without a car; most bases have everything you need right ON BASE. You can always carpool with people and pay for some gas if you're not socially inept.

60,I felt this. I’m just gonna take my bag of Cheetos and hide all night...
61,Or also when you get home at night and parents aren't home yet. But you know they will be soon. So you rush to bed so you don't have to deal with the typical parents issues.
62,"Haha, I never left home"
63,"Heheheh... Yeahh... I do that way too often. I mean I'd try socializing with them, but just ehh..."
64,"So here's the thing, I moved out at 15 years old and was in my own apartment at 17. Ever since, I live paycheck to paycheck, drive a shitty car that is a giant money pit, and am in crippling debt. You better fucking believe if I had a better home life, I would STILL be living at home now, at 22."
65,Ik the pain
66,"I didn’t mean it disrespectfully I was honestly curious. I moved out as soon as I could, I couldn’t wait to start my own life away from parents and siblings. I understand the money part but I also don’t mind living paycheck to paycheck either if it wasn’t for  experimenting with drugs I’d actually have money sometimes but fuck it ha! I just don’t know many people with your mentality so I was genuinely curious most of my friends left before I did at 18 so I always wanna know about stuff like this! I just find it so weird honestly I think more old fashioned about some things"

71,I'm genuinely curious how somebody comes across a random 2 year old post from my hardly active account 😂
72,Why do you live with your parents still as a young adult is the better question
73,I don't remember the first one but I remember the  bottom two. I had teachers using the bottom left up till 10th grade.
74,Dude I had a teacher in 2nd grade named Ms Sprinkles. Nobody ever believes me
75,The one on top is a promethean board     And I remember the overhead projector being used by my US History teacher in highschool in 11th grade. I was surprised to see him use such ancient technology
76,I had a Ms. Cinnamon. Everybody asks if she was a stripper
77,Damn this is so true. Now my old school uses mostly 80 inch tvs
78,"2001 checking in, can confirm"
79,Don't forget the 90's kids :)

Fuck ME"
84,Remember when kids would argue over who got a turn to write on the smart board
85,2001 gang
86,I did this too it’s okay
87,"Damn. I forgot how annoying trying to the notes in my bio 11 class was thanks to the old overheads. My teacher had an affinity for only having each slide on the thing for about 30 seconds. And  before hed take it off for the  next one he would start adding things with a marker.

I remember when they renovated one side of one of the wings in my highschool and the classrooms went from old overheads, old brick walls, old windows, and green chalkboard, on one side of the wing, and right across the hall the classrooms had smart screens, new walls, new windows, new flooring, white boards, new desks, ect. It was a weird split of new age and stuff from 45 years ago"
88,"My math teacher uses his smart board every day. 

As a white screen for his overhead"
89,"Born 1994, so not really 100% 90s as a kid. but still remember those old projectors."

93,Dude I was born in 1999 and I still got to see a one or two in high school
94,Yea definitely
95,I had a Mrs. Anger and Mr. Art
96,"*congratulations, you’re part of the problem*"
97,It really be like that sometimes
98,Omg absolutely true
99,There was always one teacher that would say “guess it’s a not-so-start-board huh!” every time the smart board would be unresponsive
100,I was in that weird time where my teachers didn’t know how to use the newer projector so they just used the one with the big light!
101,I remember first seeing a smartboard in third grade in 2001 and most recently seeing an overhead projector in college in 2015. Those transparent sheets are still fun to draw on
102,Wth is the top one
103,Maybe in my youth but not in recent times

105,"Oh, I shit you not, there’s a good handful of people that do this on the daily AND believe it’s the superior way of living. Yeah, it may be convenient and may save water, but the SMELL.

121,I turned 20 a couple weeks ago and I still refuse to talk about it with my friends and family. The fact I can't legally drink in the US yet is making me feel somewhat better.

123,[deleted]
124,I turn 23 in two days and I still do this
125,I think I’ve been 18 years old for 4 years
126,Yes! I had someone accuse me of immaturity because I said I don’t relate to 30+ year olds (I’m in my mid 20s). That’s still a pretty sizable enough gap imo that I think not being able to relate is justified.
127,Fortunately I’m 113 years old
128,"I'm 20 but sometimes when they check my ID at places they'll ask my age, to try and fuck over the people using a fake ID, I'll sometimes forget and almost say 19 haha"

134,"I was playing an online game a while back when there was like a 14 year old boy on mic and I realised like a whole decade of culture has happened for those people and I can’t relate to him in any way. I have no clue what interests him or is popular.

He was super into memes and back when I was his age memes we’re sarcastic and stuff and he just genuinely likes them as a piece of media and I was dumb founded when I found out he wasn’t fucking with me."

152,"I get that there's a /s and all, but people will actually believe it, especially the kids who aren't supposed to be here. Also, I'm pretty sure that's just American capitalism"

165,"I don’t wanna brag but I filed my taxes for the first time last year so basically I’m an expert at being an adult

All I have to do now is figure out how to cure my overwhelming depression"
166,"Oh okay, you are pretty young I guess. I honestly consider adult as soon as you turn 18, but there are a lot of cultural differences that determines this. 

In Mexico you don't really move out until you finish your undergraduate's or you get married, but at 18 years old you're not a teenager, but at 17 you are even if you're in university. 

So I get what you mean, at first I though you were the same age as me or something, and the fact that we went to university made us not young adults."
167,"I kinda helped kick off the memes here if I say so myself.

My first meme here was kinda the top post here for like 3 months straight 😎"
168,now instead of that I get to rant about how I’m in college to have a life after college even though I’m probably not suited for college.
169,"Yeah I'm a junior in high school, but at community college full time because of this program at my high school. I'm only here because r/teenagers went to shit."
170,"Nah I feel it


After spending so much time around “functioning” “adults” my own age group tends to pain me..."
171,"I usually would say ‘fuck it C’s get degrees’
but then I’m only able to go to college cause of scholarships I lose if I go below an 85 in anything whatsoever"

173,sometimes it be like that
174,"Not quite the same, but this reminds me of when I got to the 6th grade and started middle school, moved to a different school system partway through the year where 6th grade was still in Elementary school, I was back to having recess, and I absolutely hated it. Like all my peers were my age still, but 4 months into middle school, being mingled with grades 1-5 again and having recess with them was hell."
175,"You're doing dual enrollment I assume, honestly fuck it we ain't judging, we struggle collectively."
176,Ngl....I definitely downloaded Minecraft for the first time as a 21 year old........ but I just use it to cope with the crippling stress of two jobs and full time university
177,I’ve gotta get into a Physicians assistant program which is competitive as hell and I need straight A’s and a high GPA to stand a chance in getting into. Not to mention scholarships will make college a bit cheaper lmao
178,Stay with your parents as long as you can cause once you move out that's it unless they're nice enough to take you back. I've been flatting since I think July now and am going to try and move back with my Grandparents because the place I'm living in turns out it sucks and I need more time to sort my my shit out without going mad
179,If your 19 then your still a teen technically. However the line is kinda blurry.
180,">All I have to do now is figure out how to cure my overwhelming depression

181,Dual enrollment but not doing the high school part gang?

185,"if you get your degree than it’ll be like you’re constantly doing work for only the single hardest class in your major, constantly, for less time a day with no work at home, so a bit better I think."
186,"Well yes but actually no, I’m doing dual enrollment but skipping the HS part. Is weird 

But yep. The struggle with grades is eternal"
187,Feel that. Wake up every morning like “maybe I’m not smart enough to pass with all A’s”...
188,"I just got out last week, I'm 23 and definitely feel like I'm wasting my time but like, fuck it lmao"

203,Hahahah
204,"I got tons of vaccinations in basic training, I'm still alive almost 20 years later. 

If anything, the needles full of uncle Sam's jungle juice have made me less likely to be sick during a given winter cold and flu season.  

Good for you, it warms my heart to see a young adult taking responsibility for themselves and practicing good self care."

Bro, don’t worry about how you look rn. Have fun and be confident. I like to throw on my earbuds and skate publicly and when I’m listening to Metallica and hear a sick ass riff I pretend guitar with my board and rock out in broad daylight on the sidewalks listening to sick ass solos. People look at me like I’m fucking crazy but I don’t fucking care. I spent my entire middle school and highschool years caring what people thought how they viewed me. Trying to be like the next person, I’m not the next person I’m ME. I’m free, I have no kids, none of that, I can do wtf I want.

Enjoy yourself, love and respect yourself."

I have a friend who will have their Master's next year whereas I struggled to finish my undergrad on the better side of 5 years.  But then, lots of my friends didn't even go to college.  Lots of them are still living with their parents.  Some are married, and shit, some are *divorced*.

And I realized as I was thinking about all this that I wouldn't respect any of them any less for the paths they've taken since high school.  They're doing alright.  So why should I let my own path affect my respect for myself?  I'm doing okay, I'm living my life and I'm being who I am."

I, on the other hand:

•still live at home

•am broke

•still have one more year (hopefully) of college

•am single

•feel like 30 is creeping towards me already

•don’t know how the hell to even exist let alone get my life together amidst a PANDEMIC"
380,Tell me about it! I sometimes wish I could stop time and move on my own pace
381,"Keep that mentality. It’s very easy to compare yourself to others. Especially if your parents had a habit of comparing you to their friends kids. “So and so is going off to do this” Cool. Their journey. Not yours.

385,"Absolutely you can. We all get so stressed and forget there is no timeline for life on what should be completed by when. If you finish college/start that career by 22, awesome! If you finish by 30, cool! Everyone has their own personal path and not everything works out right away, we'll be fine."
386,"brooo, feeling this sooo badly rn. I need help."
387,I always feel like I’m running out of time! Glad I’m not the only one
388,22 and I can relate. I’m just gonna blame being behind on college on COVID now

400,I've heard back from one job this summer. And it was just a rejection.

405,Ok nvm it makes sense now lol
406,"the entirety of their COVID relief is a $600 cheque. I think they had one near the beginning of the year as well, but that's it. Meanwhile in AU I'm getting $750 a week in Job-keeper, and I'm pretty sure you get $500 a week if you lost your job :/"
407,So as a non american thats out of the loop whats going on with the 600 dollars?
408,"Even if they are pretending they are certainly fighting a lot harder for more stimulus money. 

Republicans don't give a shit and are actively shooting down stimulus money unless it gives a lot to big wealthy corporations. Dems aren't perfect but I'm gonna say they are more right than the Rethuglicans."
409,[deleted]
410,"Ayyy a meme about my situation...


Yay...


Ima go cry now"
411,Don't be diluted — Democrats have been trying to pass $2000 since May. Take the both sides shit and stuff it.
412,"I earned too much for my parents to claim me, but I didnt know that. So I put that they claimed me. So I get jackshit, even though the 2 stimulus checks would have been really valuable."
413,"In April-ish, (almost) every American that filed taxes received a one-time $1200 stimulus check. This was very well-recieved publicly. Congress has been negotiating a 2nd relief bill for some time now, and Sunday night they finally agreed to pass a $900 Billion piece of legislation that offers an additional $600 per taxpayer. 

A big problem people have with this bill is that the check makes up less than 25% of the cost of the bill. Most of the money is going to foreign aid and businesses. That's not to mention the fact that $600 does not have the spending power one would need to get through the next couple of months. For example: Our electricity, water, and TV bill will be $450 this month.

After Congress passes something, it has to be signed by the President or else the bill fails. There is technically a way that the bill can still pass, but ~~I can count on one hand the amount of times that's happened in 250 years~~ this doesnt happen very often. Where it stands now, Congress has passed the Stimulus, but Trump won't sign it, saying that it does not offer enough support to people, and he said he will only sign a ""suitable"" bill. By this he means he wants less foreign aid included, and he wants individuals to get $2000, rather than $600.

That's the facts, but my opinion is that I actually support Trump on this. I have been very opposed to him since before he was elected, but putting the people's interests first is surprising to me. I personally think that if he gets his way on this, then we will see a big shake-up in public opinion about how the government can serve it's people instead of [insert bad things US does here]"
414,Don't know why you're being downvoted since you're now my significant other. Thanks babe :*
415,the downvotes were worth it babe #justrelationshipthings
416,"The six figure analogy isn’t quite true; you only get the $600 if your income in 2019 was $75,000 or less."
417,"Okay but to be fair, Americans who lost their job are eligible for unemployment, which depending on the state is like 200-600 a week depending on regional cost of living. Some states boosted their unemployment rates for a while during the pandemic as well, but I believe that money has run out. 

This is extra dumb, because uncle Joe of Uncle Joe's pizza and subs, who has been struggling to stay open, gets 600 dollars, and someone who makes 6 figures and is generally unaffected by the pandemic also gets 600 dollars. 

But this 600 dollars of federal money, so ots different.  But they've been arguing about it for 6 months, heaven forbid they pass something before the election."
418,hi. commenting on your post. are we dating now?

421,Heh relatable
422,"> There is technically a way that the bill can still pass, but I can count on one hand the amount of times that's happened in 250 years. 

It seems you have many hands then, there were 111 times where the veto was overridden by congress. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_vetoes)"
423,"I couldn’t even get unemployment because my boss kept me on the books even though he didn’t have me working. Luckily there’s lots of people here offering jobs. I feel bad for my friend though, he lost his job and was getting unemployment then got his call pay (<$1000 for the year) from the fire department and the state cut him off. 

Being under 18 none of us get the stimulus which is just awesome."
424,"Doesn't Germany get ⅔ off your bad salary each month? Or was it another country?

The US for you fucked up my dudes"
425,Wow wtf you can do it to other people but I do it to you and I get told to die
426,Same 😐 so you mean to tell me that most likely it'll be the same situation this time around? I was literally laid off BECAUSE OF Covid. I've been struggling since April. Fuck the government.
427,Oof. I hope you are at least in a place where people respect your pronouns... be safe and happy holidays.
428,"Technically this really shouldn't be the case. If you live on your own for more than half the year and provide more than 50% of your own support, your parents can't claim you. If her parents provided the support for her then it makes sense that they would be the one's getting the money and not her."
429,"If what you're saying is true then you should contact your state's department of labor. If he kept you on the books for the sole purpose of not giving you unemployment and you weren't actually working, then you should still be able to qualify. This is especially true if your hours were adversely effected."
430,"I don’t think it’s necessarily Trump “putting the people first,” but rather knowing a $2000 check for will be popular bc money and the $2000 checks serving as a fuck you to Mitch McConnell after McConnell refused to jump on the “overturn the fraudulent election” train."
431,"I encourage everyone to do their own research and not take my word for it, but people in this situation should still be able to get their stimulus on their 2020 tax return. I don’t have an official source, but this is according to my tax accounting friend"
432,"Eh, I’m not gonna jam him up, I got two other jobs on top of that place during the lockdown and he kept my job when the lockdown lifted. Not like I get many hours there anyway (I’ve done like 8 a weeks max but sometimes it’s so slow I don’t even have to go in)"

438,Buying a Switch is always the right answer. I love mine
439,Yes.
440,"So feel the same, except I'm neither going out to eat, nor do I buy a console. I literally just save my money, thinking about what to buy, then not buying anything. I so want to play the new Fire Emblem , but at the same time I know that's kind of the only game I really want to play nowadays, and I can't get myself to buy a console just for it, even if I wouldn't spend my money on anything else."
441,don’t please
442,Not knowing what to buy is better than not being able to afford what you want
443,"~~I love it too,seeing gameplay on YT is fun~~"
444,"If it helps at all, my and my GF bought a switch together and so did my group of friends.

My friends have all sold their switches, and I have mine, but it just collects dust on my shelf until a new zelda/mario game comes out.

There is a lot of hype for them, but I'd say if you have literally any other console or a PC, you'll likely play those after the initial switch hype is gone.

&#x200B;

For me at least, I paid $300 plus $120 to play Mario and Zelda. And for some god awful reason I'm paying 25 a year to play NES games I could literally play on my phone."

450,I bought a switch over groceries one time..

452,When I got my first job I sank every penny into a nice gaming PC and now I haven't had to upgrade for 4 years so far. The initial investment was worth it.

I played a bit of Zelda on my friends switch and it was incredible"

543,???
544,Kim?
545,mood
546,Me
547,"Can relate, but I'm 21, and I live with my parents because I don't know how to live apart from them :("
548,"On a positive side, you don’t have to worry about rent, food and other necessities because you live with your parents. Enjoy this while you can, we’re gonna spend 80% of our lives in our own places anyway."
549,"Only in my first year of uni but with the crazy costs of rent in my city and lack of resolve to move away to anywhere further in the future, absolutely makes this seem like a prophecy"
550,Its very normal for us Indians. Infact it's not uncommon to live with the parents even when one gets a job. The same exists in a lot of other Asian countries.
551,"I have in person classes but still live with my parents. My major costs wayyyy too much money and I would rather not spend an extra $12,000 each year for room and board."
552,Me but 21
553,Kim possible? Yea
554,🤝
555,"Nooo, i want his gold"
556,This is interesting
557,uuhm idk
558,As seen by this post lol
559,I only noticed I got one when I got on Reddit this morning and my homescreen was black instead of white lmao
560,"Sadly, I think even he gave up at this point. 

I wouldn’t be completely hopeless though. The addicts usually come back every time, however briefly."
561,Sknots
562,Link?
563,"Oh we're talking about that guy?

Yeah, absolutely. He wasn't even subtle about his cult-esque beliefs"
564,oh i got mine
565,I never got a gold
566,It was my first too
567,"honestly who cares about gold, I got it a few times and it does absolutely nothing"
568,It’s called “Exploring a Reddit Cult” by Barely Sociable
569,stop calling me out lol
570,I'm a month behind and exams are coming up so yeah i'm going to fail and it's my own fault too
571,"Holy shit when are your exams? You got to take out the three days on the weekend and do nothing but work. You don't want to fail dude, don't accept that"
572,I'm not 18 how do I edit this
573,I’m failing math because of this. Thank god for pass/fail.
574,Put me out of my Missouri
575,Finals are next week and I'm behind on 7 weeks worth of classes (my terms are only 10 weeks) fml
576,Currently on my 3rd out of 5 lectures in a row so I can actually understand my homework due tonight🙃
577,I don’t even bother watching them. I just wing myself through the open note quizzes and pray the final is also open note
578,I prefer to watch at 2x speed anyway. One time I joined class live and was so fucking confused why my professor was speaking so damn slowly before it hit me
579,english 1A and 91 right now 😑
580,"In January, but they're giving me a lot of tasks too so I need my weekends for that rn"
581,bring me the CEO of Reddit.
582,Run from it
583,That boi left
584,Are you corona-proofing actual Reddit?
585,Destiny still arrives
586,Do update how it goes! And have fun!!
587,Please tell u/spez that I have banned him from every sub Reddit
588,Where are the Reddit admins. Give this guy free merch or something.^(/s)
589,CEO of Racism
590,"I am now chilling at home browsing Reddit. Regular 8 hour shift tomorrow, hallelujah!"
591,have fun friendo
592,"nice, i remember your post"
593,16 hours wtf?
594,"> Gayage

I see you're a mod as well"
595,All the same
596,Have fun mate
597,Im proud of you
598,[deleted]
599,Very complicated way of phrasing things but you do you
600,Did you make him have 1 baby hand?
601,"I am a romanist, papist"
602,no
603,wow there are memes yes.
604,Pope Benedict or Pope Francis
605,XD
606,"I'm raised as Romanist, papist by my family

my family is romanist papist"
607,As a papist I just want to know the consensus
608,?
609,Who are you to call me a non papist
610,Big if true
611,You are no such thing.
612,Why are you asking?
613,You were raised as a Papist? That's cool. I converted on my own. The only Catholic in my family. A loyal papist for life
614,"You are no papist. But to answer the question, it is hard for me. Pope Benedict was more conservative but way more controversial. Pope Francis seems a bit more liberal, but also has a better image. I like Pope Benedict very much, but he was the leader of the Congregation for the Doctrines of the Faith, where he received and investigated child abuse cases personally. I hope it does not turn out to be so, but there is some chance he might have either covered some of it up or maybe not acted urgently enough. So, it's tough"
615,"You are mocking me being a papist, probably. If it is not so, I apologize"
616,[deleted]
617,Just had my first class literally 10 mins ago. I'm in danger
618,It’s nice not having school. It’s less nice not having summers off.
619,tfw you're late for work instead
620,[deleted]
621,"Fellow recent grad reporting to say boo ya!

Now let's just not talk about job searching or anything. Not important at all."
622,[deleted]
623,*cries in grad/med school*
624,"Congrats that's awesome!

I honestly haven't started looking. Was lucky enough to get through college debt free and actually save enough money that I could take time off. Have spent the summer road tripping and relaxing and the such. Unfortunately job opportunities are starting to present themselves and the amazing time of relaxation will be coming to an end quite soon"
625,Then realizing you still go to college
626,"Then it gets worse...


YOU'RE A TEACHER"
627,Hey you got this! One day you'll be laughing at the fools like me while you sit on your stacks of cash with a happy life full of accomplishments:)
628,Just a few more decades....we'll get there.
629,It's a set date for a lot of schools/countries I guess? All universities in the Netherlands start the first Monday of September.
630,[deleted]
631,On my second week on college rn 💀
632,"What is this, i'm a young adult"
633,[deleted]
634,"I never work any earlier than 2pm (well, unless I do overtime) and it's bliss getting a lay in every single morning"
635,Then you realize you’re Kakashi and you go back to sleep
636,"Damn your highschool started at 7? My college starts at 8, HS at 8:30"
637,I normally start at about 11 so it's pretty good anyway.
638,I'll have my first class in 11 days
639,I see you like Bo too
640,I swear the universe picked the worst possible year for me to graduate. Between this and COVID I might as well just collect unemployment insurance.
641,This is me but in college applying for internships
642,"Applied to 60 internships, heard back from 5 (all rejections). I have a 3.8 GPA in the University of Illinois accounting program. Really don’t know what else to do lol. Guess I’ll update my LinkedIn again!"
643,Absolutely love this.
644,I've been in this situation for the better part of last year. Just keep trying. Or call to the companies you applied at for a job. Worked for me.
645,i got rejected from starbucks though
646,"I'm so tired of the notifications from indeed and LinkedIn. 

""_____ wants to hire you!""

No...no they don't. Thanks for the encouragement, but you're straight lying."
647,Bruh. I'm 0/3 so far and thought I was doing bad.
648,Best of luck to you man
649,A McDonald’s branch never contacted me after my interview.
650,I'm 3.6 average GPA so not as good but still up there. Applied for about the same amount and heard back from only 1. I got an interview for that one but was rejected within the same day afterwards. I've got only 1 more year to get an internship before I am supposed to graduate and an internship is required.
651,Pick your major wisely friends. Work hard to get a good GPA. These two things will make or break you I promise.
652,I have a brief internship which will last until late August...but after that I’m going back to school with online classes. (This is a two year college)
653,During a pandemic.
654,Jesus man
655,Yall gotta start going into trade jobs - the need is growing and so is the pay not to mention like 2 yrs of  school
656,"My brother builder 
My sister can't remember but it sounds awesome
Me Burger King :( I feel lime the underdog of the family I'm smart but not smart enough for WORK"
657,"While there are guys who gets hired at a good company and has sex with the bosses hot daughter, learn game. r/pickup"
658,"Ahh yes, and maybe I wouldn’t have gotten kicked out from turning 18 lmao."
659,Oh man I felt this one deep in my soul.
660,"Help, it starts in a month and I've built up so much about it in my head. When it'll inevitably go not as planned, I'll just feel horrible afterwards."
661,Trust me its not as fun as it looks (at least for me anyway). Take this last year and use it to really prepare yourself or it will be a stressful mess
662,"whatever happens, happens. sometimes you just gotta say fuck it."
663,For me being at uni is infinitely more fun and less stressful than being at home
664,"I’m having a good time so far, classes are rough but I like the feeling of being away from home for a while. I’m also close enough so that I can go home any time but I haven’t yet"
665,I start Wednesday. **Fear**
666,"College is what you make it. I fucked up my first year socially and almost academically. Here’s my advice, get a good academic cycle going first; get comfortable with your classes, do homework and learn which classes you need to study for. Then you can start worrying about the social aspect of it, going out to parties with friends etc. Most importantly though GO TO CLASS. It will become way too easy to tell yourself you can skip classes here and there but unless you have a medical reason or some equally as important do not skip, attendance is the best way to succeed academically, I learned this the hard way."
667,Why?
668,Its true
669,December for me!
670,Same. 2 weeks into December
671,Atu. you?
672,Nice.
673,Me too
674,"Yeah that's true, I guess you just gotta' try with things, and at the same time, just not try as hard to just make sure things go as well as they can. I kinda' gave up in high school, and I'm just going to try not to do that. I don't know, hoping for the best sounds like an okay idea."
675,CU
676,"As much as I appreciate the advice, it seems odd to me that the first thing you mentioned after moving out is getting a girl pregnant"
677,I don't think you understood the humor behind this post
678,"No bb for me, at least I hope not"
679,**This** is true man. Adulthood **Is** supposed to be **a** time to continue to learn. **Shit** is fine when you are in your **Post** teens.
680,"Yeah this attitude is really fucking stupid. I reckon it's mostly a joke but even then, bloody hell."
681,That weird transition phase Is what college and/ or Working at a tattoo parlor is for. Maybe  Learn to play an instrument( Guitar is usually easiest) It can  help get you through that weird  Period in life Where you aren’t a kid anymore but not quite an adult in your mind yet.
682,Oh get a grip
683,College is dumb like that man. I took an intro course that turned into something way above what I was told it would be. Things will get better it just can take a while.
684,Holy shit mate use some periods and line breaks.
685,"I meant the original post btw, not yours, just so you know."
686,I can't really put a time stamp on it because at the end of the day it's up to you to look for the opportunities to make things better
687,"Yeah you do you of course, but it being legible helps a ton if you want people to read it."
688,"turned 18, everything was fine, I graduate hs, bittersweet, start college, suddenrky hate my life, hate my school. my highschool side job is now my favorite escape from soing studying and homework 24/7 other than the little sleep I got. It’s rediculous how little we actually learn compaired to the work thrown at us, it’s horrible and I regret going to college in the first place. 

It’s a scam and I hate myself for being too poor to go to school elsewhere, unable to drop out and start a life because I would fuck myself over by doing so. I am unable to take a gap because my mom would lose child support and without financial aid I’d be unable to attend anywhere.  The pressure of not knowing if I will actually like my career until my 3rd year when I actually get to take a course in my major, teaching, let alone get experience.  I need to do this for an Accelerated 5 year masters program taking 2 labs every semester and being completly fucked over in terms of every aspect of my life. 

With my friends all far away saying im over reacting cause college for them is easy, the pressure that I might not be able to handle it and actually just being stupid. I didn’t have to study at all in highschool and now it’s not studying, but the workload that is so ridiculous. I’m thinking of the: ‘if that car were to swerve and it my I’d be ok with it, id get a break from school, or never have to go back’, constantly feeling stupid, an anxiety attack every other week, loss of self esteem, and weight gain. 

I was a social varsity athlete and now have no time to excersize, and dieting is near impossible with a college lifestyle. I get no sleep due to shitty train schedules and shitty times 3 hour long classes, let alone losing sleep due to anxiety driven insomnia. 

With a prof rambling on about random bullshit like music videos in an english based class, or a prof with a 100% online class we have to commute for the prof to sit and use his phone the whole time, and when out for religious obligation had a substitute prof instead of having the ONLINE class be done ONLINE from HOME, another history prof repeating stuff we learned in 11th grade, while giving us textsbooks to just read on out own, not giving, but making us buy 3 books we will only use for 2 papers, and english class eith a horrible prof that threw near temper tantrums and I had to withdraw after having an anxiety attack in class. 

I feel that everything in this world is against me and I honestly the only reason I care that I don’t die is because other people would be sad. my life went from 100% an amazing thing that I loved even the bad parts of. 
This spiraled down to the best part being a weekend I get to get a slightly less unhealthy ammount if sleep and maybe squeeze in eating a meal with my family rather than working or doing homework. 

I’m a slave during the semester and constantly stressing about it now. probably not the right place to put this but probably a cry for help, what do I do in this situation. However,  maybe I just had a horrible semester but next has more classes and more work and harder work because it’s for my major, (bio edu).

Yes I got a 4.0 but that is because everything was easy, there was just way too much of it and the commuting and staying at school next semester from 9-6 not to mention the out of school work is going to be the death of me, I almost hope I get drafted from Iran and get shot so I have an excuse to not go to college."

690,WAAAAAAAAAAAA
691,Lol
692,Bruh this is an old ass shitpost
693,Wut
694,Okay
695,"tha ks man, but how long is a while?"
696,it was an emotional rant if u want I’ll go and double check my writing.
697,Its wario
698,Oh right
699,is that a bit better for you? hopefully it helps
700,Is that you in the bottom right?
701,SIMPLY AWESOME
702,I remember when I did this by accident once in high school and basically had to fend off an army
703,Build the helicopter?
704,Accurate
705,Yeah it's a deep face of mines
706,Deep face? U mean deepfake?
707,I'm at this picture and I don't like it.
708,Bruh I'm starting to think I have ADHD
709,Don't worry u will have a longer list of regrets later.
710,This is me at this exact moment
711,"And here I thought I was just a procrastinator throughout all of college. This term ""duality of man"" sounds much better! Thank you!"
712,Oof ouch my grades
713,"Just do what I did, drop the classes"
714,this is me rn procrastinating by going on reddit
715,Get out of my head
716,"And not making dinner because that’s time that I *know* I can’t be studying so I don’t do that either but I continue to just not do shit. Three things I’ve learned to help with this:

1) have someone else keep you honest. Tell them to remind, or prod you about getting ___ done, whether it’s a paper or a group assignment or setting up a doctors appointment or applying for that job. That kind of peer pressure usually helps me. 

2) stemming from 1, go to a different environment. I always found it way easier to get work done at the computer lab or the library, than I could in my dorm. That kind of passive peer pressure, people seeing you not working when you’re in a place that you should be working, helped keep me on track. Everyone needs breaks, but being on my phone for too long always made me feel guilty. Not a great way to get yourself to do your homework, but it’s better than nothing. 

3) and if you really just can’t get any work done, and you’re just spiraling into anxiety and panic, just stop. Tell yourself “I’m not getting this done, and I know I’m not going to get this done. I’m not going to stress about this any longer, and I’m acknowledging that I’m putting this aside until a later time. For now (whether that’s a few hours, or the rest of the night), I’m not going to worry about this, and I’m going to relax.” Sounds like procrastination, but acknowledging that you aren’t going to get it done, despite how much you’re trying to force yourself, can really help your mental health. Take a breath, push it out of your mind until the next morning, and rest easy

Oh, and if you struggle with this like me, you still need to eat! It’s entirely acceptable, nay, entirely normal and expected, to stop studying to make food for yourself. You won’t function without energy! Wether it’s taking an hour to make homemade chili, making Mac and cheese really quickly, just a meat and cheese sandwich, or hell, a bowl of cereal, getting some food is important. It’s more important than studying, and it’s more important to eat something that stress about eating something super healthy and dinner like—obv an assorted bag of Halloween candy isn’t a good idea. But it can be as simple as instant oatmeal, something to give you some good energy"
717,I see myself in this picture and i don’t like it
718,I just joined this group and I already love it.
719,"I miss having the entire life ahead of me, to be fair"
720,"Teen yrs suck lol. Teen yrs are just about learning and getting the skills you need to be successful as an adult. Being a young adult is just putting those skills in place and acting on them.

I'll take being 20 over being a teen anytime."
721,Dude the last time I was happy that I could relate with 12 year olds was when I was 12 lol. It's not normal nor healthy to look back and want to be younger again as much as you do.
722,"Well, my teen years are almost over"
723,"Yes, but at 20, you are at a different stage of your life. You are already very well aware that aging is not some distant thing that affects ""other people"""
724,I'd much rather deal with all the struggles of being an adult then go back to being a teen. Being a kid was cool but there is a lack of freedom and then I'd have to go through my teen years again. Fuck that.
725,"No sure your point exactly, you're again your entire life. 20 most certainly isn't considered ""old"" and you definitely shouldn't be worried about aging."
726,But you are not a kid anymore. You look at 12 year olds and feel sad how you no longer relate as well as you used to
727,Me too :-( Why do the years go by so fast?
728,"Forever young.   
  
I what to be forever young"

730,Eh still would take adult over teen. I'm much more happy now then I ever was back then.
731,My youth is slipping by so quickly and even if I try to enjoy what I have left there’s no denying that I’m growing up
732,"I'm 21, I still have plenty of life to live and plenty to learn with the experience I already have."
733,Yeah... It just eats me up from time to time. Time really flies
734,Sucks
735,you’re 16 lol
736,Lmao you’re basically still a kid then
737,I've experienced a lot of new things in my life that I didn't think I'd experience when I was a teenager. Gotta keep your head up m8
738,At least you are stil cute
739,I’m 28 and I fucking feel this in my bones
740,"Well, under different circumstances, WITHOUT restrictive parents, it would be nice to be younger. You get it?"
741,Me too
742,No u
743,U cute
744,You say this but I've already tried to end it a few times now.
745,"Hey dude, I hope you find the hope you deserve, we are too young to give up on all of this. I don't know your struggle but I believe, even if it's too naive, that even our suffering is something worth experiencing, such is the paradox of humanity."
746,"Sure, but sometimes it sucks when I look at a 12 year old and just no longer seem to relate with them. It is as if they are a different generation. And then I remember being 12 and seeing 21 year olds as grown, and knowing that is how those 12 year olds must see me... You get my point"
747,"They are a different generation, it's hard to relate to them. But hey, I relate with your anxiety so we kinda have that?"
748,"Actual Speech 100. Seriously though, inspirational"
749,">Make sure you don’t mess around too much your first semester.

Can't emphasize that enough. I took my first semester seriously and I passed with pretty decent grades.

Many of my friends did not take it seriously, got depressed/fat, and barely passed. If you're drinking on a Tuesday night, it's time to reevaluate how important college is to you. 

You can party, but probably stick to the weekends"
750,"I thought Wyoming didn't exist?

JK, congratzzz, what ya gonna study?"
751,It really depends on how you deal with things though. I’m at McGill and we have a huge work hard play hard mentality with a lot of kids going out more on weekdays (literally Tuesday through to Friday are huge party nights) then on weekends. As long as you prioritize your studies and put that before partying you’ll be fine. I know far too many kids who shut themselves out of everything and don’t have balance in their lives.
752,The world needs more cowboys
753,You enter your real life when you move out on your own and realize you have to buy all the stuff you've taken for granted like toilet paper and shit.

Cheers from a Freshman at ~~a less shitty version of BU~~ Northeastern!"
773,"Not gonna lie, at the end when it said congrats for being accepted to UW I read it as UWU"
774,If only it was United Wyoming University (UWU) I’ll see myself out. But happy to hear!

779,"No joke, last year on my birthday for some reason I was like ah yes, I'm finally going to be 18, wait no! I'm turning 20....yeah took me two wrong answer for me to finally realize that I'm turning 21. I feel like a 17 yrs old trapped in 21 yrs old body and with extra responsibilities."
780,I’m turning 20 on monday like wtf. I was 18 yesterday it feels
781,"I was just in the middle of a conversation when I realized, I'm not in puberty anymore.

It felt so weird realizing that."
782,"For some reason, I keep thinking I'm older than I'm actually am. I once told someone that I was 24 when I'm 21. Idk."
783,I was 18 yesterday too. And I've just turned 23. Time really does speed up. :(
784,"I'm about to turn 21 this uear and its like damn, I feel like I grew up too quick"
785,"I won’t ever get to do this math formula. 2000 babies have it easy lol. If it’s before my birthday, I take a year from the current year (21-1= 20). After my birthday, my age is the year"
786,"I turned 20 in December and so far it still feels the same as being 16-19, but people respect you a bit more."
787,I turn 22 this year and I feel like I haven't changed a bit since I was 18 LOL
788,24 and still feels weird to say it
789,Wait til y’all are 25
790,I feel so young but too many of you guys I’m hella old
791,This is why I actually think minors should be <21. You’re still an ignorant kid and even me being 23 I have a lot of growing still. I barely know how to use the washing machine. It takes a while every time I get back to campus to figure it out again since they’re different than at home.
792,"I agree on that remark 18-21 has lot of growing left to do, and not even then done with growing up. but then I concur that Im glad that minor is not 21 & below, because I was able to rent my own place at 20 and finally escape from my toxic family because of that."
793,Do you have to know everything before you are considered an adult tho? I feel like at 18 most people know enough to get by and they won't grow up much until they are 21. Being able to use a washing machine is imo not an indication of being an adult. Just of your parents teaching abilities
794,At 19 I was just as much of a child as I was at 16. I was just less Chringy. If I was thrown onto the street I would not have been able to take care of myself.
795,No expects you to take care of yourself at 18 either. You can choose to do that because you have the right but you don't have to.
796,That’s my point though how is 18 so different from 17 that you can be kicked out by your parents and have no way of fending for yourself?
797,"But why would 21 be any different than that?

Apart from the fact that in the first world (maybe except for the us) this won't happen. In Germany If your parents kick you out the government provides for your well-being and your first Job education. Be that a craftsmanship oder a university education"
798,"I don’t think that’s a good argument. Of course a 21 year old still doesn’t have things figured out, but they’re a hell of a lot more developed than an 18 year old. You grow so much in those years."
799,Well there you go! It’s super creepy adults can prey on 18 year olds cause they’re ‘legal’ also. Lots of reasons to raise the age.
800,I feel like it depends. I enjoy the low voting age in Germany. As well as the more liberal alcohol laws. I'd much rather have controlled alcohol consume than try to drink in secret for the young guys
801,Once grades are in I can’t wait to turn off canvas notifications for a bit .. there’s nothing worse than thinking you’re done and you finally have air to relax and then BAM teacher adds more shit to canvas and notifications start popping up

824,Oct. 99 and I love flexing on my friends born in 2000
825,I love that a lot of people relate to this
826,Someone once told me that they were a 90s kid because the were born in 2003 and that its basically the 90s and that I was a 2010s kid because I was born in 2004...
827,"Hey, same! What day?"
828,November 99 here. Settle down kid.
829, Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
830,How old are you?
831,14th
832,My best friend born 1 January in 2000 must be feeling this hahahaha
833,In school I had a friend from January 3rd 2000 and literally befriended her because my maternal instinct kicked in (I used to be that mom friend in my circle)
834,born in 2001😔 basically a baby then
835,May 1999 and I feel like an oldie compared to you
836,technically you were alive in the 90s 👀
837,Jan 2000 here too!
838,Gang gang✊
839,haha 69 wholesome 500
840,Me too bois!
841,Hit 21 earlier this month
842,Actually I would assume it's the opposite. Who wants to be in a building of strangers during a pandemic?
843,I’m sure one of them
844,Oof. Hang in there.
845,"Took my last final yesterday, I made it and am home free"
846,Tried telling all the freshman I knew that the last two weeks will kill you if you don’t already have some stuff done and more importantly DO NOT hinge on getting stuff done over break
847,Time to decompress!
848,Same
849,Same
850,Same.
851,"Sounds pretty accurate

I downloaded it cause people were always sending me random tik toks and I wanted to see what was up. A lot of it is painful to watch, but if you know how to weed through it then there's a lot of good stuff on it also"
852,"I'm an old soul or something idk, I deleted Snapchat a month after I got it because I didn't know what was going on. 😅 I understand social media up to Instagram but after that I'm totally lost."
853,But as an app it's an objectively better version of vine.
854,does that mean we can expect it to die off too
855,"honestly not a big fan of most social media, but I still use ig on occasion. I tried snapchat once in like 10th grade but it seems hella vapid to me. so I got rid of it after like a month."
856,I don't think America=good. It's just a matter of choice. I can't avoid using the Internet. I would choose using non-Chinese browsers when I still have a choice. (I am also boycotting for protesting's sake)
857,"At least letting them know my location won't result in danger. On the other hand, I would be in danger if China knows my location as I joined the protests. I hope you understand my choice to boycott those apps. :)"
858,Think of vine but it is cancerous and a bit like musically
859,"me too, Im only 20, I think it's just that I didn't download it when it first came out and couldn't be bothered to lesrn how it worked cause I thought it was stupid."
860,"I don't get it too. I thought the users were mostly younger teens. However, even if I don't get it, I would never download this Chinese data collecting app."
861,Literally the only social media I have is Reddit and TikTok. I just dont need to know every thought and action of my friends/family/acquaintances and they dont need to know mine. I use the internet for entertainment and on the whole social media just isn't very interesting to me
862,"It's just a more popular version of vine, not much to get."
863,"There has been no evidence of Chinese data collection, reddit just loves speculation because its China.

The United states government would've banned it if China was actually proven to be spying on it. 

No, tiktok data is stored in Virginia and California. Not China."
864,"Eventually, yes"
865,Lol this applies to me and my siblings who dislike that with a passion. This aside I also find it hard to understand and like tbh.
866,"I dont really get tiktok, do you?"
867,no one does tbh
868,Hope you don't use google!
869,Well.. I am boycotting Chinese apps. I am from Hong Kong so I would rather being monitored by Google than by China.
870,"🙄🙄

""I want only Americans to exploit me"""
871,"I don't. You have a ridiculous view of the world if you think China = bad and America = good.

You've bought into American propaganda."
872,"As someone who just finished a 4 year degree and will be starting a new job next month, I have to tell you, keep going! You /will/ get there at the end. I can't count the number of times I was so beaten down by my degree and yes I wish a lot of things went better than they did, but I actually made it to the end!

882,Me finally getting the degree after years of studying and realising there’s either no jobs or they want experience ;_; no worries dudes I’ll just be here in debt. Wish uni would actually teach you adequately for a job. So that we wouldn’t have to deal with bullshit
883,"Go back to the sidebar on the sub's page and change your flair then, there's probably a good one.

I'll be damned actually, there aren't any. You should probably message the mods if you want that changed then."
884,"I skipped that phase and have no regrets. A job is a job.

What matters is how you manage that minimum wage to be happy."
885,"I think it’s ok, you can really only do 3 things, medschool, lab work, or teach. and I’m going to try to get a teaching position as my major title is technically ‘Biology Education’."
886,quarantining with my family on a farm in my early 20s during a pandemic after graduation feels like a transitionary period tho...
887,"I wish I could lol. But my week is completely filled by studying and school and weekends are reserved for work and falling into my bed tired.

Only one more year to go tho"
888,"This is how I feel post high school 19 year old me. I'm barely realizing how great it is to be young even though I feel kinda old in my age. You see all the movies and video game were the protagonist is 9-18 years old not so much 19. I wish I had could spend my last year as a teen under better conditions but it is what it is. I also wish I could go back and fix things like preventing my self from isolating myself from my best friend who was also my aunt that's the same age as me. I also also wish I didn't have anxiety and have made more friends and do mischievous things like the kids in movies do. I know life doesn't end after 20, but it kind of feels like I'm heading down a dark path with the way the world look's now."
889,i feel you man.
890,"I learned somewhere that while growing my hair out, I should focus on appreciating the different stages of hair growth instead of just wishing it would be longer already.

I think this is kind of the same thing.

I've done a lot of nice hairstyles and tried out different things with my hair that I probably wouldn't have done if I just ignored it until it's the lenght I want. I'm gonna try to apply this to life in general."
891,"Exactly, this sentiment is important most of the time but I feel like with quarantine and wildfire messing up a lot of people’s lives there’s nothing wrong with being a little patient and waiting it out."
892,Needed this I’m a senior in college
893,"I’ve thought about this, but I’m not sure where the difference between “treating the present as a transitory period” and “focus on your ambitions, future, and where you want to be.” In a way, we’re all working towards influencing our future events; I think it’s okay to think of now as a temporary period, whose future outcome you can change by putting in the efforts now. 

In that vein, this too shall pass."

973,"I love arguing with people if both sides have a full understanding of the issue and mutual respect. It can help build understanding and also establish conversational boundaries to what either side is willing to discuss. Not to mention learning what convictions someone actually holds.

Peoples opinions on one issue is a very good insight to their thought process and how they’ll probably feel about other issues. As long as the arguments *can* end (ie it’s not about faith or any other belief system not based in evidence or personal philosophy) it’s fine. If otherwise the argument will literally never be able to end because you can’t argue against someone’s faith, it’s not supposed to be swayed like that.

1058,lmao you have more chances of dying by drinking alchol or weed than eating a simple cookie. Do you see the logic? At least my mind is not fucked by eating a cookie.
1059,"Weed has never killed anyone, if you didnt know its actually used as medication in a lot of situations. In fact, theres many websites listing it to help with pain, nausea, vomitting, and even slowing down the growth of tumors (https://www.lungcancer.org/find_information/publications/328-medical_marijuana_and_cancer) This government funded organization is endorsing the use of marijuana. This is why i say do research instead of assuming everything your parents tell you is true."
1060,"Weed has never been proven to kill brain cells. You know what has been probed to kill brain cells though? Microwaves. Better throw them all out! Have you done any research at all on drugs? For someone who has such a strong opinion on them, i wouldve expected more scientific evidence to back you up because i would never make an opinion on something i know nothing about."
1061,"My family is super religious, super republican, homophobic, and against any kind of drug use. I'm an atheist, leftist, anarchist, bisexual that's done acid, shrooms and smokes weed on a regular basis. My family knows nothing about me and yes thanksgiving is horrible."
1062,Yep
1063,And you're still choosing to kill your brain cells and have side effects as well as wasting money. And yes everything else like meds have side effects but at least in your case you have a choice to make unlike medications. Just a saying.
1064,"If your so uptight about your belief sure, but i still believe inhaling and  exhaling whatever is unhealthy and stupid. Regardless of what it is. I live naturally. It smells like crap too. Well goodluck lmao. Hopefully your not addicted"

1088,"It's hard to pick a certain one. I think one of my favorites is, when I found a little cat, that doesn't belonged to our little village, so I took it home.
He was so excited and happy to have a little cat at home, that he was always around her, barking and howling in a higher tone, than usually. He kinda adopted the kitten until it's owner was finally found and even let it eat out of his food bowl.

We won't, he was for almost 11 years (minus one day) on our side. We will forever love him."

1102,"I really hope he enjoyed his life as much as possible, thank you so much and sorry for your loss, too!"
1103,"Thought so, too and I realized it would be a good last photo if him.

It fits good, because the last part of a lifespan is called in Germany ""Lebensabend"", which means something like ""evening of life"" (don't know, if there's an english equaivalent for it) and since it was his last evening at all this is a very important photo for me.

Thank you! I hope so as well."

1137,[deleted]
1138,"At that point, I just want every challenge to not be a damn wall I have to push..."
1139,I actually dropped out of school and for now I’m not going back. When you said career I thought you meant studying to get a more than average job.
1140,"I get it. When I was 19 I got dropped from my parents health insurance. It was a mixture of dumb decisions that lead up to me getting dropped and at the time I didn't know how big a deal it actually was. I'm a type 1 diabetic and blow through a bottle of insulin in about three weeks. I never had to manage getting my prescriptions because my dad did it for me and I didn't know how expensive everything was. Without insurance, a bottle of insulin is about $300-600 depending on where you get it. I am a drain on society. I am part of the reason insurance premiums are so damn high. 

I would look at different insurance companys online and not have a clue what any of the numbers meant and thought I couldn't afford any of the plans I was looking at. I started to fill out an application with one company, but I think I stopped or just didn't pick a plan because I was so stressed that I wouldn't have enough money to pay for it. I kept it in the back of my mind and moved on with my life because I was scared. Sometime later, a sales representative from that insurance company called me. Normally I hate sales people especially when they call trying to sell me something, but this woman was my guardian angel. I was able to explain my situation to her and and she found a plan that would cover everything I needed for like $100 a month. That was probably one of the best plans I've ever had because I didn't have copays for anything. 

I learned that it is okay to admit that you don't know what you're doing. There are tons businesses that exist to help people with things they don't understand. I use turbo tax every year for my taxes because it's fairly easy to just answer some questions and transfer numbers from w-2's and 1099's. I have no clue how I would actually file my taxes by myself. My dad used to do that when he owned his own business and he said it was like a week of looking for a bunch of bull shit information and learning what numbers to add and subtract where. Nobody knows what the fuck they're doing. Everyone is flying by the seat of their pants and tackling challenges as they come. I know you feel a lot of pressure on you right now, but understand that no one is expecting you to know how to do everything. If it helps, make a list of things you need done and complete them from easiest to hardest. If you get stuck and don't know what to do, tell someone! Maybe talk to your parents like, ""hey I'm trying to do this, but don't really know what I'm doing. Could you point me in the right direction to get me started?"" If they can't help, you can even post here and I know someone will be able to help you. If you feel overwhelmed, take a break. Go for a short walk, play a video game, do something to relax for a few minutes. It gets easier over time and if you need help I'm here for you. I believe in you."

I’m not aware of anyone in my country that has that in mind even though I’m pretty sure that’s a thing people vote on but since I’m technically a foreigner, I can’t! I mean, I could if they wanted to but somehow, making foreigners born in the country vote is a bad idea... Not really surprising from a wealthy country tho...

Idk, I might be looking at the bad side of things but at that point, it doesn’t feel like it."

1152,"easily, my first year of college (that being 2019-2020) had me only doing small amounts of work outside of class with the exception of readings and studying and the occasional paper. these online course have had me working nonstop to complete basically nothing but filler work that would have been a discussion if it had been in person. online classes suck ass"
1153,"Thankfully I haven’t had to use Proctortrack, but it basically records everything on a student’s computer (webcam, mic, desktop, and keyboard strokes) to “prevent” cheating. I understand some profs really want their students to learn, but this year is just not the right time to be that tough on students. Their 1 star review on the app store should speak for itself."
1154,"I can't really speak for Proctotrack, but Respondus Lockdown Browser prevents you from accessing most of your computer's features while taking a test. Most professors will also enable RLB's recording feature to make sure that you aren't cheating. 

I do not condone this at all (\*wink wink\*), but it *may* be possible to bypass this via a Virtual Machine."

1164,Can someone explain what the respondus lockdown browser and proctotrack are?
1165,if i had to use that lockdown browser shit i'd just put it in a VM
1166,Yeah online classes are a pain in the ass.  I can't imagine what the freshman are going though not having been to college before and taking 9n unfamiliar subjects. I feel incredibly fortunate to at least have had 2 years of  The normal collegiate experience To make friends and network with people before we had to move to online classes. I really hope colleges next year at least give the students that would be sophomores that were freshman this year the same experience they give incoming freshman that way at the very least you may have missed a year but you still get the same opportunity and make friends in on campus orientation
1167,Wow

1169,I took the opportunity to take all of my boring/useless Gen Ed classes this semester. Professors at my university are usually pretty relaxed about grading due to the forced online classes. This was perfect for me since I had been avoiding all of my writing and humanities classes for 2 years.

1180,I'm about to start my second year and I can not tell you how much meaningless busy work there was for chemistry or physics. They're probably the most universally hated classes at my college for that reason.
1181,"depends on what you want, a high gpa? much harder than highschool. a 3.1 gpa? easy AF"
1182,Exactly! So much easier when you have 2-3 classes a day instead of 8.

1190,Not a fan of coffee but the amount of green tea I've had this year...oh god.
1191,"...oh no. The college I'm going to is known for being hard and I've heard the the bio major, which I'm going to try to do, is really difficult."
1192,"What are you going into?

Your major really dictates how much you're gonna want to die in college.

That being said, I agree. I wouldn't care at all if my major didn't require a 3.8 GPA, things are generally much more laid back than they were in high school."
1193,"Same here. High school, I was on campus for 12 hours, came home and did a ton of homework. Last semester, I had a four day weekend, rarely had homework, maybe one class a day, and I barely tried. I ended my second semester of college with a 4.0 and 47 credit hours."
1194,"Well, you gotta be good at memorizing. I'm a bio major myself, and so far things aren't necessarily hard...there's just a lot of it. 

Every day you get 2-4 new concepts in a class, and you just gotta remember what they are. It's simple, but it's not easy."
1195,"Music lol, I know it's a terrible decision but hey that's the name of the game in young adulthood"
1196,Coffee got me through high school too
1197,Not at a Mormon school.
1198,Definitely not for me. College so far feels like I just went from 100 to 20 in a school zone.  I hardly tried and got a 4.0 gpa my first year. It probably will get harder. But if I actually study I bet I can keep it up.
1199,It was way easier than high school for me
1200,Same. Holy fuck. Every parent and teacher acted like I was in for it. But honestly. I was lazy as fuck. didn’t study. And now I got a 4.0 gpa for my first year. Probably is just giving me terrible habits if anything.
1201,"Somehow I got a 4.0 last semester, but online carried. Being honest I was sure to burnout and lose focus, helped that my internet was shit in my dorm"
1202,"Hey OP, a couple words of advice since I was trying to make a similar change as you and I've made pretty decent progress.

Exercise is a lot easier to do when you've already started. especially if you make it part of your routine. I just do a small jog every morning. it tires me out pretty good but it feels great and it's especially nice if you have a nice area to run in. I go to a nearby walking park which has lots of nice trees and greenery to look at.

if you have a source of income, I would start shopping for cards immediately. don't rush yourself, try to find a card that has exactly what you're looking for, or at least as close to that as possible. what I've been doing for almost a year now is just buy gas, then pay it off at the end of the month. if you don't drive, you can try paying for your lunch or something every day with it. that way it'll incur a decent amount of debt every month, and you're paying it all off. never use it to shop for anything else! if you think you can afford that fancy new gadget, then pay for it with cash, not credit! buying luxuries can be a slippery slope that I've seen people with previously great credit slip into. it's best for the purchased *and* payments to be routine as possible to discourage mismanagement. 

as for budgeting (your ""spend less money"" point), id just put together a small budget. make it something you can recall without having to refer to a physical paper or something. like for my budget, I can recall right off the top of my head that I can afford to purchase about 2 new games a month, or go out to eat a handful of times or a mix of the 2. this makes it easy to budget because I don't feel constricted by a strict list, but I'm still not overspending. 

and finally for the sleep deadline, I just use melatonin. messed up my sleep schedule by accident? melatonin and force myself to bed earlier. works every time (for me). they sell bottles for just a few bucks at your local Walmart. 

good luck OP, I believe in you!"
1203,"Thank you a lot man!!! My goal later on is to start biking in the early morning, right now it's mostly just whenever I want to. As for cards, do you mean gift cards? Sorry I'm  a bit slow for that haha. I live on a very strict budget due to me paying for mortgage for my family and my orthadontic treatment. So I don't really buy anytbing all fancy like anymore I guess. 

For melatonin I know it's a supplement but is it safe to use that every night? Can you become dependent on it?"
1204,I just made the list lol. I'm only in step 1. I felt very suicidal yesterday so I thought today I'd make a change.
1205,"Remind me! Two weeks.

I’m holding you accountable OP!"
1206,I won't let you down my man! In two weeks you'll see an update!
1207,Did you reached all of it ?
1208,"This is all good. The short term goals support the long term goals there. Eating more fruit/veg and sleeping will help you work out. Spending less money will help you get a house/car etc. 

Try a money saver app and check your credit rating too!

Also, a busy body is a busy mind. It's when your sat there or laid there bored or unable to sleep that your mind starts drifting off to negative places. Hopefully, being healthier like you've put in your goals will help negate this but like I said - keep your mind working!"
1209,I really felt that “GET MY LICENSE”
1210,Thank you! I've already started a spreadsheet documenting all my progress espically for sleep and exercise for 14 consecutive days and making a graph seeing how I'm doing.
1211,"Hey, that's ok. You can do it OP. We're all different, go at your own pace. I didn't get my license until 20 due to my anxiety issues.

I've tried making a list, doesn't do any good for me personally. I do kind of still have one but it's mental and pretty jumbled. Maybe you'll have better luck than me. ;)

Don't worry if you slip on doing daily things sometimes, you've still progressed from before, even if you don't feel up to it.

I do maybe a quarter of that consistently and about half regularly so don't worry if you don't get all of it."

1239,"Plus literally anything you do now will define the rest of your life. No matter if your 10 or 50, that’s just how time works lol."
1240,oh my
1241,r/agedlikemilk
1242,I feel old now
1243,"damn , that’s true"
1244,"Accurate. This is the first they of my new job. I just graduated last school year. Plus i got a crush on a waitress from who I don't even know the name of atm. I haven't been nervous this many times in short period of time. 
Good luck to everyone that's going thru defining moments of life."
1245,"Honestly been missing those defining moments. Graduating college, getting my first job, buying my first project house, all feels a little empty with no love/social life. I feel like it takes other people and being in the mix of a community to really make those moments mean something"
1246,"I somehow managed to tolerate until 2020 started  
but now I feel like I'm one bad news away from jumping in front of a truck   
except that in 2020 we have bad news 48 times a day"
1247,To sum it up in three words: we're all fucked
1248,:(
1249,except the rich
1250,I agree. Like I'm not gonna out of my parents house right now. I don't want to get home to a empty house every day.
1251,"stealing memes from Instagram, I see

down vote, I must"
1252,Yeah I've realised that
1253,"I mean I'm not the one that stole this from there, my friend was scrolling through insta and he was like ""ooh, you should post this on that young adults thing on Reddit"""
1254,Tbh I agree. r/teenagers sucks. It’s just shit memes (mainly aimed at teen boys) and very little discussion about being an actual fucking teen. Though this meme isn’t absolute garbage it still worries me that the same thing will happen to this sub
1255,"> it still worries me that the same thing will happen to this sub

that's exactly why it annoys me. I just want this sub to be where we can talk about, well, young adult stuff. I would be fine if vote scores were hidden or even disabled on this sub, too."
1256,Why?
1257,"Literally all the discussion on r/teenagers is about being virgins, how to get a girlfriend plot twist he doesn’t ever get one and how girls don’t exist. It’s pathetic. 

At least here we can talk about issues directly related to our age range like universities, student debt, dealing with moving out for the first time and just actual things. It’s nice to have a meme every now and then but if this goes down the shitter I’m gonna be pissed"
1258,You have to look for more adult adults!
1259,[deleted]
1260,At least crop it ffs
1261,"Dude 1. I love r/teenagers (pssshhh-for the memes...) And two, this was directly related to adults, young and old alike"
1262,Ok boomer
1263,Yoda voice I see unoriginal you are
1264,Yoda voice I see unoriginal you are
1265,"because posting low effort reposted memes here makes the sub a lower quality place. a meme with no effort, that is basically a copy of a hundred others before it, gets a couple comments with little to no discussion and a bunch of super dank upvotes (xD). and then the front page is just a clone of me_irl or some dumb shit like that, which is exactly what happened to /r/teenagers, which is a cesspool now. then, you have to sort by new to see anything worthwhile, and even then eventually it becomes worthless. there are a billion subs for shitty memes, it doesn't belong here IMO"
1266,I wonder where Sammy is now
1267,"I checked last year and he goes to college rn, maybe a junior I think?"
1268,"Yep, there's a video of him talking to a class about his YouTube channel."
1269,"Wait what ??

I thought sammy was an earliy 2000 kid"

1276,Well yest but also no memes
1277,I don't see any memes here. How can it be better? You guys probably don't even stick your dicks in random objects anymore.

1281,Well yeet but also neat
1282,Pretty much
1283,That’s...why I’m here

1312,same
1313,Hell yeah
1314,"I think I make mine that too, but if not I guess go ahead lmao"
1315,Why.  What separates you from being a young adult.  Ik you’re not just basing this off age are you because maybe you’re referring to a maturity level (which is also dumb because there are some 13 year olds who are more mature than 30 year olds) but you have to have an explanation
1316,"A young adult is exactly what it sounds like. An adult who is young. When you turn 18 you are factually and an adult, and dice you would then be the youngest possible adult, you then become a young adult."
1317,Hehehe
1318,Big brain time
1319,Here I am man
1320,Ha as if being old is gonna stop me from using r/teenagers

1329,"Luckily I can switch between both, 20 is when the horrors begin"
1330,Wish I joined Reddit as a teenager.
1331,Why are you trying to be a real adult at 17?
1332,"I was already obnoxious enough as it was as a teenager without being regularly on reddit. Can't imagine how smug I'd be if I was on here as well.

I'd probably have been even worse of an r/atheism neckbeard or fallen down some alt-right ""gamer"" rabbit hole. Anonymous social medias are a dangerous place for young white men and boys who are trying to find their own identity."
1333,Well shit I haven't been using Reddit for months and I'm actually 18. I just haven't changed my flair
1334,Yes on r/teenagers once you're 20 you are an old man to them I just stay for the memes
1335,It may apply to her because it applied to me. I had to move out and take care of myself at 17. I’m 22 now.
1336,"I feel you, 18 wasn’t so bad and I still felt like a kid

20 does hit different tho"
1337,"Idgi, just live with your parents lol. I dont feel like an adult at all and im 20, feels good"
1338,Can confirm
1339,All roads lead to rome
1340,Oh god no
1341,Man being an adult is hard.
1342,"21.

I have a stable job and my own apartment but I feel I should start studying university but then I'll have less money and I'll have to move out of town away from my friends but I also want to move to a new place and especially further south so I can get away from these god forsaken cold winters that last all the way to May."
1343,Can double check
1344,What's this then
1345,"Nobody really knows how to be a ""real adult"". Just don't starve and that's fine.

1347,A meme.
1348,I just realized my flair was still 17 too.
1349,Life is pain
1350,Being an adult is just way gloomier.
1351,Fuck r/teenagers
1352,Because you're adults not teenagers anymore
1353,No shit coz being an adult kinda sucks lmao
1354,This sub is just a bit more serious sometimes. It’s why I like it though because it’s relatable content for me
1355,Why?
1356,i didnt know i was in there (i dont use reddit super often) & i saw a post in feed then left because i just feel weird since i just turned 20 lmao
1357,agreed
1358,what a fuckin bop tho

1366,I opened my first one in December. Waiting for the first payment due date atm. I got a secured one and I am more than ready to pay off the balance!
1367,"I gotta think about credit cards too?

Seems like a trap to me."
1368,"I always pay off my card ASAP. I only go over when it’s medical related/emergency, because I’m pretty sure there are ways you can talk to either side and explain."
1369,"You need a credit history to do damn near anything, in the US at least. Buying a home, buying a car, renting, etc. Unless you are rich and can pay for things like houses and cars in one lump sum, you're gonna need credit. And if you're that rich, you probably don't have to worry about your credit much anyway because you likely won't have issue paying it off. 

Anyway, credit cards ain't nearly as hard as they seem. It just comes down to: don't spend money you don't have."
1370,"This took me a very long time to figure out but once I accepted it, life got a whole lot easier. Don't hold yourself to impossible ideals."
1371,"The day I figured out I wasn’t a career oriented person, and that that was okay, it changed my life."
1372,"Honestly I like my job, but I love my family, my friends, my dog, and my hobbies. I don’t have big dreams for my career, just to have enough money to live my life the way I want."
1373,"Same. For the longest time I thought something was wrong with me because I could never relate to the ""follow your dreams"" narrative that was pushed on me in high school. I don't have a ""dream job."" I never have.

Obviously I'd rather not have a job I hate, but I don't need my job to be my life's purpose. Frankly at this stage of my life I care more about independence and financial stability. Once that's settled I can do whatever I want outside of work."
1374,Thank you.
1375,"This helped me a bit, thank you"
1376,Ah yes my parents used to be like that
1377,Bruh
1378,You can have it constantly not figured out yeah don't rush stuff
1379,I have no idea what I wana do and I keep waiting to find a career field that just clicks with me. This makes me feel better that it’s ok if nothing ever clicks. I just wana be smart and get into a career that makes tons of money and the economy crashing never means I’m out of a job
1380,Getting women is more important than getting a good job. If you are able to get a lot of women then bosses that hires for good job will hire you because they want you to wingman for them at the clubs

Negative take: I'm not even two years out from being a teenager. By far the worst is still yet to come 😕"

1394,"Meh, it wasn't really easier but I definitely enjoyed my non-teenage years more than my teenage years."
1395,peaked in senior year but even in senior year I was still a loser. haha
1396,Things dont get easier. You just learn how to deal with them in your own way.
1397,🙋🏻‍♂️
1398,Damn nigga. I suddenly wish I had 2 more hands.
1399,"It did tho, I was anxiety ridden and super shy in highschool. Now I do whatever i want"
1400,"Nothing got easier and now, at almost 22 years old, I wish I didn’t rush my teen years to get here"
1401,"Easier isn't the same as better or more fulfilling. Who tf told you it'd be easier??? All you do as a kid is go to school and eat dinner. That's the easiest thing you do in life. 
As an adult you become your own person and really learn to value the good things in life. But you can only do that by comparing the good parts to the hardships."
1402,Uh.. um... it doesn’t get easier? AHHHHHHH
1403,"Yep, same happened to me. Also cannot wait until I am done with Uni can just focus on work and side projects. Unlike now, dealing with uni b.s, job and personal stuff."

1410,I expected I would like it better. I sorta do I guess.
1411,I’m in Spain (without the s)
1412,"yeah, i’ve noticed my day to day things haven’t really changed much. yeah college is online but i already lived at home and spent a lot of days at home doing nothing. my retail job is still open so i don’t feel like i go to stores less but it was weird during the first few months of quarantine when it was closed. but it’s the little things that ruin stuff for me. i spent a lot of time alone lately but i used to see my friends a few times a month, and see family, and travel to see family that lived far away for holidays and stuff and those were always some of the best days of the year since my cousins are all around my age and are like my friends. now i only see them every once in a while outside and can’t see the out of state ones at all. we used to have sleepovers a few times a year at holidays and we can’t do that anymore. plus i can count on one hand the amount of times i’ve seen my friends this year since were all being very careful living with high risk people. i’m not getting bored in my house because i sit around alone when it’s not quarantine already but i wish i at least had some highlights this year"

Not to take this meme seriously though  I dont wanna be that guy 😂😂"

1446,What does sleeping with a stuffed animal have anything to do with being in a relationship? Lmao
1447,Lmao sign up for therapy dawg you need it
1448,"That’s fair, to each their own"
1449,"both my ex’s slept w a stuffed animal and they were both 22. personally i don’t think it’s weird, actually kind of cute"
1450,mood
1451,"Yeah, a society where people can even get offended by a guy with a stuffed animal in his bed, there is quite literaly no difference between guys and girls having stuffed animals in bed."
1452,"Well yeah, I see no issue with a dude who likes stuffed animals vs a woman liking stuffed animals. It's one of those things where I can't even begin to understand people who think otherwise, unless you grew up in an era in which genders were segregated and treated differently. Then I would understand, but it still doesn't make it right."
1453,Holy shit all of your comments are completely fucking retarded 💀
1454,me irl
1455,"I swear this was my motto all throughout college and it worked way better than you'd expect. I guess by faking it you kinda learn something even if you don't realize at first, or at least people think you do and they trust you"
1456,"I see, I understand your point better now. I was under the impression you meant that someone that isn't manly is ""less of a man"" than someone than is, with which I do not agree. As a pure adjective, I agree those characteristics describe manly and just like everything, some people prefer manly traits and some don't. So it's all about preference and not necessarily one being better than the other. Thanks for taking the time to explain!"

1458,"As a 24 y/o man in a relationship, I don't see what's wrong about sleeping with a stuffed animal. I bought a stuffed bear with my gf and she thought it was cute"
1459,"Girls sleeping with a stuffed animal, ehhh…still a little weird but I guess if you win it for your girl at like a fair or something maybe. Guys, well idk maybe for guys in homosexual relationships it’d be understandable, but heterosexual guys I would raise an eyebrow. Not saying you can’t do it, but I’d certainly question it"
1460,Man idk if you'd noticed but based on the downvotes you're getting I think most people wouldn't agree w you as you said in a previous comment. I respect your point of view and you questioning whether someone's straight or not based solely on if someone thinks a stuffed animal is cute or comfy. I just wanna share you're in the minority group and neither girls or society in general think there's any wrong with it. Uncommon? Maybe. Less manly? Not at all
1461,yea i agree it would be abnormal but i don’t know of any girls who would judge me if I did
1462,Disagree. I think there are definitely standards of manliness. Someone who looks like Harry Styles isn’t going to come across as manly as someone like Tom Selleck.
1463,But what exactly is manliness and how does that factor into being able to pull a girl or not? Bc Harry Styles having softer features doesn't make him less capable of a man than Tom (who honestly I have no idea who he is so maybe he wasn't man enough to get it together and become famous enough. I'm just picturing Arnold Schwarzenegger)
1464,"Tom Selleck was in magnum pi. I would say being handy (being able to build and fix things), being able to fight and hunt (both with weapons and hand to hand), and being physically powerful and imposing, all make only stereotypically “manly”. I would not say Harry styles is a manly man. I would say he is a fairly effeminate man. Now is that a bad thing? In today’s culture, not necessarily. Gender bending is all the rage  nowadays, so styles fits into that mold a lot more than a traditional man like Selleck. I prefer the traditional mold personally, but maybe I’m a dying breed"
1465,No prob
1466,This is just a circle jerk of oppression Olympics rn 😂😂😂😂
1467,"Y’all are just proving my point, but it’s fine."
1468,"The problem is society is a lot more PC and sensitive than they used to be. So it’s skewed the barometers. Whenever I have a question over how manly something is, I think, would I have gotten bullied for this in the 80s? And sleeping with a stuffed animal past the age of 9 would probably fit that criteria."
1469,"Well that's not the definition of manly tho, bc it's not the 80s. A man in his 50s is not more of a man for being a young adult in the 80s than a 25 year old who wasn't alive then. Or a someone is not more of a man bc he can shoot a gun and skin an animal than someone who dresses with a pink polo to go to work in an office. The definition of a man is what he stands for and how much he can take care of his people. We're not in the 80s anymore, so if sleeping with a stuffed animal doesn't interfere in my ability to give a girl what she deserves I don't see how I'm less manly than someone who doesn't sleep with one, but treats his girl like a beer opener"
1470,Well there used to be at least. Maybe now there is so little differentiation among gender roles that people just don’t care.
1471,"Pretty simply…genders were and have been treated somewhat differently until relatively recently. Guys are typically led in sports or join rock bands, girls are typically led into dance or choir or theater. Girls were typically encouraged to wear dresses or skirts, or maybe leggings while guys generally wore jeans, t-shirt etc."
1472,Cause we live in a society where people get offended by everything. But 5 - 10 years ago…
1473,"Maybe for girls. For dudes I think it’s weird, and most guys I know would agree. But that’s not saying you can’t do it. It’s better to do weird stuff than illegal stuff (hence why I have a pending DUI)."
1474,It’s a bit juvenile. I said it was a little odd (for adults not kids) I didn’t say it was illegal or that they couldn’t do it.
1475,Guessing you aren’t in a relationship then.

1500,Does this mean all young adults slower clothed????
1501,Im scared to use that link
1502,Bars
1503,I’ll look into it. It is my first bike!
1504,I have been an organ donor since I got my license for my car. This bike is extremely slow (compared to other bikes) topping out at like 80. But I won’t. I don’t wanna be scraped off the pavement. But thank you
1505,Take it easy and learn the bike before you do some stupid shit. It could really save your life!
1506,"Surprisingly, I only paid $1300. It has a lot of scratches. But I really didn’t care. It’s my first bike. I honestly thought my parents would kick me out when I ran it buy them that I was going to buy one. But I had a plan, I talked with the seller, had a buddy with his full license come with come to take it back. I’m picking up more hours at work, and got insurance figured out. Because of that plan, they were a whole lot more open to me getting one. You’ll get there eventually, it takes a good amount of money. I’ve spent $200 this morning alone getting gear and shit for it. 

And I won’t. This bike can’t go that fast to begin with."
1507,"nice. how much did you pay for that? I've been wanting to get a bike but I'm poor and my parents wouldn't like it one bit. Would be nice to get a cheap old bike and fix it up a bit, maybe I'll do that one day when I have some more money.

don't ride too fast when you're stressed out though"
1508,"Congrats on the ninja, that thing looks like a lot of fun! One of the best feelings as a YA is a big purchase paid for entirely by yourself, be safe and keep an eye out on the road- people tend to have a blind eye for motorcycles."
1509,"Thank you! And yeah I won’t. It’s the first bike I’ve riden, I’m getting my temps for it tomorrow. It’s Just something nice to have in the spring and summer when I’m too lazy to take the door and top off my Jeep."
1510,God that's a beauty. I've always wanted to own one but I can barely bring myself to drive a car let alone a bike
1511,My advice is to apply for as many scholarships as you can. And I know you’ve heard that from absolutely everybody. But it will save you so much money. Money that you can do with as you please
1512,"Looks sick, keep up the great work."
1513,People around here have a blind eye for everything around them. But I will!
1514,How come?
1515,You too!
1516,"Lol I second that. I got an R3 last semester and it was already dropped before so I didn’t bother but it’s been dropped like 3 times teaching friends and slid once when I got cut off and hit the brakes too hard. So definite investment. U will fall or drop eventually and yours is beautiful
Edit: didn’t even notice the scratches, could be way worse!"
1517,"yeah scratches don't matter. if it's your first you'll probably end up dropping it anyway. I'm happy for you, hopefully it gives you a lot of fun in the years to come. I'm saving up my money, I have about $500 in savings, $200 in investments, and another like $700 in the bank. I would have had like $1500 in the bank but I had to pay for my school enrollment and textbooks and stuff, that was a pretty big chunk of change. if I really wanted to I could get a bike for like $500 and it would probably need a couple hundred in work, but then I'd want gear anyway so I figure I should hold off until I have some more. and even then I would probably get a car so I can carry stuff and people if needed. I'll definitely get a bike some day though."
1518,Thank you I needed that
1519,What year is it?
1520,"Don't forget to ~~be safe~~ drive fast. Head down, throttle up, drop a gear and disappear."
1521,"Thats beautiful, I got a cheap one but I use it for work mostly, now I make faster deliveries, and sold the bicycle I had."
1522,"Ayyy I did a similar thing! Treated myself to a new Honda CB300R this summer.  I love everything about riding so far. My daily commute is now much more enjoyable with practicing my skills. 

My advice that I haven’t seen anyone else give is to get some cones so you can practice low speed maneuvers in vacant parking lots. Riding at speed is easy, riding it slow is hard. 

I thought once I got my bike though I would stop obsessing over what to get as my first bike. Now I’m obsessed as to what to get for my next.. it never stops I guess."
1523,"Few tips from a fellow biker:

1.ATGAT: All The Gear All The Time. Even when your just driving around the block to meet a friend, wear at least a jacket and helmet.

2. Get to know your bike: find a private space and test it out: how much distance do you really take to brake from a given speed? How does your bike react to different kinds of input? 

3. You never stop learning: there are many additional training courses one can take. More is always, better but I would generally advise doing at least 1/year, preferably at the start of the season."
1524,250r!
1525,$1300
1526,"If you live in America, it’s probably pretty easy to get a bike without your license. My state requires a motorcycle endorsement for registration and insurance but no one cared when I got my bike. They all literally just ask “but you plan on getting it right?”"
1527,It's pretty nice.  I got a 2017 special edition Ninja 300
1528,Okay. I will order it. Thank you!
1529,That’s awesome!
1530,"the problem for me is that when I look on those scholarship websites most of them seem like just scams or sweepstakes stuff, where do you find scholarships? through your college?"
1531,"Yeah. It’s different for every school. Just look up scholarships on your colleges website and there should be some options. 

I go to a community college (which also saved a lot of money) and all we have to do is get three reference letters and fill out some info about ourselves and we it automatically applies us for all available scholarships for our major."
1532,Looks really nice! I really enjoy Ninjas. Is this the 250r or a slightly bigger one?
1533,"Back when I was pulling all-nighters in HS, I had to have some sort of stimulant in my system to get past 4:30 AM (when working on an assignment). I’d have these weird dopamine spikes after 2-3 AM too, mildly delirious.

Even with alcohol involved, I’d be passed out on the couch at 4:30 like clockwork. Something in my internal clock likes that time.  

Most drugs too, only exception was cocaine. My body would feel so tired, but I wanted to move around so badly. I stayed awake well-past 10:00 AM after taking 2.5 big lines over the course of the night, before finally passing out on a pretty awful comedown. 

LSD too, actually. It’s impossible to fall asleep when you’re tripping, nor would I want to. It would freak me the fuck out and increase my concerns of never fully coming back.

Edit: Establishing a healthy sleep schedule over the past year has really helped me though. I think my melatonin production has cycled back to producing at 10-12ish after sticking with it consistently. Lets me wake up early, refreshed, and with zero stress. Going (mostly) sober and (mostly, 3-4 times per month at most) caffeine-free has helped with this too."
1534,"if you stayed in shape that may have had something to do with it, and also had a somewhat healthy diet. 

my current roommate snores loud as fuck every night so i’m always waking up 2 to 3 times a night and having to throw shit at him so he can wake up and stop snoring. but i wake up feeling tired at first but once i’ve had a shower i feel like i had gotten enough sleep."
1535,Better just get your sleep than ruin your brain from staying up all night for no reason.
1536,"I don’t even know how I managed 6-8 classes a day, 2 tests everyday, 1 exam/week and be pulling all nighters for those finals in HS. I’m in college rn, only taking 3 classes and I can barely keep my eyes open past 10pm. We were wilding back in the day"
1537,"Right?! How on Earth did I manage to get to school at 8, sit in class until 3 pm, do homework, eat dinner, and then study until the next day? Now I have class literally 3 times a week and still have to force myself to show up."
1538,school?
1539,Fucking relatable
1540,Same. I use to be able to work all day and stay up all night talking to friends and playing games. I still work well on like 4hrs of sleep but I need those 4hrs lol.
1541,I can't even pull an all nighter
1542,if you can't sleep after doing coke then what you're doing isn't coke
1543,college classes require way more brainpower and cover twice the amount of material in the same time
1544,Exactly!! We were doing the MOST back then no joke
1545,I feel like I'm the opposite. I'm unable to go to bed early even when I got commitments the next day.
1546,"I can only do it with the help of stimulants, otherwise I just pass out around 4."
1547,Hey even at 18 I could never pull an all nighter. Baffles me how people do it
1548,"Yup, I woke up today at 5 AM, worked out, showered, felt fresh and rested.


By 4PM I was so tired I didnt even notice when I fell asleep.

I still had plans to work after for 4 hours.

I, once, a year ago could stay awake for 3 days on a row with only anger, pain and an un healthy amount of sugar.

Its 8PM, it would be foolish to go work now, and my sleep routine is messed up once again."
1549,Exactly what I DONT have or am I unable to do either
1550,It may be because you watch things that aren't that entertaining anymore? I started to watch the legend of kora so I can have a conversation about it and I've stayed up till almost 5 last night till I told myself to go to bed. (I finished the season same night)
1551, Oh dear so that's how it begins...
1552,I couldn’t pull an all nighter even as a teenager. Deliberately tried with two friends once but it effed up my stomach
1553,"My dad was saying he’d do guard duty on post for 24 straight hours so he’d get an extra day off. Something like that. Now he can barely stay up past 11:00.  

I on the other hand is still going strong. It’s 7 in the morning and need sleep but reddit beckons me."
1554,i was abl to do all nighter ar 34 years old easy until one day i had a bad abtch of diazapam which were fake chemsit told me they was real i had a jolt i nside ehad and now I CAN NEVER DO ALL NIGHTERS AGAIN AND IM ALWAYS FATIGUED MIGHT BE PITURITY GLAND I DONT KNOW IM SEEING NEUROLOGISTS SOON
1555,NOTHING TO DO WITH DIET IT HAPPENS WHEN GET OLD OR BAD BATCH OF DRUGS
1556,Alcohol makes me pass out quicker what you mean lmao

1574,Do they have a conference room for every huge sub? Wow
1575,I wanna see the conference room of dank memes. Do they have just pictures of random dank memes taped around walls of the conference room?
1576,"No, since we’re moving Reddit to a new building, everything is empty except desks and chairs."
1577,Is it just a conference room named after a sub or do they actually use it to talk about r/oddlysatisfying related stuff?
1578,Aww thatd be dank as hell tho to have random dank memes printed on paper and then taped on the walls. Percentage wise about how much of the building has been moved over to the new building?
1579,Roughly like 70% from the old building to the new building. We still need to bring more chairs and pedestals from the old building. It gets really tiring after a few double shifts.
1580,I think they actually use it for r/oddlysatisfying related stuff. I’d assume that they talk about who to ban and stuff lol
1581,What about r/NSFW?
1582,Lol I haven’t seen any
1583,Awesome
1584,Oo I hope there's one for r/aww. Not sure how popular that sub is but I love it
1585,"I was gonna check try and look for it today, but I think imma just call off on my second shift because I’m hella tired."
1586,Aw jeez take care bro!
1587,I didn't know subreddit have conference rooms. What do that even talk about .
1588,"I hate being 21. Suddenly you are one of the life-hating 40 year olds, apparently. Life as a teenager was much more relaxed :C"
1589,"Shoot, I love getting older - but only for the next couple years. Life’s getting really exciting, and I’m doing things that are only possible because I’m getting older

Being young has freedom from responsibility, but being older has the freedom to pursue your path"
1590,Yo she kinda sounds like an asshole. She could've worded how she felt way better
1591,Drinking in the USA is only then legal once you get a hangover like the grown ups lol
1592,2 months and I'm 21 bro. The only upside is I can legally drink my pain away
1593,"Thats some prime projection right there, I agree with you, kinda not nice."
1594,"In November I and a bunch of friends were sitting in a 3-hour graduation ceremony to watch one of our friends walk. He was a semester early, and we were only sitting in the crowd so we could watch him walk. So like the twenty-somethings we are, we start goofing off. Eventually, this older lady sitting in front of us goes ""Y'all are acting less mature than my 8th graders!"". Me not know how to respond just smiled and shrugged after a minute of stunned silence. I think that only pissed her off more and really at the end of the day none of us cared, cause we got to cheer for our friend getting his diploma, and the family in front of us did too.

What I'm trying to say is, who tf cares if your goofy or silly sometimes. I swear, I've always heard how ""You should never be too quick to grow up!"" but then you're scolded if you just try to be a little playful. So really, why should you care? The important thing is to understand the environment you're in and act appropriately. (i.e pls don't put the fun in funeral)"
1595,"I'm 19 (turning 20 this year) and my 17 year old coworker told me that I was acting like a ""boomer"" a week ago

Also a lot of people tell me that I look ~22 and I love it

I also get nostalgic but I wouldn't trade the present for the past

I guess we are on opposite sides of the spectrum"
1596,"Oh my goodness, I hate seeing myself get a year older, I’m just like well I have to act 1 year more mature. IDK, it’s definitely a balance between acting like an adult but yet still having that spunk"
1597,Happy cake day!!
1598,Yeah but now you can drink alcohol and smoke weed and have sex without it being an awkward mess
1599,I feel like me and my friends group maturely devolves as we get older. Recently we been really into having nerf wars and watching sitty movies while playing Mario kart and smash. We did the same stuff 10 years ago in elementary school lol.
1600,"To me she doesn’t sound very mature herself. Telling others they’re immature is one thing, but saying one is more mature is pretty childish imo."
1601,"Well, to younger folks (see, I already sound like a 60 year old) we are considered boomers in their eyes."
1602,Mutlu yeşil üçgen gunu.
1603,I completely agree on that. I’m 17 and my friends tell me i’m immature just because i was telling a joke they didn’t like. I just dislike how some people tell others they are immature whilst themselves aren’t even mature.
1604,"I'm going to sound like a stick in the mud here, but largely the reason it's looked down upon to cheer during a graduation ceremony is because it takes the attention away from the students. Oftentimes, one particularly popular student, or one with a large family in attendance, is handed their diploma and crowd goes wild, continuing their cheers well after the student has left the stage and the student after them is drowned out and their name may not even be heard nor acknowledged.  


I know it seems backwards but there is a level of respect to be observed and this may not be the ""ok boomer"" kind of moment you might be thinking it is."
1605,"> Being young has freedom from responsibility, but being older has the freedom to pursue your path

I like how you've worded this statement. I'll probably even end up quoting it later. You did leave out one important detail, however: it's your responsibilities that shape much of the path you pursue. Going to college, getting a job are not things a lot of young adults want to do. They're things we have to do, because of responsibilities to ourselves and society at large."

1613,Yes
1614,"It’s quite entertaining. I recommend downloading a plane tracker app. Most are free and can give you an idea of when you’ll see a plane and where to look. Some examples of apps are: flightradar24,and planes live. 


Those are apps I use"
1615,Hai
1616,Of course there’s apps for that lol didn’t even think of that. Thanks!
1617,usually it's called [plane spotting ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_spotting)
1618,Yeeet
1619,This seems pretty fun. Definitely something my friends and I would do. Could be cool at night too!
1620,"In San Francisco there is a strip of hotels on the bay that overlook the SFO landing strip. Honestly, I felt so relaxed just sitting on a park bench and watching these planes land.   
    
If you are not familiar with SFO, there are 2 landing strips parallel to each other. So I would just entertain myself by rooting for 2 planes to land at exactly the same time. You get the same pleasure when that happens as you do when the DVD logo hits a corner of the screen perfectly."
1621,Yooooo CT represent!! I live 20 mins from there!
1622,"My family and I take a picnic round to this park thats right next to an airport, on a sunny day with the planes taking off it can be a real nice, cheap outing."
1623,I haven't used Planes Live so I can't comment on it but Flightradar24 is also awesome for finding info on a given flight number. It saved my ass when I had a short layover and the gate for my second flight wasn't printed on the ticket
1624,My dad took me and my sister a couple times to watch the planes takeoff and land at an airport near us. It's kinda relaxing and a good spot to chill and think or read or whatever
1625,That’s really cool let’s do it together
1626,"I’m an aviation major at my university. There’s plenty of times where I go up to our aviation college’s retired ATC tower and just judge student pilots on their landings. 

There sometimes would be a group of us and we’d be like “oh no, he’s coming in too fast. He’s gonna float down the runway.” and we’re right. We’d just give them all ratings based on how they hit their touchdown point and how smooth the landing looked. Yeah we’re bored a lot."
1627,Lol I’m staying at the Hilton by this airport now! Hello fellow connecticutian
1628,My sister is a pilot and she frequently goes planewatching for fun. Half of the dates she takes guys on consists of going to a local airport and calling out different plane models (or even just sitting in silence and watching planes take off/land)
1629,"This is interesting to do while in an airport. I've watched a plane take off from behind it and it took about 15 minutes before it completely disappeared past being a black dot. I found it crazy how a plane goes from being a whole plane to a tiny black dot then vanish. It also shook so much, I thought it would be just straight but it looked so shaky as it was flying off. Obviously turbulence but I underestimated how turbulence looks."
1630,Maybe it's the kid in me talking but watching these giant fuel-eating composite birds reach into the sky is always a sight to behold.
1631,Absolutely.
1632,Ayy
1633,Ahhh that sounds like loads of fun tbh
1634,Ahhhh yeah it really is a lot of fun
1635,Lmao that sounds like an amazing time
1636,"Well the plane I filmed there was a private charter flight. And there are a small handful of domestic commercial flights still flying for the people who absolutely HAVE to travel but yeah ultimately not many.

I think there were a total of 10 planes that were either on the ground with a registered flight plan, or In the air scheduled to land at BDL today


Edit: oh and cargo planes (Fedex, Amazon prime, UPS, etc.)"
1637,Gotta do what ya gotta do in these times! It’s cool to see how big they look and how close they get

1661,Angel Beats was the anime that took tears from my eyes. But to be fair i do have quite alot of them. High school was not that bad  but it made me forgo a chance to do A levels in a different country and an awsome school.
1662,no lmao
1663,Well I’m part of a lot of organizations on campus and I row crew For my university. So I missing a lot of the social interactions of campus life. But it nice to spend more time with my friends and My twin brother we go to college in different states so we’re all spread out across the country usually now. It’s cool to be able together again at least for a while

1669,"I do, and this is coming from someone who was a complete loser. I wasn’t in any electives, didn’t go to football games, and wasn’t popular or had girls. I just really miss the atmosphere. I miss going to school at 6am, falling asleep on a desk, walking down the hallways. I miss hearing the teacher’s phone ring, I miss doing worksheets, and I definitely miss the feeling of finally getting out and going to eat a pizza with my friends. I think it’s perfectly okay to miss school. You spent a good chunk of your life there, and at one point was literally your second home."
1670,"I miss high-school so much. The simplicity of life, seeing friends everyday and weekend get togethers. Playing on the basketball team, school rivalries, dating, the drama lol."
1671,"I’m in the same boat but a year ahead of you. I haven’t really made any friends in college (which negatively effected my mental health and grades both spring semesters) but I still regularly talk to my high school friends, even though I can feel our relationships slipping away as they all make new friends..."

1693,"I used to hate being treated like the child I was, and now I'm here. Barely adulting."
1694,I mean a ROMANTIC appetite in females
1695,"Yo, same. My quotes are definitely movies or memes."
1696,"Well, I can always be that one mom friend."
1697,I don't understand.
1698,"I gathered, I meant I dont understand the words you used to describe yourself."
1699,Oh the good ole days
1700,Ouch
1701,It's okay to cry. Honest.
1702,"No, I mean a sexual appetite. Are you just trolling me?"
1703,"I can't believe you honestly just quoted Michael Jackson to me.

Does the song resonate with you?

Edited because I realized it sounded rude."

1707,"I want to say they’re meh so far but I’m only one year into my twenties and I definitely feel an upward spiral from my late teenage years. Can’t try too hard to make my twenties perfect, but I have plenty of time to enjoy it."
1708,I learned about this while watching gta v roleplay with a lawyer
1709,Do the same rules apply in medicine/healthcare? Cause I wanna hit some of these anti-vaxxers up lol
1710,"Does not apply. You’re protected by numerous laws assuming you’re just saying stuff and not actually fucking performing surgery or some dumb shit. I think even then the Good Samaritan law still would protect you believe it or not. (Assuming a lot of different factors are true). However I’m too lazy to type up all those factors and I’ve spent enough time thinking about this comment. 



(Not a lawyer, not legal advice)"
1711,"This should also apply to doctors in every field including mental health, if I had a nickel for every time a teacher or someone in a professional field started talking about mental health as if they knew what they were talking about I would be rich."
1712,"This is why you will see the acronym IANAL on a lot of online forums discussing legal issues. 

IANAL = I am not a lawyer

I ^^^^^^do ANAL"
1713,Do it I dare ya. Jk I’d forgot in like a day or two horrible memory
1714,"it exists now r/USALaw


I’ll build it up more once I’m done with homework."
1715,Was this post partially inspired by my silly comment on the other thread about legal advice? Lol.
1716,"Lul 

but yes. Precisely."
1717,Partially. The rest of the inspiration came from my friends who think they know more than everyone.
1718,Aaand looks like you've made a new subreddit! Subbed.
1719,"I don't live in America, but I wouldn't mind getting law facts for the day"
1720,GTA 5 role play has taught me a ton about law and law enforcement. Stuff like DOJ and LSPDFR
1721,Thanks!
1722,Nice
1723,"I took a couple classes at a CC during this summer and they used BlackBoard. Canvas has a much slicker UI, is less buggy (when I used the BB app on iOS, I had to manually login every time instead of it storing my login info). Also, it automatically generates analytics on your grades if the Prof allows it (mean and median of scores).

Blackboard feels like it’s from 2007, Canvas feels like a modern webapp imo."
1724,"What are the differences, and why is canvas better?

My uni uses blackboard."
1725,Gonna use this as motivation to try and do well on my final... probably won’t end up using this as motivation
1726,Art History 304. College classes are tiered 100-400 for freshman-senior.
1727,"Thanks, I think most of what you say is right. The app works for me, I don’t need to login every time. But it’s very slow and buggy indeed, as well as the website.

Ny biggest problem with bb is that there’s so many pages for every course and even though they have the same name, the info in there is always different for every course."
1728,Congrats! Your confidence is amazing! You're amazing! Good job!
1729,Blackboard
1730,"Good job, OP, as a fellow struggling student I feel both your joy and pain"
1731,Proud of ya bud
1732,"I got a bad case of “I’m sick of my communication class.” I’ve started turning in everything late, if I turn it in at all. That’s the only class tho and all I need is a C and I’ve got an B/A so I think I can make it. It doesn’t help that all my finals are piling up and that (and art history) are the classes Ive decided to ignore in favor of passing my other classes. 

This is inspiring me to stop procrastinating... but I’m at the airport and incredibly stressed"
1733,Congratulations! I don't know you but I am so glad you got an A!
1734,I'm 24 and I felt the same way every year after my 20th. You get used to it (at least that's what I tell myself to not think too much about it)
1735,Nah ! Your brains not even fully developed yet .. I’m 23 and feel wiser each year ! I’ve also been learning how to live life with more and more peace each year. Embrace the growth and your older age :)

1743,"🎵 Idk about you but I'm feeling 22 🎵

Completely relate although I'm turning 23 in 12 days and I still feel like I'm 17 lol"
1744,You are only old when you say you're old. Or until you are pissing yourself which can start at any age.
1745,"Same age, my 21st birthday feels like both a decade ago and last week. Like I can stroll into a bar and not get carded 90% of the time, but I still feel suspicious lol"

1850,I turn 30 in 8 years so theres that.
1851,"getting worried that it's gonna be too late for me soon honestly, feels pretty damn bad"
1852,I can’t even talk to any girls that i like after a few seconds
1853,"I'm with you man. RemindMe! January 1st, 2029"
1854,"Why do they bully you? Because you get rejected? If that’s the reason you get nervous, let me tell you that I’ve even seen the biggest fu*kboys getting rejected. That’s just part of the game. But sometimes it works out and suddenly your bullies will stand there in awe when you arrive with a girl holding your hand. What I’m trying to say is: don’t stop asking out you WILL get better at it i.e. less nervous. And concerning the bullies:  I don’t know if you’re still going to school but once you go to university or something else, it will get much better. There, no one really cares about you except for a small circle of close friends. If you are in your last year or so at school it might not be worth it anymore to do something about those bullies, at this point I would just wait"
1855,"How do you know what other people, you don’t know yet, are thinking about you? Don’t just restrict yourself to the people that dislike you"
1856,"Yup, I ended the decade with a medical school acceptance. Here's to the future, may the odds ever be in our favor!!"
1857,"I should have been doing all that 5 years ago but fuck it 

2020 is the year bois"
1858,"One question: how often have you been rejected by now?
Do you fear being rejected, solely because of being rejected or is it being rejected and others(maybe your bullies) finding out? In the latter case you might want to ask out when you two are alone after school maybe"
1859,Well that won’t stress me out at all....
1860,"Don't do that, don't give me hope..."
1861,I know! Thinking about how much changed between now and '10 is mind boggling.
1862,"Pfff 6 times.. THOSE ARE ROOKIE NUMBERS, YOU GOTTA PUMP THOSE NUMBERS! No honestly that’s not a lot. Definitely not enough to say you are giving up. And why are your „friends“ bullying you? Is it just the normal bullying between good friends or actual bullying. If so, talk to them. If they are good people they will stop and might even encourage you. otherwise you should consider finding better friends."
1863,">The people that **bully** me are mostly my **friends**.

Friends =/= Bullies

Do yourself a favour.

Get better friends."
1864,"I don’t get how your bullies try to befriend you. Anyway try to be casual when asking out. Don’t rush anything. Maybe get to know her first in normal everyday situations. Get her to notice you and then you can ask her after a while. This could happen within an evening at a party or during the course of a few days, depending on the situation. Asking someone right away might overwhelm them. 

Not freaking out is something you have to manage yourself. I managed to change myself during my last years of school. I just said yes to uncomfortable situations like presentations etc. and managed to change from someone rather quiet and inconspicious to someone who was regarded as self-confident and trustworthy. 

This change might need some maturity that just comes with the years but working on it at a young age already is a good thing."
1865,"I was just thinking about this. It’s gonna be crazy to see how I’ll end up when it’s about to be 2030. I’m fresh out of high school and I just left home and it’s impossible to think I’ll probably be married, own a house, start my career, etc. etc, etc. by 2029. Aghhhhhhhh"
1866,"Never thought about this, now I’m worried but also excited"
1867,"you, my friend, just gave me the scariest thought of the week. I’m 20, and 21 in september.... let’s not rush life now, shall we?"
1868,"The new decade where I'll soon reach the end of bein a teenager

1902,"Um… You’re taking it a bit too far. First, it’s not like this comic (at least) is propaganda for anything. If anything, it makes me wanna work less, which I’m pretty sure is the complete opposite of what right parties think. And second, I think we can all think for ourselves and decide what we feel is right or wrong. This is not r/teenagers.

But most of all, do not confuse the art and the artist. His comics are funny. End of the story. Just like Hitler’s paintings and Charles Manson’s songs are really cool even though the guys are not my idols."

1904,It's actually true.
1905,"it 100% is not subjective, it is purely factual. he has posted things against Jewish people, people of color, gay people, trans people, follows and supports alt-right politicians and commentators. the only way it could be more explicit is if he wore an arm band.

as to why I'm posting ""Nazi content"", I'm not. this post has zero ties whatsoever to Nazism, and the creator whom I disapprove of has had his name scrubbed from the image (for those who don't read the comments) and I've attached a disclaimer that he is a Nazi for anyone who *does* read the comments. if you're told a creator is a Nazi, and you still seek out their content (to support it), you're probably already a Nazi and I cannot help you.

so why block out his name just to mention it anyway? because if someone saw his name on the image and didn't know any better, they might search him up thinking he is relatable, visiting his page and giving him clicks. this way, the only mention of his name has a disclaimer attached so it can be known *not* to support him and further spreading the word to anyone who has heard of him but did not know he is a Nazi, that he is a Nazi, and not to support him. unless you're a Nazi. which I hope you're not.

and uhhh no, I don't feel bad about stealing from Nazis hahahaha fuck Nazis why would I feel bad about stealing from a Nazi"
1906,"No problem, it was my original intention. Thank you for receiving the intended message! Also, since I didn't mention it, I do wanna confirm I think it is indeed suuuuuper scummy to white out an artist's name and I would never do that on any other comic, this was purely a special case since the artists does not deserve to have his name anywhere except in a disclaimer."
1907,Don't downvote my dude he just didn't know who pebblechuck is
1908,something something nazi
1909,it was definitely new to some people
1910,"fine, I'll give you 99% factual since you choose to be pedantic. No, he was not a registered member of the Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party in 1930s Germany, you got me. no way he could represent the Nazi ideals then, right? oh wait, except here is him [supporting the Charlottesville Unite The Right rally, all but outright explicitly supporting race supremacy, literally denying the Holocaust, and strawmanning Jewish people.](https://imgur.com/a/xEmY3AM) 

if it takes literally gassing Jewish people to label someone a Nazi, you're waiting for a tragedy not actually trying to stop a dangerous ideology. If actual genocide is what it takes to get you to disapprove of a thought process, I have no idea what the point is. drunk tweets? man is stone-cold sober. 

as for the last paragraph, I wrote 2 entire paragraphs to explain it to you, including a ""why scrub his name to mention it anyway?"" paragraph, and my answer is unchanged. So feel free to re-read them if you'd like, I think you failed to understand the first time. 

if it makes people ""more interested"" after reading he is a Nazi, then those people are also Nazis! lol"
1911,"> edgelords are more likely to be alt-right types

Where does that come from? I don’t even think younger people really understand racism. If they are racist or hating specific groups of people, it’s (at least most likely) bc they didn’t have a proper education, not bc some idiot is posting comics on his website. But from my very limited understanding of basic psychology, they could just be asking for attention. Like most edgy people.

Also, after seeing a few of those fucked up comics, I can say that they all require some degree of analysis and general knowledge, except for the most obvious ones. And I’m pretty sure that ""edgelords"" couldn’t care less about general knowledge and analysis.

Or I’m just that snowflake having a very slow brain but I’m pretty sure it’s not the case.

Although, I’ll say you’re right about the art and artist thing, that’s a good argument. In that case, let’s just not spread his racist and supremacist comics. Which is exactly what most people are doing. Hell, there’s even r/antifastonetoss.

Ultimately, maybe we’re both right and wrong but I think that it’s not requiring a full wipe of Stonetoss’ comics off of the face of the internet. Which is impossible anyway."

1917,"Fasisti su govna, eto sta."
1918,"Yes, but relevence?"
1919,It’s a comic of his
1920,"I give you that, but isn't it counter intiuitive to remove the watermark and then go into the comment and call the artist a nazi? If anything it makes people unaware of them more curious and drives more traffic to their site than if we just whited out the watermark and left it at that."
1921,"Fully agree. It’s very much idiotic to do so. 

Best course of action is to simply not use his content, or if you use it to cover the watermark and not mention him."
1922,[deleted]
1923,"I really thought this wasn’t r/teenagers but now i’m having to explain a simple concept that I’m honestly baffled by that ppl don’t understand it.

So firstly no this is not a piece of political propaganda. I never said it was.
However saying that posting his comics isn’t helping him spread his propaganda is also wrong.

His humor is edgy like this cause edgelords are more likely to be alt-right types (or getting there). They also tend to be younger. Say what you will about even stonetoss’ worst bigoted comics … they are edgy. His propaganda is aimed for them. Not for the ones among us who can think for themselves.

This is why it’s kinda difficult to (impossible) to separate the art from the artist. Based on the “art” i know he is a nazi. I don’t know anything else about the guy. Everything i know about him i know because of his horrible cartoons of which a lot contain propaganda.
When we talk about separating the art from the artist, well we only really do that if the personal life and the professional work have little in common. 
Hitler’s paintings don’t contain antisemitic rethoric, but if they did we wouldn’t talk about “Seperating the art from the artist” now would we.
Similarly Michael Jackson has no songs about allegedly being a child molester.
Manson to my knowledge has no songs about stabbing pregnant women in their homes.

But Kevin Spacey for example did star in a movie where he tries to seduce a high schooler. I’ve watched American Beauty both before and after the scandal, telling you now that it is impossible to separate the art from the artist.

And stonetoss had a shitload of nazi cartoons. Ones containing strawmen and other logical fallacies and misrepresentations of people, groups of people, arguments, etc.
Not to mention the nazi shit.


If we could all think for ourselves than propaganda would not exist."

1926,"Yeah, okay, but these aren’t the ones we mostly see on here. At least, I never saw any like those."
1927,"The existence is 4chan making the case that edgelords tend to be more likely to be alt-right.

Propaganda isn’t meant to appeal to people with a general knowledge of stuff. It’s meant to form a false narrative.

That and r/antifastonetoss is a subreddit mocking his comics. They’re not spreading it. They’re using it as left-wing meme templates."
1928,"That’s… not how to do statistics lol. 4chan is one of the worst places on the internet, and they don’t ban alt-rights and stuff so of course you’ll find them there.

""Good"" propaganda isn’t meant to appeal to people with general knowledge. But in this case, I swear that I wouldn’t have understood most of the bad comics I saw if it wasn’t for the explanations below them. And I have literally zero general knowledge bc I couldn’t care less.

And yes, r/antifastonetoss are mocking his comics but that’s exactly my point. Stopping the spread of all his comics isn’t gonna wipe the guy off of the internet. But we can’t anyway. So I don’t see what’s wrong in posting his comics that aren’t propaganda. In the current era of the ""gimme now or gimme never"" that we’re living in, I doubt the kids will wanna type his name on Google to know more."

1931,"That's just speculation, personnally i've lived through wars and bombs when growing and luckily im still alive and after moving overseas I look at other people and find myself built different...able to withstand much more stress be it in a workplace or studies. I find it as a strength instead."
1932,"Lol i don't give a shit, bless you man"
1933,I never thought about it as a trauma! well because it was our lifestyle back then... it was a normal thing to live through.
1934,"People break down after heavy stress, suffer anxiety attacks etc i don't know if you got what I meant, but i have realised that i function under stress better than others do in my workplace. Im talking about basic work load here. I never thought about it as a trauma rather than a strength and it made my personality steonger."
1935,Exactly
1936,I needed to hear this again.
1937,"Hiya! I live by the ""10 rule"" (or that's what I like to call it) where I believe there's always going to be at least 10 people out there who are worse and 10 people who are better than you. For example, ""There are at least 10 people in the world whose lives are worse off than mine and there are at least 10 people who have it better than me"" or ""There are at least 10 people who are more talented than me in \_\_\_\_, but there are also at least 10 who are less talented than me in \_\_\_\_."" Does that make sense? 

I bring this up because it reminds me that literally nothing else matters when you compare your life in relation to other people's. Yes, some people may have suffered more but also there are others who did not suffer more—you shouldn't compare! You have the right to feel your feelings and nothing good ever comes from comparing your trauma to the trauma of others!!! I'm also rambling but I'm just here to affirm that you have the right to feel sad and you're not selfish at all! Feelings stemming from trauma won't change quickly, but things do get better and you should be proud of yourself!"
1938,"Like this perspective a lot, but uh, who tf is downvoting you lol?"
1939,"Hahaha thanks, but that’s not what my family says. I’m pretty sure I’m just useless. It’s fun being adopted from the other side of the world and not having any genetic family health history. Sigh. But yeah, I 100% am privileged to even be alive right now, so I have no room to complain. My “backstory” is so dumb compared to those who have truly suffered. Why did I have any right to attempt suicide. And think of those who did and didn’t get rescued in time. Fuck dude, am I selfish? I’ve been trying to change that for a long time but... sorry no one wants to hear a stranger on the internet mumbling to themselves."
1940,"Let me know if I'm off but it seems like since you lived through a bunch of heavy stuff already, what people find stressful seems small to you because losing a job is still better than getting bombed. Is that what your viewpoint is sort of?"
1941,"Oh ok cool. Yeah idk why it's different for others. I've never been bombed before but the stuff I went through kind of left me with the fear of it happening again. Even when I'm not consciously thinking about it, I find myself doing things to try and prevent it."
1942,I think it may be different when it's something everyone you know is going through with you. Correct me if I'm wrong.
1943,"I'm not sure. For me, it's tied to losing loved ones which lots of people go through."
1944,I meant more the whole country at the exact same time as they mentioned above.
1945,Is there actual research on this? Or is this speculation/an anecdote?
1946,I really think it depends on a person's sensitivity level as well. Have you ever heard of highly sensitive people?
1947,Maybe. I guess a death is pretty personal but everyone having the exact same disaster might have a different impact.

2131,"I always sit at the computers back in the ""Teen"" section & I'm 21. It's because no one ever uses them & I don't feel like sitting next to someone who's middle-aged as I code my Tumblr for awhile lol."
2132,"I do that too! I know that those books are generally more my vibe. In the 'adult book' section I just don't know where to look and where to start. Sometimes my mom recommends me a certain book she liked, but most of the time I read young adult books! Absolutely no shame!"
2133,That's exactly what happened to me. My friend and I walked passed the neighborhood creep we call Lester watching porn on the public computer in the library
2134,Wonder if his first name is Moe
2135,Lester the Moe Lester
2136,"Not at all, 24 here and checked out my first harry potter book about 2 months ago"
2137,I work in a library and a Barnes and Noble before this. I’ve seen old men buying the heck out of the Fairy Tale manga and some other manga that’s not shy about fan service. You’re fine lol
2138,"nah man, you do you"
2139,"I go to the library all the time. In fact I am there rn. I go there mostly to vedge out/websurf/jobhunt/etc.  

I read sometimes but read e-books. But I do look at the YA section too and I'm 25 y/o male. I usually look at them and if I see a book I get it on my Kindle App."
2140,me too! i’m only 18 so i guess i’m still in the target audience for young adult but i just don’t know where to start with adult books! i’ve read so many YA books that it’s really easy to find the ones that appeal to me but the adult fiction books are a mystery to me unless someone recommends them or they’re well known..
2141,Thank you. As you can tell I’ve never read it. I’m intimidated by the sheer size of the collection.
2142,I’ve been there watching high school DxD on the library computers and reading Monster Musume in the library. I spent 1-2 hours waiting there every weekday after highschool until I got my car. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about at the library.
2143,"Honestly, with how little people read now (At least the people around me that is), I'd say you're just pretty good for reading at all, and I wouldn't really see anyone criticizing just for the different types of books you prefer."
2144,"I work in a library and literally spend most my time reading picture books and juvenile books. There is no judgement I promise you.

Edit: Just a heads up there's actually a lot of YA books in the adult section too. They're there because someone decided that they were meant to be there. Like some times half a series is in YA and the other half is in Adult fic. It's weird but it happens."
2145,*Fairy Tail
2146,"As someone who works at a library (I’ve worked at a university and public) I can tell you that literally no one is there judging you. I don’t even pay attention to what people are looking at/checking out. Libraries are essentially alternate dimensions where you can do almost anything within reason, you do you!"
2147,"Not quite tbh, I always go to the adult section looking for field guides since I am 10. But somehow the library here seems a bit empty though, hence I sometimes look alone. But also, it's choice according to the reader, no one would care though."
2148,"One time I sat in the lobby of my English building in college reading Percy Jackson, I understand what your saying but I think most people are just glad people our age are reading anything other than text messages and out of context news articles. Also read what you want haha the people who may judge aren’t worth giving credibility to."
2149,"I love young adult books. Hell, my library even has a book club centered around the genre. They're not just for teens. :)"
2150,"Kinda, but that’s where I found the first book I read in English, and it turned out to be a lovely story about two girl friends falling in love! The book was Unspeakable, by Abbie Rushton, if anyone’s interested."
2151,Hell no I'm 19 and mostly read kids books. One of my favorite authors is Dav Pilkey (Captain Underpants and Dogman) and Rolad Dahl. I also want to get a collection of Dr Seuss books
2152,To be honest the only adult book I've read from beginning to end is Doctor Sleep
2153,"Who cares. Look, read whatever you like, you only have one life."
2154,"I do and feel EXACTLY the same ! What a relief to know that I'm not alone :D

  


I tried litterature meant for adults but I just don't enjoy it as much as novels written for teenagers..."
2155,"Well first of all, not that you need to be told again but you are still a young adult.   
100% real though, I've seen some shit in libraries.  

   
As long as you're not filling a book with jam and trying to fuck it in the stacks corner, other library users and the staff wont give much of a shit about anything you do.  


If you're quiet and just minding your own business I'd be surprised if anyone even noticed what section you were in"

2185,does this change as u move up in years? all my professors in the summer courses i took wanted me to use a title (i'm an incoming freshmen btw and took some college courses in hs)
2186,"Same especially when i hit 15/16, adults out of school just wanted me to call them by their first names"
2187,I STILL have to work on that after 10 years of school
2188,this is just working in general lol whether ur  15 or 20
2189,Depends on the professor. Some only want to be called by their first name and others will get butthurt if you call them mr instead of Dr.

2202,Is that watercolour? Looks very nice!
2203,"Very pretty ~~drawing~~. Aesthetically pleasing!

edit: its not all a drawing but idk what else to call it so im leaving it there lol"
2204,"aw that’s awesome! i’ve always wanted to watercolor, is it hard to get the hang of?"
2205,It took a while but I got there eventually lol. I use tombow dual brush pens to watercolor with and I enjoy that more than using typical watercolor paints
2206,This but unironically
2207,Maybe we should get rid of it.
2208,Violence is not a solution.  But people since history have used it as such. Politicians are rich and protected. They almost never have to pay  for inciting great violence. The civilians always pay for wars caused by the politicians.
2209,I agree
2210,Power usually attracts horrid people.
2211,"This is why at least one person has proposed embedding the nuclear launch codes in a capsule surgically placed on a volunteer's heart. The president is given a steak knife and a simple choice: carry out the cold-blooded murder of at least one before he can order the murder of hundreds of millions, if not the total extinction of humanity."
2212,"The volunteer would be cut open without hesitation, and it would subsequently be announced that he ""fell in the line of duty"".

If this volunteer were one of the president's family members or close friends / monetary donors, only then things might be different."
2213,Stop my penis can only get so erect
2214,I agree but feel like a hypocrite because of my job.
2215,That's a good point. I wonder what it would be like if a president's campaign donors were all entered into a pool to be randomly selected  to be the code carrier if nobody volunteered under the modified conditions.
2216,What a load of crap.
2217,why is /r/youngadults indistinguishable from /r/depression recently lol
2218,A sign of the times we are living in

Maybe you should look into your career. How can you help there? I felt like you for a good while, but I'm going into nursing and somehow that's made me feel better. Makes me feel like I'm at least doing my part

Maybe you should think about what you could do professionally that would feel good for you. It's the right time to be thinking about that"
2221,"Bro my second job is an office job and I’m just now seeing how toxic office culture is. Everyone is so entitled and passive aggressive it’s nuts. 

It reminds me of high school JROTC. There were always a select group of kids who were “high ranking” and had a stick up their ass and an authority complex. Except in the office that’s like everyone."
2222,Yeah and the worst is when an office culture previously had no minorities and then you get hired and the culture doesnt change at all 😅😅😅😅
2223,"Well, sounds good! Still doing your part, that sounds like a bit of a gruelling job but it still has to be done

2240,Is this your hobby? If so it's a neat one.
2241,"That makes sense. There's a lot of light pollution where I live too so I don't get to see views like this. I remember the last time I got to see the night sky without it, was years ago...but definitely amazing.

Out of curiosity, would a tripod and long exposure time be needed for a pic like this? I imagine the comet is moving fast enough to mess that up."
2242,"Yeah, you need a tripod and long exposure. This is nine 15 second exposures stacked together into one image, and even 15 seconds was enough to cause some blur on the comet and the stars."

2286,THIS IS ACTUALLY ME. So relatable. Wow I thought I was alone in this feeling..
2287,I feel that at times as well and yes I am 21. Any adult place feels weird tbh.

Hang in there, maybe someone would already be in front of you. Someone you have feelings for, and you don't even realise that those feelings exist. Don't lose hope."
2531,"> confidence/looks

My band-aid solutions that work for most people: 
- lifting (you’ll grow out the desirable muscles and will not get “bulky” unless you’re a world-class powerlifter, DM me if you need some fitness advice/a plan and are willing to put in the effort)
- clothing (glam your wardrobe up, lots of inspo out there)
- nice hair (i’m a sucker for girls with good hair)
- general hygiene (do you smell good? you have a daily-use fragrance? washing your face and throwing on a bit of sunscreen? bonus points if it has toner. etc.)

> modern dating

Honestly, this is only a small segment of the dating pool. Yeah, some people like to play games. Yeah, some people like to keep things casual.

I’ve never really seen a problem with this. I think it’s great that we’re more sexually liberated. I guess it isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but you can test out the waters and see if you’re physically attracted to them (and have sexual chemistry). If you click on an emotional level along with your physical level, you can talk about dating. I think that this is the more fun route. Plus, it’ll help with your confidence and help you get over your ex.

There is still a big chunk of people who purely want a serious relationship, you just have to put in the effort to find them. Search for people within your friend groups. My sister’s current boyfriend is the brother of one of her sorority sisters. Great guy."
2532,"Well I don't have any guy friends, almost all my friends are girls. I wouldn't want to date right away since my breakup was only 2 weeks ago, but I hated dating in college. I was sick of being talked to for 2 weeks and then it stops when things get more serious. That's why I dated my ex- he was older and he became my best friend. It was a heartbreaking breakup because we both still love each other."
2533,19M and i feel the exact same as you do when it comed to the dating scene. Im not sure where to hang out if im not a party and hookup kinda person. Maybe try out hobbies and make friends along the way and see where it goes?
2534,"I am scared of dating but for different reasons, i'm 20M, in the closet in a small town in the countryside."
2535,"I \[20M\] have been single for a little more over a year now. I was in a relationship for 2 & 1/2 years with my HS Sweetheart and I was in a similar situation as you. She was the first person that I ever dated, we both felt a click since the beginning and we were best friends as well. But over time, people become distant, and we each have different goals and paths in life, so she broke up with me to dedicate time to ""work on herself"" , but she ended up being in small time relationships that didn't last very long. And with that, my self-esteem lessened, I developed trust issues, and I thought I would never find anything close to love like that again.

But now I'm here, started working out and lost weight, gathered back my confidence, got a new job that pays well, and Im getting used to being single again, and I love it!

My best advice to you is to just go with the flow. Life has its ups and downs, like breakups, it will happen more than once. Think about it this way - this is just a stepping stone in life, and that things will get better, and if you dedicate this time to becoming your best self, either through new interests and hobbies, experimentation, going out with friends and just enjoy life, you'll probably find someone worthwhile when you least expect it. 

You're only 22, you're still very young, you don't have to have everything figured out. So don't be bummed out that things like that don't work out, eventually, somethings will. It doesn't matter how many times you get pushed down, its about how many times you get back up. So take it easy on yourself, kiddo, everything will work out as intended to!"
2536,"Not true imo. Physical appearance plays a very large role in dating.

Call me shallow, but I’m not going to have sex with someone if I’m not physically attracted to them, let alone date them."
2537,"I only ever dated one person, when she and I were like 12. She's the best person I've ever met though we're not close anymore. We pretty much drifted apart in high school and yeah. Now we're both 19, in college. 

She's going through a crisis right now and I just really wish I was right there with her but I am doing all I can to support her through this tough time since I'm in Arizona and she's in DC. I moved to NYC in June. We used to live 20 mins away from each other but now a 4 hour train away. 

I love her so incredibly much and want her to have what's best for her. She's the one who's influenced me the most to become who I am today. She's the most kind, most caring, most supportive person I've ever met. We don't really talk anymore but we still are there for each other to support each other, and right now I'm really doing everything I can to support her. 

I have personally met her mom and her now dying grandma. Her grandma was really kind and sweet and it's really sad that she will be gone soon. I wish she could still be around but at the same time I just hope the suffering ends soon because the time is always the worst part. I'm always checking her stories and am fully willing to talk with her about it or anything to make her feel better. 

Btw breakups are tough, but I'm glad you're able to end things peacefully with no drama. Shit happens, sometimes you just gotta accept reality as it is. If you need someone to talk to or a friend in general, feel free to reach out to me. I'm quite busy often for obvious reasons, but I'll be around."
2538,"I've never been in a relationship, and most days I struggle to see how anyone could love me in order to be in a relationship, but I still long deeply to be able to do all those romantic things I've never been able to do, even if it's just cuddling on a couch in (not awkward) silence.

Like, my 2 best friends are married and while I love being with them, it's really hard because of the little things they do to/for each other. Like her and I were playing a game the other day and he was doing some schoolwork, and she just out of nowhere asked him if he would be her valentine. Out of absolutely nowhere. And it kinda broke my heart.

But you know what, I'm also very scared of a relationship if I somehow found someone who likes me. Like what if I become too dependent, is it too clingy to want someone that I want to be with all the time (not in the ""no you can't hang out with so and so"") what if it's just a first impression they like and I end up broken hearted. I feel like shit right now and that just sounds like a nightmare to me."

2541,"Just got out of an abusive relationship myself and I think the same way you do. I’m not unattractive but I’m not anything special. I do workout pretty consistently and that does make me feel more confident in myself however my last relationship makes it hard to believe in love. If I was to find someone I was mutually emotionally and physically attracted to, I don’t think I would be able to reciprocate the love that they might expect. Times are hard but maybe it’ll work out for us in the end who knows"
2542,"not scared really, but I don't have very much hope for things working out well for me"
2543,"Ehhhh, it really does just depend all on who you’re with. I’ve met like 13 year olds more mature than me, but I’m also more mature than some of my elder cousins. 

Yeah, the dating scene can be shallow but kinda always was shallow its just more prominent now. But most people are also increasingly attracted to character. Don’t get me wrong physical appearances do matter, but in so far as what they tell someone about themselves. 

“They dress like shit and have a terrible body, they don’t care about themselves”

“Well kept but not terribly fit, they does care to some extent”

Just present yourself appropriately and you will get attention, put yourself out there and you will get consideration. But if you don’t try at all because you’re scared nothing is gonna happen."
2544,">love isn’t just feelings, it’s actions and really committing and choosing to show love, even when you don’t feel it.

Precisely this. A lot of people that even I know personally are too caught up in the fairy tales and they don't realize that love takes work. 

Fairy tales tend to confuse love and infatuation, so now many people are expecting to become infatuated with someone and for it to last for 60 years...and it just doesn't work like that.

But to answer your question...yes. I've had the same gf for 5 years and couldn't really picture myself with another, so it's hard for me to answer, but finding somebody new sounds decently difficult

Good luck! I *know* there are people out there who realize this and are feeling the exact same way as you are."
2545,"Hey there! Somewhat similar situation here, just got dumped a few days ago. If I can offer some advice, take this time to focus on you and build yourself up. I saw a quote recently along the lines of ""your education, career, and money will never wake up one day and leave you"".  Take a step back: you're young and have so much time to find a partner. I'm sure you've heard this a thousand times, but looks truly are not everything. You know what's really sexy? Having your life together, being happy with yourself. I know it's incredibly rough right now and I fully empathize with you. Date and fall in love with yourself."
2546,"I feel you. I’m in my first year of college and I’ve been looking for friends but most of the people I met want to date. I’m not feeling a relationship rn and I’m kind of scared to dive into hookup culture. 

The worst one in particular is when I met one guy who introduced me to his friends and we all had a lot in common to the point where it was scary! Turns out though two of the guys (including the one that introduced me to the group) only talked to me because they wanted to be my boyfriend. When I talked to them told them that I wanted to be their friend and that I’m happy single... many times. They ignored that most of the time. When they finally realized that though, they got upset and the whole group ghosted me."
2547,"I see your problem. But there is a large crowd of people that don't play games or hook up, but are mostly scared to even talk to others with fears of looking either like a creep or embarassing themselves."
2548,"I know where you're coming from and that definitely helps, but you're still going to have to take some time to find out what you really want coming out of this and how you want to move forward from this step. I'm someone who usually puts other's well-being before my own but I've realized after my last relationship that I need to do what's best for me to make me happy, exploring and learning as I go. The fact that I'll never know exactly when 'the one' pops into my life is what excites me and keeps me moving day to day, hoping to run into a cute girl at a restaurant or at college. People just kind of suck and mess around a lot and it affects every age group, so I'd say just try to do what you need to do make yourself feel happy and wanted again!"
2549,Happy to help brother <3 feel free to dm if you ever need to just talk! I know how much it can help
2550,"That's really sad. But hey, don't lose hope! You'll meet a lot of new people in the next years. Don't put pressure on yourselves. It'll happen naturally. You'll meet someone, and you'll fall for them so much that you'd be willing to change countries to be with them. 

College.. is a weird time. Everyone wants to fuck, no one wants to be serious. Don't put too much importance to that phase."
2551,"Hmm... see yeah,  like I did say it does matter but its also like you’re not really gonna stick with someone just cuz they’re attractive. 

It’s a synergy between the two, like how is the decent looking guy with the 8/10 girl? He’s charismatic/funny/whatever. 

When I said physical matters on what they tell us about themselves that’s true, but you said you won’t have sex with someone you won’t find attractive yeah? That’s where that character comes in, it makes someone more appealing."
2552,"> you said you won’t have sex with someone you won’t find attractive yeah? That’s where that character comes in, it makes someone more appealing.

Nah man, I wouldn’t have sex with someone who I don’t find to be *physically* attractive. If she’s a sweet person, caring, intelligent, etc (good character), I’ll be incentivized to stick around and consider dating them.

I agree with what you said in the first line, but your third line contradicts that. I would fuck someone who’s *physically attractive*; I would date someone who’s *physically attractive with an attractive personality*. I would not fuck someone who I don’t find physically attractive. Looks make me fuck you, personality keeps you around.

If I was into their personality but was not immediately physically attracted to them, I’d say some shit like “oh you’re just like my sister” or whatever to make my non-romantic intentions clear. It’d be hard to see them in a more sexual light if my lizard brain wasn’t immediately physically attracted to them lol."
2553,"Lol nah I get you, but for me at least I start seeing people more attractively if I like their personality."
2554,"Yeah, I kinda feel it; I’ll be more into a girl that I’m already attracted to if she displays good characteristics. My standards for physical attraction (and, frankly, attraction to personality) are fucked tbh though."
2555,The best thing about how acceptable hooking up and casual dating has become is that people are up front when that's what they want. As someone who likes to keep a casual a lot of the time I've personally gotten frustrated finding that a lot of people only seem to be interested in serious relationships. There's someone and something out there for everyone.
2556,We are all very happy for you. Love and peace
2557,"Bro I hate college lol, it sent me to a psyche ward for 2 weeks for trying to hurt myself because of it, I hate being an art student."
2558,"Understandable, I feel like I only made the friends I did by getting lost with other people and going through the adventure of that. But also I think it’ll take more time you know?"
2559,"yeah I am a freshman! good luck with your second year, I hope it’s a good one!"
2560,Yeah. Main thing is I’m commuting instead of living on campus so I don’t have many opportunities outside of class to actually meet anyone. Plus I’ve lived near the campus my whole life so I know where (most?) things are
2561,"Aw shit that doesn’t sound great, I’m sorry to hear it. Are you doing better now? I contemplated going into the arts but settled on CS"
2562,I wish I was smart enough to go to college. That'd probably be the best place for me to make friends and I like to learn although I don't remember half the stuff I've learned over the years I just think it's a better pass time than sitting on my ass
2563,"Thanks, you too!!"
2564,"I believe you can try community college? if it’s truly a thing you want to do I don’t think you’d be limited, you just have to see what options you have and if they’re possible"
2565,"I'm good now, on multiple meds that definitely help a lot, it was just a lot of stuff built up over time, was taking 4 classes, 1 art and the rest just normal required courses like English/speech, my art class more or less assigned something very time consuming and large every class, I have an issue where I have to be as perfect as I can or I get really anxious, on top of the fact that I have social anxiety, so critique and presentation is also difficult, more or less due to the amount of work from other classes I wasn't able to finish my art assignments, my mental state was pretty fucked at the time and usually when I'm anxious I draw to get my mind off things, I started drawing and realized that I was producing much much less quality work than I usually do, this was the straw that broke the camel's back because I broke from that moment and hurt myself as both a cry for help and punishment for my inability to draw, after that my concerned mom took me to a new psychiatrist and he made me self administer to a psych ward, rest is history, on meds, taking a lot less classes, regaining confidence and getting over some trauma, things looking good for now at least."
2566,"My first semester was the best time of my life and my second semester was by far the worst. Heading into my third and hoping to get better a bit but yeah, there's still a lot of drama that can come out of college so stay strong and don't neglect yourself for your social life!"

2569,"Yeah I'm doing good now, on multiple different medications which definitely help me deal with my issues in a healthier way, all of my art classes have been very demanding, at the time it happened I was taking 4 classes in total, 1 art and the rest required courses, long story short I have major anxiety and depression issues so towards the end of the semester when finals and a fuck ton of work was getting thrown at me, long story short I could barely complete my work without breaking down, my anxiety made me fear starting my work (art assignments that is, we have to do critiques where we more or less present and have others judge), when I finally managed to sit down and start, my depression would kick in filling my mind with bad thoughts and irrational concerns since there was no stimuli to distract me from it, all of this plus a mental break I had after I tried drawing just for fun to relieve anxiety, found out I was producing much lower quality stuff than normal, at the time my anxiety and depression were quite high if that makes sense, lost it and hurt myself as both a cry for help and punishment, afterwards after my concerned mom saw my injury, sent me to a psychiatrist who forced me to self administer at a hospital (if I didn't he would baker act me, which entails police cuffing me, getting thrown into a cop car, then being brought directly to the hospital where they forcibly administer me), after two weeks of being imprisoned I finally got the help I needed, am on a bunch of different meds but they're helping greatly, I just got back into school and am only taking one class to see how it goes, still dealing with a good bit of trauma so school in general makes me anxious, but I'm slowly working towards being comfortable and self sufficient again."

2571,Lmao relatable
2572,Thx. It's gonna be a wild ride for sure!
2573,"I absolutely loved (and still do) all the new doors that open to try new things. Work hard, but also make sure you keep experiencing everything because it won't always be as easy as it is now."
2574,"Congrats!

How did you like the weed? Lmao"
2575,"Ohhh I see, have you tried joining clubs and what not?"
2576,I hope your journey to be comfortable and self sufficient isn’t a rough one. I’m glad the meds are helping too!! I wish you the best of luck bud
2577,"Something I've learned is that mental health is a lot more important than I originally thought, college isn't a race and should be finished at your own pace, I hope everything goes well, don't be afraid to ask for help, you don't want to let it get to my level (again if you've already been there that is), are you seeing a therapist? Even though it takes quite some time it helps a bit, just even having someone else to talk to that is. Wish you the best  :("
2578,"Same, on the first day the friends I already knew introduced me to their new friends, so I'm familiar with like half of my college(small town things)."
2579,"College is the greatest time ever, but you still gotta be responsible. Im in college rn and its been fucking amazing"
2580,"Dude I'm in the same situation! I'm an overweight person but I made up my mind to go join the college sports team :)
I've been practicing for two weeks and I kinda love/hate it. (hate when I'm exercising, love it when I get to rest afterwards and dream about getting in shape)

I've made some friends too who share the same humor I do.    
I do miss some things from my home like not having to do laundry and having a chance to slack around anytime I want.    

I've been here for about 20 days and it's better than I expected.
Looking forward to getting my degree and experiencing more fun times."
2581,"I wish my college experience was the same, with less than a year before I graduate I feel like college has destroyed my mental health, I’ve lost my sense of self, I don’t even know who I am anymore or why I’m here. I wish I had gone to a college where I didn’t know anybody so that I was forced to get out of my comfort zone."
2582,"I really didn’t start enjoying college until after I joined my sorority. Before that I kind of just went to class, work, then bed. It can be really difficult to balance work, school, and a social life when you haven’t had to in the past."
2583,"I started college 3 weeks ago and I feel the same way, there’s tons of room for opportunity and trying new things you never thought you would. For me I’m working on trying to find a balance between academics and the social scene. Good luck to the both of us lol. What’s your major?"
2584,"It was certainly an experience lmao, I’m going to try and limit myself with how often I do it. The effects are cool when I actually get them, but I think making it a once in a while thing will make the experience better"
2585,"Danggggg, I go to a huge public school and I’m the only one from my class there so it’s been quite the time, but I’m enjoying it none the less"
2586,"For having ideas that aren’t based in reality and defending them tooth and nail lol, don’t allow him the opportunity to use mental gymnastics and let himself continue to think that he’s right.

At least, I’m speaking regarding his “romantics” post. Nothing else. *Edit: I’m not a member of the Discord server, nor am I familiar with this user other than seeing a couple different posts where he argued with other users. Frankly, I don’t really care about whatever drama caused several users to dislike him. I’m just commenting on what I’ve seen.*

To /u/jameswon3tk

You need to gain a better bearing on reality man. You need to learn when to stop. You need to interact with real people and work on your social skills. I’m saying this from a place of concern, because you need to see the issues in your ways (or at least, from other’s perspectives) and you seem to have some social issues based on my limited experience. Don’t take this as me bashing you. Take this as genuine criticism. Feel free to DM me if you need to and I’ll try to help, but just work on it and try to be more critical of yourself/more cognizant of the social implications of your actions.

And listen, Reddit isn’t a social network, but if you’re pissing people off here, those same people would merely ignore you in real life. It worries me because those ideas that you pitched in that post that I referred to earlier would not be common with people who have active and healthy social lives. At least, not if you’re socializing with normal people.

See the thread below. Just work on bettering yourself and becoming a bit more level headed. I’m not saying this in a negative way, but I just see a lot of flaws in your logic and communication which leads me to believe that there’s an issue at hand. One that you can correct.

2611,"And if in a legal state and decide to smoke, also have lots of water cause your mouth’s gonna be dryyy. Also, buy snacks first not after lol"
2612,"Honestly, back when I was a stoner, I’d enjoy the “adventure” of buying food to satiate my munchies.

I was in Miami (Brickell) for a week last Summer with my girl and some friends. Me, my girl, and a couple people from my group got stoned on Girl Scout Cookies, then our munchies forced us to go out for food. Went to this little local food truck and ate amazing Venezuelan food. 

It was a pretty dark street and was mostly empty, except for a couple guys with MS13 tats—I didn’t think much of it. My girl, on the other hand, noting that we were wearing pretty expensive clothes, thought we were being followed which got us all paranoid. We decided “fuck it” and hopped on the metro-rail to ghost our imaginary pursuants, then took an Uber to the nearby bars and met some really cool people. I mean, you gotta have story if you’re getting drunk on a Thursday night in Wynwood, right?

Ended up exploring the wall art in Wynwood, getting a bit crossed, listened to that “Songs That Get Drunk White Girls Excited” playlist in the Uber with the chill ass driver, drinking more with the whole crew back at our Airbnb and passing out somewhere around 4 AM.

All in all, a great night with a fun adventure, all because we went out for munchies."

If you haven’t decided on your own that your current look feels too feminine, why ask others? Have other people interact with you based on how you want to look, rather than conforming on how you look to please others.

Stay gorgeous, king 👑"
2752,"I mean, first glance says you're a girl, but what's too feminine is up to you.

2786,Yeah! whats your username?

2790,Idk much about Kano but i have a friend who schools there and the name Sabon Gari is pretty popular for some reason so I've heard of it. I stay in Ikeja on the Mainland and I too have  friends in Ikoyi. Someday I'll visit the North and Kano is definitely on my list. I'm not done with the South and East yet though lol. I'm Igbo and ancestrally from Imo state. He knows what that means. If he really spent all or most of his childhood here then he's as Nigerian as any of us. Though I am intrigued thinking about what his experience as a Naija Kid was. He knows what Naija is. Oh and please ask which 9ja rice is his favourite. Mine is Fried Rice lol.

2805,I still am friends and still talk with some of those I met on kik. We moved to snapchat
2806,"Oof I've got some bad memories of kik, but that was mostly because of myself. When I had an eating disorder I would connect with random people who were dealing with the same thing. We would encourage each other to eat as little as possible etc. It was super toxic, though that wasnt really because of kik. It just made it very easy. 
Also got contacted by quite some creeps on there... Weird times...
I guess its good that it will shut down."
2807,I mean there’s discord and WhatsApp is always an option! But yeah that’s a real shame to hear.
2808,It stings that Kik is shutting down. My first memories of meeting my boyfriend were on there. 💕
2809,"It's absolutely getting pulled due to rampant pedophilia. Go on /b/, hit the catalog and look for the kik codes saying shit like ""no rules"" or ""anything goes"". It's a bunch of degenerate perverts sharing CP without any consequences."

2817,it's where I first started messaging my boyfriend 4 years ago and we use it everyday. sad to see it go
2818,"Back in high school I had a hobby where I made stickers and I would often trade them with different people. Often times I would use kik to exchange info and most of the time the people who'd I trade with were pretty cool and usually all went well. You would deal with some oddballs every now and then, but that's pretty much it. I have seen some creepy and downright scary stories about some experiences on kik, so using the app always made me a bit uncomfortable."
2819,"I used it once, then I wanted to use it on a desktop and there was no way except for using an emulator.  
Honestly don't mind it shutting down as there are better alternatives."
2820,"There was this app I found when I was like 12 called iReversi. I originally got it because I liked the game, but found out it had a chatroom as part of it and fairly quickly that became the reason to use the app. I made some friends on there and the ones I got decently close to we would talk on kik before eventually swapping numbers (even then though mainly used kik except with one girl who became my ""girlfriend""). Eventually iReversi shut down and all was left was the people I had gotten on kik with and of course it didnt take long for that to stop too. Regardless both of those apps are home to a lot of memories for me, I probably spent more time on them than I did in the real world from like 7th to 10th grade."
2821,man i started using it in 2012 and used it up until 2017. it’s sad to see it go. i have so many fond memories
2822,Jordan peterson would aprove
2823,Great job!
2824,Damn that’s a good selection. How’s “A Million Miles in a Thousand Years”?
2825,I will teach you to be reach is a good one.
2826,"All the books to the right of “Boundaries” were the most influential for me. I loved the Power of positive thinking, compound effect... it really depends on what topic you’re interested in. Scary Close is an engaging read about how to show up in your relationships. Anything by John Maxwell is fantastic. Two more of my favorites aren’t on this shelf: the go giver & how to win friends and influence people (I’ve heard that every successful person has read this one so I try to read it once every year)."
2827,It’s been about five years since I’ve read that one but I remember it being a really thought provoking read. I intend to get around to reading it again during this quarantine.
2828,"But r/music is always there to show us new underground bands like Pink Floyd, Nirvana, and Queen  /s"
2829,Nazi? In what way?
2830,Fukin wat
2831,This is an old shower thought. I actually saw the post (or what was probably the 6th repost) a log time ago.
2832,"They actually listen to amazing underground bands like the pixies, sonic youth, and brockhampton"
2833,Dude have you heard about this dude Tyler the Creator?  He’s pretty underrated tbh.  You probably haven’t heard of him
2834,Thats the craziest story i ever heard props bro
2835,i wish something that cool would happen to me 😪
2836,"Fuck, that's badass"
2837,"Something cool happened to me once too:
I was on my way to my college in a bus and I was listening to- Linkin Park- Shadow of the Day. It was early morning so the sun wasn't up yet, and it was also winter so even tho there was no snow, but there were a lot of clouds and fog so the light of the sun and the sun itself wasn't clear but the day was just getting brighter. The lyrics were going - 
"" And the shadow of the day, will embrace you into grey, And the sun will set free you ""

And as soon as Chester said "" the sun will set free you"", the cloulds and fog cleared up and the sun was in a direct eye contact, and it was giving me that morning sunny warmth which I desperately needed."
2838,That's the coolest thing that could happen to anyone. I wish I was as lucky as you 😩
2839,Wish I was there to see it
2840,What is that ironically gay about?
2841,thank uwu
2842,i care and that's sick as fuck
2843,.
2844,ikr the only way it could've been better is if I had a witness or it was recorded
2845,a message from God
2846,I am envious of your ability to get a mortgage for a house at 21. Congratulations on the marriage!
2847,"21, single, college dropout, still living with mom and pop, spend most of my time working. Man I freaking feel you dude."
2848,"I'm a bit different bc I AM one of those people who has their shit together and is doing adult thing

But it makes me think, damn am I wasting my life and my ""youth"" by dedicating my life so I can do these things?"
2849,"Yup, 23 here and some of my friends are starting to get homes or even kids, shits scary"
2850,"If it makes you feel any better, that was an example of how little I know! 

I don't have a mortgage, I figured it came with a house. Perfect example of me throwing myself forward and having no idea what's going on.

Thank you, though! I'm very lucky."
2851,"Yeah, feels like I’m at the starting line and everyone is almost reaching the end of the marathon"
2852,"I got married at 18, and we have been married a year and a half now. Maybe we just have a knack for this kind of thing but it isn’t as hard as it may seem. I do have to say, though, that arguments have more riding on them. When we were dating if we broke up it would be sad but then we’d move on, but now that we are married, breaking up isn’t an option anymore. Take a deep breath. Rely on google for finance questions. Call your mom when you’re not sure if you need to put half a cup or a cup of chicken broth into that recipe, call your dad when your engine won’t start out of nowhere, rely on others to get a head start."
2853,I feel the same way but it gets worse as you get older because you also start getting the feeling that you're running out of time but I just try and remember that everyone's path is different and that having a Spouse/house/kids ect isn't a guanrantee that you'll be happy or feel fulfilled. Also some things are worth waiting for and you're not less of an adult or your life is not worth less because you live in a apartment or house ect.
2854,Life happens fast after high school. I'm 24 and it still feels weird seeing all of my friends having babies and getting married!
2855,"Hey I got married at 21 and am 25 now and still happily married. You learn a lot as you go and never really feel you're as old as you should be. It's very nice to have people who can help you figure out problems that you've never faced before, and if you don't have those people Google is a nice supplement. I try to face problems as they arise, but keep myself in a financial situation where I have the means to fix urgent problems quickly. My wife is much more of a planner and tries to be proactive about fixing problems before they come to the surface. Nothing is ever perfect and sometimes we fail at very simple things because we don't have a lot of experience dealing with those problems. My wife and I have had a lot of success, but we are literally flying by the seat of our pants most if the time."
2856,"I gotta be honest, I’m not super envious of people who “have their lives together”. Like, I know that will come in due time. I know one day I will have a job, perhaps find a partner, hopefully have kids

But right now, I just want to focus on embracing the non-adult stuff: Living with my parents, spending more time with them, studying hard in school, but finding time to have fun and socialize. 

Because I have the rest of my life to adult... I don’t want to start right now"
2857,I like this analogy!
2858,"I'm 24, graduated HS in 2015. Now I cant really say what people from my HS are up to since I only talk to one person from HS and I don't use facebook, instagram, twitter, etc. but from the ones I have seen, they are not getting married or buying houses or anything. Basically all are working and/or just dating someone. I do know people around my age though from college that are engaged/trying to buy a house and it seems odd to me even though were in our mid twenties. I don't know though, if that's what they want and are happy there's no reason for them not too I guess. My own personal preference is that I don't want to get married or have kids till I'm well into my thirties. I honestly still feel largely like I am the same person from HS just with more responsibilities. 

I do feel behind in life though a lot when I see people my age or younger than me doing these kinds of things but not everyone is the same and everyone has their own goals and ambitions in life. I just try to focus on myself and the things I enjoy doing and progress through life at my own pace."
2859,"That kind of stuff? Yeah, because I genuinely don't believe people our age are ready for that stuff even if they think they are. I live in Utah and the mormon church really encourages getting married and having kids at this age so I see a ton of it and it disturbs me."
2860,"Hey, I feel you. I got married at 20 and had no idea what to do, but we figured it out. I’m 25 now, graduated with my BS and MS, in my ideal job, happily married, and closed on some land a couple months ago. We have a cat! My husband is also in his dream job, and as far as he tells me, equally as happy. Don’t stress too much. Make plans, do what you need to do to reach your goals, and keep going on dates. You’ll be just fine. :)"
2861,"> Spend a whole day procrastinating on Reddit?

stop calling me out dammit"
2862,"Honestly, feeling like a 12 year old is a pretty awesome feeling. My thinking is that we have the rest of our lives to feel old, so why not try to feel young for a bit before the adulting inevitably comes up :)"
2863,"yeah it’s weird for me. i’m 21, still in college, living with my parents and content with it and haven’t had a relationship since high school (and that one lasted one month lmao) meanwhile i have friends who bought a house and are ready to be engaged, and friends that live across the country and have no desire to come back. the other day i saw someone who i went to school with with who was a year older than me announce her pregnancy. so far that’s the only pregnancy i’ve heard about out of the people i went to high school with and i haven’t heard of any marriages but i see random strangers online doing it all the time. the craziest is seeing people who are younger than me do this stuff. i still feel 17 in my head. i graduate college in the spring and i’m starting to do internships and stuff and hopefully will find a full time job afterwards but i still have no desire to leave my parents house because i like it here. everyone always asks me why i don’t want to leave and move to another state or at least an apartment but i just don’t want to. once i graduate i’ll be paying bills and “rent” so it’s not like i’m
living off my parents but i just don’t want to be on
my own just yet. i feel like i’m starting to do all the adult things but i still feel like a 12 year old in an adults body, like no one should be trusting me to do anything lol"
2864,"When my friend joined the navy I thought, “but we’re too young.” Nope. We’re 18..."
2865,"Yep, and just to think we were all juniors, seniors 4, 3 years ago. I still look like I'm 17-18. Or 16. A girl from my high school had a kid at 17 and now is expecting another on the way. I don't need any kids. I'd rather be childfree."
2866,How.... do you have a wife at 21? Do you have like supermodel good looks?
2867,"Oh... I am fluent in Russian. I am actually tri-lingual. A tri-lingual, blue eyed, handsome papist"
2868,"I am a tri-lingual, blue eyed, handsome rapist"
2869,Is your professor a [Volga German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Germans) (Germans in Russia or German speaking Russians)
2870,Unfortunately I don’t know . I know he grew up in West Berlin
2871,"I am a monolingual, black-eyed, hideous rapist"
2872,Baptist
2873,Aide ich kann kein wort russisch und kein wort deutsch lmao
2874,I speak English and Spanish fluently and am currently getting frustrated af trying to learn French so reading this has left me impressed. I think there’s nothing cooler than being multilingual.
2875,You are me and I am you. Except we’re supposed to be learning sign language not french.
2876,I am actually a trilingual bigot
2877,Bigotry is always bad.
2878,Well I wish you luck on your silent linguistic endeavor
2879,I know basic words and expressions. I think it’s pretty easy even if you’re learning yourself but unfortunately I just don’t have the time rn
2880,Why is el dragon the coolest guy alive
2881,я тоже
2882,Nice I have always wanted to learn sign language
2883,"Whoa I didn’t even notice this was a post by the one and only El Dragon

I bow before your presence

Seriously though I think asl is so freaking cool and I want to learn so bad"
2884,I know a bit of ASL. It's not as hard as many other languages. Just make sure you have a good teacher
2885,What? I said PAPIST with a P!
2886,You are a baptist? I am Catholic
2887,"What's important in that is ""so far"". I mean, in the larger scheme of things you will not even be close to that number tbh."
2888,And even higher when you're a toddler!
2889,"65% of my adult life (from 18th) has been spent in lockdown. Or various ones, as you pointed out.

More than 50% of my degree so far has been conducted from my bedroom, all alone. I already know that won't change until at least mid June, so 50% total AT least will have been online.

At least I have a partial excuse for still being a virgin and can put it down to ""looking after society""."
2890,"Yeah, but you don't remember shit, if you're a toddler. So those years are wasted anyway, in a sense."
2891,"Yeah, and when you're 80 that will have been a measly 1% of your life. Let's also not forget that we're all crazy young, can continue doing fun things when we're less young, and our ""pRiMe yEaRs"" are yet to come for almost all if not all of us."
2892,"As a 28yo with a big boy job, you can do way more fun things when you’re older bc you’ll have a *lot* more money."
2893,Yeah of course. I was just stating a fact. Although I imagine lockdown on early life will have a long term impact in later life and will likely lead to some anxiety about being around people.
2894,"Yeah, but if you're a toddler (1-3 y.o.), it won't matter, because you don't remember anything anyway in those years.

But if you spend more time as a toddler with your family, due to lockdowns, then you may be able to bond with them more closely, leading to a better relationship in the future."
2895,"The way I’ve made myself feel better about that is when this is all said and done, me and the homies are going to have this big 21st. Best part is nobody will think we’re weird when we say “it’s our 21st!!!” but it says 24 on the licenses, because we all experienced COVID. Alittle mind games won’t hurt."
2896,"I feel you on that one. Depression sucks, and who knows what the future dates may hold. But even with past/current experiences having a down side, that doesn’t mean your 23rd birthday will be scary."
2897,"Look it like that: at least you are alive to do math and freak out about it.

but i totally get what you meant, i'm 23 and at the begin of 2020 i was feeling it would be my year, i never had felt that before, i was so hopeful, i was starting to really going to partys and to truly living my best life when corona came up in the picture. and i fuck hate that. but everytime i start to thing about the things i'm supposed to be missing i think like that: at least i'm alive to complain. i think we all have reason to complain, but we have to be aware of it, could  be worst. 

i also like to think: at least i'm not a selfish asshole, who's partying like that's not a pademic goin on."
2898,Honestly no one has it worse than the 0-10 age group. Think about it. They are just forming their earliest memories they are likely to remember and these times are going to be it. Should we ever get out of these lockdowns by the time these infants/ kids become older kids and teens I'm not sure of they will know anything different.
2899,"Growing up, I always thought 16, 19, and 23 were the coolest ages. If you ask me why, I can't tell you. While I was 16 years old, I spent the whole year in a very deep depressive episode. 19, this goddamn virus. 

I'm honestly scared for my 23rd."
2900,"I have the exact same situation as you, right down to the last paragraph."
2901,"Yep. Still, be prepared for 2024. Might be the year a meteor hits the Earth lol"
2902,"You might not remember, but early life does have a large impact on later life. It's likely to be the case that a lot of newborns will go through a phase of anxiety towards strangers (in passing) and may struggle with something as simple as going to a shop."
2903,22% of my entire life has been in college. 5 years of a 23 year life. Ugh.
2904,"Ngl.  I’ve been extremely stupid.  I take immunosuppressants and therefore am high risk.  Yet I haven’t been following lockdown.  I’ve been to 3 maybe 4 parties since lockdown began, hanging out with friends on a consistent basis.  (I don’t remember what I did for my birthday last year in April)  anyway.  I was taking immunosuppressants and undergoing cancer treatments (beat cancer btw).  I haven’t caught it once and I get my covid vaccine in a week.  Yet ppl I know caught it and some I’ve been around and they had it and I had no clue. Been dodging that shit with some highly close calls.   Wouldn’t recommend.  I’ve been playing an extremely dangerous game"
2905,"When I turned 21 I had stuff to do because school. Got a pizza and a coke with a few friends and called it a day, can't always make time to do crazy stuff."
2906,The post-covid party will be wild.
2907,Oh wow !! I’m thinking to chuck a 21st or 22nd again ? 😂 my birthday is towards the end of the year so I mean it’s only been a month since being 22 soon thinking to just chuck the party for either one😂 I mean my 21st was ruined by my best friend as well but I still did go out for dinner. But ya girl wanna get turnt up so maybe I’ll just have a proper 22nd or both 😂
2908,"Side note, your math bothers me, because I don’t understand why you did what you did, but you got the right answer 😂

But yeah, I’m 24, jobless right now (living with my parents), and it just feels like so long. It’s also right as I’ve graduated, so my experience with being an adult is royally fucked so far."
2909,3.7% :|
2910,When you're 80 60% of your life will have been spent hiding from fumebeasts in the Atlantic desert. Wholesome fossil fuels moment
2911,"That's a nice mindset to have, good on you dude. And yeah, thanks for being responsible in a pandemic:)"
2912,"My high ass just thought huh guess I’m late 20s then, then I remembered I have been 30yrs old for 8 months now fml"
2913,Can time slow down please
2914,I think it's mid 20s
2915,I think it's 20-24 that is your early 20s while 25 and onwards are your full grown adult years.
2916,I forgot mid is a thing 😭
2917,shuddup bitch I'm 24 turning 25 next month
2918,"same bro, at least I know can always blame covid for not getting too social btw"
2919,you just made me realize i will leave my early twenties in october and i’m about to have a life crisis
2920,"I just turned 25. And now, because of this post, am realizing I'm no longer in my early 20s lol"
2921,24 is the last year of your early 20's. You got time.
2922,"I feel so old even though I know I'm not.

Is time always going to feel like it's passing this fast?"
2923,"I’m approaching 24, pls don’t remind me"
2924,I was told it is not.
2925,"I've experienced time as going at a snail's pace when actively looking forward to  // waiting for something. 

So yeah, lifehack: look forward to shit."
2926,lmao
2927,I've wondered how that works
2928,i just turned 20
2929,I feel this. Turning 24 later this year...
2930,I’m turning 20 this year and i feel so old 😿😿😿

2940,Holy shit this is true
2941,There was this girl on vacation when I was 8. We have a photo together in the pool with face paint. Wondering how she's doing over a decade later.
2942,"It was at a farm in Canada and there was a gather or some party going on in the daytime. There were a few kids and this one other girl who was alone. I talked with her and I could tell she didn't have any friends from the way that she held herself, she didn't have much self confidence and was glued to my side the moment I said hi to her. But I played a much as I could with her. At some points I remember that she annoyed me and would follow me around but I understood why she did it. It's hard when you have no one to suddenly have someone to talk with and someone to be happy around. I remember at one point we painted on some terracotta pots and messed around with watercolour paint. I still have both the pot and my painting. I use that little pot that she painted on for keeping my pocket change. I still think about her from time to time even though it was about a decade ago. It almost feels like a dream. I don't remember the drive getting to that farm, I don't even remember why there was a party or who it was for but I remember her. I don't know her name but I remember she wore these big geeky glasses and big jeans. She said to me as I was leaving with my family that we are best friends for life. I still wonder about her to this day. I wish that I got to see her more than once so maybe she wouldn't be so alone."
2943,I met this one girl at the pools.She was determined to impress me with her moves at the deep end.
2944,I forgot your name but I hope you still remember me at sanibel island 2013
2945,The girl I met while feeding the pigeons in Mexico and the other girl I met at the beach. Hope y’all good.
2946,"I was literally JUST thinking about this a few minutes ago! As an only child I kinda had to make friends wherever I went, so I have a lot of those times. I actually still keep up with one girl I met at the park though! We met when I was little, she came to my birthday party a few weeks later and then we were pen pals for awhile! Now we’re just Facebook friends but I still think it’s cool."
2947,"Yeah me, except I saw him again on the same beach the next day. Hi Xavier"
2948,So true... you always have the memory of meeting that one random kid that made your day so much better yet you'll probably never se them again
2949,That hits too close to home.
2950,"Met a kid at a birthday party at the YMCA in Illinois. He was really cool, almost accidentally drowned me though. His mom dragged him out the pool after that  and I never saw him again. Hope you're doing well bro hope the ass beating wasn't too bad I know it was an accident"
2951,They are a BLAST to ride :)

As soon as I saw this one I knew I wanted it. Metallica have been my favourite band since my early teens. When I heard One for the first time I must have put it on repeat about 6 times.

So yeah, not only heavy rain falls, fires and a virus well who would have known. The life of an Australian well it is is what is lol.

Might as well do what I always do stay indoors, write a book, watch anime and draw. Because if the world burns like literally not much we can do I mean we can do something about it. 

But aren't we a little too late?

Sure we  can prevent this from happening ever again probably but we can't really stop this stuff from happening now...just prevent it.

Though I can't really say much myself,

At any rate my opionion about the war if it happened it would have happened by now so I'm not all too worried about that because quite frankly they all have the means to make it happen. But no one has, so it better to stay that way.

But since the fire is going on well, we can't do much but wait for rain well MORE rain to put it out.

During the hot weather we are getting it just gonna get worse probrally I barely keep up to the date with the news, so the virus was news for me I mean I did hear about it happening in china from a discord chat or it was youtube but other then that I suppose we just do what we normally do.

The only thing we can do now is make sure we can prevent what's happening now, to prevent it from happening in the near future because let's face it the damage is already done.

We can fix everything but the changes won't happen straight away, I'm not saying don't I'm just saying we need to and we need to do it soon so the affects of the change can happen over of the course of the next decade or even years ahead.

Because healing the Earth gonna take more then one year.

P2: yeah remember Paul?

All that aside, try seeing if there is any logos or manufacturer info stamped on it. Any tags or numbers. Would help you find what type of window it is. If it is a standard sliding up/down window, then there is probably something stuck inside the frame that won't let it go down all the way, or it is just old and it wearing out.

When I was in university halls I knew a few people who had tons of casual sex. Sometimes at annoying volume. They were all conventionally attractive and confident. Several were also clearly afraid of commitment. When the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night (a common enough occurrence as people thought it was funny), it was very common to see an unfamiliar face in just a dressing gown.

On the other hand, I knew quite a lot of people who either weren't having any casual sex or were only doing it subtly and/or infrequently. It was exceedingly rare for one of my housemates to have a girl over, and some of them were pretty good looking guys."

Sex isn't a primary motivator for everybody, Freud"
3299,I’m sure not...
3300,Maybe rude but that was a clever rebuttal.
3301,"The thing about sex is that it seems really special until you've actually had it. That isn't to say it isn't important, but not having had sex before is not nearly as big a deal as you might think."
3302,"I highly doubt it. I feel the same way as you. The thought of getting an STD or having a kid too young is fucking terrifying, and I highly doubt its normal to have casual sex with people. 
We often see this portrayed in TV and movies, but that feels really off for the majority of real people doing it. 
We have real problems and consequences, and there are some people who ignore those problems and consequences, but I believe most people aren't like that."
3303,"I’m 22 next month and I’m the same lmao. Oh well, I’ve lasted almost 22 years without it, I can keep going a bit longer."
3304,"There's a pandemic, so no."
3305,"just no. that’s incel stuff dude, and it’s not even accurate."

3311,"I'm 19 and I haven't had a kiss or any of that sexual stuff. 

Granted, I'm not looking though. I wouldn't be too worried about this. Like other comments have said I wouldn't base normality on what a friend or two are doing."
3312,"Nah, it all depends on the type of person. I have friends who are the same and others who have 0 sex drive outside of a relationship. I personally didn't lose my virginity until November last year, as a 20 yeard old in my 3rd serious relationship (with some stuff in between). 

&#x200B;

Everyone's pace is different, take it easy, find someone/something to care about and have fun with this life!"
3313,same
3314,I’m 20 and same.
3315,"can confirm, im a loser lol"
3316,"I was kind of joking, there's a lot of people here treating sex with disgust or contempt to make themselves seem superior"
3317,Nah man.
3318,"really depends on who you are, don't think *everyone* is doing anything"
3319,Maybe it's just the people I'm hanging out with but no one I know is having a ton on casual sex (and even if your country isn't in lockdown you still really shouldn't being having a ton of casual sex during a global pandemic but that's none of my business). As for the Reddit thing maybe it's the subreddits you're in? If the subreddits are more like to attract people who have casual sex then you're gonna find more stories about that.
3320,No gatherings of more than ten people 😡
3321,"Our university shut down the dorms with only a few days notice,  A lot of people had nowhere to go. So they are staying at my house for a week or so so they can find alternative housing. Yes it’s a lot of people but We are college students, Not everyone has the funds to go stay in a hotel while they try and find an apartment because the University kicked them out of their dorms Until further notice."

3332,I think you know who won the race...
3333,Welcome brethren. 21 has felt like limbo. I miss being 19 😔
3334,"Happy birthday man, I'll be 21 in about a month and some change, goodluck to you on your adventures!"
3335,Not sure on the downvotes here he’s got a good point! Good to have a baseline before getting piss drunk at a party
3336,"I felt the same when I turned 19 in March, still haven't used my newfound abilities"
3337,"I feel drinking at 19 is more about going out to the clubs and bars, which are probably not as nearly appealing now. And then as you get into 20's I feel it becomes more casual."
3338,"Go for it, smart to do it alone for your first time to get used to it"
3339,Same. My birthday was a few months ago and I didn’t get to celebrate in any way shape or form
3340,Congrats & welcome to adulthood lol
3341,bruh it’s my 21st birthday too!!! Happy birthday!!!!
3342,Happy birthday!
3343,Happy birthday! What's the first thing you're drinking?
3344,I don't plan on drinking anything.
3345,Same deal two weeks ago
3346,Happy birthday!
3347,Happy birthday !
3348,Congrats!!! Welcome to the boat
3349,Omg same!!!! Happy birthday to u
3350,"When I was your age, it was yesterday. I turned 21 yesterday lol. Almost birthday buddies. Happy birthday!"
3351,Same. I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that I’m not going to be a teenager anymore haha
3352,Happy birthday! You don’t have to drink just bc you turned 21. Im turning 21 in a few months and I’m not sure how I should feel about that lol
3353,I loath the fact that I'm turning 20 in a few months
3354,Don't get blackout drunk. It's really not worth it.
3355,I'll be turning 21 in December and I've had plans ever since I was a kid for this birthday that the pandemic will prevent me from doing :/
3356,Ok since I'm not American I've got a question: do teenagers mostly respect this law? Cause here the minimum age to buy alcohol is 18 but most teens (not me cause I was socially anxious as fuck around alcohol back then) start drinking at parties probably around 14-15. Is that just not a thing in the US?
3357,"I turned 21 last month and still haven’t had one drop in my life, so I’m right there with you"
3358,"Yeah, I mean it's not me being a square or anything, I'm just not really into drinking alcohol."
3359,Yeah it’s personally not my thing too. People can drink around me and I don’t care it’s just personal preference ¯\\\_( ツ)_/¯
3360,"Yea, the mood changed very quickly throughout these pictures. Reading it I went from “haha old people don’t understand technology” to “oh what the hell OP’s dad is a complete asshole” very quickly."
3361,Sorry man he’s being irrational as fuck and if you have had to put up with that you’re whole life I’m so sorry
3362,Literally been asking myself the same thing.
3363,Why do you talk to this man? He sounds like the most unpleasant person ever. He also sounds abusive and no most people are not this way
3364,"Disowned over $32

That's impressive"
3365,I really appreciate that. 🥺
3366,I’m 21 years old and it only gets worse over time. He’s very abusing.
3367,"Dude wth this sucks your dad is insane, my parents have never even sweared at me"
3368,I bet it’s a new record
3369,Most technically literate boomer.
3370,"Your dad sounds like a jerk but anyone else felt bad to see their parents age and become more bitter with it? It's just something you learn to live with, I guess."
3371,"I'm a bit braindead, I was reading it backwards. I saw the dad as OP and vice versa

I was thinking OP is being an asshole for talking to his parents like that while they're staying totally calm. Damn. Seeing that it's actually reversed just makes it worse."
3372,My father is the exact same way. I cut him off after I graduated college in December. If you ever need to rant about it please DM me. I can share countless messages exactly like this. We must be better when we have kids because seeing stuff like this out there truly breaks my heart that others go through the same thing. Sending all my love and positive energy and please really consider cutting him off when you can.
3373,So $32 huh? That’s all it takes to get a reaction like that? After you did your part and more? What a small person.
3374,How many fucking times is he going to say fuck?
3375,Oof r/insaneparents can probably relate
3376,"You should of just kept the money man, your dads super rude"
3377,"I can't. This is too funny 🤣

I'm sorry op that you have to live thought this"
3378,r/insaneparents
3379,Damn your dad is pretty rude. I don’t know if I find these texts more funny or sad.
3380,"Does he act like this all the time?

I'd just take every bit of that money back into my account."
3381,"Sending you a virtual hug🥺🥺
My parent be like that some time but yours is definitely way worse😢"
3382,"Hey man, I don't want to tell you how to live, I'll just say my Dad used to be similar. I don't really know what happened, but he finally mellowed out when I put some distance between us. I'm closer with him now, just had to back off for a few years 

I don't know if that's possible for you, I don't know your situation, but I hope you're fully aware that his reaction was unwarranted and you didn't deserve that. Good job keeping your cool, really, I know I wouldn't."
3383,Oh I was dying laughing at how DUMB he was being. He gets on my nerves.
3384,Awee thank you! 🥺 it’s a daily battle. I don’t want to have to cut them out of my life but that’s what it’s looking like
3385,"Not understanding tech, yeah thats my mom. Yelling and blaming others for their problems, yeah thats my dad. That's why i only see ny dad once a year."
3386,Once I had to send back money to my dad so I just sent the money to his bank account (with the communication that says what it’s for and of course he can see that it comes from me) and the next day he calls me and shouts at me because I didn’t send him a message to say that I sent the money and he was panicking because he didn’t know where the money come from. Like he tough it was some kind of scammer that was sending him money to scam him somehow ? Even tough he could’ve just read that it was me and what it was for...
3387,Jesus what a grump. It'd take 2 fucken seconds to sort this problem and he decides to just have a sook instead
3388,"My dads like this

He’s also the worst person I know. Cruel, manipulative, selfish, no empathy. I once saw him steal a pregnant lady’s furniture because he thought her boyfriend owed him money. She later lost the kids to DOCS because she couldn’t wash their clothes or clean their house

Simply put, our dads are terrible people who will never admit fault and will blame you for their own shortcomings. Good luck dude, I’m just waiting for mine to die"
3389,This man sounds like an ass
3390,Thanks. I know this job can give me some health problems and that's why I don't want to work long term there. Only one or two paychecks and I will get out of there and try to find other job
3391,"Can you please not objectify women, thanks 

They're humans too, just like you."
3392,Idk what post office you go to but it’s definitely not mine lmfao
3393,"Around here people working packages get paid like 2x minimum wage.

Work that hard for minimum is a fucking joke, you're being scammed"
3394,You must be lean as hell
3395,I wish. I'm a bit chubby but I'm losing some weight slowly
3396,"I work 8 hour shifts on overnight at Walmart, it is really difficult. I get paid a bit more than minimum, which makes it okay"

3398,Try to line up a new job first
3399,"Yikes dude, don't wreck your body for something like a minimum wage job. Try to get a job as a cashier or waiter that doesn't take such a physical toll."
3400,"Correct. The healthy recommended weight loss rate is 1-2 lbs per week (or about 1/2 to 1 kg per week).

> Losing weight too fast may increase your risk of side effects including muscle loss, lower metabolism, nutrient deficiencies, gallstones and many other risks."
3401,"I hope I'll find similar job in couple months. Tbh, such exhausting job for minimum wage isn't worth it"
3402,I know. After I get some money from this job I'm firing myself the fuck out
3403,"I make 5 above minimum (granted minimum is like 7.25 here) and am just saving for college, it’s a fair wage and if I decide I don’t like it I’ll go somewhere else"
3404,[deleted]
3405,BUILD THOSE TRICEPS BRO!
3406,[deleted]
3407,That's why I want to get out of there after 2 months. I just want to get my first money just to somehow start my independent life and I'll try to find a better job
3408,That's the idea after few paychecks
3409,Hell yeah boi
3410,I've seen only one or two attractive women there. The rest is older ladies and men
3411,"I think target just made their minimum wage 15 an hour, if you have one near you. Could be worth checking out. It is exhausting working nights though"
3412,"I did something similar. Unloaded trucks in college. Back breaking, pay was garbage, but it keeps me humble now. Many of my coworkers never had to do that to get through college, but I'm proud that I busted it to get through."
3413,"I worked at the counter and register at an overpriced chipotle copycat mexican bistro. I got paid $10 an hour which is decent but I absolutely hated it, and when I asked for shorter hours becuase of my mental health they said OK and then took me off the schedule completely. I had been working there for a month and had got lucky with a job interview for a daycare. I get paid only $8.50 an hour at the daycare but it's full time and I really like the job. It isn't strenuous on me mentally, my kids are great and I'm just about to turn 18. Not going to college this year becuase it's crazy and I cant afford it and I can't even get a driver's license becuase the DMVs are appointment only and that appointment is in the middle of October. This year has been pretty shit but at least I found something. Too bad my first real paycheck is gonna be spent fixing my mom's car :^)
 
Tldr: wait a while, keep searching, and you will find something you like that suits you."
3414,"Ok if there’s like two attractive ladies working there then it’s an ok job, remember the more attractive ladies that works there the better the job."
3415,Unfortunately we don't have Target where I'm from. They just started selling doritos like 3 years ago. I hope one day they'll get pop turts and coloured mountain dew
3416,Everything is cheap though so it’s really not bad for how much stuff costs locally.
3417,"Haha, good luck man. Here's to hoping. My favorite flavor of mountain dew is black label or voltage"
3418,Then get out ASAP your not working a job your working slavery. A good note to go off of is if there are no good looking women working there then it’s a bad job. Good looking women won’t work at bad jobs but they will work at decent or good jobs so it’s a good measure to go by.
3419,Since it’s at a post office I assume there are some attractive women working there? Is there?
3420,That’s awesome!! Huge congrats!

3484,"Lmao this isn’t the worst virus in US history. Spanish Flu killed like 675,000 when we had a population of around 100 million. That’s way worse. 

I also haven’t seen nearly enough people caring about this for it to become some “gReAtIsT gEnErAtIoN” success story. Way too many people our age have failed miserably with this, and there are also a ton of people - young adults or otherwise - who are ignorant and don’t learn from their mistakes.

We aren’t coming out harder and stronger, we’re coming out stupider. Look at all the astroturf protest movements, the idiots who are protesting but somehow aren’t part of an astroturf, the senators who blocked information about this in January, the president who keeps talking nonsense and lied for so long, the intelligence reports in November showing that this was a threat that got suppressed, etc. Yet there’s no outcry about any of that. It lasts a couple weeks, then nobody cares. 

In order for us to come out stronger, people need to learn from their mistakes - and people don’t have a great track record with that."
3485,">We are the generation That will have survived the greatest Medical catastrophe in American history.

More than just Americans in this sub.

>We will come out of this swinging , Harder and stronger than any generation before us.

I'd say that absolutely goes to those in their 20 and 30s during World War 2. To suggest otherwise while we sit at home on our well-fed asses is bizarre and -in the light of remembrance day in Australia today and next week in the Netherlands- rather insulting. 

Never mind other wars.

Yes, this is history. Absolutely. But don't exaggerate. There's no need for it."
3486,The Wisconsin Historical Society is collecting journals people create during COVID-19 for future historians
3487,"Not every death is the same mate. A death due to war is far different than a Corona death . A death of a young girl burning to death in her village due to Napalm is different than a death here in the Netherlands where the average age of a Corona victim is 80.

So far, here in the Netherlands, we're not even at 2x our normal death rate and it's dropping quick. Even if it was 3x we simply can't compare it to war.

I don't want to understate the deaths either because I feel for them and their families, but try to be realistic. Try to keep a level head and place things in a proper perspective, it will make this time a lot less stressful."
3488,We will hang our heads in shame when we tell our grandkids how we shot up lysol in gas station bathrooms because the president said it would help
3489,"It's not as bad yet
We can look back at the 1918 influenza and say it was worse total because it already ended we already know what the total was 
We are in the middle of the first wave of the corona.
The influenza had two waves. The first one had 2-3 million confirmed cases in the US but when it ended and people went out to the streets to celebrate the end of the war. It started the second wave where 20 million confirmed cases happened almost simultaneously completely overwhelming the system.

Now for the real issue which is that while OP is trying to maybe spread around some positivity and hopefully help someone feel better that once this is all over we will get out the other side stronger and better. You decide to tear it down. 
This is only the beginning, and op is right in saying that this is very much similar to the circumstances that the greatest generation grew up in. Political hardships like the endless war in Iraq political instability, a pandemic and economic collapse.

Despite it all the greatest generation are remembered as those who rebuilt america. People are allowed to hope that we will to"
3490,"It's very unlikely that a bacteria will evolve to be resistant against *all known* antibiotics. We're seeing bacteria that's resistant to a lot of them, but not all. Some thing or the other works. Not to mention, there's also ongoing research into producing new antibiotics."
3491,"> It's not as bad yet 

In order for it to become worse than the Spanish Flu, based on %pop dead, we'd need 2.2 million dead in the United States. It's simply erroneous to say that this is the worst virus in US history.

> Now for the real issue which is that while OP is trying to maybe spread  around some positivity and hopefully help someone feel better that once  this is all over we will get out the other side stronger and better. You  decide to tear it down. 

 You wanna know why I'm calling OP and you out? Because we don't have a reason to celebrate yet. We're not handling this well. Our generation is not on track to become the greatest. Rhetoric like this breeds conceit, and conceit breeds apathy. Apathy hinders progress, and at times, destroys it. 

We *can* rebuild America and become stronger and better than ever, but a lot of people need to put in a lot of work for us to get on that track. If we start acting like we're already on that track, like we're about to become the greatest just because we're alive, we will not be leaving a better country for those coming after us."

3529,"it do be like that sometimes. thanks, dude!"
3530,i hope so too
3531,"Clean and tidy rooms are the best and just  amazing when you finally get around to making it look nice

And then it’s a mess within 3 days..."
3532,shhhhhh don’t remind me of the inevitable
3533,"thanks man, I just did some calisthenics at home. just do it for 15 minutes at least today, you feel me"
3534,That’s great! I hope you feel this way all day!
3535,I’ve still not been able to get around to exercising in a while but that post exercise sickness be hittin’. good on you dude!
3536,"If it's braggy, it's just a knee jerk reaction to feeling like garbage because apparently I'm not good enough. I fucking suck, man.

EDIT: Ok, that was pretty knee jerk as well. We're all somewhere between great and shit."
3537,"That’s whack bro, pretty dumb reason to be fired.

But you’ve got something lined up so you’ll be fine, they’ll notice what they let go when those other scrubs can’t perform like you did! Cheers man"
3538,r/notsohumbleflex
3539,Thanks for the positive attitude! You're the best!
3540,"Hey man, as someone who's been there, just wanted to say yeah you shouldn't like being fired, but you should look at it as to why you were fired. Did you legitimately do something that caused you to be fired, or did you not meet some unreasonable goals set by management? I've worked a couple of jobs over the years and have only been fired once. When I was fired, it was because management set a unreasonable and clearly unobtainable goal, and when I stood up for myself and my department and pushed backed, they let me go. When it happened, I actually didn't mind getting canned because I stood up for my beliefs. You decide if you are good enough, and not others. Based on what you said, it sounds like you kicked ass at your job, and they have some shitty practices firing the bottom 30% of producers. You're probably better off not being there.

Just some unsolicited advice from a complete internet stranger."
3541,"No, I agree completely, I'm definitely much better off not working there. For some context, in October we broke a company-wide sales record, and our boss gave the whole team a ""talking to"" because we ""could've done better"". 

Sorry, *former* boss, that guy was actually fired a few weeks ago for sexual misconduct. It was my *new* boss who canned me.

...yeah that place sucks, haha!

EDIT: It paid pretty well though..."
3542,"The former governor of my state reduced the collective bargaining power of unions to almost nil, unfortunately. Also, I have a feeling that there isn't a brand ambassador's union... we're generally a pretty young and disposable lot.

Plus even if there were options to be had, it would take away too much time from school and my next job.

It was a good idea though, that definitely gave me a pause."
3543,Do you not have a union you can go to? This seems like you were dismissed for invalid reasons
3544,Leave a glassdoor review with proof of  your track record if possible. That is AFTER securing your next job.
3545,"Hey, so long as you got good references you're moving up in life! Also, explain the ""fire the bottom 30%"" to whoever asks about it. And I'm not sure if firing you like that is legal, idk"
3546,"I know I'm a week late, but at least you clearly have a natural talent in selling! Focus on that and you can become very successful if you want to become a salesperson"
3547,"Yeah, I'll leave a shitty Glassdoor review. That being said, this company *did* offer each employee a $25 Amazon gift card to leave a good Glassdoor review about one month after hire, so my poor review may be drowned out.

I didn't accept the gift card btw. Gotta take a guy out to dinner first."

3577,"Even if OP themselves never did anything wrong in their lives, people our age are more likely to drive under the influence of god-knows-what, reckless driving practices (our cellphones just became too distracting for driving... if you’re that kind of bad driver), glasses might not be aesthetically pleasant even when desperately needed... you get the idea.

Elders, barring a sudden onset of... death or anything else that takes them down within a second, are mostly guilty of driving really slow cars which, yeah, annoying, but not as risky as other things as long as other drivers are paying attention (not to elders in particular just... you know... driving half decently).

Also, idk about other countries, but where I come from, you regular license (aka the one most people our age have) is good for five years and, once you get to 65, you need to retake your driving test on a yearly basis so our DMV-like institution can see by themselves if an elder is still capable of driving or not"
3578,"In the uk it’s crazy, I’m paying £2500 for a car with a black box that’s worth £1000"
3579,"It doesn’t help your payment that, at least in my state, the state government forces you to have car insurance. Making it somewhat of a monopoly. I know there is multiple providers, but since everyone has to have insurance it lets companies charge an artificially higher price."
3580,I'm getting quotes of £1800. Two named drivers takes it down to 1300 ish but that's super expensive.
3581,"New Hampshire is the only state that doesn't require it, and as a result, it's about 20% cheaper than the other 49 states."
3582,I think it depends on the insurance you choose. I got my car insured for an almost laughable amount for my age and power of the car. Also got a lot of perks from my insurance guy.
3583,"Yep I have two names drivers as well, where u from in the uk?"
3584,"South, round the Winchester/Salisbury area."
3585,"Also depends on where you’re from. Here we don’t get different pricing based on our ages. Mom and dad only added me to their insurance when I got my license at 17 (as soon as legally possible in my country) and that was it. Their premiums didn’t go up and never went up no matter what

We do pay for a more expensive or a cheaper policy depending on the cars we have. A small Ford Ka pays a fraction of what a gigantic Ford Kuga does

Something quite new we got here, though, are insurance companies that’ll make you pay according to how much you drive, but still, not depending on whether you report stuff to fix nor your age"
3586,"London here mate, we get ripped off, out of curiosity is used my mates postcode and I would of saved £700 if I lived in Stevenage"
3587,"Where I am from we pay based on which car you drive (how likely a certain car is to crash) the horsepower of said car, your age and your premium stage(goes up with accidents and down once a year)"

3601,I love this
3602,"I have a tattoo involving only straight lines and some of em are a bit uneven, I thought I'd beat myself up over it, but I honestly don't mind. It makes it unique. 

And also, just like yours, you literally only see it if someone puts your attention on it!"

3606,"Thank you so much for the reassurance, made me feel better :)"
3607,"for sure, it would probably look weird if it was perfectly symmetrical"
3608,"I think it looks more like your body is just curving it; I had to spend like 30 seconds looking at it to notice it wasn’t perfectly symmetrical, so I think it’s good."
3609,"Thank you, that is really reassuring"

3624,Looks absolutely fine dont bother panicking
3625,I like it
3626,I don't see it as uneven. Ye thicken the middle a bit if you really got an issue. Different angles and movement of your arm and skin are going to look different

3633,"Ugh... where do I begin? I’m only 19 but I was just starting to make steps to finally get out my shell after being a shy shut-in in high school. I was also finally starting to really improve my mental health, which was huge for me since I’ve struggled with anxiety since I was little. I was looking forward to finally going to parties and bars (after literally not going to any in hs), going to shows, going on adventures and having crazy stories to tell afterward, hell even network more often for my future... buuuuuuut then covid got out of control.

All the little steps to become more outgoing felt like it was all for nothing. Everything was thrown out the window. At the beginning of lockdown when I had to go back to my parents, I briefly reverted back to high school me — a *super* socially awkward, *super* uptight, *super* anxious mess. Plus, many of my family members got more toxic as the days went by.

Despite all the bad things, a few good things happened that helped me move forward again. The meds I’ve been taking (combined with some online Zoom therapy) has helped me slowly regain control of my life. I worked on some skills, changed my major to something that I actually like (and is closer to what I wanna do), and I finally realized that I’m asexual after *several months* of questioning my sexuality.

I’m now back on my own and I moved into an apartment. Even though things still suck ass for the most part, I still feel a lot better on my own. I’m hoping by the time covid gets under control I’ll become that outgoing, adventurous person I’ve always strived to be... even if things aren’t going to be the same when this is all over."
3634,I empathize and I’m so sorry. & thank you ❤️
3635,"Trivial? Excuse *you* this is **not** trivial at all. These measures have a severe impact on our mental health and you should not be ashamed to voice them!!

I wholeheartedly agree fwiw. I'm just glad as a 22 y/o I'm in a country where when I was 16 I was legally allowed to drink and could go clubbing, my clubbing days were 17-19 y/o and am I grateful for these years.

Corona really screwed us young people hard. My favourite club has died due to these measures, and many more clubs will fall. It's all very sad."
3636,My great grandpa wrote in his diary about how the Spanish Flu ruined his teen years
3637,Same honestly. I’m a freshman in college even though I’m 22 (Ik) this totally ruined the experience. I was looking forward to meeting new people and getting out and finally saving up enough money for a car and getting a job but this completely screwed me over. I’ve always wanted to go bar/club hopping or go to a real life party that I always saw on tv or just freaking enjoy my youth but now I feel like there’s nothing left for me anymore. The worst of it is that I feel like an absolute failure alone still at my moms house with no income or transportation
3638,"Fully agree, although I've been able to have a decent bit of clubbing & festivals etc. bc I'm 21 now and have been able to go out since 18, my parents were telling me about being in their early 20's and saving for a year to fly to Europe and backpack around on almost no money and it dawned on me that there's a good chance my best mate and I might not get the chance to do the cheapo backpack tour of south-east Asia we've been talking about since high school before life passes us by. If I was in your shoes and hadn't been able to even go to a bar legally yet I'd be rightfully a bit annoyed."
3639,"IRL socialization is a HUGE part of life ... COVID has destroyed that for a lot of people. You're not alone in this thinking.

(Also, this virus has existed in various forms for a few million years. It just keeps evolving and mutating.)"
3640,I know  what you are feeling  right now.  I am going to Graduate coming May. I'm home with my family instead of my friends in college making valuable  memories and it saddens me deeply. I started 2020 with a bang by achieving  a few long-awaited goals and was about make a lot more progress but have to postpone all my plans due to the pandemic. It just sucks!
3641,Unfortunately It's just another day in the life for me. I lost a good portion of my adolescence to depression and I have only been maybe 3 year free from it. It sucks because I was finally learning how to be more social after going weeks at a time without talking to people as a teen. This damn virus kinda screwed me over and put me back where I was before minus the depression. Now I just sit in front of my computer all day and work while rarely speaking to anybody.
3642,"I relate to this, I was supposed to transfer to a university from my local community college this semester and was really looking forward to the dorm experience. I wasn't social in highschool and I was looking to be more involved in university. But because of the pandemic I won't be going on campus until next year."
3643,"100% feel this, I finally moved out to university after struggling for years (I'm 2 years behind my technical academic year) and I got a tiny bit of taste of freedom, then covid happened and took it away. Currently I've moved in with my friend, but my parents are insisting I move back home, but it's like, I have no one at home, like 0 friends nearby, I just want to live a bit of life before I graduate (hopefully) and go straight into a job. It really has bummed me out man, having finally found friends that don't just sit inside and play games all day, I was happy, but yeah. Oh well, it is what it is."
3644,Best of luck!
3645,“I’m really too young to be feeling this old” -drake

3648,I mean something's better than nothing right? The demon chick sounds cool.
3649,Yeah but I already sold my soul for godly guitar skills but got ripped and had to settle as a bassist

Hella scrambled eggs oh yeah 😎👌"
3651,"I mean bassists are pretty epic, they're basically anarchists along with the electric guitarists. They do whatever they want in a band as long as it sounds good XD"

3664,"You actually get rejections? 

Whenever I get a job rejection, it looks more like this:

Edit: I now realize it maybe seems like I'm being a douche saying ""naw bro I don't get rejections cause all I do is win"". Nah, it's just they never fucken tell me"
3665,Best kind of rejection mate. Keep your head up!

These times they get me stuff that's useful, and I get them stuff that's useful. Don't spend a lot and it's all good.

Most people aren't fussed about presents during Christmas, they enjoy the time off, being with family and of course the food. Don't stress yourself too much."
3692,I too want to spend more than $150 on uncomfortable earbuds with mediocre sound.
3693,That's what I'm hoping for at least :D
3694,"What amount of money are we talking? 10, 20 or 30 bucks can get a great gift. But yeah if you have a few family members then that does really add up."
3695,"We used to try to do gifts for everyone in our familys. Now we have all agreed to just do a white elephant or secret Santa. The problem is they normally do a kids and adults white elephant and my wife and I are considered a part of both groups. So the people the least financially stable and with the most hectic schedules have to contribute the most. It's gotten better over the years, but Christmas always hits us more than we expect financially."
3696,"I feel you. Luckily my family is super practical, so even if it doesn’t cost much if I can get something that is useful for them they will be happy."
3697,"Most people don't literally get kicked out, but in North America once someone is over 18 there's an expectation that they'll suddenly learn to be independent and not need their parents anymore. If you're older than 22-23 it's considered childish to live with your parents, even if you're working or going to university. It's ridiculous."
3698,"24 still living at home in my european country just like many friends. No one I know got kicked out at 18!

(You mean America/USA perhaps)"
3699,You work at a highschool.  Man people like you make me feel like I’m falling behind in life.  Due to my health I’ve taken multiple semesters off of college and I’m 20 and will likely get graduate my 2 year community college in May since I’m not going this semester and I didn’t finish my 2018 semester.      Anyway.  People are just zoomin. I feel like I need a kid and house by time I’m 30 or I’ve failed.
3700,"I like how your last post was the exact same wording except *asking* if 25-29 yr olds are considered young, and then now that you got your answer, you're declaring that it isn't and that you're sad people think otherwise.

That's good having conviction my mans."
3701,"Definitely can’t say “no one”, it happens, even if uncommon. Typically in already unhealthy households."
3702,"Nothing, im saying it was kinda like seeing a journey in your thought process and it was interesting"
3703,Your young till you let yourself be old. You'll always be considered old to someone. And youll be young to others. I wouldn't worry about it.
3704,"You're doing perfectly fine and don't let people pressure you. I got lucky and had a teacher who offered me the tutoring job since I was pretty good at math. You're going to college and are planning on graduating which I think already puts you ahead of a lot of people. I get it though, I know people who are way ahead of me financially, have kids, or are married and it makes me feel like I'm falling behind too. just remember to focus on yourself and don't worry about what other are doing. Your going to achieve much better things in the future, just remember to stay determined and don't give up. Good luck and stay safe."
3705,"Unfortunately it's more common in the US than you might think, to be actually kicked out."
3706,"Jeez. If everybody just does their thing, without judging themselves or others for their age, the world would be a slightly happier place."
3707,"What? Yes I did post something similar earlier, and I saw your response (which I totally agreed with). I just...liked this wording better and wanted to repost? I’m sure it’s not uncommon for Redditors to post something, then change their mind about, and repost again. I guess I’m not understanding what the problem is here..."
3708,well different cultures different people different minds we cant say anything.
3709,yeah sorry for generalisation.  :)
3710,"I have also def seen older people say stuff like this too, and I agree with you that when they say it comes from projection probably."
3711,"4 years is still a good chunk of time, but I get where they're coming from because the time seems to pass you by faster the older you get. It's the blink and you're 30 syndrome. Plus you're several years older than most of the people on this sub, and you don't really think about how being 26 is different from being 30 until you actually get there."
3712,"Think it depends on the situation. If you're legitimately giving it a good effort and struggling to get from under your parents wing. Nothing wrong there

But if you just laying around bumming.. dude what are you doing with your life lol. I'm 26 and am living a way better life then I could have with my parents. I left at 20 for reference

Again depends on the situation. Other things too besides what I mentioned"
3713,"Haha I’m actually 24, but turning 26 next year so I’m kinda “preparing” in that sense lol. I guess I’m just confused cuz even as a teen, I didn’t think 26/27/etc was remotely old, so I guess I find the difference in mindset kinda jarring."
3714,"No one in the US gets “kicked out” at 18. And everyone I know that still lives at home doesn’t get shamed for it. It’s more common than you think, especially with rent prices the way they are these days"
3715,"Ah I see haha. I think the first post was a roundabout way of expressing how I was feeling, and then I decided, “Fuck it, I’ll be blunt.”"
3716,"Right now I don't have many time-sensitive things to do, so it's not uncommon for me to spread 2-3 hours of work over the entire day. But if I *have* to get something done within a certain time frame, I can."

3721,I will sit down to do a 30 minute assignment and three hours later I’ll still have about half way to go
3722,I know like two of those words
3723,Might be ADHD/ADD. Procrastination is a major flaw of mine but I’m noticed I can go hard on a assignment at the last moment. I was able to knock out a 1200 page paper in 2.5 hours. I’m betting your great when you’re under pressure with an assignment as well?
3724,Oh yeah I forgot

3726,The worst this is when you procrastinate your homeworks but at the same time get distracted when you're doing them just a few hours before submission deadline. FML.
3727,I felt that so hard...Good luck though
3728,Yes once the pressure is extreme and I know there’s no other way out and time is close to running out then I can get things done extremely fast. I need the panic to settle in before I’m in the zone 🤣

The thing is I needed a logo for my college assignment but I have no clue how to make it, so I was going to ask you for ideas. Sorry my initial comment came out wrong."

3751,Kinda sad to think about it as our generation.

3767,Any sort of intimacy would be great.
3768,"Yes, I want to be cared and loved, not to be fucked."

 but more than intimacy I will think of finding love"
3773,Ridiculously easy for some people maybe. ;)
3774,"Wait till 18, it'll get you someday"
3775,"Maybe I’m in the minority here, but does anyone else think it’s ridiculously easy to find a hookup? That’s not really an issue, sex is easy to find.

Intimacy in a relationship format, with someone you *actually* want to be in a relationship with, has been a bit tougher. Its def been harder for me to find girls who have similar interests that I like being around. 

I’m sick of being used for sex and using other people for sex, bc that’s genuinely what it feels like sometimes."
3776,Why did this get down voted so much wow
3777,Maybe but with how much I love my work and how bad my luck is with women I highly doubt it.
3778,"My boyfriend and I moved in together after covid started. We'd planned to do it eventually, but lockdown accelerated our plans. Not to brag, but it's been pretty great to always be around someone who cares so much about me (even when I've been repeatedly sick during all this.) It's also gone surprisingly well considering we're around each other 24/7."
3779,"You're lucky.

Closest I've gotten to someone like that they revealed they were ace, nb, and not attracted to me."
3780,"Don't worry, just keep being yourself, your time will come"

I appreciate the perspective."
3783,"Yeah, me too. We get fucked by life anyway..."
3784,Right?????? Like wtf
3785,"Nein, im an omori

Better to stay in white soace than go out"
3786,"Not only sexual. Before quarantine I was talking to this girl, not a big deal. But after like a month we began talking 24/7 and I fantasized about her a lot. I was like damn I wish I could cuddle her and kiss and feel loved"
3787,No cap I have some days when I feel bothered but beyond that I feel like quarantine has made me feel alot more isolated than anything. Isolated to the point where I can't imagine or crazy intimacy.
3788,"For me, not really, if anything quarantine has made me want a person to talk to at night"
3789,"Nope. Sex drive is a dead as ever. Been that way for years. Before the pandemic I had little interaction with people my own age. And even less now. There's also the incentive of not wanting to get pregnant ever, but much less in a time like this.

I just delve into my hobbies more."
3790,I will never look at bagels the same ever again.
3791,"BRUH THE BAGELS 

IM SLEEEEP 💀 
But in general I guess half/half."
3792,"Bro absolute mood, i’m caught between yearning for literally any relationship/intimacy and also having to stay away from all humans outside bc i still live w my parents and theyre immunocompromised so i gotta be hella careful abt covid. Gonna be so desperate to get a boyfriend once this is all over😂
But yeah i def relate to u"
3793,"I completely agree! I wasn't actually super sexually active pre-covid but since my country has been on lockdown for 10 months now, I've really been craving for cuddles, kisses, even sex! Worst part is my partner is halfway around the world and it never helps! I got COVID about a month ago and this has made me even more scared to go out. I hope after all this we could all go back to doing are personal business without getting any virus! Cheers!"
3794,Quarantine doesn’t really have anything to do with it. I haven’t been in a relationship in years and I think I’m finally ready to date again so I’m just listing to f4f asmr and getting super lonely and sad cause Idk how to find a gf that’ll hold me like in those audios.
3795,“These fucking bagel holes are even looking sexier by the day” is my new favorite sentence!
3796,"Personally I’m not like particularly more horny (I don’t think I’ve ever been) but I’m just more desperate for intimacy. Like desperate as in my standards have gone down, and I could tolerate a lot more than what I would have before for even the illusion for intimacy (appearance, personality, etc). Fuck i sound so pathetic lol"
3797,Yemen has always been one of those countries that no one generally cares about since it doesn't really have any resources or have any strategic importance. US and European countries aren't gonna talk about it because Saudi Arabia is one of the causing factors for the current crisis and other middle eastern countries are either on Saudi Arabia side because of the Iran sponsored Houthi militia or they're too busy with their own shit.
3798,probably why the media isn't covering this
3799,"Contact your local and higher level government representatives and ask them to impose penalties on Saudi Arabia. Unless you live in SA or Yemen, there isn't much the average person can do on their own"

3801,Pretty sure this has been talked about continuously for years. It’s just not always popular on Instagram
3802,i weirdly enough found out from instagram
3803,Yeah. It’s popular now with woke crowd
3804,Did you post this in the Discord too?
3805,how do you think people can help then?
3806,nope not on it
3807,Do you want me to post it there too?
3808,People who live in SA can’t really speak about it because they don’t have free speech laws
3809,ofc
3810,"If the SA govt doesn't listen to their own people, I cannot imagine a world where they listen to a petition from a bunch of angry white people."
3811,"UK, US, and Canada may listen to a petition telling them not to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia"
3812,"Yep, that's exactly what I said in the comment earlier in the chain"
3813,"Every time I read a post like this my heart aches. These are innocent people who have their life taken away suddenly because of a momentary impulse. To think that all of these deaths could be prevented from attending to people's mental health - countless young lives could be saved.

Edit: Just wanted to add, can't imagine what you're going through OP. Hope you can come to terms with this horrible experience"
3814,"You don't know what he was going through, sometimes what we see is only the top of the I iceberg"
3815,"I've been that person, although I'm fortunately still alive I think all the time about how I would've affected those around me, this type of stuff is never easy and mental health is even more difficult to battle, as messed up as it sounds I don't blame or extremely discourage people who commit suicide, I've been there for too long, just wish it was easier to get help.."

(Sorry for making that about me...just nice to see somebody else doing it)"
3819,It’s all good. Nice to know I am not the only one either. My SO and I are both 19.  It can get a little alienating when you think you are the only one with a relationship longer than a year. I just figured that I have found an SO who’s brand of crazy fits mine perfectly so we got lucky... lol
3820,i’m 19 and i had dated someone for 7 years. we broke up though. it’s crazy seeing other people who have been in super long relationships. it’s not common for young people. good luck!

Oh wait, he's not... because he's trapped in a containment tube for all of eternity."
3839,"That's exactly how I feel. It was the last year which felt like it had a charm and the world was normal. 2017 was maybe an exception, but everything since feels very bland."
3840,"I think it’s partially you being a kid and partially politics not being so crazy.

I mean, from 2012 to 2016 Obama was in his second term as president, while republicans controlled the house and senate. They made a big fuss from 2008-2012 with birtherism, the tea party movement, etc. to try to win the 2012 election, but that failed. Obama won a second term. He can’t run for a third term though, so there was no use on continuing trying to paint him in a terrible light. So things calmed down a bit. Meanwhile because congress was republican while the presidency was democrat, not much could get done. There were no massive steps backwards, and there weren’t any big policy changes that made the news either. Things just kinda stayed still. They were at a stalemate. At most we got the occasional Supreme Court ruling like Obergefell (which was a pretty positive moment overall) or negative rulings the press didn’t talk much about. So yeah, nothing really happened. It was just stable. 

Then in 2016 we got the presidential election with all that nonsense, then trump got elected and he was crazy and passed a bunch of highly unpopular laws with the Republican Congress. Then we had the impeachment post 2018 and then coronavirus. Then the next presidential election. 

Honestly I think 2022 felt pretty normal in comparison to the last few years. Even though we lost abortion rights, that was really the only big negative in politics that happened that year. Covid was mostly over too. But as we approach 2024 things will probably ramp up again : ("

3861,I listen to a lot of music and especially some of the songs I know were released recently make me feel useless. I'm already a year older than the musician the inspired me to pursue music a little more seriously and it just kills me.

If you are going to college have a solid groups of friends you have been to hell and back with and you are just hanging out an enjoying life. It’s okay to just be happy. If other are doing a million other things it doesn’t matter. Everyone is different and if you want to try something then do it if you can but it’s okay to live a normal life , get a decent job, hang with friends ,and spend time with family and the people that love you. Don’t measure your happiness by others lives. Everyone is always doing something different then you and to some dude Somewhere your life is the gold standard he is measuring his life by while you measure yours by some else’s achievements. Don’t compare lives just be happy as best you can And try to achieve your own goals and dreams."

Apparently she was going onto stores harassing customers and employees. Last thing I needed was to get screamed at by psycho Monika while trying to pay for my food."
3922,Restaurant owners may not give a fuck but the employees don’t get paid enough to protect their employers who obviously could care less if they die.
3923,"Fair enough. I would just honestly think a struggling restaurant would not give a fuck. While the pandemic is a huge deal, I would think they would care more about keeping their livelihood. Sounds selfish I know, but I think its a realistic assumption. Just my 2¢."

3983,"I was hit by a terrible diseases at the beginning of quarantine, and have been able to undergo treatment without anyone noticing, or me needing to pretend things were fine. From a purely egotistical POV, lockdown have been my saving grace"
3984,Proud of you OP! Have a wonderful day :)
3985,happy cake day (:
3986,"I plan to! I'm half way to my goal of 50 pounds, so there's still a lot more work to do"
3987,Whoopppppp go on
3988,"That’s good, lockdown was pretty solid for me too. It was like a forced staycation and mental recalibration. Cut a WHOLE lot of toxic people/stuff out of my life, reconnected with family, some old friends, lost weight, started working out again, etc. i essentially just found myself again - all in the course of about a year while stuck at home 80% of the time. Funny how things work out sometimes."
3989,I made a ridiculous amount of money during the pandemic bc essential workers life. It was great for me
3990,Thank you so much. I hope your day is great as well
3991,I lost recently lost the Covid weight I picked up and I’m so pleased with my body now :) I had a beer belly as a girl D:
3992,Way to go
3993,That's great!
3994,Opposite for me
3995,Good shit bro
3996,"I experienced a ton of negativity during quarantine but it helped me to see the darker side of my personality, learn from it and work past it and be a better person. Quarantine was AWFUL for me, but I think it is a net positive because I will emerge a better person because of it."
3997,Hell yeah!
3998,Happy cake day :D
3999,I will!!
4000,"Yeah, if your post history translates to the way you behave in real life, I'd find you a little creepy too."
4001,What is a cheese hat?
4002,"Cheese hat is a Cheesehead hat, Here is a Wikipedia article explaining the concept

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesehead

It’s a hat you see a lot at sporting events in Wisconsin Maryland and pretty much the Northeast and Midwest"
4003,I’m pretty sure the hot blonde chick who is my neighbour who looks around my age is creeped out by me because I often stare out my window and stare at her whenever I am lucky enough to see her.
4004,"I was totally imagoning a hat that looked like a block of cheese, which would have been ridiculous but very funny."
4005,"Same. It was four years ago for me, meaning freshman who started HS *after* I graduated would now themselves be graduating. Crazy. Looking back is weird because I'd say I was a different person then.

My long-term memory isn't great, so what I mostly have is bits and pieces instead of the continuous flow that some people get."
4006,When you were in high school it felt like a long time when your out of high school it only feels like a brief moment.
4007,"It is oh so real. I would give anything to press fast forward until I’m heading off to college. Anyone who says highschool was the best years of their life, you peaked there, and now they have to live with that."
4008,"One of the weirdest things for me is that even though I graduated HS 2 years ago, it feels like it was ages ago. I often think of events that happened during that time as being 4 or 5 years ago, when really it was 2 or 3. Also, there are people who I think I haven't seen in ages when, again, it's only been a couple years."
4009,I felt exactly the same way and you’ll be surprised at what you miss.
4010,It seems like a blur to me. I’ve been out for four years and it’s still so strange
4011,Like I used to be so concerned about everything going on in hs and now that I graduated last year it feels like nothing. I can imagine how I’ll feel about college once I graduate from there.
4012,Also just finished freshman year and man I’m so much happier no longer waking up at 6 am everyday. Sleep is such a mood booster our education system needs to realize that. My quality of life has been great since hs ended
4013,"congrats, youre now officially feeling ""the years flying by"". its scary."
4014,"Yeah, it went pretty fast. Still, remember as a freshman the teacher told the class that we'll be outta there fast and yep."
4015,Definitely. My quality of life hasn’t improved much but at least now i’m actually making steps to improve it and not just living the same thing over every single day.
4016,"My teacher told my class that freshman year as well, my school even did this thing where they brought in some seniors the first day of high school and had them tell us how fast it would fly by. I sort of shrugged it off, most of us
did, but here I am, two years since I graduated. Not going to lie time is flying even faster in the adult world, like I will be 21 in less than a year?? Make it make sense"
4017,I graduated 3 years ago. It feels like it was only a week ago. Only 2 years ago when I was still an actual teenager. And I still look like one today. I would have no problem fitting in. lol
4018,2022 lowkey shit
4019,It's gotten real bad lately for me yesterday I had a panic attack as well

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/youngadults) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
4022,Why???
4023,"Me too. I feel as if I’m bothering them, so I just stopped reaching out all together unless they reach out to me first because it seems I’m always the first one to reach out."
4024,My only advice is to talk to them about it. You may find they do indeed want to interact with you but something's getting in the way of them reaching out.
4025,"Damn. I suppose I’d just hoped differently bc we were already a pretty tightknit group, just 5 or 6. & the majority of them live in the same city; I’m the only one that had to move hours away. But you’re right, I guess it’s just one of the unfortunate changes of young adulthood"
4026,That’s a good idea. I just have to think about how to approach without seeming pressy
4027,"Exact opposite for me. Everyone moved to a different country / city. The only times I see them is either online (for my close group) or when friend X does a party for idk... Sylvester and all visit again.

I didn't move out out of fear of loneliness and yet here I am... alone in my bedroom at home."
4028,"I feel you. I am also facing similar shit. Many a nights I feel like talking to someone but no-one would be available. Pre-Covid I used to have a large friend circle, 40+ regular contacts from college. And now it's usually me and 2 more friends who catch up.

It's not that others wouldn't talk to me, just that I would have to be the one reaching out, everytime. And honestly it sucks a bit.

In the starting months, I used to regularly organise video calls sessions, but once when I stopped noone attempted to start it again. 

And the funny thing is it's not that they are too busy or something. Even they don't have people to talk to or vent out to. It's just a generation thing - Most of us suck at reaching out to people.

It feels great whenever someone reaches out to you, even if to just ask you something trivial. So whenever you are reaching out to others, you are actually making their day."
4029,"Man, same thing. It’s killing me sometimes, weird kind of pain"
4030,Maybe. Would genuinely baffle me but tbh nothing’s impossible
4031,"Yea that’s something I thought a lot about after hs graduation. Some ppl youre only cool with bc you see them in the halls everyday.

I had a friend or two like that and we barely talk, which I’m actually fine with. For the ones I hoped would go the long haul though, it kinda stings"
4032,"Not exactly the first thing to consider. And not productive either, because it just makes you resent them, and if you're wrong, it'll make them feel upset too."

4035,public policy lol. Love hate relationship bc I’m passionate about the community work but bored af with the technical language/process 😭sorry about your friend! Young bonds are really a different kinda close
4036,maybe they don't see you as a friend tho?
4037,Disappear with fake documents and run away

4040,"My friends & I have always talked about how we think we have the strategy, planning & execution abilities to pull off a great bank heist. We've always said we'd love a chance to try if we could somehow guarantee that we wouldn't get into any legal trouble, or hurt anyone in the process."
4041,What *specifically* is illegal about that?
4042,And with the pandemic lots of parking lots are empty so I'm not saying to go throw a Molotov but

4051,"Throw one of those mansion parties with alcohol and stuff. Kinda like those ones you see in movies? Idk, that’s as much illegal activity as I need in my life."
4052,"when i was a kid i’d compulsively steal stuff from friend’s houses, just toys and plushies and legos and things, and i stopped around the time i got into middle school. i’d absolutely love to either mug or stealthily rob some old boomer, or a rich entitled karen whose equally entitled children used to bully me. i think it’d be super exhilarating to just knock out half of some CEO’s pockets and anonymously donate it to a charity that really needs it"
4053,some guy threw shoe on president bush back then in 2003's
4054,nah I got other hobbies I can't do while high
4055,Work and live in a different country without the permit/visa.
4056,"I was in a high speed chase for like 30 second-1 minute in 2017. I got away but it was not fun at all. cop was going opposite direction and had to turn around, I floored it around a school bus and took a left full speed at a fork in the road. Drove deep into the subdivision and parked my car on a quiet backstreet. Left my car there for the day and took the bus to my university. Kinda realized how much it could of fucked my life up if I had gotten arrested."
4057,**oh no**
4058,"Steal a road sign, smoke pot on the roof of a police station, drive (cant get a permit/license due to covid closing the DMV.)"
4059,You had me at whole onion
4060,You better have getaway music planned
4061,smoke pot everyday

4068,i live with him !!!
4069,Dude this is a blessing. I cant even tell you how much i want a kid brother who talks to me the way your brother does :(
4070,I think he misses you.
4071,I wish I had a cultured sibling I could converse about Doujinshi with.
4072,Lmao. I wish I was that cultured.
4073,Be grateful bro. It's such a blessing that your little brother trusts you enough to be his silly self around you. And he thinks of you even during the night. I think a lot of siblings wish they were this close.
4074,I'm glad my siblings don't think of me when reading doujinshi 😂
4075,"That sucks bro! I agree with u/Anthadvl , show us some of your projects! Let's celebrate the ones you've created, together."
4076,"You're posting about trustfund kid shit like owning properties and doing stupid nutri-diets, and spend a lot of time in the steroids reddit.

You seem like the kind of guy who'd bully a homeless person for a laugh."
4077,Did he at least apologize?  That would suck
4078,"I feel bad and totally understand your frustation, but I think its cool think to have a friend that can brag about your accomplishments."
4079,Gimp
4080,"what assholes 

i think that's an awesome hobby and would love to see some of your works"
4081,If they made fun of you they’re the losers. Having a hobby is really cool and one of my favourite things in a person.
4082,"I mean they're destroying your property...isn't that reportable if you're staying at a dorm, no?"

4084,"can’t really relate to that impulse tbh, haha.

what is a nutri-diet?"
4085,sounds lame
4086,"I was 25 with only a HS diploma, and a 2 year old son working at a dead end warehouse job with no skills or plans for my future whatsoever. My gf at the time had a friend who’s husband was a commercial electrician and needed a helper. With ZERO experience in that field (and pretty much life)I took a leap of faith. 4 years later I’m a few months away from getting my commercial journeyman license. Now I’m 29 and make a good living and feel like I’m almost a completely different person then I was just 4 years ago. I never expected this path in life but when the opportunity came I seized it. Best decision of my life. Hopefully my little story here can give you some hope or motivation to make the change you need to in your life."
4087,i feel like this'll be me in 2 years
4088,Well as others said: find your **broad path**. Don't stay over yourself for years and years... Don't do nothing. You're still young! You got this!!
4089,Are you guys still together?
4090,"Yes! So we all have a relationship with our self. You want to have a healthy relationship with yourself. Treat yourself kindly, look out for yourself, give yourself a healthy lifestyle, be good to your body and mind. This is more difficult than it seems because many things that aren’t good for us feel very good. 

So if you have an unhealthy relationship with yourself, you might do obvious things like thrill seeking in unhealthy ways (overboard on drugs, alcohol, maybe sex for some), in common impulsive behaviour. This is self sabotage. But it’s more insidious. In an unhealthy relationship with yourself, now you’re not being kind to yourself, you’re not looking out for your wellbeing. Relationships aren’t fulfilling because you won’t think you deserve better or that you’re even *capable* of being desirable or good to yourself and others. This sort of mistrust with yourself, demeaning yourself, insulting yourself, it is very easy to fall into a habit. These habits form a sort of codependency with external stimulus (and this can be overt in drug abuse, or covert in escapism into other platforms like extreme gaming etc) and even with this terrible feeling that you’re not enough (which is addictive in its own right). You lose your ability to withhold satisfaction for a better outcome. 

I broke up with myself when I took a hard look at myself on that drive. I spoke to the universe, to myself, whatever and realized I was in an unhealthy relationship and I broke up the whole personality I was buying into, thinking it would solve my inner unhappiness and malcontent. This hurts. You grieve yourself, who you used to be when you were healthy, how much “fun” you were having when you weren’t, how stupid you were to ever be in the situation. But you start to take meaningful, proactive risks. You slowly start to believe in yourself again and want more for yourself. 

I would not be able to tell you I thought I was capable of who I am now a couple years ago in my car. I didn’t believe I had the guts to make a change. But I did, and I broke up with the part of myself that was holding me back. I used to be suicidal, wonder what was the point. The hard truth is at the time I HAD no point and there was no point in the life I was living. I committed suicide in the sense I left behind an old unfulfilling life and formed a new one. And we are all capable. Our worst enemy is ourself. 

This is vague an convoluted. It’s an idea I’ve formed in my head over the years and don’t really talk about, and I’m sure with time I will be able to put it into words better, but that’s I guess the essence of what I meant. There’s obviously more to it, and pretty much anything in the analogy I used about breaking up with yourself applies. Anyway, thanks for reading the novel lol"

4092,"Work my man, work at anything that pays, driver, cashier, whatever you can get.


At some point you will realize what you want to do, hopefully."
4093,Not anymore but we have a healthy friendship for our sons benefit and I still maintain a relationship with her daughter/sons half sister.
4094,you're right :)
4095,The student has become the master.
4096,"Don't beat yourself up. All I'll say is go with he flow, and stay away from motivation killers. That means overusing marijuana, alcohol, videogames, sex, anything that gives instant gratification. I got depressed and spent about $1,500 on a two month alcohol binge. I'm just now starting to build my savings and my life back to what it was. I have a friend who I'm gonna room with in another state soon. Ill be picking up martial arts, a good hobby that builds discipline and motivation. There's tons of hobbies and activities like that you can do. D&D, running, learning a language, art, music, motherfucking chess.

Just do EVERYTHING in your power to keep from staying stagnant. I don't remember who, but someone said there's a million ways to go forward, but only one way to stay where you are."

4100,"It’s not for everybody so just ignore me if so but think about joining the military. Both of my parents were like that at that age and were in a worst position and college wasn’t an option for them. If it wasn’t for it my parents would still be in their hometowns like the rest of their family doing nothing good, not that it’s your case but you get the point. It really taught them a lot and you can do school while you’re in at your own pace so when you get out you have a degree that’s paid for. There’s so many career paths that you could do as well so I’m sure you could find something you like just don’t pick infantry. If you do though please be smart with the money because I see soldiers all the time waste it when they could be loaded by the time they leave. But really think about it it’s honestly not bad at all if you don’t know what you want to do even if you just do a couple years and get out."
4101,Can you explain a little more about breaking up with yourself?
4102,"Thanks for that. It's almost 2am. I am drunk in my bed, friend on the couch. I'll bend my way with your words.

You're putting youself and other people in danger."
4118,Nobody else needs to know! Takes me a good few hours to fully wake up 😂
4119,"I did. That’s where I got the .5%

Unlike most people, my car only heats up when I’m driving, so turning it on 15 minutes early won’t make the defroster defrost. 

Normally I would’ve waited but I had work. 

If it weren’t for the fact that I live in the country and that I’m I good driver, maybe I would’ve crashed.

But I do live in the country.
And I am a good driver

And it also helps that I could probably drive my road with my eyes closed considering I’ve been on it for 10 years. 

But you’re right. It was dangerous and stupid."

4167,"Just asking but if I use cold water, like straight out of the tap will it break?"
4168,"if you want to help defrost your car more quickly, you can use a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water 2:1 and a squirt of soap, this will help melt the ice quickly"
4169,"This is something that needs to be said?

I don't live in a place that has ever snowed and I still know that would be a bad idea.

Not trying to be judgemental just amazed that that's a thing that needs to be said. Didn't we all learn at some point in our childhood that if you quickly change the temperature affecting glass it will shatter...

Edit: I don't know what car windshields are made off. If it's not glass then ignore me"
4170,"Probably not, but its just gonna freeze faster and make it much worse. Just run the defroster and scrape the ice if you have a snow brush or ice scrape."
4171,"just was recently told this, have tried it and it works pretty well

I now have an alcohol spray bottle in my car

it also doubles as a distraction aid, like pocket sand"
4172,Yes. I live in the south and did this unknowingly. We do not have the same level of street smarts when it comes to the cold. I had a crack on my windshield as well. Thank god it didn’t completely shatter.
4173,Warm water in a sandwich bag works. Just make sure its tied properly.
4174,"FUCK YEA! I'm so proud of you! Self confidence can be such a big step. 

I have keloids all over my back and shoulders so tanktops are hard :( I know the struggle so congrats on making the step!"
4175,"Hell yeah dude !

Edit: wait are you a guy or girl?"
4176,"Good for you dude

I hope the weather was nice, at least. It would've sucked if you made up your mind to wear a tank top that day and then it started raining."
4177,For a good part of the day it was hot but in the evening thunderstorm came and it started raining hard
4178,I hope you're as proud of yourself as I am!! I know it can be a struggle 💕💕💕
4179,proud of you <3 you're beautiful the way you are homie
4180,Thank you. I hope you'll be able to get rid off those keloids one day or not think about them as much and enjoy hot days as you would like to
4181,"I'm a guy, don't worry"
4182,What about corona though!
4183,"I have to say, I find it kind of odd that you’d decide to go out on a date while simultaneously knowing about the state of the world right now. It’s great that you worked up the courage to ask, but are you sure that’s a good idea?"
4184,It will be a bit awkward with the masks but I just couldn't wait to ask any longer!
4185,"Is that gonna be a zoom/facetime date? (I mean if its not, rmb to keep ur distance!!)"
4186,"Hell, I’ll take the downvotes. Good for you and screw all these people. Breaking out of your shell is a damn hard thing to do and I’m happy it worked for you. I don’t get why all these people are upset when tons of places all over the country are reopening, anyways."
4187,To hell with stay at home orders and social distancing I guess.
4188,Ehhhhh I’d wait until this fucking corona thing is over before doing anything out of the house
4189,"We are in indeed in a fairly low risk area! I would have waited longer if there was higher number of cases. 

I don't know if I would count Germany as a low risk country given how many total cases we have, but my city itself is doing pretty well with only around 0.27% of the population being known cases."
4190,Leave room for Jesus!
4191,"He can probably justify it to himself quite fucking easily if the rules allow him to meet up with friends/family in small groups, as is the situation in a lot of countries at the moment. You have no idea where he lives & there's no need to be such a cunt about it."
4192,Slayer
4193,"They may be in a very low risk area in a low risk country and not need to be overly worried.

To be frank, covid would've been stopped from travelling if countries stopped bringing planes full of people across oceans bringing the virus."
4194,If she takes off her mask its a sign to go in for the kiss. You got this!!
4195,Good luck!
4196,Will still be keeping our distance and stuff but we dont really live in a high risk area.
4197,"I've been outside 5 times total in the past 7 weeks, always with a mask and keeping my distance. Monday, things like schools, all stores and outside public pools are opening again."
4198,What are you doing together?
4199,Don’t get addicted to porn  Lool have fun
4200,Depends more on if either if them live with anyone at risk tbh
4201,Thank you!
4202,Gonna have some frozen yogurt and just relax
4203,"It went pretty good! We met at the frozen yogurt place, talked a while and then she had to go pick out a new kitchen with her parents."
4204,nah man im almost 21 and this was my first. it just took some time and the right person ^^
4205,[removed]
4206,How'd it go?!
4207,I’m as old as 19 and I still have no date. I guess that makes me an incel.
4208,"Good luck buddy!

Erstes Date ist 'ne coole Sache. :D
Mach dir keine Sorgen, falls du etwas nervös oder aufgeregt bist. Meiner Meinung nach gehört das zu jedem Date dazu. Macht die ganze Sache spannender. Man muss sich nur darauf einlassen. 

Masken und 1,5m Abstand sind vielleicht etwas awkward, aber ich sehe nicht, warum das Date dadurch nicht trotzdem gut werden sollte. :)"
4209,"It went pretty good! We met at the frozen yogurt place, talked a while and then she had to go pick out a new kitchen with her parents."
4210,"That's awesome!! Congratulations

When's the next one?"
4211,"Dude. You missed my point completely but ok. You assume op lives in America where covid is bad, without asking if they perhaps lived in a country that hasn't had a single case yet."
4212,"I kinda miss it, everything was so much simpler. Maybe that's because we were all children, but it seems like things were a lot less complicated"
4213,"The early 2000's were honestly like leftovers from the 1990's. I was also born in 1998, i wish i remembered more of the 2000's."
4214,Definitely because you grew up. Stuff was always complicated
4215,"I was also born in ‘99, I remember playing Blackhawk on my dad’s colorless flip phone - now I have a VR headset. 

The amount of technological changes is absolutely mind boggling"
4216,Holy shit wife swap I remember that
4217,"1998 REPRESENT, what I remember most was the Great Recession, that had a pretty big impact on growing up then. Made you realize how valuable money is and how easy the economy can just drop out on you even being that young..."
4218,I love the 2000’s honestly
4219,"yeah dude - i was born in 2000 but i feel you , things changed so fast - technology just exploded and sped our progress as people up so much"
4220,"The 2000s felt like a big big mess, there was just so much trashy stuff everywhere"
4221,"The internet and computers started evolving at a super fast pace and the 2000s just got stranger from there

~~Also nearly forgot Wife Swap was a thing~~"
4222,I just choose to acknowledge that the 2000's never happened sometimes
4223,"9/11 and the wars that followed, the 2008 recession, the rise of social media (it started in the late 00's, but the rise to total ubiquity is totally a 10's thing). It was a pretty eventful decade."
4224,[deleted]
4225,ok shush i was born in 1999
4226,I get really lonely coming home to an empty appt. Makes me miss living in a single room dorm sometimes lmao
4227,"You're not the only one..it seems like once I'm back home, i start worrying again.. like the time I spend with friends distracts me"
4228,yeah it happens to me all the time too
4229,I guess that settles me as an extrovert
4230,"I feel this. Recently I started making my first friend after moving (I'm 19/military brat) a year ago and every time I hang out with them I come home and feel empty. Which is weird especially cause I'm more of an introvert than an extrovert, and when I was completely alone I was fine, it's just after going to hang out that I feel bad. It's like coming down from a friend ""high"""
4231,As an introvert that would be my dream to come home to an empty house.
4232,"Yea I feel this, after like trips away especially"
4233,Same here
4234,"Is it existential, like realizing hanging out with your friends has a finite number?"
4235,I can hang out with friends go home and the next day feel like I need to go out again.  I’m an extreme extrovert so sitting in the house all day kills me.
4236,Same here dude
4237,"I don’t relate, usually after good social interactions I feel fucking fantastic, super confident, like I’ve achieved or done something impossible"
4238,"Hey El Dragon! Funnily enough I have 5 roommates, but in summer I'm the only one who stays in the city to work, and I barely see them when they are home. I would love a pet but you know landlords... Soon I'll move out and try to get a kitten maybe"
4239,I know exactly how you feel. I'm not exactly sure what the cause is but I imagine it's as simple as you had a good time and you miss it. When I get in those moods I try and make more plans with people so I have something to look forward to :)
4240,I think that might be social anxiety? That sounds like one of the symptoms.
4241,"Just read my mind, depression is a helluva thing"
4242,"Yes, because it gets really lonely at home and when I’m with my friends idk it’s just less lonely I guess"
4243,"No, not really. I usually feel either pumped, normal, or tired after a hangout."
4244,Find something to start learning at home i deal with the same feeling we are at the club or the studio all the time and when im alone it kills me unless im studying or something
4245,"I sometimes get sad about hanging out with old high school friends after it ends, maybe because I get the feeling we'll never be as close as we once were when we used to see each other every single day. Like I'm just trying to grasp onto the shadows of what used to be a vibrant friendship? I dunno, it worries me because now that I just graduated college, maybe \*every\* friendship will have this feeling. So it kinda terrifies me :("
4246,I guess because we feel sad that we are alone again and want to keep hanging out
4247,We really do all live the same life
4248,If going home makes you feel lonely maybe get a roommate or a pet?
4249,"I just clicked sort by new and upvoted you, is my quest to be nice to people done yet?"
4250,"Lad, you took ""being nice"" to another dimension"
4251,"Those “insufferable shitheels” may have something unique and positive about them. Go out of your way to find the positive attributes in people.

Nobody likes the person that finds the negatives in everyone. People love those who find the positives in everyone.

That doesn’t mean that you make friends with people who have very few positive attributes. That means that the individuals who really are great people stand out to you even more.

And if you’re purely surrounded by “insufferable shitheels” or people with very few positive attributes, it’s time to work on yourself so that good, well-adjusted people are drawn towards you."
4252,"Heck no, my guy. You gotta be oh so nice to yourself. You got to live with yourself 24h a day, 7 days a week, til the day you die. Treat yo' self, honey."
4253,And it'll continue to suck if keep being a dick to people.
4254,"""Be the change you want to see in the world."" I think that's from the Dalaï Lama. It's true though. If you give out positive vibes, you'll be helping not just yourself, but everyone."
4255,Am I allowed to be mean to myself?
4256,"But people are so incredibly shitty, this world is such a rotten place man"
4257,"It was actually Gandhi who said that. That quote was on a sign in every hallway of my high school. Unfortunately, no one ever read them."
4258,"I am trying, I am trying. Please stop pressuring me so much"
4259,"My bad, you're right. A good quote. It may seem really generic and over-uplifting, but it's actually really important. Like it's kind of all that matters."
4260,"I assume you guys also have the mindset of ""ooga booga going to bed at 2am and waking at 7:45am is good for me"""
4261,i sleep 8 hours every night. still constantly tired. what am i doing wronggg:(
4262,Are you eating right? A bad diet can affect your energy levels by a lot.
4263,More like 5:30 AM and 9 AM
4264,Hahaha just woke up and I got like 5:23 of sleep. Today's gonna suuuuuuuck. . . OP is right. Get your sleep.
4265,"Another thing I want to point out, too much sleep feels awful. I oversleep sometimes - and I feel more tired than not having slept at all"
4266,"Wouldn't know, I get neither"
4267,"Exactly this, you right. 

Never stay up to get work/studying done. The work will be shit, you'll not sleep enough, wake up tired, and then the work you do the next day will also be shit.

Sleep is key, don't stay up to be productive"
4268,/r/outside
4269,That might be it actually. I live in scandinavia and we all have vitamin d deficiency. Thanks! Im gonna look into it
4270,"In my case if i sleep for 8 hours, it's 2 hours too long. I'd try experimenting with your sleeping times on days you can miss."
4271,In my case it was Vitamin D deficiency. Go get tested.
4272,Nah I can't study with less sleep than 8 hours so I sleep between 7 and 9 most dayd
4273,i'm trying to but life is pretty boring  and i'm very isolated rn. Don't know what I could even do for half an hour without my PC or phone. Even when I study the lectures are videos on my laptop..
4274,"I am 20 , recently due to submissions of assignments, exams and all in the college make me go all nights till 3-4am, I barely sleep 2-3 hours a day, any solutions?"
4275,"I totally agree. I had a week off of school last week, slept a ton, and felt like a million bucks at least twice. That’s awesome!"
4276,never thought reading good advice on the internet could make me so sad... It takes me hours to fall asleep so much to think about... Don't get how some people just get knocked out whent hey lie down and close their eyes
4277,Maybe your sleep schedule is off. I know personally I am way more rested if I slept from 11pm to 7am than if I slept from 2am to 10am.
4278,Stop using phone or gaming or movies half an hour before you go to sleep?
4279,"meditating for ~15 minutes during the day helps me fall asleep at night. not a guided meditation and without music, and i just focus on my breath. and when i inevitably lose focus and start thinking about things (which happens usually after 5 seconds), i eventually remember that im supposed to be focusing on my breath and i start doing that again. 

it eventually makes the mind calm, and it helps me sleep because it makes it easier to not focus on all my thoughts when i lie down."
4280,Maybe try to get a pair of blue light blocking glasses- at the very least they’ll help a little maybe and they only cost like $15 bucks tops
4281,Tell him! Make a post afterwords please! Reddit cares for you.
4282,Let us know how it goes!
4283,"I definitely will, I’ll update around 9:30 pm PST"
4284,Yes do it! Tell us how it goes!
4285,"I reckon tell him, it'll be better for how you feel, and if he said it's ok to come to his class even when you're not enrolled, he obviously likes you too. It's good to talk to people you trust about how you're feeling, and if you trust this professor, then it's a good idea to talk with him imo. Let us know how you go tho!"
4286,"Agreed! My brother is doing his masters in creative writing, and thus he teaches an introduction to college writing course. He's told me that several students have have opened up to him about various things, come to talk to him after class about this & that, and he says he's always appreciative of them coming to him with any comments, issues, etc. because his primary goal is to help students and make a positive impact on them. Your professor will be overjoyed to know how much of an impact he's made, heck it might be one of the highlights of his year. Hang in there hun ❤👍"
4287,[deleted]
4288,"Well said, my math prof told us the same thing"
4289,"I will, I’ll update around 9:30 PST"
4290,"If you trust the professor i'd say you'd do well to open up to him. He might not be able to help you, but he might be able to direct you to someone who can. In any case he'll like to know you appreciate him and his classes."
4291,"Tell him, as someone who was a teaching assistant in college, when a student told me they needed help or enjoyed my ass it made my whole week if not month. Alot of the people who teach are there because they want to legitimately help others."
4292,"Dlive sounds like an interesting idea, I’ll consider it. But I’m happy your father cares."

4308,I'm in compsci right now and it's been pretty nice. Are you applying to state or any other schools?

4310,Ngl this sounds fake

4314,You’re not allowed to go back to their college dorms a lot of Universities have close their dorms and told people to go home
4315,How big is your house damn.
4316,Why in God's name are people not allowed to go back to their homes? Sounds like kicking out a kajillion people out onto the street in the winter isn't a big brain epidemic containment solution.
4317,What about people that permanently live in their dorms?
4318,I'm an introvert and this sounds like hell for me. I would kick them all out.

4323,"Wouldn’t bet on it. Adrenaline does things to you.

I passed one of the most complicated tests for my degree on no sleep and then crashed as soon as I entered my apartment. 

Nope, I wasn’t drunk, but mom’s effing car died 100 miles away from my place and we spent 16 hours on the road for a 3 hour trip. 

Made it to her place at eff o’clock and then had to drive myself to my place 

Cool experience /s

Also passed two tests in one day while high (prescription meds gone wrong... my doctor was horrified and took me off them as soon as I finished describing what happened)"
4324,m o r n '

I'll bite -- what subject? I'm a physics major about to finish my degree."
4326,[deleted]
4327,bro 4 bangs 3 adderal 1 brain cell...what the FUCCK
4328,"Damn. I’ve had to skip a night to finish an assignment, but I was in no way able to make an exam that day.

Though I must say that grading in my country is very different than in the us, and getting an A is near impossible, so I might have misjudged."
4329,"Cool! I'm an electrical engineer planning on getting a physics minor. The way my school works, though I probably won't have to take anything that advanced."
4330,"I’m not from the US either. Like I said, adrenaline is a big thing and you usually crash afterwards.

Also, you may be vert knowledgeable on the subject or the professor might be nice when it comes to grading

For the one I didn’t sleep, we basically have a crappy professor (there are several complaints against her but she can’t be kicked out because it’s hard to find specialized professors who’ll work for almost no payment) who tends not to allow students to pass based on an unknown and unstable criterion (aka her mood and how much she likes your face that day).

Many people (great students, btw, not the lazy ones) even end up retaking her subject after failing the three chances we get to take the final. Our grading system is based on 10 marks; we pass with 4/10. This lady usually gives people 5/10 at most if they’re extremely lucky or if she’s is in a good mood... this obviously messes up everybody’s average. Couldn’t believe it when I got 6/10... my test only showed two small mistakes without any further clarification so... very educational... learnt a lot /s"
4331,Weird flex but okay
4332,They asked me what I knew about theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.

4337,"Speaking from experience? If so, nice"
4338,"Bruh I shoulda done that...

I was talking to some girl last night, our friendship has been very rough recently... I asked her how Christmas was and she sent me a dick pic. I kept asking why the living fuck she sent me a picture of some dudes cock and she wouldn’t tell me. But later on she said it was because her boyfriend told her to do it so I would stop talking to her, even tho I literally only asked how her Christmas was and it made me talk to her more because I kept tryna ask her why she did it because obviously I’m super confused and shocked about it... also She’s aloud to message me earlier that day and ask me when I’m coming back from Christmas break because she wanted to see me for some reason but I’m not aloud to ask her how Christmas went for her like what the fuck lmao

And that was the moment I realized it was enough and it was time for me to walk away from and move on from that girl

4340,Nah I’d send one with a bunch of needles in it
4341,"Sound advice, or I could just send a cursed furry image back"
4342,Or block. Blocking works
4343,That’ll sure turn someone off
4344,"maybe, so why don’t we say... meme mondays?"
4345,"I agree! This could be a great place for young adults to have convos and whatnot, but this sub is currently tumbleweed city. I think including images would really help grow this place and make it the ultimate hub for young adults."
4346,"Now this I could get behind. One day for memes is much more bareable than images 24/7.

I would even be down to allow images as long as there are no memes. Like Sunday could be selfie Sunday or some shit idk. 

I came here to escape the shitty memes 🙃"
4347,thanks!

also for 20-30 year olds"

4351,"I agree with images, but we should have a strict no memes policy."
4352,"So post them in the discord. In a discussion sub like this, they are just spam. Imagine if /r/askreddit or /r/casualconversation allowed memes.

This shouldn't be ""/r/teenagers 2.0"" this should be ""/r/teenagers/new in 2016 2.0""."
4353,As long as it stays on a monday. The mods would have to control it so this place isnt filled with garbage
4354,"How about no memes ever? There's lots of places on Reddit for memes, this sub shouldn't be one of them."
4355,we should have other themed days as well!
4356,Images would definitely make this sub more entertaining
4357,"Images are allowed, you just have to link them in the body of your post."
4358,"But memes can be used as a tool to express relatability and if relevant to the sub, it can be very entertaining."
4359,nah chief

4427,"Lucky you, my friends and I went out to a club the other night (yes im in Australia its allowed again). So we got id checked at the door which is fairly normal and the once you are in they usually dont bother you again. My friend got his id checked 3 more times by 3 different bouncers once he made it in the club. No one else in our group got even so much as a 2nd glance and are all within a year of each other age wise."
4428,"They usually don't care to ID you. Probably company policy to, hence the sign, but they still don't give a damn to actually do it."
4429,I think it's just assumed that if you have the confidence and maturity to walk into a sex shop you are old enough to be in there in the first place.
4430,i went in one with my friends when i was 18 (and as a virgin felt kind of out of place lmao i had no idea what to do with myself) and no one carded me. idk why bc i’m 21 now and people still think i’m in high school
4431,I bet they would have asked for an ID if you tried to buy something. They were probably too lazy to bother at the door.
4432,The only price I remember is the fleshlight for $19.99. One thing that was really weird was that they had porn on DVD. I didn't even know that still existed

4434,"Nah, OP probably doesn't have the youth genes tbh. I got carded at a sex shop and for fireworks. It's annoying"
4435,Those signs are mostly for show in those stores in my experience. It’s just to deter young kids from entering
4436,"My mistake, I haven't been carded before as I do not have ""youth genes"". Just fake like you are meant to be there and it works."

4441,"Haven't read through the other comments so idk if it was mentioned, but they might have carded you if you bought something. My friends and i used to walk around the back of Spencer's all the time in high school, they didnt seem to care. Idk if a real sex shop is different though"
4442,I'm pleasantly surprised! Not like I need a fleshlight on account of the girlfriend mind you.
4443,Ive been carded. It's OP is probably a neckbeard
4444,Where do you live? I don't think I've ever heard of a law banning minors from entering or purchasing something from a sex shop. In fact I'd say teenage guys buying dildos as gag gifts probably make up a sizeable portion of revenue.
4445,I can kinda relate. I went to a restaurant at 16 and my friends and I ordered tequila and cocktails. No one asked us our age so we just ordered alcoholic beverages.
4446,"Back in high school my ex (F20) would get IDed everywhere she went to buy alcohol. She has tits like Mia Khalifa (they are natural btw) and the face of a 15 year old.

4461,"Look, I don't know you or your girlfriend so take everything I say with a genereous serving of salt. That said. You say you've been going strong for five years. Depending on both of you marriage, while a big step, may not be that unrealistic. If you feel she is the one you want to spend your life with, go for it, it really doesn't change much, just makes it official. 
However there are other factors. As a firstyear at university you definitely don't want the responsibility of a child. It would be bad for all three of you. University takes attention if you want to do it properly. Nothing too horribly much, but caring for a baby next to it... I don't think it's viable.
And leaving the baby as her responsibility only won't work either. No father should do that and it will take a toll on both of you if you do.
If you can and haven't already, you could try moving in together. Building a home isn't two minutes either. You finish university in the meantime and by the time you are done you two will have a stable life and home to welcome a little one to the family. 
As I said, serving of salt, I have no experience navigating relationships, let alone long term ones, so this is purely my opinion. I do have a few years of university experience though. I hope I could help."

4464,"I have coworkers who are interns like me, in their senior year of college and are married. 

I see no issue with it, they are mature and you can tell they didn't make any rash decisions. Now, college freshman? Eh I'd say it's okay-ish if you've been dating since early high school or something but 

1. I think it shows maturity if the couple decides to wait until they are financially stable near the end of college/wait til graduation

2. The first couple years of college can be stressful and big fights can result of that stress. If you two can make it through school then thats really good."
4465,"Personally I would definitely wait. If it's driving you to the brink of insanity, tell her how you feel. If she's really in love with you, she'll understand."
4466,"We learned in Psychology that when relationships start out, it's often as passionate love, but very quickly turns to companionate love. So it's not the end of the world if you don't feel the same amount of romantic passion as you did when you first started dating."
4467,"Id say marriage is fine as long as: 1. You guys are both ready to stay together for the rest of your life no matter what happens to eachother. 2. You guys have a 100% completely honest relationship with no lies, not even small ones. 

&#x200B;

People these days generally say early marriage is probably a bad idea, but i think that's because people see all these young marraiges fall apart way too soon. But i think that's probably because of how society views marriage these days: it's no longer seen as such a permanent thing. If you guys see it as something 100% permanent i'd say go for it since as long as you are honest witch eachother, you can solve anything.   


As for kids, i'd say finish college first, since it provides the proper stability that a kid needs, not just economically, but lifestyle wise aswell."
4468,"Nobody can tell you what's right for you. I see so many comments in this thread speaking in absolutes, as if there is 100% a right answer about what you should do. There's not. All anyone in this thread can/should be doing is telling you their experiences and giving their advice, but in the end it's on you.

Personally, I doubt I would have made it through college if I had been dealing with the pressure of planning a marriage. On the other hand one of my best friends got married our senior year and she didnt have any issues from it. 

I would suggest asking yourself if its something you really want right now and if you think you can handle it. Maybe make a chart of pros and cons, that can sometimes be helpful. 

Questions to consider:
Do you really want to marry this girl?
Will marrying her now have any negative impacts?
What would be the difference in marrying now versus waiting until after you've graduated?
Would an engagement make more sense and waiting to actually get married work best?

Starting with those and adding any others that come to you as you think things through would be a good start. Best of luck!"
4469,"Those two reasons are exactly my thinking. It just feels irresponsible to get married now.

I mean sure it sounds fun. It'd be wild to have a wedding and get tons of gifts and move in together....but also I have *no* money. I'm also trying to start nursing school and there's no way I'll have any time for a job then. 

The only reason I was debating is cause she's decently well-off in terms of money and is entirely willing to pay for everything, but I don't know if I love the idea of that. I feel like it could cause a weird mojo in the long term. 

Thanks for the advice! Feels a little weird to just turn to Reddit to be my personal advisor, but y'all are delivering"
4470,"Well, I’m pretty much in your exact position. I’m with my fiancé, been together for 7 years, engaged for 2, and I’m 21. Getting married will be great, if it’s the right person. I’m looking forward to mine, but the thing is for us engagement changed nothing. By that, I mean we still love each other the same and if we had to wait longer that would have been fine. Currently our wedding is planned for the last bit of 2020, right as I’m getting out of school. So I guess my advise is this: talk to her and fine out her true feelings on the matter. Perhaps propose proposing and have a long engagement to get the process started and committed. As for the baby...I can’t speak to that one and would recommend against that. Way too much of a time and money sink during the college years before you both have started careers

Best of luck regardless of your decisions!"
4471,"I got married my junior year of college to my hs sweetheart. We had been together long enough and knew we were gonna get married, so we decided why wait, we might as well reap the financial benefits too. 

A couple things, like any marriage at any age, you really gotta know. If there’s any doubt, that means you really don’t know yet. Both people have to be completely all in. You can’t force or speed up that all in. It has to be there and stay. Marriage is supposed to be permanent. Any doubt, even the smallest sliver of 1%, is no different than 100% doubt. You both need to be 100% no doubt. 

Secondly, my wife and I are still together and stronger than ever almost 12 years later. We have 2 kids and a good life. So it can definitely work out if you know what you want."
4472,"Timing isn't just about how long you've been dating. Different strokes for different folks. My brother met his now wife in college and they didn't get married until about 29--I think they wanted financial stability first. He didn't get his dream job--being a cop--until his late 20s, so I think that was a big part. Don't do it because you feel like you're supposed to. Do it because it feels right."
4473,Interesting perspective u/pain_in_the-anus
4474,"I know it's late, but I just wanted to add this.  


I've never met anyone who didn't feel nervous about getting married. Marriage is a huge commitment; you are going to be nervous. Just ask yourself, are you excited and nervous, or just nervous?  


I don't know your relationship or lifestyle, so take everything I am about to say with a grain of salt.  


College can be chaotic. Often people will study abroad, or take summer classes, or spend 30 hours a week just studying.   


Your girlfriend may start to resent you spending so much time away from her. Or vice versa. On the other hand, your girlfriend may be an invaluable support system in your studies, and you hers.  


Either way, you guys will have to find a balance. How will you make time for each other while in school? What will you do if one of you gets accepted to a program far away? Do you think you can handle long distance?  


What about after college? What she gets a great job opportunity in one location and you in another? What if you get a great job but it requires working a ton of overtime?   


These aren't reasons not to get married. But these are conversations you need to have before you get married.  


And it's not just about answering these questions. If you and your girlfriend can have an honest, realistic conversation about what would happen if life takes you on two different paths, it's a good sign that you can handle marriage."
4475,"Speaking as a 19 year old girl in a long term relationship, we all have baby fever. 19 is too young for that, especially in college. Wait until after you graduate."
4476,"I have a friend in the same predicament except idk how long he’s been dating his GF. I told him that it’s too risky to start a family now and he agreed, but doesn’t think she’ll take his opinion well. He said she also wants him to work out more, and he said if he can’t even get into shape how is he gonna take care of a baby?

I’d say ur in an almost identical situation and so I’ll tell u the same thing. It can all work out fine if both of u are completely, 100% in love and ready, but since u aren’t I would wait until you have a house after college. Or at least wait until u both have jobs that can keep u financially stable enough to rent an apartment without worry. 

The burden of a baby is huge and something most people are not ready for even as seasoned adults, so just let her now how u feel and give her some idea of when YOU think would be an ideal time to get married. That way it doesn’t sound like u don’t want it, but u just want to wait."
4477,"Not sure why I hadn't even considered an engagement as a form of compromise/promise that it's coming. I suppose being engaged for 3 years isn't terribly strange. 

Thanks! Good input"
4478,"Oof, that story sounds kinda terrible. Good to think about, though!

I wrote this late at night and really wasn't thinking, but the whole baby part honestly hasn't even been considered as an option to me. It's something else she wants, but getting married is really the only thing I was wondering about. 

Thanks though! It's still nice having all these responses"
4479,"I was/am in grad school when I got married and my wife was still an undergrad. I already had a good job and place so it worked out for us. But she was going through her internship and planning for graduation which was the hardest part (don't forget a bridal shower).

It's very doable as long as the both (that's the key word) of you are ready. As you will find out with lot of things in marriage, it's about communication and compromise when you don't fully see eye to eye on things.

No one is ever ready, but really who is with big life events?"
4480,"I’d wait. College is already a lot, especially if you’re a freshman. Stacking that with jobs, internships, etc. makes the responsibilities you have even bigger and more frustrating. Getting married and having kids this early isn’t good because you still don’t know what you want at this age in terms of that stuff. Imo I’d wait til you graduate college. You (and your gf) may mature and have different attitudes on things by then.

In the mean time, rooming with your gf in an apartment/house is a good idea. You’ll get used to her living habits and it can be a good first step before you guys get married."
4481,"Dude, dont do it man. Its too soon, you are only 19, so much more a head of you, also weddings are expensive af and Kids even more so.

If you have any dreams or stuff you want to do, do it before having Kids. Traveling is easier if its only 2 adults, creating businesses is easier if you dont have a Child to take care of.

If you have any dream at all, do them or try to before having Kids."
4482,"Personally I think it's a terrible idea. I already am not too into the idea of marriage but doing it so young can lead to disaster. You're both still just learning so much about the world and who you are. By the time you guys are in your mid twenties you can change completely as a person. Also unless you do it the most cheap way possible, getting married is expensive and can tank anyone's bank account if they aren't careful and excessively buy things to make that day ""special."" Also if you're already having doubts then it won't end well."
4483,"If she doesn’t get over this and see your side of things, it really isn’t the right move for you. It will set the precedent that she will have whims and you will just have to go along with them. Is she not thinking about what you want to do in life? You’re still in school. Something like getting married and having a baby is a huge life changing event that will derail almost every endeavor you have now for a considerable period of time."
4484,"I am against the idea of marriage in the sense I don't believe the government should have the right to preside over your love life.

As for children, the longer you wait to have a child the better that child will become. I would say definitely no to the baby, you aren't even old enough to drink yet."
4485,Not in college my man you better not be raising no kid with student loan money lok
4486,I think it’s very reasonable to wait until you have a stable live. I would never marry before I finished college.
4487,"Just my worthless opinion: my parents as well as my oldest sister and her husband met and got married in college. My parents turned out fine and my oldest sister seems like they’re going to be fine too. On the other hand my uncle is about 30, but he’s still single and he’s also doing great on his own. So do it when you feel ready and you know this is what you want. It sounds like you don’t feel ready though so it’s perfectly ok to wait."
4488,"Let me tell you about a girl I know. She wanted to get out of her parent’s house so badly bc they were super controlling. 

Her freshman year, she met a dude who asked her out the first Friday after classes began. They got engaged later in the month. Her fiancé was a senior so they were waiting for him to graduate to get married. Fast forward to spring, he’s graduated, and she’s getting married. 

We (my bf and I) go to the mid-may wedding and school starts up again in August. She’s now living in married housing with her husband (so she got away from her family, hurray) but she’s also pregnant and had terrible morning sickness on her way to class. She did not enjoy barfing outside of her class building and scaring some sorority girls away. 

We still don’t know why they didn’t wait until she graduated to have a baby bc she still has a few more years until she graduates, if she even does graduate. 

Do with that story as you will. 

Honestly I think whatever about marrying in college. I think it’d be better to wait until graduation cos then you’ll both be more mature but if you want to have an extra long engagement, whatever. I do not recommend having a baby in college, idc how bad that baby fever is."
4489,"Yea dude... don’t, like seriously don’t.

What’s the rush? Finish growing up first, finish college, travel a bit, figure out yourself."
4490,"I think it really depends on the person, but I don't think getting married in college is a bad idea. It's only a bad idea if both people aren't ready yet or have different expectations and lifestyles. I've been thinking a lot about marriage lately, and I wouldn't mind getting married before graduation and it is likely to happen."

4509,Yes
4510,Not at all why would we want to be mismanaged like the rest of Britain’s colonies? At least we don’t have your dental system. Your entire rainy ass binge drinking country looked like you got kicked in the mouth 😂 You may have health care but that’s about it

4515,"Nah man I’m not insecure but I think it’s shitty of you to come make played out jokes when someone is clearly posting about a bad time... it’s not helpful and it’s in poor taste. Also hella weird look to make a joke and when someone else makes one turn right around and call them insecure... that’s pretty thin skinned. 

But to keep the jokes going: y’all do really suck at being a country, so glass houses and all that. We got single states that contribute more to the global economy than your entire country if we wanna keep it real. With the exception of London. Y’all are basically Oregon just a lot of rain and ignorant white people. You’ve got an international reputation as racist alcoholic drug users too. between Meghan markle, the Thames testing positive for cocaine, the pailamentary bar fiasco from this week... wouldn’t want to be from that side of the pond ever govna"
4516,"For a troll you project a lot. Calling people insecure for doing the exact same thing you do. Going out of your way to point out how you “couldn’t care less” yet you still reply with your goofy caring ass. Walk away if you don’t care. I think it’s awfully shitty of you to make jokes of any kind when someone comes here struggling, find a better hobby."

4521,"I agree with this, since supposedly you're in the UK, I would definitely suggest going to a GP about it, especially the reopening cuts on your legs. I'm no doctor but that sounds like it puts you at a high risk of infection."
4522,"That's a pretty rough situation and definitely way more than I've ever been through so my advice is not experience based. But nonetheless, high school can be a brutal time. If you're 15 I'm guessing you're in grade 10 or 11. Personally, the later 2 years of high school went by pretty quick and then I was out so hopefully that will happen for you too. Things always get better after high school if you're not one of those people who peaked during that time. As for the family issues, you might just have to stick it out until you turn 18. You don't get to pick your family unfortunately but I'd say any parents that make fun of their kid on a consistent basis is some kind of fucked up considering they had a direct hand in your development. Maybe you can talk them into kicking your sister out seeing as she is doing well enough on her own. I find when my parents are getting on my nerves about ideals and politics you just pretend you agree with them. I find it's impossible to change the mind of people like your parents so there's just no point. If you have some friends I'd recommend asking to move in with them after high school, that might make the transition out of your home easier and it having a roommate you trust makes the financial burden smaller. Unfortunately, the rest you might just have to bare until you can leave. People can be real shitty especially during your teen years, but if you make it through I promise life will have a different kind of flavour. Maybe you could talk to a school counselor to help you out with your PE situation. I'm not sure what your credit system is but I'd imagine you wouldn't need to take PE anymore after this year so that's a bonus. I actually had similar problems there when I was in high school and I know how bad it feels to be constantly worried about how you look. I had to wear a back brace for scoliosis and it is very difficult to hide that shit. But now that I'm 20 and I've spent some time away from high school I've grown into my body a bit more and made some health changes and feel a lot better. I believe the same can happen for you too."
4523,"Don't be sorry for the rant, OP. People need to get stuff out into the air sometimes

It seems clear from the post that you're in real need of some help and it could benefit you to accept that. It doesn't mean you've failed, it means you've been smacked in the face by life. It happens, it sucks, and it doesn't mean you're weak. 

As for the college/school woes, I'd encourage you to ask yourself what it is you want to do. Are there any jobs you could get prior to college that you're interested in? Even internships? There's no need to rush college, I have 7 siblings and not one of them graduated college before they were 27. I know the feeling of ""Oh fuck everything is moving so fast and now I need to wrap this up so I can go get stressed out in the next stage of my life here we go oh shit"", but what if you didn't do that? Your choice, I just think it could help you to consider it. 

Good luck. I know it's a cliche, but this time will pass. If you can persevere through this, you can persevere through anything."
4524,"As much as its a very kind thing to listen to your family's problems, you need to tell them that you cannot handle it and that it is not your burden to carry.

Your sister should be contributing if your parents are struggling for money.


It feels like you are bottling everything up with the expectation that you have to deal with it on your own which is unhealthy and wrong. You don't. Its ok to not cope with this as it is too much for a 15 year old. The adults in your life are letting you down. Give yourself a break.

You need to find someone to help support you."
4525,"That does suck, dude. First off, if you need to talk/vent some more, feel free to dm me.
Second, one thing that I've learned in life is that people aren't always going to ask you how you're doing or if you need to talk. They'll lay all their burdens on you and never even think if you need to do the same. I've caught myself doing that before. So when someone starts talking to you about one of their problems, don't give them the chance to just walk away, assume that they're planning on listening to you and just start right into it.
Also, it's okay to tell your family, ""hey, you didn't want to listen to my struggles/didn't treat me with respect, so I'm not going to listen to your problem this time."" And then walk away. Because honestly, you need to be taking care of yourself first.
Also, I would try to find someone there that you can talk to about some of these things. Don't feel stressed out and feel like you have to talk to them about everything, but even talking about some of these things could really help. Like maybe the school counselor, a teacher, a friend, an acquaintance even, a cousin, just someone.
But don't just do nothing until you can leave the situation. You need to find a way to deal and cope with it. Remember, don't stress about things you can't change, because that doesn't help solve the problems, and change things that you can, but above all, take care of yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically, because no one else is doing that for you.
Again, dm me if you need to talk more."
4526,"Hey bro, absolutely shitty situation you're in.
The best thing I advise you to do is to speak to someone outside of your immediatefamily who might be able to help. Anyone at all, aunt uncle teacher, even show up to the police station if you need to and say all this to them and they can at least point you in a direction.
15 is too young for this shit, take you teenage years back if you can. Focus on the future and reach out man."
4527,"Hey man, I can understand a bit what you’re going through. Being the person to calm down arguments, paying rent doing, and having the pressure and responsibilities and I’ll be honest I’ve had many nights just looking at the ceiling with so much on my mind and the stress

The only advice I can give you is that you sometimes have to be selfish, if you’re about to be evicted or there’s no power maybe it would put pressure on your parents to get your sister to help pay bills. It’s not your job to pay the bills you’re a kid, if you really want to help your family put half of your money in and say your sister needs to put the other half for bills"

4557,anyone has any tips on how to fight flatulence after sparkling water?
4558,Yeah - there are conflicting views about hydration. 90% of the time you get sparkling water and then you have to pay for it on top of it when you are a restaurant.  They have excellent tap water but it's all bout the sparkling bottled water.

4567,Its cool bro I'm the same and I'm almost 20.
4568,I never understood the desperation for a relationship when it comes to males. I'm a female (20) and I don't see myself in a relationship until I'm like 26
4569,"The best way to meet people is to be open and be yourself. It also helps to just be around a lot of people. Most people aren't the type to approach someone by themselves, so try joining a club of some kind. I started going to college this past fall, and despite covid, and despite it being a pretty small college, I have never made so many friends in my life!

It's weird with the virginity thing I tell you. All of high school I felt that losing my virginity was the goal of my relationships, but I never really had a relationship last too long. That was until I met this girl we'll call S. I met S in November of my Senior year, and instantly I was head over heels for her. We dated for longer than I had ever dated anybody, but the crazy thing was I wasn't even concerned about sex at all. S wanted it but I was nervous but then we did it and it was okay, but mostly I liked her as a person.

I was in a lot of activities in high school, and I met S at some random debate meet that I almost didn't go to. Moral of the story: More clubs means you meet more people, more people means more friends, and sex really doesn't matter that much if you have the right friends.


On getting a relationship in the first place: love yourself. Most everyone can sense when someone is confident and comfortable with themselves. Don't be afraid to approach people you like, and don't be afraid to ask someone on a date even if you aren't friends already. Don't pin your self-worth on the experiences of other people, and best of luck, King"
4570,"That's perfectly ok that you have't done that stuff at 19. It's not a race. I was fortunate enough to find a nice partner at 19 but if that didn't happen it wouldn't have mattered. I had a few opportunities to do that stuff when I was much younger but I decided it was wrong considering the circumstances and I waited which was a decision I was very happy I made. I'm not saying you should wait for your absolute soulmate to come by, but wait until you find someone you like and trust. I promise you the only thing that changes after any of that stuff is you just stop thinking about it so much. It's nice but not mindblowing enough to lose sleep over, even though I certainly did lose tons of sleep over it."
4571,"Same, 20 next week and no girlfriend and never kissed a girl"
4572,"22 and same, so if you don't want to end up like me you've still got three years to put yourself out there more. Dating apps are probably the best option during the pandemic aside from work / school, as much as I dislike them."
4573,I had my first kiss when I was 21. I married that person years later.
4574,Underrated comment.
4575,"I understand the desperation because that is what the media emphasizes and glorifies, romantic love..
I'm (20F) and don't see myself in a relationship anytime soon because I want a long term relationship and don't feel like most people my age want the same thing.

But regarding your post, OP, work on yourself (not just physically) and work towards feeling complete by yourself and having a significant other will seem like a bonus and not something that you can't live without."
4576,"I wouldn't recommend Tinder because it seems to be more of an app for people who aren't looking to last long. I've had good experiences with Bumble and OKCupid, though.

OKC takes a long time to set up with all the questions, but there's sooo many users on it, which is a good thing. Bumble is pretty similar to Tinder, but as a man I prefer it because the woman is required to text first. This automatically fixes a big problem I personally have with Tinder, which is not getting a reply."
4577,20 and same
4578,"Hey dude. I'm 20. I used to feel this exact same way about it. My friends used to make fun of me for being a virgin. I know they didn't mean it and were just messing with me, but I did always have the feeling that my life would end up that way forever, and I spent an unhealthy amount of time feeling bad about it.

Then I kissed someone at 19, one of my closest friends. It was nice, I enjoyed it. We dated for a bit, did ""things"" together, was really enjoyable. But afterwards, nothing really changed. People still made fun of me. I loved the time I had with her, but I didn't feel more fulfilled, or like anything about me was different after all that. I had a little more life experience, and that was about it.

My point is, you're not more of a person for having romantic experiences, and you're not less of a person for having a lack of them. Your self worth is measured by your character, how you treat others, and how you treat yourself.

Focus on the journey, not the destination."
4579,Yep forgot to change it
4580,"Almost 20 here and I've never kissed a girl. Just be cool about it. Enjoy your life, do things you like, don't let everything revolve around wanting to having sex. I know it can be hard at times but I'm pretty sure you'll be able to do it."
4581,how old are you now?
4582,The society = reddit?
4583,The only thing men are valued for is losing their virginity? What planet so you live on?
4584,Wow dude. You need to lay off those anti-women groups.
4585,"I think it has its advantages for both guys and girls. In my experience the people on bumble are a bit more serious in looking for a relationship, while tinder is often used for hookups."
4586,"I get how that feels, I don’t actually want to lose my virginity cuz asexual but I totally want a girlfriend. It’s even harder being gay because like most people aren’t into members of the same sex, and then you’ve got to figure who even is gay and then you gotta see if you even have feelings for them. I’ve only met like two other girls my age who I could date but I have no interest in them. Sucks to be gay and sucks to be single, but eventually it’ll happen. I just hold onto hope that it’ll happen when it’s meant to and I shouldn’t rush it."
4587,do I make a tinder? I've considered it.
4588,"Same, almost, but I was 22. We got married at 25. I just hadn't met the right person before that, and I didn't want to throw my first kiss away on just anyone. I didn't always like being the only person I knew who never kissed anyone, but I eventually became totally fine with it."
4589,"Idk why, but I think that everyone on Reddit is male, lol. So when you said you lost your virginity to a dude I got confused."
4590,"I haven't used Tinder personally, only a few others like Bumble. But it's definitely good to try several different ones. In general you'll want to have a few good photos of yourself and a short bio that can attract their interest without being too wordy. There are sites which can offer a lot more specific advice on creating a good profile."
4591,"24, I was married after I turned 23."
4592,We have an incel ladies and gentlemen
4593,"Not sure where you would have heard that but most are judged for way more things, which changes depending on who (a specific person, independent of any group or affiliation here) is judging them. There exists some media which can give the idea that this is not the case but you have to keep in mind that in social situations where one is able to get to know the other, views of a person are rarely as one-dimensional (in my personal experience)."
4594,"That’s the thing, it’s not an exception. You may have had a set of experiences in your life that shaped the view that you’re talking about, and I’m sorry to hear about that because it sounds like you haven’t met too many genuine or caring people. It’s fair for you to assume what you have if that’s the case because that’s what the data you’ve gathered has shown you. Just keep in mind that in our lives we only experience a fraction of what the reality is, and this applies to my view as well. As such it is important that we approach new situations with an open yet critical mind because the result of that can be completely different to what we’ve come to expect.

If you haven’t met too many (or any at all) genuine and/or caring people in your life, I hope you do in the future. P.s. remember that people can react to our apparent selves rather than what we truly mean as nuance can be misinterpreted or lost, so it’s important to analyze our behaviour in general and in its connection to the outcome in a way that’s honest with ourselves; that’s a big way that we can grow. Wish you the best."
4595,"That user probably called you an incel because you were making an argument that aligns with the definition that society gave it. That doesn’t make it ok just like any other insult or slur, but unfortunately not everyone gets along in this world. Many people may also choose to shut others out and say demeaning shit rather than try to have a conversation and this is pretty much everywhere in society, but that’s just something that likely to come with the package today.

The image of society you’re describing sounds close to some of what reaches the surface most of the time on social media. Since there’s so much out there, it’s unrealistic for people to be informed of everything from every angle. Because of this, it’s quite easy to end up with only part of the puzzle.

With that, I encourage you to analyze what you’ve stated: how men are viewed, degradation of ethics, et cetera. Don’t be surprised if you don’t end up with a crystal clear answer, as many of these questions have a lot of hidden factors like how men are viewed; for example, which individual is answering this question (and and some may find it difficult to have an all encompassing view at all). You may find out quite a lot, and may end up with more questions! 

Also we might both get a warning because I don’t think this discussion fits the nature of this sub, so we may want to take this elsewhere such as in dm’s or another more appropriate place for discussing these topics."
4596,"As long as you’re taking good care of it and not using it to your advantage, then to me it’s beautiful"

4607,"I am already working a 9-5 job and I feel the exact same way.  I started working in November and was feeling extremely depressed about going into an office to sit in a single chair under the same fluorescent lights every day for eight hours.  Saying it like that it literally sounds inhumane.

There is something deeply dehumanizing about the way we carry out work, and I think most people are profoundly affected by it even if on a conscious level they are able to accept it.  How many kids watch their dads come home from work and veg out on the TV for hours without a word, just because their jobs are so utterly draining?

Anyway, I've been having a much easier time dealing with it since I've been working from home.  Overall, I think I've even been *more* productive.  Yes, I slack off now and then, but in the office there are days where the whole experience of being there is so unbearable that I can't get a single real thing done.

I've been thinking about buying an RV and just going, and working on the road.  To me, that's the life.  Maybe you can find a way to integrate your work into your desire to travel?"
4608,It's easier to accept when you know the alternative is homelessness imo
4609,"Hey, I just wanted to let you know how much your comment resonated with me.  I'm in CS too, and I always tell people I like CS the same way some people like crossword puzzles.  It's satisfying to solve a problem, but how many people would want to sit and solve crossword puzzles for eight hours a day?  How do you make that into something that feels fulfilling?

I like programming on my own, but as a ""job"" that my life is centered around it just feels so empty and passionless.  It's cool to see someone who has felt the same way and done something about it.  Cheers!"
4610,its easier to accept the idea of eating shit instead of razor blades but im still gonna hate both
4611,"9-5 sounds chill as hell honestly. I’m worried about working 60+ just bc I’m chasing that paycheck

If I could make the money I want in a 9-5 I’d be perfectly happy. It’s basically like going to school. You did that shit your entire life basically

Plus you don’t have to do it for 40 years. Go look at r/leanfire if you wanna get out early. Or save up for a few years and then do an epic yearlong trip every 3 years or something"
4612,"I’ve accepted it because the field I want to work in means a lot to me. That’s pretty much all it is for me - although I’d love to spend the time traveling, I’d also love to do some good with my career."
4613,"25 here, been working since I'm 15 because, sadly, I wasn't born rich. I've had plenty of jobs, some of them were from 10-14 hours a day. Working 9-5 has been WONDERFUL. I wish more people could feel the same tranquility in that as me.

Traveling the world and enjoying new experiences sounds cool, awesome and totally possible; but unless you come from a wealthy background you'll have to provide for yourself and, well, that is life.

I hope you find a way to get there."
4614,Check joe rogans interview with naval ravikant. Nothing is definite in life. ravikant really puts into perspective how and why people work.
4615,you guys are getting paid lunch breaks?
4616,"I’ve been having this same exact dilemma. It’s so mentally exhausting for me and I feel like it just gets me stuck in a loop of going to work, coming home and being too tired to do anything, going to bed, and repeating. I don’t think that I can do that for the rest of my life. 

I think it’s a combination of my short attention span and difficulty with commitment for long term stuff that makes it so hard. So hopefully I’ll grow and mature out of it eventually.

The last few weeks my mind has been racing with ideas trying to find some way to make a comfortable living that doesn’t require 40+ hours a week. 

Fingers crossed we all get this figured out, whether it’s through trial and error, maturity, or some great invention. Chin up!

Edit: so to some"
4617,Lol I feel the exact same way. Just finished up my 3rd year of CS. At the end of first year I came to this same realization and got super depressed. Still in CS but thinking of starting my own business (CS related or not) since it might actually be more full-filling than just working 9-5 for the rest of my life.
4618,"I haven't come to terms with that idea either, it seems like endured servitude. Right now I work full time with a constantly changing retail schedule, but I've found some hobbies to look forward to on my days off and I have some vacation time to use before the end of the year. I know. It's a bleak outlook. I've seen how miserable my parents are. But honestly it kinda seems like things are changing right now, and hopefully we can build momentum to get so much more shifted in our favor. And even if that's not the case, remember to enjoy the small moments and the nuggets of joy, whenever they happen."
4619,"I am blessed, in that I have a job where I only have to work 6-8 months a year and still make 6 figures, but I feel this too. I get a fair amount of travel due to the nature of my work, but my friends are always on some exotic trip on instagram, it is a pretty cool opportunity I have. I work anywhere from 35 days on 35 days off, all the way to 180 180 off, (other options include 60/60, 75/75, 120/120) its pretty great. 

But let me tell you, I dont want to do this forever either. In exchange for the pay and rotation, I risk all sorts of health issues including cancer and death. This is a young man's game for sure. 

So instead of hiking though Columbia or ""sowing my wild oats"" through eastern Europe, I am staying home, Saving Aggressively. I'm working to buy forms of passive income so I can take it east, or ""retire"" at 35, AKA take a lower paying, less stressful job where I get to go home at night and have a family. Pre pandemic I was on pace to buy my first multi family property by my 25th Birthday, but that may be pushed back a couple months. 

I'd advise checking out the book rich dad poor dad if you havent already, and then the book on real estate investing. 

There are places like r/FIRE and r/realestateinvesting but they are a little much for me."
4620,"You don't have to necessarily work a 9 to 5. There's jobs out there that have you work 10 or 12 hours a day in exchange for working less days a week. I personally have a 4 10s job and I DEFINITELY appreciate the 3rd day off every week. I won't be willingly going back to a 9-5 unless something big happens lol

I say it also depends on what you're doing. My first year working, I was in retail and I felt it more there. Once I got a job in my current field, it didn't really bother me ( granted I was working 7AM to 3:30PM )"
4621,"This is the thing that keeps me up at night. I spend almost every ounce if thought trying to figure out away to turn my hobbies and passions into a sustainable career. I suppose, worst case scenario, moving to Europe would be a good move if you can't avoid a 9-5 job. They have great benefits in some parts of Europe, specifically the Scandinavian countries (although it can be pretty depressing up there). At the least they offer better vacation opportunities and time off. Plus, living in Europe could make it feel less like you're stuck somewhere because it'll be a new place. And honestly dude, never forget that you can make a change to your life if it's not going well. At and time. If you feel like you're caught in the rut then do something about it. It will be rough, and quitting a job you've had for a while is never ""smart"", but it's probably best for your happiness to find something real."
4622,"Life isn't a walk in the park, and even though you might be turned off from the idea of working a 9-5, there are definitely other ways to make a living outside of office work. Skilled trades in particular can be rewarding if you're the sort of person that would like working with your hands, plus the starting pay is pretty great. 

Eventually you just have to come to terms with the fact that barring any serious disabilities, you have to contribute to society in order to thrive. It's been like this for thousands of years, and it will continue to be like this unless we enter some sort of post-scarcity space communism we see in star trek and the like.

Edit: before anyone starts reeeing about [insert job] that doesn't contribute anything worthwhile to society because of [insert reason], all that matters is that people think it's worth paying money to do said job. I never said it had to be a positive contribution."
4623,"Yep not 40, 50 for me :/"
4624,Then don’t.
4625,That would be the dream. I’m split between majors right now so idk how it would work out but I would love to find a way to travel while working. Something i’ve wanted to do since I was like 16 is to get a sailboat and sail around the world. I kinda feel like it’ll never happen but it would be a nice way to travel for cheap-ish and I might be able to work as well. The only thing I don’t know about is how to get internet.
4626,"This sounds a lot like what I want to do. Sadly I see no way that I could get that kind of pay that quickly. However I don’t need a ton of money. Maybe it’s because i’m young, but I don’t really care about having a nice retirement. What am I going to do with a ton of cash when i’m 80? I don’t need to live long to have a good life, I just want to be satisfied and have no regrets, and not seeing the rest of the world is something I know I would."
4627,"Look into the Merchant Marine, more specifically SIU. You can go to a trade school and get some mid-level papers to sail, and get paid a decent amount. 

But the idea isnt to have a ton of cash when you're 80, the idea is to be ballin' when you're 80. Live on a cruise ship half the year. Fart around in a mobile home. Go on benders with hookers and coke, the possibilites are endless!"
4628,"Then don’t. Learn a more profitable and less time consuming skill. Start a business. Learn how to invest or day trade in various markets. Sell a skill or service. Flip cars/ shoes and other items. Start a YouTube channel. Invest in real estate. Dropship. Just use your brain and get creative. Switch it up if you get bored. You could easily knock out 300k+ a year with a whole bunch of different methods and working far less than your traditional 9-5, and you’d be doing a bunch of different things you more or less enjoy so it wouldn’t get boring

The problem with our current society is most people put themselves in a box when it’s so incredibly easy to make money in today’s world. You could easily generate enough money to visit different countries a couple times a year even and still live a very comfortable life without that much effort"

4688,"Warren is less progressive than Sanders. Like that's a fact. Bernie was campaigning for the rights of black people, gay people and women before it was even considered a duh position.

I never said any demographic is part of the establishment. The establishment is the DNC and the media. Both have a vested interest in keeping the status quo going.

The amount of negative media coverage, or lack of positive media coverage for him is outstanding compared to any of the other candidates. His campaign is not shitty and I can guarantee that if the elections were fair and media coverage was completely neutral, he would absolutely wipe the floor with everyone. He just polls well on all of the issues that people care about and the media has to come out and bend the narrative and attack his personality or use russia to try and smear him and even then he *still* is getting a considerable amount of votes.

Don't you find it weird that Buttigeg and Klobuchar dropped out and immediately endorsed Biden who had been nowhere before SC, and then Mike Bloomberg also stopped his campaign. Its because the Democratic establishment are going out of their way to boost a single establishment candidate who happens to be a sellout with dementia.

Are you honestly telling me that a man with dementia is better than someone who has been cleared as extremely physically healthy and has stood for principled and progressive issues for over 50 years because I really cannot see a reason to."
4689,"PA is Tuesday April 28th!  Most fire departments and some government buildings are polling places.  Check your registration, if you're not registered do it!

4693,The primary was today in US I think. That’s why people are talking about going out to vote.
4694,"Sanders stands up for what Warren says she stands for. Biden is an establishment hack who ""prostituted myself (him) to the big money donors"". Whether Warren is going to cozy up to the establishment or stand up for her progressive principles remains to be seen. Regardless, if you are a progressive, please vote for Bernie."
4695,Early voting starts today for me here in Florida. But with Warren all but done. Her being my favorite by far. I probably won't vote till she makes a endorsement. Not happy with Biden or Sanders
4696,"Well I literally can’t lol, I’m a registered independent"
4697,I am a progressive. Hence why I like Warren more than Sanders. If my most important issue was getting post offices renamed. Sanders would be my choice no question. You can't call black voters and people who vote against Sanders the establishment. Stuff like this is why he lost support from 2016. And why states he dominated in. In 2016. He's losing this year. Another good reason to not wanna vote Sanders is because of just how shitty of a campaign he ran in 2016 and how it's even worst it is in 2020. For how evil these establishment candidates are. Sanders does seem to get his ass kicked by them a lot. This reads like something a Russian bot would say and doesn't help your candidate's case
4698,"Do you not understand what strategy is???? Pete and Amy bombed in South Carolina. Super Tuesday days away. What do they do? Endorse the person they share more values with.

4717,"My entire college experience has been really crazy, and I was hoping this semester would be the exception. 

My first semester, I was involved in a hit and run as the pedestrian. Then I had to have surgery to help my deviated septum because I found out I hadn't been breathing right since the age of eleven my second semester. Third semester, I transferred to a university. Within the first three months there, I got evacuated from of my apartment in the middle of the night because the infrastructure was unsound, then a series of explosions from the food truck park next to the building once we got let back in. I got lightly hazed by a greek org that I don't really talk about since it wasn't that serious. I had a major depressive episode, and right before finals? Kidney stones, multiple hospital visits, and a huge bill because my dumbass called an ambulance because I thought my appendix burst.

 I was hoping this semester would chill out some, as I was finally getting ready to go into the field for my major. Then a fucking plague. At least I have some amazing stories for my students when I start teaching!"

I agree with this. 

While it's great that the money was deposited, this most likely was done in error. It's very possible the bank will request that you pay it back. In the future don't spend that money and call your bank, because they will often catch it and reverse it- bad if the money isn't there when they do.

4835,seriously though why did you need to get so amped up? I get headaches when I just drink normal coffee
4836,I don't have the money for that nor the desire to have an addiction for when SHTF

4839,How dare you
4840,GANG GANG
4841,good shit hopefully you got all that done and then some
4842,I had things to do so I did what I knew would help me do them
4843,"I did lmao, and then I crashed like a mf and slept real damn well for nine hours."
4844,Okay boomer
4845,South
4846,Up
4847,"no, up"
4848,"no, up"
4849,west
4850,"I always feel proud when I end up taking a bunch of turns and go out far then am able to navigate myself back without Google maps 

Call me your captain now"
4851,Is that the same as uʍop
4852,"I used to do this in high school with friends, and just have deep conversations. Miss that shit. 

Currently sitting in my front yard in a lawn chair listening to Brand New while my boyfriend walks our dog. Oh how the times have changed but stay the same"
4853,so east?
4854,Love this
4855,Bro I wanna go driving sometime hmu
4856,Go west
4857,that's pretty neat. I wish the police kept old cars around
4858,Up what?
4859,Good on you! I was proud of myself too when I figured it out!
4860,but east = up
4861,"Same feeling, i just don’t want to take responsibilities yet,"
4862,"I've begun looking for my first apartment for the fall to have a place to live for my last year of my Bachelors degree, and I'm fucking terrified"
4863,"Same. I think every college age person has that at some point. My teen years weren’t that great except for senior year, but I still get somewhat sad knowing they’re over for good. Although now my feelings of excitement to get on with life are stronger than those missing the past."
4864,"I like being in this stage of life but while I remember the good times and things that were easier, it’s hard for me to reconcile with my past mistakes and immaturity. So no, I wouldn’t want to go back unless I could change my words/actions, repeat with a greater emotional maturity and empathy. I wish I spoke up more in high school as well, been myself."
4865,"Also can you feel the shift between 18 to 19 where you're suddenly no longer treated as a lost cause adolescent but now you are full of potential apparently and you should figure out what you're going to do. 
We have the lockdown underway as well which adds pressure to the situation and changes are happening so fast to our social spheres. Yeah somebody tell me what I am to do with my life? It's all so complex."
4866,"Nah, I love being in my 20s :)"
4867,"I could relate to this in the past. Moving out of province for school really made me yearn for those teenage years for some time. 

Moving away from parents is a huge step! Ultimately it might have been one of the most crucial things I've done towards growing up in my life."
4868,"I hear music that I discovered in my teen years and I'm like ""good times"" even though it was not a good time. I guess it is because back then there was less pressure on milestones, expectations, that stuff you mentioned."
4869,"I've grown up more and moved out of my own place, a year through uni and some training with the military.  I still wish I could be 17 again sometimes.  It sucked absolute ass, and I didn't like who I was then, but there was something nostalgic about that time.  It's an important growing phase for most of us, and even if it sucked or it was just okay, it was still important to who we are as people."
4870,"Yes, especially since I spent my teen years being socially awkward & stuck around people that I didn't fit in with. I'm scared to grow up because I'm socially anxious & afraid that others will harshly judge me once I finally move out."
4871,"That feeling made up my entire 23rd year of life up to and including right now

It’s not as bad as it was, but I still want to go back and just do those kid things again. Parties in a paddock, dying of alcohol poisoning in someone’s backyard. Hell having time to do things that I want to do instead of working weekends and not even having a social life. Shit was just better when nothing mattered except my school grades"
4872,All the time lol
4873,"I loved my teen years. I miss my Mom, school, not working a shitty fast food job, not paying rent"
4874,I think about how much I missed out on my teen years and my parents don’t seem to get it. Partying and having a driver’s license are pretty important things to me and it sucks I couldn’t get to do those things before the pandemic happened.
4875,"I think about my youth a lot, yes, and that includes my 20's (I'm an old man, I guess)."
4876,How is it going on the finance side? I’m a university student looking to move out once COVID is over but I’m afraid I’ll spend all my free time working to be able to pay the bills
4877,I can't wait to move out. I feel like a teen since I graduated college and moved back  in with then. I got a way more rested sleep in college. Also their house is too hot. I was home a lot more when I had my own place in college.
4878,Weird flex but ok. This was the year I was supposed to move out for college but COVID had to ruin everything.
4879,I kinda fear the day I move out because I like living with my parents because I love them so much. Is it just me who doesn’t mind waiting a bit?
4880,"I'm happy for you!

I moved out almost two months ago and I completely agree with you!

By the way, how does one date when there's corona outside? :("
4881,"Congrats! I moved out nearly six years ago, it wasn’t always the easiest, especially to afford my own flat at 18/19, but it was so much worth it!"
4882,It's been 1 year since i moved out as well! I love my parents and we have a great relationship but its great to live at your own free will and getting to do what you want when you want. Yeah its more stress but i love it
4883,I'm moving out on December and plan to commit my entire life in being financially independent and on my own.
4884,Don't worry. COVID ruined a lot for all of us.
4885,So far online I've been talking to some people. I don't know either!

Things change quick, for better or worse."
4890,"Basically just stop. Easier said than done - but the sooner you realise nothing matters, the better. You have loads of time to do things. There’s no rush, and it’s better to do something in your own time.

So many people rush into doing things to “accomplish” just for the sake of it when there’s no reason to."
4891,Get drunk
4892,"I don't think it'd have done much, tbh. I'm 19 myself and although I have the self-awareness and knowledge that I should just fucking chill, I can't help but feel like a failure. It call it a mid-mid-life crisis."
4893,"You don't have to accomplish anything. Living a normal, simple life is okay too."
4894,"Sigh I really hope we're the generation to stop this. 20 is young, just like 30 is young. Accomplishments are so, so subjective and upholding our parents' generation of success especially in this current world we've inherited will only make us another unhappy, superficial generation of people. Living your life happily and being able to do the things you want is accomplishing something. 

We have to be the ones to change this and the frequency with which this type of statement is made on here is sad (but completely understandable). I sympathize and I deal with this too, and I think it's exacerbated by hearing so many young people (especially people younger than me, like 18!) saying they feel like they're failing at life because they haven't accomplished things sooner."
4895,Best advice right here
4896,"Two things.

1)

When Julius Caesar, at the age of 33, considered the achievements of Alexander the Great, he wept. His sighs and tears did not come as a result of mourning or fear for his own life, but from a sobering recognition: Alexander had conquered the world before the age of 33 and yet he (Caesar) had done nothing remotely similar, nothing that would warrant remembrance by future generations in the same amount of time. What, then, was the worth of his life? Who would remember an average Roman governor of Spain? Who would remember the name of Caesar? 

Maybe this is you, OP.

2)

No matter what you accomplish in life, be it nothing or be it everything, in 100 years from now, you're not going to remember what you did. Cause you'll be dead. Cut forward another 100 years and anyone who could've possibly known you will also be dead. Cut forward 100,000 and you could be the greatest human ever to live and yet you will have been lost to the sands of time. Life is the perspective you give it.

° Epilogue °

If accomplishments are what fulfill you, work towards them, constantly improve yourself, and be patient. If you would feel happy/fulfilled with a simple job that gives you ample time to smoke weed and play video games, work towards that. But no matter what, understand that this moment right now is just as much a part your life as that future you envision. So enjoy yourself when you can.

Have a nice day."

4898,It's just that we hear of all these successful people. And this whole new mindset of life. And we are eager. I guess the idea is finding what a successful life means to you?

4902,"You got your whole life ahead of you man!! No matter what judgement you received from yourself and others through your time at school/ whatever other bs comparison game you’ve been thrown into, it doesn’t matter. You’re STILL amazing and the only thing keeping you from feeling amazing are your own negative thoughts and bad habits. It’s time to stop judging yourself. Everyone else is wrong for judging you, as judgement does nothing to influence your actions in the present. You got this dude."
4903,Don't fret about it a year in itself is a long time to do something. When you have ten of those you'll have time to do things as long as you set your mind to it.

4905,"Take the steam out of the engine a little bit. It will help you! Besides your only 20. A fruits of the labor discussion is ludacris. Take some time off. Go enjoy yourself.
Also, you need to get out of that mode of school. And get into the real world. Get out of your comfort zone
And a challenge: no judging yourself until your 30!"
4906,"You'll feel like this at every age. That's just how life is. Btw 30 isnt the magical age it used to be in the past. With income inequality getting worse each year, 30 year olds no longer have the wealth and stability they did back in the day. I'd move it up to maybe 35 or 38 to be more realistic with today's economic circumstances."
4907,"All the pressure you feel you’ve created in your own head. It’s just an accumulation of everyone else’s ideals and stresses that make you want to over analyze everything. Stop judging yourself!! You’re exactly where you need to be. You got this!! My life completely changed direction when I stopped judging myself and started weeding out the negativity from my head. Those thoughts are just good for nothing, the only thing that matters is enjoying the present. It’ll be hard because you’ve made it such a habit to find something wrong in every facet of life, but you CAN do it!!"

4909,"Every type of success and checkpoint that we create for ourselves is only real because everyone buys into it, but it’s the cause of a lot of self doubt and judgement. Don’t measure yourself on the same scale as everyone else because the truth is even with “success” a lot of people could be much much happier."

4911,"It always baffles my mind when I find out people cant. Like when I fall asleep at night I visualize so much, I’ll create entire stories and watch it play out in my mind. My dreams at night also tend to be very strange, complicated, vivid, long, and I always remember them. Sometimes when I don’t like the end of a book or movie I’ll just makeup a new one in my head and watch it in my mind."

4915,"Absolutely. I’m working on a crochet project right now, and I can visualize how it looks and what it needs to do clear as day. I do wonder how many people can visualize things clearly vs not at all, and about the people in the middle. Like I’d love to see some data on it"
4916,"It's never as solid as a real block, but if I try then I can definitely make up an object and visualise it around me. When I was younger my imagination would get carried away with itself and make up fucking **terrifying** things around me, to the point where I could actually believe they were there in the room with me because I wasn't in control of them. I once thought I saw a skeleton coming up the stairs in my house, and the fnaf monsters were really what made me try to stop it."

When I visualize, think of Bob Ross is his room with black walls. I'm wearing the afro, instead, and I get a prompt. Let's say, a red pool noodle.

I've already ""painted"" an image of the noodle, since I've seen and touched them before. Interestingly, I've also produced an environment for that noodle: a pool in the backyard of a house in an upscale neighborhood.

Essentially, I hallucinate a picture, but without the drugs."
4919,Yes and I found it absurd when I learned that some people couldn't a few months ago. Like... Can you not remember colors if you aren't looking at them??
4920,"i can't ""see"" the objects tho, i'm just aware that i'm thinking about it"
4921,"I've been the same way. When I ""imagine"" a square or something, i don't ""see"" it in my mind, but I can imagine the shape of it."

4938,"Yeah, I can. Easily"
4939,Reading a book is like watching a movie
4940,"I don't see things per se, but when I visualize something in my head, I'm exploring its shape and function and trying to understand it. It helps that I have a pretty good memory for detail, which makes doing so quite a bit easier."

4942,Not only do I not wear underwear in a bathing suit but I’ll cut that horrible fish netting they add to most pairs
4943,It makes more sense to not wear underwear under a bathing suit. You'd either get it wet or waste extra time taking it off and putting back your bathing suit

4948,[deleted]
4949,Most of my swimming shorts come with some kind of (attached) netting that holds everything in place
4950,Board shorts are pretty popular nowadays (which have no mesh netting) and are designed to be worn with compression shorts underneath. Normal swim shorts with the netting are designed to be worn without anything I believe. Would recommend board shorts. Much more comfy and you wont accidentally flash anyone
4951,"When I had my college swim class, we wore rash guards. So that’s like a swim shirt right? 

And yeah I used to be self conscious as hell of my body. Pretty much alright with swimming without a shirt now"
4952,Nah fam
4953,"I wear compression shorts, but I also normally just swim in synthetic shorts so not really normal. Compressions/underwear helps prevent... clinging. So I found it made everyone just a lil more comfortable"

If I'm wearing athletic shorts, then yeah."
4955,"I wear underwear underneath my swimsuit because in my experience it stops chafing from ocean swimming. But either is fine, I used to swim without them. I would say just go with whatever makes you fell better."
4956,Always wear compression shorts
4957,"> 
> Also I’m curious, who here wears a shirt when swimming? Coz most of my friends back in HS did

Lol no way. That would just be rather uncomfortable. 

Even when I was self conscious (I had -and still kind of have- pectus excavatum) I didn't wear a shirt, because wearing it just draws more attention where I'm from than not wearing one. Better to be fat/misshaped/odd and bold than to be fat/misshaped/odd and try to hide it."
4958,I love that username

4963,"Female here, I wear trunks and a long selves shirt (with underwear underneath) mostly because im nowhere confedent enough to wear a one peice or bikini."
4964,I straight up wear my underwear under my trunks. I find it assuring to know I have an extra layer just in case my trunks slip. Also it keeps everything secure and reduces chafing.
4965,I outgrew swimming in general. Rip
4966,"I don't wear anything under my board shorts, I wasn't aware that wearing underwear beneath togs was a thing. In New Zealand there are signs everywhere that say no underwear in the pool."
4967,"As I girl this always confuses me when guys to this. Read some comments that said It's because different swimmingtrunks etc. But for the love of everyone if you do this. At least make sure the underwears you bath with are a clean pair. Like when I went swimming in school for P.A and the boys did this, my bet is they just used the underwear they'd been using all day and didn't change until after those got wet. I guess It's fine to wear them under your swimmingtrunks but please just use a fresh pair."
4968,I don’t wear underwear under it... but I think I’ve accidentally flashed a lot of people with pp
4969,weirdos. that's who.
4970,"I think people wear them for comfort if they're spending time on land. 

A swim short is often not terribly comfortable. So when you go to the beach for example you wear underwear+swimming shorts. You can then just chill comfortably on the beach, go for a dip, let the sun dry you up on land, and be comfortable again.

It takes a lot longer to get dry with underwear on but it might be more comfortable overall.

Or at least that's why I think people do it."

4984,"Wow I’ve never thought about it like that, I’d say in terms of friendships I do have experience and I’d like to think I’m a good and caring friend, I guess the insecurity is just me being scared I won’t live up to my bfs exes because I don’t know how to date and I’m so clueless"
4985,"Same here, my friends have dated before and some are in relationships now, I feel like everyone’s had their first kiss by this age at least but nope not me, I’ve never had a guy ask me out and I’m so inexperienced I’m insecure of being a virgin because I’m clueless"
4986,"I’m a guy, but 20 was my year of “firsts” when it came to relationship stuff. First real relationship, first kiss, first cuddle, first time sleeping with someone, etc.. It isn’t weird at all to be inexperienced; in fact, a lot of people romanticize the hell out of it."
4987,"Thank you for being so nice! I’m just stupidly insecure about this because I feel like everyone around me has been in a relationship and I’m falling behind, i cant even watch a romcom without thinking of how nice it’d be to be in love at least once in my life but I cant wait for that day!!"

4990,"22 year old dude here, I'm in the same 'boat' as you. I feel like knowing that ""I'm not the only one"" has helped me a lot. Currently I'm in the mindset of: it happens when it happens no need to rush anything. 

On another note, I feel like you SHOULD absolutely tell whoever you might experience one of these firsts with that it was your first. You never know if they are in the same boat as you.

It also reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/keavrj/update_i_had_a_date_with_the_sweetest_man_and_he/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) post over on TwoXChromosomes, as to why you would want to share it."
4991,"Thank you, right back at you! :D

I just looked at your profile and it seems like that no boyfriend thing is really taking up a lot of your thoughts, huh?

I hope you get a lot of encouraging answers. Feel free to text me if you think that might help you. :]"
4992,"Pathetic? Abso-fucking-lutely **NOT.**  


Who in society said that people had to have any of that list done by our age? Sure as hell hope no one has, cause I'm not better, but this isn't about me. What I can say about my experiences might be worth something however.  


You have no obligation to be in a relationship with anyone. There should be no pressure other than your desire saying for you to get into one. You do so when you want to.   


A guy who says he has a problem with you not having experience is, at least to me, a huge red flag. A relationship should be committed only between the people involved, and comparison to previous partners both ways seems incredibly toxic.   


There is no handbook on how to date, or what to do. You follow your heart and mind. Hell, that's what I'm going to do anyways. Perhaps it will work out, perhaps not; that's what experiencing something for the first time is all about, is it not?   


Your life is yours to follow. Other travellers will come and pass, but your journey is your own path. Where light bends, you will find another who walks the same path. Time will come and pass, but light forever follows a forward path until the void takes it. It is from chaos that it's course shifts, and thus your fate writes itself in the stars anew."
4993,"It’s a dumb little insecurity I have and I cant wait for my firsts with someone, I feel like i would be such an awkward first though because I’ve never  cuddled or kissed, it’s probably just my insecurities but I’ll get over them with time"
4994,"Lots of people have those insecurities. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous and awkward the first time, but if it’s with someone special, they’ll be understanding, and it will also be a very exciting and memorable experience."
4995,"It's not stupid! I would lie if I said I don't feel like this sometimes. 

Hell you don't know what's going on in my head, I overthink almost everything. :'D

But you know what, from my experience most people have felt that way. Everyone is insecure about something or another and romace and sexuality are probably very high on that list. Just because it's happening a little later to us than to most of our friends doesn't mean it was any different for them. 

But that feeling makes it exciting too! I've been on a few dates and eventhough they never resulted in anything romantic all of them were great experiences. I met interesting girls, did fun activities and just the thought of something romantic happening is really exciting. 

I feel old saying ""from my experience"" so often but don't be fooled by that. Even with 21 you are basically still a baby. Don't think you are falling behinde. You will be in your 20s for a long time. :D"
4996,"Thanks, also I'm from Kentucky if that matters, it's been nice talking with you."
4997,"The whole nice guys finish last thing. The fact that a lot of nice guys only be nice to the girls they have a crush on, but when they're rejected they get all pissy, block the girl, and call her names and all that immature shit. That's revolting behavior.

I said texted my crush telling her I had a crush on her and everything and that she didn't really reciprocate to me that she liked me. She kinda shrugged it off. But we are still friends and yea I still talk to her. I've been trying to invite her over to smoke, chill out, listen to music together, something. With her work schedule and her living across town, covid, and a sloppy plan, it just hasn't transpired. 

I'm unemployed, not going to college for maybe a couple years due to covid (I know there's online classes for college, but they suck and I don't feel as engaged in learning as in person), I don't have a car. So I really have no outlet to form any relationships other than mutual friends."
4998,To whoever gave me the silver award: Thank you very much! It's the first award I ever got on Reddit. :]
4999,<3
5000,"So true, guys like that aren’t really nice people, and eventually their gfs figure that out for themselves, I feel like we’re almost in the same boat because especially during these times it’s so hard to even make connections, I haven’t left my house of course, and I just feel lonelier than ever and kinda wish before the pandemic I had experience dating because who knows what life will look like for the next couple months or years."
5001,"That's so sweet thank you. Made me smile. :]

We will both find someone when the time is right and until then work on not freaking out about being single haha"
5002,"You guys are so cute.

When this pandemic is over we are all going to find the right person. I'm very optimistic :]"
5003,"I’m wishing all the good vibes for u and I hope it’s your year too! You seem like a really nice solid guy that any girl would be lucky to have, you’ll find someone!"
5004,No no no this doesn’t make you pathetic at all!
5005,I’m a guy in the same situation. Don’t sweat it too much it’s not a big deal
5006,"Honestly, what really gave me hope was when Jameela Jamil talked about nobody showing interest in her until she was in her 20's. Hearing somebody who was objectively so gorgeous and poised talk about that was deeply reassuring.

5007,I'm almost 21 and have never done any of that so I guess it's not too rare.
5008,"Same, 22 years old and this whole post is my exact thoughts"
5009,"Well we all have to start somewhere, some earlier, some later. It's fact of life that we all work at our own pace. You sound like you just haven't had the opportunity yet as well. My problem really is that I don't know many girls to begin with, I find a girl and what do I do? I go straight to the friend zone because I am too nice."
5010,"Your words mean so much, I know you’ll find the right girl! Thanks for taking time to respond back to me and hear me out :) It means a lot!"
5011,"Hopefully 2021 will have great fortune in store for all, maybe this'll be my year. I've been saying that for the last three years, but maybe this'll be my year."
5012,"I read somewhere that we actually stop being teenagers by 23-25 years old, that's when we start actually doing ""adult"" and responsible choices, but somehow we're expected to be adults at a much younger age. So don't worry too much yet! And good luck!"
5013,"Turning 20 this year and can tell you with confidence we are not adults yet. We can make decisions like going to fight for our country, or take on massive debt for an education but cant for example sign up for training for better jobs until 21 or buy alcohol until 21 and recently tabaco until 21. I say we're in limbo."
5014,I just turned 22 last month. Seems like i got a year to figure it out......shit

Speaking as the only employee below 30 at an office of mostly 40-50 year olds, I completely agree. Some people just never truly grow up... I must say that working here has boosted my confidence though."

5023,Boy o boy do I feel you ive turned 19 last year and just the fact that I'm only a few months close to turning 20 freaks the shit out of me
5024,"A friend of mine is 24 and he says he is always super shocked when he remembers I'm just 18 because I seem a lot ""wiser"" for my age ig lmao I dont feel like that at all tho"

5031,"I think the problem is that you did that for impressing girls, at least it's what I think. I might be wrong. If I am wrong, please correct me so. The reason why I am saying this is because some people just go the gym for having a good body for other people(i.e. if they like someone and they think they can impress them with a good body) but the thing is having a romantical interest on someone is much more than looks. Looks is just a part of it, yes. But what about the character and other personality traits? Wouldn't you look at those criteria if you were a girl? Again, please don't get me wrong."

5034,"It's absolutely not r/teenagers :), you can relax. I am a 23 years old guy and I have some knowledge about these kind of topics at least. Even I didn't have any relationships and so on."
5035,Correct glad were on the same note just thought It'd be a joke but I guess this isn't r/teenagers and the responses are actually serious here
5036,I think you're pretty hot. Unfortunately I'm a married straight guy so probably not your type.
5037,I did for improvement as my recommended me losing some weight as I was slowly creeping towards an unhealthy weight and my family as a history of diabetes I've multiple friends and colleagues tell me I should be getting alot more attention from females and should feel better about myself after seeing my body shape improve.I have seen neither of those come to reality and this post was kind of a dig at that apologies if it came off differently.
5038,"Bro the last thing think abt when you work out is getting checked out , a man work for a healthy body,mind and hopefully a healthy lifestyle ,however if you don't like the process then you might wanna spend your time doing something you'd be happy doing and for the sake of other ppl"
5039,"Then that's great that you did it for improvement. I suggest you looking at these things from an other perspective: There are 7 billions of people who live in this planet and not everyone is in a relationship. Some just go with the flow and others just don't think that relationships are for them. And others that I haven't mentioned are probably out of some relationships and want to take a break from it for a while. And narrow it down to the same age group of you since not everyone is in the same age as you. It might be a small number that you have found compared to whole population of world, but there must be some hope, right?"
5040,Found Connor Murphys reddit account
5041,I got so much happier once I stopped doing things to impress girls
5042,Well said. The problem is that you should never do it to for validation from other people. Getting healthier/stronger should always be about making yourself feel good. OP's problem may be that they need less protein and more self-love and self-respect
5043,"Yes, man. People usually miss the whole point: You should do the things just you want to do for yourself, not for other people."
5044,When
5045,"It's ok, Alex. Most people never have one and a lot aren't even slim enough to do a situp without their belly fat pushing against them."
5046,Try taking your shirt off more and get some better self confidence. I've had a six pack in varying forms of definition since I was 12 because of sports. If I can find a excuse to not have a shirt especially when girls are around. I take it
5047,"Thank you, noted."
5048,"Online tests often show the results you want/expect them to show. When thinking about depression, honestly reflect on questions such as these:

-do I find myself with a ""depressed"" mood more often than not? Or more often than I would like?

-am i having noticeably more negative feelings/attitudes towards my life/situation lately? 

This is a good indicator of situational/circumstantial depression symptoms. 

-am I having noticeably more negative feelings/attitudes that I can't explain?

This may indicate depression symptoms caused by biological issues with the brain.

-is my ability to lead a normal life (friendships, school, work, taking advantage of opportunities, etc) affected by these feelings? 

If the answer to any of these questions is truly yes, I would suggest that you see if a therapist or psychiatrist is right for you. It's not a particularly difficult step to take, and the potential benefits are high. Don't get nervous or think of some other excuse to not get help. These people are trained to meet you where you're at and do what they can to help you make the necessary improvenents. 

Hope this helps. Good luck out there."
5049,"I just went and took the same test and got very similar scores. I feel like it's worth noting that this test recommends going through it with your health care professional, and upon receiving high scores it urges you to seek out a professional if you aren't already."
5050,Thank you homie
5051,"33, 30, 28....
I haven’t been on meds for years and I’m considered stable... this quiz isn’t really helpful.

Go speak to someone. Go outside and take a breath. Walk a little somewhere you feel safe. 
Fresh air helps so much, even if it’s just sitting out the back of your house. 
Pick one thing you enjoy or want to enjoy and try it again, but make time for yourself- read a book, or watch a movie. 
Eat proper food - not prepackaged junk. 
Fuel your body, fuel your mind back to your happy place."
5052,Exercise
5053,"Occupy yourself with work, school or hobbies. Anything to keep your mind distracted."
5054,getting professional help helped me but I know people who it didn't work for so I understand if it isn't for you
5055,"as u/AbeBust mentioned, exercise. workout is the cheapest form of therapy, iss just kinda hard to get yourself to do it.

start small, do just 5 push-ups at 5 random times in the day. if it helps, continue. if it doesn't, hit us up again."
5056,"I find that tests like this have a high confirmation bias, possibly without the taker realising. If you suspect you have anxiety, you'll automatically adjust your answers to match. I wouldn't attach to much meaning to this, if any all. Don't self diagnose, because that might end up being a self fulfilling prophecy.

If you find yourself hindered in daily life by anxious or depressed emotions, please seek professional help. It's better to do so too early than too late. Best of luck to you!"
5057,"Got 24 30 31 on this test. Dont believe these, please. Occupy yourself with some kind of hobby or go to the gym twice a week. These are bullshits."
5058,"I got 6/7/16. I think my Stress should be higher than mild. I am pretty stressed for almost no reason sometimes.. Other than that, it seems decent. If I did this 2 years ago I suppose it would be much higher for depression.  
My best decision was to fix myself a goal, quite far but not too much, and work to reach it. It really helps me. My goal is actually ""I wanna live in Japan"" so I work for it. Learning a language is time consuming and might help. It's not something where you could be harsh to yourself like drawing or doing music. Maybe you could be harsh because you don't keep much of what you learn, but you'll see a progression nonetheless. It's a challenge and rewarding.  
I guess any kind of challenging and rewarding hobbies can do, but don't expect more than you can do or it won't work."

5111,"In summer of 2011, England had something nearly identical to this happen.  We had a black guy called Mark Duggan get shot by police. It started out as protests because the family wanted justice for their boy then it turnt into a full-scale riot. All summer long. The riots went up and down the country. Police in some areas shut it down and in other areas, they just couldn't handle it. 

The only difference between what happened here and what's happening in the USA is that here, it can actually be questioned what really happened to Duggan and the reason why he got shot. With Floyd, there's a video of him dying on camera. 

If this is a repeat of that part of history, I think you'll get over it USA. Not to condone what happened to that man, you have my full condolences but it's just a bad phase and people should definitely not be looting companies - big or small companies. That's peoples jobs and local economies being destroyed!"

Google the term ""emerging adulthood."" It will explain the phase of life you are experiencing. What you're feeling rn is actually really common. I learned about emerging adulthood in college and it helped me feel a lot better about what I was going through"
5153,I completely relate in my feelings.
5154,"Snapchat is interesting because I don't even really see it as a social media in a way, more just like an alternate form of texting. I don't have anyone that I don't know on Snapchat, so it's really more just a form of communication than a social media."
5155,"I don’t like Facebook since they don’t care about people’s privacy. That company needs a management revamp and ethics check. Instagram and WhatsApp should be separated into their own companies again (not sure if that’s an unpopular opinion or not). I got rid of their main app, but still use their Messenger to talk to one of my friends (if it wasn’t for that, I would have gotten rid of that app too).

As for Twitter, I don’t use it. I like the discussion on Reddit, but I kind of see the frustration; I mostly look at things and I comment occasionally, very rarely post anything. 

Now I know you didn’t mention Snapchat, but I have my frustrations with them. Too many ads and that whole thing with merging their Discover section and your friends’ stories onto one page I didn’t really like, ugh."
5156,"Yeah, all I follow on reddit is cute animal pics and dank memes. I try to avoid comment sections n controversial memes and not much craziness happens in animal pics. Do what makes you happy :) I only have a reddit nothing else and that helps me ignore idiots and extreme viewpoints"
5157,"deleted everything but reddit yesterday, it’s been a weird change but honest, probably the best decision i could make for my mental health. i say try it, and really try to stick with it at least for a week. you’ll really feel better"
5158,I only use reddit but I have a facebook account that I usually logged in every once per month. For communicating I used only whatsapp but I have never been a social person so I spend more time commenting o random post on reddit.
5159,"I second this. I was extremely addicted to social media - especially Facebook. I deleted everything except for Reddit & Snapchat (which I don't use much of either anyways. Literally never use Snap). At first, I felt like I was actually withdrawing. Now, I've finding productive ways to fill the time I used to waste."
5160,"I agree with you, that Snapchat could be used as an texting alternative. It could also fall under social media since you can share photos and videos to your story for friends to see as well as seeing your friends’ content that they post to their story. You can use Snapchat in either way (texting or sharing stuff with your friends) or use it in both ways."
5161,"Just don’t engage in discussions so often. All those people spamming their opinions on reddit, Twitter, facebook. They’re not doing anything productive. It’s entertainment if anything. If I find myself typing more than a few sentences i sometimes just delete the whole thing because people will get annoying and follow your posts and shit just to feel they’re right. Best to think of everything as content first and comments as supplements imo"
5162,"I hadn't used Twitter since 2016. Yesterday, I finally deleted it while wondering why it took me 4 years to do so. Feels great. Fuck Twitter."
5163,"I deleted my twitter yesterday. I don't use Facebook actively so I don't really have a reason to delete it, its more just there to keep in touch with distant family and friends. Reddit I stopped using for a long time but recently have returned to, however you're definitely right about the argumentative issue.

I think the only 'social media' I still enjoy using daily is YouTube, if you can even count that."
5164,"Facebook is shit lool so no surprise there

Reddit: well i follow the right communities i guess to avoid all that drama

Snapchat/Insta: Nothing toxic there, just texting my friends"
5165,Do it. Social media is a toxic echo chamber. Reddit is the only one I use.
5166,"What do you mean by getting an ass whooping if you disagree with others? Do you mean you just get downvoted, get called names, or do a bunch of other people just exercise their ability to disagree with your disagreement?"
5167,"Every single company doesn’t care about your privacy. The government doesn’t care about your privacy. The only alternative is to use open source software, use fake names, use things like ProtonMail, encrypt everything on google drive ect. To have privacy these days is such a hassle because you need to be disciplined and be tech savvy."
5168,Reddit is the worst of all 3 imo
5169,"Yea buddy, I got to watch the matrix today"
5170,Depends on the subs honestly.
5171,"Totally agree about Facebook, twitter, and all that instant glorification spam crap.

I have unsubbed from just about every reddit sub except the ones that I trust not to have issues with that.  Reddit is definitely home to terrible people, but I have met several really good friends on here and have kept them for years.  

Sending happy thoughts dude."
5172,I’m already mostly off of Facebook and I’m completely off twitter. Use Facebook for family and friends and it’s not that bad. Twitter is absolutely horrible. Reddit is mild if you don’t look for things that will trigger you.
5173,"I dont understand it though.

Never really used Facebook. I know it was popular like 10 years ago but I never cared to use It.

Twitter I use mostly to follow people I have interest in their works for example actors, and all kind of artists, in fact I follow alot of people that make amazing drawings, animations and all that and a couple of youtubers or streamers.

I have seen them complaining about cancel culture or Kpop stans spammers but like it doesnt even bother me at all, I am 90% of the time a Lurker on Twitter. Sometimes I just post anything, kinda consider it a public journal of sorts.

Then there is Instagram where its the same as in alot of artists and what not but with also alot of friends and family. Lurker 95% of the time and the occasional post about myself of a picture I really liked or something.

Reddit I honestly just use it to talk about the things I love that cant have anyone on real life to talk about, videogames, series, anime and what not, its fun to argue and have respect ful discussions.

I dont feel the toxicity but thats probably just because of the way I use the apps/social media."
5174,Facebook used to be cool. Nowadays it's only used by annoying conservative boomers.
5175,"I got rid of Facebook and Instagram a few years ago and did miss it. It's bullshit that social media is used to keep in touch with people. If you actually give a shit about them, you'll keep in touch. I had many of my good friends added and I still talk to and hang out with them (not lately obviously). They're just annoying. I started dating someone so I got instagram again to see their pictures, like and comment, or whatever but that's it. Snapchat and Reddit are on the way out too I think."
5176,What are the obvious reasons behind Facebook?
5177,Do it be healthy
5178,I deactivated my FB 3 years ago I just use the messenger now and Reddit. I stopped using twitter back in February.
5179,I left socials a while back. Only use reddit now.
5180,The absolute plethora of fake news and just a general boomer vibe. Everything I read on facebook is so biased towards conservative media
5181,"why dont u  use snap? 

i love it imo"
5182,I never really used Snap much to begin with.

5207,"Same, why I decided never to drive with him in the car for now lmao."
5208,"same happens with my mom, it's sooo distracting! she says ""be careful with x"" like every 15 seconds lmao"
5209,Yeah my dad is chill as hell when I drive but he’ll correct me if I do something really dumb
5210,"Yeah , I know the feeling ... try being 15000 feet in the air, with you at the controls and your dad A veteran pilot, Your grandpa also a veteran pilot / Former Alaskan bush pilot/Retired two star general and your twin brother who is  also a pilot Are in the plane with you. I’ve had to more than once  tell everyone to shut the hell up in Various languages, if they annoy me to much. Thankfully no one has ever tried to second-guess me landing the plane with them in it. But yeah back seat drive is Almost surreal when you compare it to backseat piloting/flying a plane . Every time I’m in that situation the only thing I can really say it. We agreed I was the one flying the plane before we all got it. You trusted me when we left the ground, You need to trust me to get back down there with us all dying alright? 

It tends to put an end to the matter for the rest of the time."
5211,"My dad thinks I still drive like a 16-year-old. Yeah, ok sure, we don't all have 50+ years of experience! ;)"
5212,"My dad once told me ""holy shit you are driving too fast"" and I was like ""really?, You drive faster than me in these parts of the neighborhood"", And he was like ""nah impossible""

So I kinda avoid driving with him"
5213,"My dad tries to demand that I do stupid things like park in a ditch in a space that's too small, then gets mad when it ends up not working. My mom complains that I drive too correctly and tries to make me drive poorly."
5214,I drive worse when my passenger is actively talking about my driving
5215,U know their dad :0
5216,"YES!

I tried to tell him that he doesn't seems to understand"
5217,One day you will understand. He just wants perfection . I actually miss the times my dad used to be like that.
5218,"""Hey dad, stfu or walk"" or kinder, whatever you want."
5219,For me it’s my mom. My dads alright.
5220,"I tell him to sit in the back and not talk when I’m driving now, kinda improves the situation slightly but doesn’t solve the issue"
5221,Ha ha. I guess so
5222,"OMG
Must be a tense situation"
5223,10 for $10 ay Target right now!

Thank you for this."
5261,Thank you
5262,"Thank you, I needed this. I’ve been in very difficult times lately, especially mentally. Just quit my job yesterday after unnecessary conflict I was forced into, so that won’t help financially. 

However, I am grateful and happy to have a partner and very close friends I consider family, who also happen to be my roommates, but I also need(ed) to have this ingrained in my head.

On another note, and this is probably really random lmao, but i’ve seen you a lot on a certain generation sub since the beginning of 2020 and just wanted to say I hope you’re well!!"

5267,Hey fellow ace!
5268,"So you know those make-up/dress up barbie games where you can choose from different dresses and hairstyles and stuff? AFAIK Piccrew is basically a website for that except its all user submitted ""games"" and you make your own picture/avatar. Theres lots of great art there.

Theres a link in OPs pic to Picrew to make your own. I also think it's japanese but you can navigate the website pretty easy."
5269,"Hey these are fun and cute! Here's mine, and hopefully the links work!

5272,Yep!
5273,This is so fucking relatable
5274,"You could try joining a club at your school. You wouldn't have to drive anywhere since activities would be on-campus. A sports team could also work if you're athletic. 

Alternatively, you could always try to wrangle a cheap bike from somewhere. That would give you a form of transportation."
5275,"School is there to give you knowledge about the world. You may see it as not useful, but the more you know about the world, the better your ability to think critical and properly evaluate challenges. If try to find something that's particularly interesting and see if there's a club, or develop some sort of further interest. 

As for the job thing, look for jobs near where you are, or try doing lawn Care/babysitting for neighbors.

This is coming from someone who graduated college, and is applying to medical/master's programs. So for me education is irreplaceable."
5276,Education does help but fuck does it suck
5277,"Relax bro it’ll be over before you know it. Some day, you might miss it, even."
5278,"I can empathize with you very strongly. Your situation with the car is especially difficult, so this is just when you gotta be tough as nails. 

Skipping will make things worse, undoubtedly. Getting into adulthood is trial by fire, and this is the trial. You got this."
5279,I'm thinking about joining the Bowling team but I don't have enough practice. Because I'm barely able to go. They don't really have clubs that would hold my interest. And I have no clue where I'd get the money for a bike
5280,"I joined this program at my high school where I take all my classes at a community college. I'm taking jazz band at hs in the morning to maintain friendships within high school as well. You might wanna see if your high school has a program like that. Also, see if you can get your hands on an electric bike, probably the best alternative to a car IMO. I was in your shoes last year man I understand."
5281,"You gotta find something to enjoy or to release a lot of stress easily, for me I started meditating and whenever I literally feel like bending over and su..scratching my di..kneecaps with my lips until my spine breaks in 2, I just go to somewhere safe like the bathroom or library and just think about what about this stupid frickin  2 hours of homework-ass idiot I hate so gosh damn much and then just ignore all thought for a minute and concentrate on my senses. Or I just question my existence and want to hecking DIE so gosh darn hard, than just think about you not working in McDonalds for minimum wage and blowing you managers.. bubbles.

Also I have made it a habit to tell my parents to search it up on the internet as ""insert my opinion"" and they as boomers will of coarse click the first thing that comes up and believe it.

And I have a test and homework for ""tomorrow"" which I didn't learn for or do, yet here I am at 1 am ranting about avoiding giving up on everything.


Btw. You wouldn't believe how hard it was to censor all this."
5282,"Sounds like you need to take a mental health day and chill. Reevaluate your goals and maybe make a list of the things that would make you happy. HS is bullshit, but if you succeed there you’ll set yourself up for a promising future where things do get better. 

Idk if you plan on going to college, but it’s much more freeing compared to high school and will only add value to yourself in terms of employment and intelligence. PM if you need to vent more or want advice or whatever."
5283,"Hey. I have felt like that. Like its all meaningless. Like theres no point to anything and you want to give up. Everytime that happens to me its because of pressure. So much pressure on myself and my goals. 

Here's the thing. You just have to take a step out of the moment. Out of the current situation. All the anger and the self pity you feel right now, will it matter in a month? In a year? In two years? All those worries you have right now, in grand scheme of things don't matter at all. 

Although it sucks to be strong. Its tough to go on. The only way to win is to fight. If you quit, you abandon your problems, you skip school, you lose. The only way to win is to fight."
5284,"Try asking your parents. Say that they are stifling your ability to socialize and grow because you can't drive and they treat driving you like a burden. Try telling them you want to do things that would remind them off their childhood or something, and do it politely even if you hate the idea of asking them. It's your bet at getting some freedom before you move out/get a car."
5285,"Have you considered looking into a trade school? I went to high school and a trade school at the same time because the schools were partnered by each other. And god. The experience was so much different and better. I’m a hands on learner, I like a small quiet environment and learning health at trade school as well as other health related sciences was the best decision I ever made. It helped push me through normal high school too. The way it worked was, I’d do my core classes at high school then midway in the day a bus would (or you could drive if you had the car) take us to our trade school which was roughly 30 mins away. I’d grab some lunch along the way. Get to my tradeschool class and it was such a relief to have a different setting and learn in a different style and excel and be a happy student. I’m sorry you feel the way you do about school. I felt that in my first year of college due to massive burn out and my diagnosed depression. I wish you the best OP. Also I know you might be tight on money but a therapist helped me out during my most stressed years of high school (again my depression loves crushing me when I try to keep my shit together) and just having someone to talk to helped immensely. Perhaps talking with a school counselor our friend who supports you will offer a similar relief?"
5286,"It doesn't sound like you're in a very healthy situation. Unfortunately I can't give a concrete answer, but I can say some of the stuff that has helped me when I was in a similar place.

If you're very tired of school and don't know what you want to do afterwards, you may want to consider skilled trades. You can find lots of 1-2 year certificates that then enable you to get an apprenticeship, and work your way up to a fully sustainable income in about 4 years. Often, you can even drop out of high school after the 10th grade to do them. People will also sometimes go back to college after a while in the trades when they've had more time to figure out their life, and have enough money to do so. 

You are always able to go back to high school to upgrade courses you might need, or do them online, and often schools will even offer that for free until a certain age. There are many more avenues than what is obviously presented.

Ultimately, your mental health is the most important thing. Without it, you can't do anything, including school. I would strongly recommend speaking with a school counsellor both for possible resources for mental health such as therapy or counselling, and also what alternatives you can do in school/career-wise.

Transportation is very important for achieving independence, and it doesn't sound like your parents want you to have that. That is concerning to me. You may be able to find a used bike for cheap, or use your town's bus system (deals are often given for students).

As for getting your license, your school may provide classes for driving. Otherwise, you could ask a friend or adult who may help you with driving, or take lessons from a company.

Finally, I would really advise looking into the local services you may have for teens and mental health. There are free programs for people just like you, going through the same things. Activity groups, counselling, life skills, etc.

Take care."
5287,"I was in a similar situation. I got a job anywhere I could. Cash in hand for painting a fence etc. 

Then I decided to get a job for weekends and late evenings at the local McDonald's. 
I immediately started paying for my own driving lessons and I scheduled them so that if I had to be going somewhere, I could get dropped off at the end of my lesson. 

My parents quickly found out but I was paying with my money so they couldn't do much about it. 

About 4-5 months before I finished school I stopped going in to 90% of my classes. 
I told the school and my parents multiple times about dropping out, and the year prior had a meeting about it where they told my parents not to let me, because I'm clever and will definitely get A grades etc. 

I started working on days I would be going to college. Bought myself a car, passed my test, and now have a way to get to a better job. I went in to school for my exams, and was only allowed to sit one of them. 

So I don't know if it was worth it, I haven't had to use my school grades for anything really yet. But I do know that it pissed me off that I wasted years at school because I wasn't allowed to drop out and then I couldn't sit the exams. 

I would stay in school until it's over. If you want to join a club you can, but if you want to spend as little time as possible there do so. But get a job anywhere you can. Buy a bike or something. 

Then either do driving lessons or motorcycle training for a 50cc scooter or something. It's cheaper, easier, and the bike itself (with insurance) will be cheaper also."
5288,"This was me early last year

School was kicking my ass harder than ever, I was falling deeper and deeper into depression if I hadn’t left I fear for what I would’ve done

But it’s not as easy as just not turning up, try to look into out of school courses like tafe (Australian) or any equivalents near you

But if school legitimately is killing you find another way to get your education"

5315,"I’m sorry, I know how world shattering this is. It’s really a veil lifting moment of life. It’s okay to feel like shit and just let it hurt. I strongly suggest that you spend time with your coworker who was very close with them, the only way I got through loss of people I knew and loved was by spending time with others and hearing them out and also letting myself be upset and talk to others about it. 

When our good friend died by suicide in September, we all had what you might call a vigil and all of us friends got together and had drinks and memorialized him. It felt wrong, to be sure, and weird without them there. But to visualize all the people that loved him (SO MANY) and feel free to just cry whenever you wanted to and have people around that understood meant so much. 

Regardless of what you choose to do, just know you really can’t make a wrong decision. Everyone is different in how they grieve, don’t let anyone tell you how to feel and what to do. Just know eventually the hurt isn’t all consuming and the world does start to move forward again. Again, I’m very sorry for your loss, and I hope the best for you and your coworkers and friends. ❤️❤️❤️"
5316,I'm sorry for you loss. I had a coworker die in a car accident a few years ago. We weren't super close but I thought we might have been if we had more time. He was very nice to everyone and really fun to work with. It was really hard for a long time and our whole store was just kinda depressed for a few weeks. It didn't seem real. I think about his fun antics sometimes and it makes me happy. One time he had burnt some loaves of bread on accident (he worked in the bakery) and hollowed them out and put them on his feet and said they were his loafers. Take some time and think of all the good times you had together. I feel for you and am very sorry for your loss.
5317,"Thank you so much, I reached out to the guy who was really close to her, pretty sure he was asleep when I texted him, I hope he gets back to me and that he’s doing okay. He was hurting real bad and had to leave work early a couple hours after he heard what happened. It’s just going to take time for all of us."
5318,"Hang in there, what you did was very nice. If he doesn’t have the emotional energy to respond I’m certain he very much appreciates it. It is comforting to feel SEEN and understood. Make sure you are there for yourself as well ❤️"

5350,"How is Buzzfeed considered news on this chart? This chart feels a little skewed to the left in itself.  


None of these are good forms of news outlets by themselves, they're all there to make money. If you want the facts in this day and age you need to root them out from multiple sources. You need to go to CNN, BBC, Fox, Sky News, The Guardian, The Hill and all of the above to get a fair picture of what the news is. I would also say that it's valuable to go and see what places like The Daily Wire and TYT have to say, but baring in mind there is heavy bias in their reporting.  


I'd also like to shout out my man Phillip DeFranco. I don't know of a Journalist that does a better job of fairly reporting news than him."
5351,"Completely agree, did you notice that MSNBC is nestled in the 'original fact reporting with little or no bias' section?"
5352,"If you want to see a news story from several sides I HIGHLY recommend [Allsides](allsides.com). They show news stories with central, left, and right takes so you get balanced reporting"
5353,">For example: compare fox to CNN. Since one leans more left and the other learns right, they may leave out important details to a news story that doesn't align with their political stance while the other one is going to be all over it.

>The truth is somewhere in the middle between both

The heuristic of finding truth between 2 extremes only works when the extremes are distributed equally distant from center and the content you compare are merely perspectives of the same issue/topic. Neither of those two things are the case when you compared between CNN and Fox, all it takes is a 2nd look at the graph OP posted to see that.

Comparing MSNBC and The Washington Times would be a more fair comparison, considering they both output analysis pieces and are rated about equally distant from the center of the graph.

If you wanted a more neutral view of the news, why not read The Associated Press, a non-profit which has been rated for years as having the least bias, considering they aren't known for publishing opinion pieces as opposed to CNN and Fox? BBC and Reuters aren't even based in the US, yet still report on American politics in addition to everything else they do. 

You don't have to guess at what the truth is based on comparing extremes, and not every news agency is profit-based."
5354,"The more I look at it the more I hate it.

Edit: the only unbiased news I can find on here is C span, and that’s just because they broadcast live events with no commentary"
5355,"As someone who is majoring in Broadcast Journalism I find this to be true. My biggest struggle with most of the papers I write or speeches I give is to get rid of bias. Most assignments I am given in class are not political ones.  Currently I am writing on how Fortnite (of all things) changed and Impacted the gaming industry, as well as our culture.  And as a gamer.... I fucking hate Fortnite, but it has impacted many lives.   The best journalists does there research and try to find that grey area within stories.  I once thought maybe broadcast journalism really wasn’t for me because I wanted to find the truth in matters despite political bias and it makes it a little easier for due to being an independent and open minded to all facts and opinions.  Yet then I realized, anywhere above the local tv level I will always be expected to give some bias.  I eventually said fuck it and that I will do what I must. Despite currently going through hell trying to learn Spanish, I’m all in with this major and I’ll be damned if I don’t achieve my goals."
5356,"so... governments should regulate what every news outlet can publish based on how “informative and unbiased” it is?

What could possibly go wrong?"
5357,my point is that the government would get to decide what “unbiased” means. It’s subjective.
5358,[deleted]
5359,"the issue is that a lot of people say ""you need to vote! only 50% of Americans voted in 2016!!"" which causes idiots to vote and we get nobody really wants. which some people really bank off of, actually...."
5360,"Not mine, but is an interesting chart.   Also.  CNN is skewing left on the chart.  In my opinion they should be more to the left but not as far left as FOX is right.  Yea the chart does need adjustments but nothing is going to be perfect.  Bias will exist in this simply because there are no facts to base a chart like this off of.   It’s literally a guessing game"
5361,I just don’t like the game and dislike the culture surrounding it
5362,It is always worth staying informed.  Just realized my typo
5363,I wish I get to vote
5364,Gonna go ahead and disagree that Jacobyn is an extreme or unfair interpretation of the news.

5367,Nice.  Great website.  Will definitely check it out
5368,You will one day
5369,Why do you as a gamer hate fortnite? Seems like kind of a childish thing to do...
5370,"Ugh... I'm a socialist and I fucking hate MSNBC. They're so sensationalist, like a liberal Fox News, and they have a very imperialist stance on foreign policy. They also have a huge bias against Bernie Sanders. I don't think they're really very left-wing at all."
5371,Not under CCP no
5372,I don't consider cheering on war to be left-wing.
5373,"C-Span is the most unbiased news station because it is literally just politics in your face.  

It’s ok that you hate the list.  It’s not 100% accurate and it’s also not mine.   I still find this chart interesting and a nice point to spark conversation."
5374,I mean it's not like that now with the BBC
5375,"The BBC is not perfectly impartial. I don’t watch much BBC but they’ve been criticised for being biased in the past. You’re talking about taking away freedom of the press. It’s not a good idea, trust me."
5376,"Imagine having that much distrust for the government 

I think that's a big difference between the UK and the USA"
5377,"Lol I’m not from the US, I’m from Ireland."
5378,"It's honestly kind of sickening that ""news"" publications can feed the public whatever misinformation they want without consequence

In my opinion, all news should be like the BBC in the UK. It should have a legal obligation to have whatever they publish to be as informative and unbiased as possible.

Tabloid papers and sensationalist news should be illegal."
5379,Kudos to you
5380,"This subreddit's definitely a nice change from r/teenagers, you can make a comment and there's a way bigger chance someone will read it, rather than have it get buried in new."
5381,"No, you don't have to make the audience laugh. If you do that, you lose. It's a competition to produce the shittiest content possible."

5384,"Really? Because most things I see come out of here are ludicrous at best.

Your example being an exception for sure."
5385,He needed to drive back so I could drive my new car back. But I let him drive he could get the feeling for it again.
5386,why didn’t you drive instead
5387,Hey at least your family still has you new car until your parents get a new one
5388,I didn't hear a sorry yet and why he would lie about having a license is as big of a question for me as for you. Even his own father thought he had a license. Me and the other guy feel betrayed. He risked our lives for no good reason. Knowing him he only worries about the consequences for himself now. I think it's going to cost him alot of money because insurance won't cover you if you don't have a license. I so think he won't be able to take driving lessons to get a license for a year or 2.
5389,You're smarter than I was at 18 keep that energy 👍
5390,that makes sense. i didn’t even think about how you both would drove back.
5391,Yeah my grandpa does have a license so he drove me to my car. The funny thing is that it seemed like.he knew what he was doing. Just a bit Rusty. I am gonna post a picture of the car so if anyone wants to see it it's on my account. Thanks for your concern.
5392,"why did he lie? did he apologize about it, how did it feel and all that, I’m curious?"
5393,These are the words I live by
5394,Thanks for thinking I am smart.
5395,We all make mistakes we only stupid if we don't learn from them
5396,"did you end up getting the car you bought? I’m sorry he lied about having a license that’s really bad, it’s even worse that he doesn’t even know how to drive, I’m glad you guys are ok and I’m sorry about your parents car"
5397,"Tbh when he crashed he should've told you that he didn't have a license and to say you were driving. It'd then be in your park to decide. Your insurance rates would go up, but the car would be covered."
5398,Well. A bwm 1 isn't exactly a family car for 5 really tall people...
5399,Well. No. The car doesn't have all risk insurance so any damages you cause yourself don't get covered. I did think about it but when I called my parents they told me to definitely not do that.
5400,"Ah. Yeah, okay."
5401,"I've felt this way for a little while in school and it got much worse after I graduated and got a job. My values and personal beliefs changed and now the career I've chosen feels soul crushing and exhausting. I believe that this kind of thing will never go away unless change is made and that's exactly what needs to happen. Find a way to turn a passion of yours into a career, even if it's less financially reliable. I have no doubt it's better being stuck miserable and unsure of yourself."
5402,"Same, I just feel as if I struggle a lot."
5403,"i've felt that way for 2 or 3 years, moved a thousand miles away in search of a better life. was not a great decision. oh well"
5404,"damn. rn you got -1 upvotes and I almost made it -2 just because I think organized religion is toxic and should be abolished, but that being said, i reread your comment, and despite the religious reference what you said was kind, positive, and uplifting, and you didnt try and force your religion down anyone's throat, like so many people would have. have my upvote. you seem like a genuinely good person who just happened to get ensnared into a belief system based on lies. I genuinely hope you have a good day, mate. cheers.

edit: to the people that downvoted him, I can only assume it was for the same reason I was tempted to at first. but, like, really? he was being kind and supportive. and again, he didn't try and force religion down anyones throat. he just mentioned it. I strongly dislike religion too, but believing in god doesn't inherently make you a bad person, it just means that you're gullible. he didn't do anything wrong. lay off the dude."
5405,No
5406,"It is too true. It's hard to always think positive about everything. I'm very into church and God, it says trails come to make us stronger but feels like the pain, loneliness and heart ache doesn't end. It seems its good for 2 days and the rest of the week is miserable and I am just being alive not even living. All I can say man is that it will get better. Feeling lost is your chance to find something worth living. I'm 21 and just dropped out of college but I know my success will come when its time. It has to everyone has potential. Every one in this subreddit will be someone there younger self will be proud of."
5407,okay 👍🏼
5408,"Yes, sometimes just wondering when you feel that your somewhere that you want to be"
5409,"Ive been feeling like that for the past two years but it seems to ramp up even more aggressively as I get older. It really do be like that, some days there are good days, some days there are bad days. Just gotta keep going. Hope things turn for you"
5410,"I’m 21, but for the past couple of years I was feeling lost. Im the past year or so I’ve really “found” myself. I realized the thing I like doing and the things I do really well suit me nicely and people see it, they might not comment on them too much. Like my parents never really said stuff only talked about college and whatever.
But now I’ve really slapped some sense into myself. I know what’s up and what I need to do. I have no tips or tricks on how to feel better. You really have to put yourself in the center of your attention in every single good way possible (think positive after everything!) and you’ll see your strengths. Very good strengths."
5411,I’ve been unhappy for years. And recently the things I’m interested in aren’t bringing me joy and motivation. I don’t know who I am anymore and I’ve lost hope for my future
5412,"It is extremely common to feel like you are stuck in a rut or failing behind in life. This can lead you feeling lost and without direction. 

Steve Jobs’ 2005 Stanford Commencement speech highlights a few key lessons that might help with this. You need to know that patience and perspective is the key to personal growth and picking yourself back up. So be sure to ask yourself the right questions and know that feeling lost in life is only temporary.

Steve Jobs is one of the most iconic figures in history and his Stanford speech highlights how he rose up from his lowest points and ended up taking Apple to greater heights than ever before.

I hope this video can give you the motivation that you need to overcome whatever it is that you are going through.

5415,"I don't try and force it down peoples throats. And I don't mention it to be that person or anything. If you believe or not that's on you, I still love everyone equally. I appreciate you standing up for me a little. To many things have happened in my life for me not to believe. I didn't expect this subreddit to be like me as far as religion. I expected it to be people that are young like me facing the world and dealing with everyday problems and the hard times of being young adults in this world. I am black who is Christian, I'm not religious because there is a difference between them. I have a coworker who is atheist, we are bestfriends and a roommate who is agnostic and bisexual. I get along with everyone because I treat them all the same. I'm not the stereotype you may think I am. I am a very selfless person who puts the needs of others before myself. I love everyone here, I really genuinely hope everyone here sees the bad times aren't forever. I thank you for sticking up for me and having some sort of conversation about it because i would be wondering what I said wrong to get so many downvotes lol"

You're just supposed to remember ~15% of each class you take, but when you stack that up with all your classes that repeat a lot of material, it equates to knowing almost everything you need.

5577,How does one get fancy color flair?
5578,*now
5579,[removed]
5580,"Yeah true, more people would be nice"
5581,"James, for the last fucking time. I'm not lucky. 

Do you know why my life doesn't work out like then""typical"" young adult?? Because I didn't sit around and bitch about how my life sucks and how it's not fair more things aren't free/given to me. I work my ass off for what I have. I get up at 2am every single morning and don't stop working till 7pm that day just to repeat the process all over again.   

It's nothing glorious. It's nothing special. I just have drive and motivation and work towards my goals every single day. I enjoy it though. It keeps me busy and I feel accomplished at the end of the day"
5582,"> 2am every single morning and don't stop working till 7pm that day just to repeat the process all over again.

and you enjoy this life?"
5583,I do indeed. I enjoy money and I enjoy staying busy. I have the weekends to my self thankfully so that's always a plus
5584,it's not a compliment to attribute someone's success to luck instead of hard work
5585,I think all tweens think adulthood is special
5586,"Yeah okay James. Guess what though?? You could have this same exact life James. You could literally do the same thing I'm doing. I still work the same exact job I got 3 months after I graduated high school. My first job ever. I choose to not go the college route, it isn't for me. 

It's not a rags to riches story.... It's simply just working to live. Again, you too could have the same life but instead you choose to just dwell on the fact that getting older sucks and how you aren't ready for it. With that mindset James, I expect you to not make anything of yourself. You have to be willing to accept the fact that life is harsh and just adapt to the changing world around you. Develop a good work ethic. Work your ass off, keep your goals in mind and work towards them every day"
5587,"No. You don't have motivation James. You don't have work ethics, you don't have the willingness to Better yourself. All you have is complains. 

Good luck with life"
5588,No James. All you've done is royally piss me off and insult me. You don't have my life. You don't know me as a person. You are in no situation to comment and make allegations like you have
5589,In the end any improvement comes from yourself.  Never expect things to be given and if you are gifted something free be thankful. Adulthood is the epitome of working to get what you have. College requires constant work. Jobs require constant work. I think you just never learned this true fact and I'm sorry you never did. If you really want to get out of this rut then you'll have to fix it because in the end no amount of sexual questions to us or telling us how much adulthood sucks will fix anything.
5590,"I'm also 19 and... I don't find it disappointing, just because I already find life to be shit in it's whole length,not only ""adult phase"". 

I never appreciated how many problems I did not have when I was a bit younger. I'm going into uni now, part time degree and I have a job interview set on Tuesday (full time job). I feel like I'm gonna throw up thinking about all of it. I hate it. I desperately don't want my life to look like that but what's the other choice? 

I should appreciate it more when I was 15, instead of wanting to be so quickly adult.

On the other hand, the independency is the postive side of it. I don't need to ask permission anymore. And it makes travelling a lot easier. But of course, you're still dependent on how much money do you have, so there's that. 

I'm just so tired of everything and I'm only 19. I don't even want to think about all these years I have yet to live..."
5591,"nah man, if youse believe that shit fo real, then that make you simple af, no two ways about it

&#x200B;

youre the *only* reason your life isnt meeting (and even surpassing) those aforementioned expectations, you feel me bruh?"
5592,"You're looking at the pictures to big James. You're looking at the end result.

It's like building a skyscraper. 

You see it and are like damn?? That's really nice and big, that only took 2 years to build? But in reality, 2 people lost their life building it, many people didn't see their families for days and days, people worked around the clock to ensure it opened on time. 

Nothing in life is free, nothing is usually handed too you. You have to dedicate everything you have to make something of yourself. You have to give 150 precent and at the end of the day, no one is going to work nearly as hard as you... Don't compare yourself to others. You do you. 

If you still don't agree with me then I'm sorry James but you're just being ignorant and don't opening yourself up to what life is really about and to you, my condolences. I hope bitching and complaining works out for you."
5593,"You shouldn't want to be coddled or treated differently from other people. There's a point where you actually do just need to ""grow up"", because you aren't going to be given excuses and shit your whole life. You need to start taking control of your life, taking initiative, and start working your ass off to better yourself instead of wasting time on reddit or discord."
5594,"Lol it’s completely childish to think that suddenly by getting older all your problems are fixed. You have to do that yourself. There’s no magic it’s just getting to mature and be responsible and manage your life but it doesn’t happen automatically and frankly, you’re nowhere near it."
5595,I didn't expect much and am still disappointed.
5596,I work two jobs. I work for a logistics company from 3 to 10am then babysit from 11 till 6:30
5597,James please stop talking
5598,"I only thought physically I would look like an adult by 18  and feel like one but I don't. I'm still lil old me from high school lol. I think it'll take a couple more years, but you'll have to actively work towards it as others have stated"
5599,That makes so much more sense lol idk why I didn’t think of that. All i have to say is good shit aha this adulting shit is hard but you seem to be handling it better than many. I hope you receive good fortune in the future bro
5600,"No I'm very upset and going to remain upset Because no matter how many times I try to help you and tell you James. You don't listen

You are stuck in your ways and will continue to be. I'm done with you James."
5601,"I think I've had this feeling for every age. 
Every day is just another day. 

It's weird because I'm definitely not the same person I was even just a year ago, but each day I feel exactly the same. Even now that I'm technically an adult. Try not to get too hung up on it though, I enjoy my life moment to moment.

Also, personally I don't believe that these years have to be the best of our lives. I hated school and college etc. And I know people who have done a complete U-turn in the middle of their lives and finally found what's for them. Don't worry about this being ""it""


Love being able to drive though."
5602,"No, in the end I've grown the most as a person even with the amount of bullshit I have to deal with. In the end I don't have time to be dissatisfied as I can always try and change things for myself so I'd rather do that than keep on dwelling on things."
5603,Well you can either lie down and let life roll over you or actually do something about it. All of us had to learn skills and coping mechanisms
5604,"18 isn't a juvenile age. I'm an adult. They aren't responsible for me. If anything James, I'm unlucky that it all happened. And you're the lucky one

I'm done with this conversation James. You've done nothing but insult me this whole time. I hope you can be unlucky as me some you can understand what life is actually about."
5605,"Yes, but in an abstract way. I never really considered that far into the future as a tween. At that point I only had vague notions of adulthood based on (mainly misrepresentative) stuff my parents and relatives told me (and no, I didn't include the actual lives of the adults I knew in that notion, only what they said)."
5606,[deleted]
5607,i feel you.           bruh
5608,No you’re not understanding. You’re not an adult. You don’t think like an adult nor act like one. You think like a toddler who dreams of living in a castle and growing up to be a princess. That’s not reality and you had the expectation that we all had as little kids. We grew up. You didn’t.
5609,My recess is going to the bathroom and scrolling thru reddit on the toilet for 15 minutes
5610,What do you do that requires you to have such crazy hours?
5611,"Congrats, you're growing up. Didn't mean that you're not cute tho"
5612,And this is why this sub was created
5613,"I hit that point a couple months ago. It used to be a place where people shared funny, relatable memes. Now it's just a cesspool of shitposts from 14 year olds talking about how they lost their virginity or some shit"
5614,I would say the same.
5615,I hit that point about 2 years ago thankfully
5616,"Aww tks hehe 

:)"
5617,Ok Chad
5618,"All top post of r/feemagers is criticising r/teenagers . This sub is much better than both.

Edit : It used to be last time I checked. The top posts must has changed since."
5619,Good
5620,"A lot of karma whoring posts too



r/Feemagers seems to be a much better alternative to be on"
5621,Had to unsub. r/teenagers is a giant karma farm for the most part now.
5622,I feel like the whole vibe of it changed immediately after the alt-no-more story and instead of being a community it was everybody trying to one up each other to have recognition in that sub for a week.
5623,I honestly feel like r/feemagers is going to end up down the same hole since so many people from r/teenagers are moving there.
5624,r/teenagers just keeps going more and more downhill. Every day more and more assholes arrive to that sub.
5625,"It's just a bunch of early teens being horny and stuff. 

Can't relate to their humor"
5626,Thank God I joined this sub
5627,Definitely. After the condom guy story it went to shit. Now half of the posts are about sticking dicks in things and girls not existing.
5628,It’s kinda crazy. You’re gonna keep feeling and getting older and understand/looking at life differently. You’ll mature super quick. I feel so different than I did just even a year ago
5629,"Ayyy big man Tri, fancy seeing you outside the server"
5630,Yea ive about hit that point
5631,"UwU

Hello there


It's been awhile lol,miss talkin to ya on the server"
5632,Thank you for confirming my suspicions.
5633,criticizing doesn't mean it'll be better. r/teenagersnew did nothing but criticize r/teenagers for *months* and that place is a spammy hell hole for the most part.
5634,I know right
5635,E
5636,As we age i guess the more it’s like a need for us to move on in a sense
5637,I just checked the sub for the first time in a while and the humor is definitely weirder. Still lol’d at a few of them though. The microwave post killed me.
5638,Bro it's crazy tho cause this sub is getting more and more new life every day! A few months ago there was like no activity at all!
5639,What even is happening with the revolution thingy that's going on there? I'm so confused. Can anyone explain?
5640,"Eh, we'll see


Hopefully it doesn't"
5641,Okay. I won't give you silver
5642,Am I too late
5643,Holy shit
5644,Ask and you shall receive
5645,It seems like we have a bored god on our hands here. Its very generous of you good sir.
5646,Got em
5647,Username checks out
5648,Yes
5649,"And now, so does yours"
5650,I'll include you in my life insurance plan for this
5651,I guess... Since you asked so nicely :)
5652,Mayhaps please
5653,yes!
5654,Can someone please explain what those are for I don’t get it I’m kind of new lol
5655,You're definitely right about the bored part.  I appreciate your kind words. Enjoy your silver :)
5656,There you go bb
5657,This is so cool lol
5658,Have my upvote

5664,perhaps
5665,:)
5666,Perhapped
5667,you’re the best
5668,Wait is this real? Can I ask for one?
5669,"What a massive legend (and on a side note, yes please, sir!)"
5670,What no way
5671,"Your first sentence actually made me scream omg at my screen. Feels weird being so accurately described. My mother has been ultra over protective basically my whole life, and we're basically lower middle class, so I'm not being rushed out of the house.

Yeah, I was thinking that getting general requirements would be a good start.

The problem is I did online classes for most of my high school, and I have a burning hatred for them now. It may sound wierd, but I'm seriously aching for a more social experience. I was able to spend 1 semester at an actual school for my senior year, and it was so much fun. I actually hate that I spent so much of my teenage years behind a god damn screen. 

So yeah I was gonna enroll for this year, and then Corona happened, and I said hell to fking no, not again."
5672,"Mind if I ask what kind of job you have? I've been investing the little money I do have, and I think having an income from home that I could invest would make me feel a lot better. 

Tbh I'm just looking for ideas at this point.

Also, I think it will work out for you friend. Just keep saving, being financially secure *is* freedom. In fact if I had money, then I could get my own place and actually try to live beyond these walls."
5673,YES! I got an internship that was cancelled and so far I've done nothing but watch Avatar and program stupid shit.
5674,Oh for me too. I was supposed to finally leave for my last 2 years of college after graduating community college but now I’m doing online at home. It’s almost less social than community college lol.
5675,"> So yeah I was gonna enroll for this year, **and then Corona happened**, and I said hell to fking no, not again.

So you know why I chose the username...it impacted all my spring classes which was frustrating as I was finally getting more comfortable with going to in-person classes. Then bam, suddenly I'm back to friendless isolation and online classes.

Have a single in-person class this semester, the rest are online with group meeting times (WebEx/Zoom). Given the volatility of the situation, I can't even be sure the one in-person class will stay that way. And the masks + social distancing makes everything more awkward and isolating so in-person classes are pointless anyway."
5676,Also you aren't a spoiled brat these are all valid things to be worried about. Don't worry about being listless I've been there for years and it looks like imma be there for a couple years yet. Just take it one day at a time. My dms are always open though if you wanna talk
5677,"How do you like the online classes? 

I did online classes for most of my high school years, and I honestly couldn't bear the thought of doing college online now."
5678,"Damn what a bummer, like yeah the world just had to have a friggin *plague* drop on us during the most important transition of our lives, but oh well I guess... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
5679,"20 also and I'm right here with you. Haven't had a real job or driven really and im so thankful for my parents taking care of me but my independence is shot (also theyre helicopter parents so that doesnt help).

I'm in college (not physically :/) and I can say that has helped me make steps to become more independent at least emotionally/mentally. Not saying you need to do that but if you are going a college route, community college sounds like a good track. Or a trade school.

I half knew what I wanted to do going into uni, and now I'm on track for a completely different career. But im also considering quitting all that and living in the woods, so you dont really need to know what you wanna do rn. You can make decisions so that you can have the freedom to choose later in life- from signing up as an exploratory student to getting a job to just give you money."
5680,"Same here, I was supposed to leave for a university from my community college but I'm doing online classes this semester."
5681,"So relatable. I've basically just learned a lot about investing, kept practicing my guitar, and watched dumb stuff. Like no wonder I feel bad. 🤦‍♂️"
5682,"Alrighty, then it looks like were both in similar boats. I wish you all the luck and good fortune on the way to independence.

All these prerequisites that seem to be required for adult hood, are just so blah. Like if you can't drive or have an income, you just have no freedom to be a person.

It's pretty comforting to know that a lot of people still aren't quite sure where they wanna go with their life. At the same time though, I feel like I should be learning from people and try to be sure. I'd like to do it right from the get go, that way I save my future self from less regrets. My teenage self has left me with a mountain of them, and I'd like to do better this time."
5683,"Yeah, it definitely did. I was beginning to recover from depression and then suddenly covid stepped in and fucked up a lot of what I had been doing. I feel like I've managed to recover from that though, and with the semester starting for me on Monday for me I'm back to being busy and progressing in my life."
5684,"I've just turned 21, I was getting ready to transfer to a university after two years of community college and I was looking forward to getting to experience the university life, dorming on campus,  and was hoping to be more involved in student activities. I'm doing online courses now and I miss in person classes."
5685,"It was the opposite for me. Like you, it’s taken me quite a few years to start actually growing up after high school. I have been out of school for 5 years and was kind of a failure, however Covid has kind of helped me in a way to work in only fixing myself. Got a new job, moved out, bought a new car, and got a dog. You should use all this time to work on yourself, you’re unlikely to ever get it again."
5686,">Does anyone feel like Coronavirus has brought their life to a screeching halt?

I'd like to meet anyone who hasn't had their life on pause ever since the pandemic started. Online classes absolutely blow and my social life died, but what can you do? A global pandemic is ravaging the land, and the only way to fight against it is to stay indoors. If anything we're lucky to be this young while covid is going crazy since the mortality rate for people our age is a lot smaller compared to older adults.

I like to think of it as our lives being on pause rather than being stopped. Even if I can't socialize outside I'm still socializing with people online (I'd recommend VRChat to scratch that itch) and I'm still going to classes and my job. I understand that you can't do the things you want to do right now OP but it's not like life is paused forever. I'm sure you'll experience those life moments soon. For now let's chill and wait it out.

(Also heads up, relationships are kinda overrated)"
5687,"I feel like I’m behind on that whole “becoming an adult” thing too and I understand wanting that feeling of independence in adulthood. I see other people my age driving and getting part-time jobs and getting their lives together and stuff, and meanwhile I haven’t learned how to drive yet or got any jobs other than summer jobs, and I’m almost 20. I wanted to start getting my stuff together this summer, but then the coronavirus situation happened.

Community college is definitely a good choice if you want to go the college route, as you save more money over going to a 4-year college at the beginning. 

And I feel like it’s okay to feel like you don’t have any idea what to do in life, in our late teens and throughout our 20s, we’re discovering what we want to do and figuring things out."
5688,Round 2 of Corona Virus for me has sorted of disrupted the flow of things for me and its irritating me. Shit was just starting to feel normal again but now we are back to lockdown
5689,"what branch you going? I'm going air force and I got in just fine, mostly. there was a delay (lost my job due to covid and had to wait an extra 2 months) but not quite a pause on that, at least."
5690,I work at a call centre (the shift just ended) so its work at home baby!
5691,I was in the process of joining the Canadian Airforce but COVID paused that as I needed to focus . I need to check soon
5692,I haven’t started yet but I think it’ll be easier to get A’s but it comes at a cost of being boring a lonely.
5693,"Yep, we got the shittiest end of the stick but we’re not a majority so no one will even think about it that way."
5694,"Very true. If you want someone to chat with about this, feel free to drop me a message sometime later. Guess it could help."
5695,Appreciate it friend.
5696,"Wow, that's.. actually amazing advice, i will still find it odd. But as i usually do, I'll adapt to it, well i also have to, but, that somewhat brings a new perspective, you don't realise how much that has actually helped me, thank you, sincerely, thank you :)"
5697,"I’m 18, for me it got scary after graduating HS, currently i. a college I hate with a passion for a degree I have a passion for. Life can suck but you have to roll with the punches, it’ll get better, work hard enough so you can like a kid like life when you have to take care of yourself and not stuck in 2-3 dead end jobs. as another redditor said, it’s about perspective, but I’ll add to that. You can see it as freedoms to do what you want when you want or you can see it as your fleshbag getting closer to death, but life is a lot more worth living if you think about the good in having a career you love and building a family to love that will love you (I might not get that last one cause confidence, but whatever) It’s your life and you’re behind the wheel, make what you want of it, you are literally like less than 20% through it, even less if you think of the time you could actually create memories. Good luck with everything, God I feel old talking like this but really don’t waste youth worrying!"
5698,"I mean, that counts, but you'll either do it or you won't, try it and it might work.  ""If something is important enough, even if the odds are stacked against you, you should still do it"" -Elon Musk. That seems important to you, your work and a married life, even if it's stacked against you, try your best"
5699,"Me? I'm a pretty confident person. Couldn't wait to be out how high school and DO something. I always imagine myself as successful at whatever I do. Always planning,  and can't wait to begin the next thing. But now? I'm 22 in college and I feel so constrained by the endless waiting for it to end, yet I need the degree. ""Getting older"" isn't something that cross my mind very much, just moving on to the next ""thing""."
5700,"It was fucking mentally intense at first. I remember the first time I realized to myself that “damn I’m getting old”.  A young kid probably around 12 came up to me and said “hey mister” and then proceeded to ask me something. Mentally I was like “ahh noo” because typically younger people call each other dude, bro or some other variant.

Regarding handling life, i personally loved the independence of it all. Having your own money and being old enough not to have any age restrictions on things is nice. I also set really high personal goals for myself and see if I can accomplish them. It’s like a game for me and when I get these goals I get great personal satisfaction. Have X amount of dollars in my retirement account, bang this many girls this year ect.

View aging as a challenge that you can overcome. Make life your bitch."
5701,"Your responsibilities and duties as a child/teenager are, to a large extent, superficial. It's a phase where you're told that you should do something ""just because I told you so."" It's a phase of (limited) fun with no real responsibilities, and yet it's a phase that is hard to navigate due to all the tension, agony, stress, and the everlasting feeling of being uncomfortably restrained.

Adulthood brings a sense of relief. A sense of security and comfort. With it comes a lot of responsibilities without which you can't survive. And it also comes with the opportunity to shape your future as you see fit.

There's no coming to terms with it, really. I dread the process of ageing as much as you do. But I'm hopeful for what may come next."
5702,"Yeah I felt that at 15 as well. Every stage of life has it's own pros and cons, and I've found it best to just try and focus on the pros at any given age."
5703,Where do you go and what's your degree if you dont mind me asking? What happened that made you hate it with a passion?
5704,"I haven’t, but thanks for reminding me"
5705,"I just had to get it through my head that life doesn’t end after 20, or 30, 40 etc. It’s still something I’m dealing with but it been getting better. I guess I sort of think of it like this: remember how your teachers would always try to tell you, “_____ won’t be like _____. It’s really easy now but it isn’t going be as easy in _____.” in order to scare you into studying? Well I used to be so afraid that I wasn’t ready to move forward. When I actually did I realized that my teachers had blown everything out of proportion and I actually was ready. I was more prepared than I gave myself credit for. That’s how I sort of view life. It’s scary to move forward, to face the fact that I’m getting older, but it’s not as scary as I imagined and it can be exciting too."
5706,"It’s good lol, I’ll figure something out at some point"
5707,"The feeling of age first hit me at 18. Afterward, it took me another three years to make this simple observation: You can't stop the march of time, seemingly worsening the older you get, but you can make the most of it. For 2020, I resolved to take more risks and manage my time better. Time wasted is time you'll never get back."
5708,"I just turned 20. I don't like it. Everyone around me is moving on and living their lives, but I feel like I missed out on my childhood and that's probably part of why I still can't let go. I wish I had just been normal and had a good family, and grown up like normal kid and have those experiences, and then I would be able to let go. But feeling like you missed out really really sucks and I feel bad about it all the time, among other things to feel bad about. But I still feel some sort of hope for the future at the same time as I feel like I missed out on things and it's too late for me. 

I think the way most people come to terms with it is, they grew up normally and naturally just moved on."
5709,"In my experience, those sorts of question only arise when I’m feeling dissatisfaction in my life. When you’re to busy having a good time and doing something meaningful, thoughts like that lose their power."
5710,"I’ll be 25 this year, and so far I’ve always been pretty happy with getting older. To me, getting older has just meant becoming more independent and generally being taken more seriously by others (getting fewer of the “oh you’re just __ years old, you don’t know anything” type remarks). 

I guess in my teens it was pretty scary, but that wasn’t really a fear of getting old so much as it was a fear of adult responsibilities that nobody had prepared me to deal with."
5711,I had an existential crisis for the entire month I turned 20 because I was a real adult and no longer a teenager. Then a few weeks later I ended up getting severe burnout. Dealing with both wasn’t fun. But I became more sure in my current self and abilities which grounded me a lot.
5712,"I realized I could buy whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it. It wasn’t just paying bills and working at a shitty job anymore. I’m only 22 so I don’t considering myself a high level adult; maybe like a level 2 at this point. But I came to terms with it by realizing being an adult means being able to do the dirty work without complaining so I can spend my free time doing whatever I want.

If I want cookie dough st two am; I’ll drive to wallmart and buy it. I want a new pair of shoes??? If my bills are paid why not. 

I don’t think you ever 100% come to terms with it; but everyday feels like a new realization that with aging and I guess adulting I’m able to do more things I’d always wanted to do.

Getting older just means going higher on the adulting scale in my opinion. You learn more and gain more XP that lets you focus on different stuff"
5713,I didn't lol
5714,You start playing the role. Yesterday I yelled at a bunch of kids to get off my lawn and went to bed at 8pm.

5746,"I'm kinda on the same fence as you so i am kinda here to see what sociable people give as ideais (doe this is reddit, so eh). My best bet is for you to find yourself a hobby and see if there's a group/event for that. This can range in anything really.   


E.G.:   
1- Cars, if you're into them, go to a car meeting.  
2- Anime? Not something i'm personally into, but plenty of people are, why not look for a event that'll happen this year and go to it?  
3- Trying social websites? I don't really know of any, since i never looked for one, but, you can probably find one. (Reddit should lowkey have a subreddit where people(reddit randoms) just meet up or something ngl).  


Hope i helped, looking fowards for other inputs from other people since i also sorta have the same issue, doe i'm still in college..."
5747,I wish. My job is at a family-owned business and everyone there is 10+ years older than me with kids.

5764,"Ahhh idk, I dont even know what should I say, or how do I know if she wants me too, and I just feel super awkward and un confortable when is someone I dont know very well.

I guess I should have specified, I am afraid of hook up sex.

Never had sex, but one time I was close to do it with my ex, but something interrupted us, but in that case I wasnt that insecure. Idk."
5765,That's up to you if you'd rather wait for a romantic partner or hook up with someone. But it's better to wait for the right time then forcing a hook up then having a bad experience.
5766,slow and steady wins the race. the earth is responsible for when you are ready.  it happens naturally with a human
5767,what are you afraid of
5768,"> I dont even know what should I say

Be charming. Flirting has tons of different forms. Smile, make eye contact, tease her a bit, give her compliments, if she's responding well perhaps slip in some very casual physical contact or closeness.

>how do I know if she wants me too 

At each point just see if she starts doing the same. That means you're probably fine. Closeness is one thing you can watch out for. If she starts sitting close to you or stands really close to you (even when you move) then it's obvious. A potential romantic partner that's not a good friend will not try to get close to you if they're not keen. Beware that it's not out of practical reasons though like the only place to sit is next to you on the couch. 

It's a whole thing. Don't worry though. Take other people's feeling into account and you're fine. Sexually assaulting someone while you're being a considerate person is actually rather difficult to do. 

And it gets so much better with practice and age. 25 year old me is just fine with it (well, kinda). 18 year old me? Lmao. 

>I guess I should have specified, I am afraid of hook up sex.

Well that's fine. You don't have to have hook up sex. It's a ton of fun though, so if I were you I would find out why you're afraid (are you insecure? Well that's a reason you should try and tackle) and see if you find that reasonable and want to deal with those fears. 

It's like being afraid of swimming. Well if you're landlocked and you just never liked swimming and no one near you ever goes swimming then that's kinda ok. However, swimming is a lot of fun, people do it, etc. So if you want to join in on the fun then it's time to tackle that fear."
5769,"This guy summed it up pretty well. I’m exactly like you, I’m not necessarily insecure about the size of my guy down there but like I’m just insecure about life and anxious in general on how I perform even though I’m like completely fine. It’s all in my brain. Like he said, finding someone you’re comfortable works heaps since you forget all that nervousness and are just able to be yourself and get into that mood. Porn and society really make things worse for guys like us because it makes it seem like everyone is just a sex machine that can get a boner on demand and hook up with any girl that looks at them. This isn’t the case with a lot of dudes but it is well hidden."
5770,I'm the same way
5771,"Im the same bro, thought it was just me that this happens to, glad someone else is going through the same thing"
5772,"Hey, it’s ok. Don’t be anxious about ir. Sex is just like any other bodily function, you just happen to do it with someone else.

You will get there eventually, just let it flow naturally and if your partner is understanding explain to them that you are nervous. These things tend to happen, and are more common than you think."
5773,Just like peeing with someone else... or having a pee sex fetish.
5774,First time?
5775,"Don’t force it. Don’t regret not being ready. 

If you force it, you might actually create a situation you regret. And that can make your overall view of sex tougher than it currently is. 

When you are ready, you won’t have to force it, and the experience will naturally be more positive."
5776,"I’ve never even asked anyone out, it that provides any consolation"
5777,"fucking hell you hit the nail on the head, could I have an f as well"
5778,I meant to de-glorify sex as a whole. Most people get nervous because of this whole stigma of sex being a huge deal.

Enjoy your last bit of being a kid, cause growing up sucks"
5802,Thank you! I appreciate it my friend.
5803,To each their own I guess
5804,I can relate. Did you voluntarily join or is there conscription in your country?
5805,"Well being a teen you have more free time, less responsibility, and you see all your friends literally every day at school

Now being a (young) adult, it's rare I see my friends more than twice a week, I have a much stronger routine now where I dont have as much free time, and I cant skip school or anything like I used to. If I skipped work it means I'm not getting paid and risk being fired.

Having money is lit though. So theres ups and downs to both"
5806,"Idk man I hated being a teen. As an adult you have more say in *everything*, you live your life how you want to live it. I'd take going to work over school any day, I absolutely love working. I live with one of my best friends, me and 10 of my friends just celebrated Thanksgiving together where I got to cook a bunch of the meal.

I never skipped school or anything like that so can't comment on it but was most definitely on a much suckier routine/schedule than I am now. I find it hard to find anything I liked more as a teen tbh. I love the freedom I have now."
5807,"I joined the Army out of Highschool. Definitely DEFINITELY make sure you check your contract, take full advantage of your schooling and financial benefits. You have a LOT more benefits than what's told to you once you're in, whatever component or branch you're in."

5810,I joined the military right out of high school. It’s a weird feeling and only gets weirder the closer you get to actually leaving. Make sure to spend as much time with your family as possible. I thought I wouldn’t miss them as much as I currently do but with being clear on the opposite side of the country I don’t really get to see them that often. Just enjoy the time you have with them and enjoy your time left in HS.

5813,Good luck boot military is gonna be gay just embrace it. Don’t be a bitch and if your sensitive stay the fuck out of the military. Otherwise just roll with the punches. you’ll be away from home a lot so you’re gonna get homesick. if you need a coping mechanism a lots of the guys will smoke or dip.

5815,i was scared then. don't be. life is to short not to be happy

5817,Ah nice. Have u decided what branch? (I don't know too much about the military so sorry if some questions sound stupid)
5818,What branch and job are you looking into?
5819,Yeah it’s the same for me. In school I knew nearly everyone in my year group by name Atleast and some of the other years too. But I can say I know about 10 peoples names at uni and only speak to about 3 or 4. Unless we’re talking about uni on the course group chat. Kinda miss knowing everyone ngl. Everyone just sticks to their own little group and don’t interact with other groups.
5820,"I don’t think my school was that big? I was the graduating class of 2017 but my class felt very small. I think it just has to do with the fact that most of us all knew each other since we were kids. We don’t have many schools in my town so you were always bound to know and see the same people over and over again. I also think it just has to do with the fact that we were our high school staff’s favorite class, we had the most spirit and we never had drama. Even for the introvert like me, I didn’t have a problem talking to the people in my school or not feeling accepted. 😅"
5821,"Lol, I literally did not do shit in high school. There were like 5 people who actually knew I existed. In college now and I can say that number has increased."
5822,"I personally didn't feel this at all. How big was your high school? I moved to my high school in 10th grade, and my graduating class was 290. I think part of it was just being kind of antisocial, but I only ever felt community with people in extracurriculars I was involved with."

5853,My parents have been helicopter parents ever since I graduated college and moved back in with them
5854,Don't feel bad. A lot of people are living at home longer and longer these days. People just can't afford to move out. And in many cultures it's completely normal to live with parents until marriage. So you're definitely not the only one. No need to compare yourself to your friends if you're not there yet!
5855,"Why would you be wrong for this? This is YOUR decision, not your 'friend' who literally has no reason to be angry with you for this. If you're not comfortable with a relationship with someone for an age gap, that's normal and completely fine. Please do not let people pressure you into thinking you have to give in and be with someone if you don't want to. Not to mention age gap aside him wanting a serious relationship and you not could be enough to cause some issues. I don't think you are selfish at all. If anything, it's not cool that your friend is getting mad at you and making you feel this way, and if I were you I'd stand up for yourself and call them out on it."
5856,"If you're not comfortable dating someone for any reason, that's your prerogative. I wouldn't judge a 26 year old for dating a 20 year old, or vice versa, though. Once you're 20+ it's not really that unusual to have larger age gaps in relationships. In the gay community (of which I'm part), people generally don't even bat an eye at 20-30+ year age gaps between consenting adults."
5857,"My parents have a 6 year age gap and have been married for a few months short of 30 years now. With that being said I definitely feel you on that and no one should be forcing you to do something you aren’t comfortable with.

Also not looking for sex, I’m looking for love."
5860,"you're too young for him.
it's not about the numbers its about life experience creating an uneven power balance. a 26 year old should not be trying to date a 20 year old."
5861,"I feel the same way with my almost 22 year old friend who is dating a 17 year old. I can’t say anything about it since it’s their choice, but it’s weird to me and honestly borderline creepy."
5862,"I see it more like different priorities than age gap issue. He wants stability, and you want to have fun. Both is cool, you just don't fit together (at this point in life).

And your friends should focus more on their own relationships. It's your problem if and why you want/don't want to date someone."
5863,My friend is 21 in a few days and she’s dating a 28 year old. I find it super weird. My mum on the other hand is 47 and is dating a 29 year old. I’m normal and dating a 22 and 20
5864,Omg that’s so creepy
5865,"Oh no, I never said it was. What age do you think I’ll be more developed? I’m still immature in some ways"
5866,"That’s not borderline it’s just creepy. Like, he could be out of college and she’s still in school. Weird asf."
5867,Sad I asked you a question I should be asking myself lol
5868,"3 years or less is comfortable, 5 is a real stretch unless you're in your 30's imo lol"
5869,Half my age +7 is my rule
5870,"Definitely not! I'm also 20 and tbh I wouldn't feel comfortable dating someone in their mid-20s either because we're in different stages of our lives and therefore have different priorities. Even if you were the same age and refused to date hin, your friend still shouldn't be mad about it."
5871,Someone could be a year older than you and if you still dont feel comfortable with that the decision is up to you. Dont let anyone guilt trip you for having preferences or guilt trip you into a relationship that you dont want.
5872,"I don't give a shit ab age gaps and idk y others do. whoooo careeeess. 

The fact that ur friends feel the right to b upset w u over who u choose to or not to date makes them seem like really bad friends"
5873,I agree with this 100%

Im glad you didn't fold!"
5876,"As long as its two consenting adults and there wasn't some weird grooming crap going on beforehand, age gaps are fine.

But it's absolutely fine to not want to date someone six years older than you. Think about it, they turned 18 when you turned 12. That's TERRIFYING to think about.

Also screw anyone who tried to guilt you into that. Its your life."

Don't rush or stress over this. 🤠🧡"
5881,"you’re not wrong. some people are fine with age gaps like that and some people aren’t. my friends wanted to set me up with a 26 year old last year when i was 20 and even though he didn’t really act 26 a 6 year age difference just felt weird for me, especially because i definitely act a little younger than my age"
5882,"I'm sorry, but what kind of friend gets mad at you for making your own relationship decisions? You are an adult who can make their own personal choices, without being guilted for making them.

You are in the right here. You are not selfish in any way for looking after yourself and your autonomy. No one has the right to be in a relationship with you without your full and enthusiastic consent.

5898,"I mean.... I know you’re being funny, but... They do have the “old”flair for a reason... Plus my brain is weird and was really really uncomfortable with me leaving it, so I’m sticking around.

5899,"I stayed cause change is really hard for mentally due to trauma in my childhood, so the fact that I’ve been decently active on there since I joined reddit over a year ago makes me really uncomfortable letting it go. Plus, it’s nice to feel like I can help someone who’s going through similar shit to what I went through at their age.

But, some people are butthurt by the fact that some of us older people want to stick around, whether to vent to those who we’re still pretty similar to mentally or to help others out. The other day I posted about a panic attack I had due to losing something and how I was upset with myself for freaking out about it, and when I mentioned at the end that I was 20, some people commented saying I wasn’t supposed to be there cause I wasn’t a teenager. Some of them can be really annoying(like the people who were saying I wasn’t allowed there even though it’s only been two months since I turned 20), but most of them are really nice and sweet and just want help getting through life."
5900,yea but why would you
5901,"that's understandable, it's cool that you're connected to it. don't blame you for not wanting to leave. 

in my case, I didn't like being there even when I was a young teen, so that was the meaning behind my comment"

5909,"I'm 23 with braces and people think it's ""so cute"" and they make me look younger."
5910,">i definitely don’t want braces now lmao

I'm probably being dense, but then why don't you just not get braces? Will you need to get some pulled if you don't get braces? I know that can happen, but I was under the impression that that's pretty damn rare. 

My teeth aren't great, but I'm just like nope. I prefer white teeth to straight teeth, and I'm in direct control of the color of my teeth."
5911,"damn.. I never wore my retainer after I got them off two years ago, maybe i should get a new retainer that fits properly?"
5912,i’ve looked into it but honestly i really don’t think i have the self discipline for invisalign lol. if i decided to straighten my teeth that’s probably what i’d do though since i like the idea of being able to take it off for pictures and stuff

5916,"Got my braces on in 7th, got them off halfway through 8th. I'm in my second year of college and havent missed a day yet. 9pm every night like clockwork."
5917,that might be a good idea
5918,My teeth have moved back too and I kinda hate it but not enough to go through the stress of braces again
5919,"i highly recommend getting permanent retainers that fit on the back of your teeth. i had invisalign retainers for a few months and they were a pain in the ass. i had the discipline to wear them, they're just extremely fragile."
5920,"So, I had about 5 years worth of wire braces, plus 2 years of headgear and now I wear a retainer only for the night. When you get so much moving done in your mouth your teeth will shift, but for some it doesn't 🤷"
5921,"I lost my retainer almost immediately after getting my braces off, and by the time I found it the fit was already off. However they cemented a permanent retainer (basically a tiny chain) behind my two front teeth to keep them together so they aren't going anywhere in the near future."
5922,Did you stop wearing your retainer recently? I've had mine since I was like 14 or 15 and am now 23.
5923,lol this post feels like you're spying on me or something because lately I've been wearing mine waay less.
5924,"No, I stopped wearing it a few months after I got it. The shifting was so gradual that I didn't notice until recently."
5925,"Ideally that's what I'm going to go for (not Invisalign specifically but a different, more affordable brand of aligners.) Not everyone can get it though so fingers crossed."
5926,it isn’t that noticeable but they kind of get worse over time so if they got super bad i might want to do something about it. but yeah if they don’t get that bad i probably will just leave it since they aren’t that crooked. i just hate how they look sometimes
5927,I need to go back to an orthodontist because of the wear n tear of my retainers. Do you think they'll be able to put you through the same braces treatment again though? The reason younger people are given braces is because that's when their teeth are developing.
5928,"Before I got braces i actually had my upper jaw expanded because there wasn't enough space in my mouth. They wouldn't be able to do that again because my skull is fully formed now, but the straightening of the teeth themselves can be done at any age."

Most careers only care if you have a degree though so I might complete it just so I have schooling under my belt!

5934,"Man I'm really sorry... Just last friday I had a very sudden, what the doctor believed, epilepsy attack myself, never had one before in my life. I'm studying musical theater at the moment, and I'm very scared  it was stress related and I'm scared that if it happens again the doctor will tell me I shouldn't be striving for this profession. It's not like I'm forbidden to if it turns out I suddenly have it (it has only happened once so far and might never happen again) cause I don't think people with it aren't allowed to do this, and there is probably ways to work around it too. But I'm still scared...
I really hope you found something else to do and strive for, an epilepsy attack when you've never had one before is scary af."
5935,"I’m so sorry you went through that. They can be scary and I hope you have someone that can help you through this! If you have any questions about seizures you’re more than welcome to pm me and ask :)


I’m not a neurologist or anything but speaking from my own experience, stress has been a huge factor for my seizures. BUT, I think it’s because when I’m stressed out I take care of myself a lot less. I forget to eat, I forget to drink water, and I definitely don’t sleep like at all lol. I have no idea what factors went into your attack, but taking extra care of yourself is really preventive for things like this. Other shit like overstimulation (lots of sounds especially), nicotine, and excessive drinking trigger tf out of me too. 


Honestly I think you should still go for musical theater if you really do love it. You’re young and this is a crucial time in your life so I think *anything* will be stressful right now. You might as well be doing what you love! The only way I could see it directly affecting your schooling is that after your second seizure you’re not allowed to drive for a while, but there’s ways around that too (walking, ubers, etc). Hell, I’m a stranger on the internet and I’d be more than happy to venmo you so you can make it to class lol. 


Try to do little things to help yourself if you can! Write down the things you typically do when you’re stressed, whether it’s not sleeping or overworking yourself or whatever it may be. Being aware of things like that will help you pinpoint your triggers if you do have another seizure, and I think it helps manage stress a lil easier. Like I said, almost any career is possible with epilepsy and there are lots of ways to make it work. I just happened to pick one of the only jobs that won’t allow it lol. 


Also, sometimes seizures really do happen once and never again. The word epilepsy sounds scary, but you’re really just considered epileptic when you have two or more seizures. Yours was probably just a fluke so please don’t worry too much. And if it happens again, it doesn’t mean you’ll have to stop doing what you love! ❤️


I’m hungover as fuck and I hope this helps a bit and makes sense lmao!"
5936,"This is honestly probably the sweetest reply I've gotten here on reddit, thank you for the kind encouraging words :') my boyfriend was there when it happened, he was super freaked out and is probably more traumatized by it then me.. But now afterwards he's checked out this doctor site (It's a site of a tel.nr you can call here in Sweden if you need medical advice) so he knows what he should do if it happens again. Hopefully it was just a one time thing, the doctor said himself it's very possible it could be just that. But he's still ordered a post check - up (which I Will have to wait a bit longer for then usual, because, Corona) and I've gotten a temporary ban from driving, but I live on the schoolgrounds so getting to school won't be an issue!
And just a few days after i got back from the hospital I found out I was accepted into a second year in the musical theater programme (sadly, not everyone in my class was accepted) so I definately won't let this stop me!
And again, I really hope you manage to find something else you want to have as a future career! And thanks again for your kind words, it really helped my anxiety over this, at least for a little bit :'))
And I hope you could understand all this, like I mentioned, I'm a Swede so English isn't exactly my native language lol"

5938,"Well the hot topic lady I asked claimed to be the manager, found out she wasn't so I spoke to the actual one and she said the positions were full. I do have a resume of 2 previous jobs with references. I asked them how they got their jobs and they said they spoke to employees also. I will try to find a manager lol thank you!"
5939,"Aaaaah, that might be it. They might be wondering what the hell happened in those 2 years. And between a CV with complete information and one missing it, they will choose the complete one. 

There's a lot of good sources about how to do a good CV. 1 page long, your name and contact informations, your qualities/abilities, your schooling info, your work/volunteering info and to finish your hobbies. You also need to add a cover/motivational letter. By doing that, you're showing how serious you're about the job! Where I am from (Canada), it is normal to bring a cover letter with your resume. Maybe not for McDonalds, but for other jobs like retail."
5940,"Just keep at it I'm afraid. Also make sure your appearance is smart. If you're wearing a hoodie and joggers nobody's gonna want to hire you. Try wearing a nice shirt or blouse and look a little formal

Also be pleasant. If you ask them with a frown on your face like you're not really interested they're probs gonna throw your resume in the trash. Look enthusiastic and smile as if you're really looking forward to working there"

And don't stop with one time in person meeting. Call them, email them, or visit them again.

5946,I don't mean to offend... but are you on the larger side?
5947,"Aah, if your CV only consisted of your previous jobs, then that was the reason for sure. Check the CV of your sister and your friend! They may be close to what I described you. You can always check the internet for more concrete examples! I'm glad I could help you"
5948,"I'll try to do exactly all those points, thank you! Most places just ask previous work and that was that but I'll include way more. I'll consider a cover letter too if it makes me stand out more this time."
5949,"Yea, people have a tendency to hire good looking people before others that arent. Even if the CV of the good looking person isnt as impressive as the other."
5950,"Wow idk why I'm being downvoted, it could seriously because of this reason...."
5951,"What does your resume look like? It’s crucial to list what you can do for a Company than what you did. 

For example, just don’t reiterate your former job descriptions, companies want to know how you’ve impacted other companies and how you can help them."
5952,Actually that sounds super helpful. I'm typing up a cover letter right now also and I plan on handing them out in person today. Thank you!
5953,"Hm. Maybe you need to buff up your CV  bit then. Idk what it looks like, but make sure you list what qualities and skills you gained from those jobs/hobbies etc and why they're important. 

As for application forms, it's a hit or miss lol. 

Good luck!"
5954,"Yes actually I'm going to take this advice to the top. I was too worried looking desperate and needy cuz I thought that would make me look like a bad candidate. I'm doing a second, and some third time going back in and speaking to the top this time. Thank you!"

5956,"> online

This is your issue. The best advice I have ever got when job hunting is: get your best resume and go to Walmart n get those pack of like 20 duotang things, or even little folders. Put a resume in each one and as you are going to hand them out, *in person*, quickly write the name of the company and your first and last name on the front of the folder. This makes it look like you have specifically set up a folder *just* for that company. Bonus points for a cover letter."

Also check out your CV Make Sure it’s up-to-date and formatted correctly. Also I hate to say this but how you act or ask something Can affect how people respond.  Having a nice confident attitude can really help when applying for jobs

It sucks that I might have to start my first semester over there with partial online classes. It really takes away from the experience.

Nonetheless, while I feel your concerns, it’s probably a temporary situation and I can’t imagine it lasting much longer. I feel like this is a really great opportunity to bond and grow in a way too. My girl and I have never been in such a good place since we’re living together, my folks have been reaching out to me more often, we host friends for a few days at a time if they need it, we keep ourselves busy. Having a home gym keeps me busy, and I have plenty of things to keep myself productive with. 

In a way, it’s great to recharge. Equally, I hate not being able to go out, especially since I’m back in Texas and want to enjoy my time here. Here’s to hoping this ends soon."

I think it's not a wild assumption to make that you can party harder in your twenties than in your thirties. Early adult years are for most people the years where you go out the most, meet the most people and discover the world as an adult.

5998,"Yeah, especially since I was finally starting to recover from depression and talk to people and actually enjoy college"

Had the pandemic happened in 5 years time when I will hopefully, touch wood, be working a boring graduate job (and now even this seems potentially unlikely due to coronavirus) I can imagine I'd have been absolutely thrilled to bits with a welcome break from the monotony of my day-to-day existence.

Who I feel even more sorry for though is the year group below me who have the stress of not having their school results dictated by exams and will most likely be deprived of a traditional freshers' week (first week of uni in the UK).

What were you meaning to say? Because here in the Netherlands for example the landlord fucking definitely can't just waltz right in. Privacy is actually part of some EU Human Rights charter.

They have to knock or ring the doorbell and ask for your permission. I think it's only possibly if there is a actual dire need for an inspection (so not just a once in every six months casual inspection), and even then it's iffy and they can't do it without making an actual appointment with you.

I would find out your local laws and send the landlord a letter that you want him to refrain from doing so.  It will give you something to point at next time it happens, because next time you could just go to the police. It is rather illegal here. 

You could also consider changing your locks. Do look at your rental agreement, as some agreements state that the landlord should have a working key."
6007,"When the landlord was showing me around my old place, he literally walked in on two seperate people sleeping, and continued to show us the apartment around them for a bit. He always knocked but I thought it was weird. 

Luckily some guys signed on the unit I was in really early so we didn't get any of that."
6008,You’d be surprised
6009,"Reminded me of Consuela from family guy, no, you need towels, nooooo, I will get you towels"
6010,Not creepy at all
6011,"Sorry for the confusing text in the original post. It was typed just after waking up.

Wht happened was they put a letter on the *floor* outside our front door. We actually stepped in it on the way out of the house. They had said they would be coming by ""at some point between 10am and 10pm in the following 2 days. The very next day after we had spent all day cleaning the house, we were sleeping at around 9am ish, and they unlocked the door, and knocked *once* AS they opened the door. And just walked around. I opened our bedroom door to see who the fuck just broke into our house, he walked down the little hallway and basically came into our bedroom, where my topless half asleep and very terrified gf was sitting, LOOKED INTO OUR BEDROOM AT HER and then started talking to me, asking me why I have an ethernet cable tapped along the edge of the wall running into the room where my ps4 is. I *wish* I had the clear headedness to freak out at this guy for creeping on my gf and violating our privacy but all I did was confusingly tell him it's for my system and told them to leave. I also tried to then contact our downstairs neighbour on facebook to let them know what was coming, but they informed me that they werent home. 

Now keep in mind the last few days I've been trying to figure out what to do about this, I've also got other stupid crap on myplate to deal with, BUT in my lease agreement they are ONLY allowed in like that in an emergency. This was CLEARLY NOT ONE. 

My gfs family said to call the police, my family said to look up my renters rights, I want to deal with this because this isnt the first scummy thing these 2 people have done in the 3 weeks they've been working here"
6012,"Wow yeah that sounds scummy and likely illegal. As I said, best to send them a letter to make sure you never want that again!

Yes, you can get the police involved, but that is not going to improve your relations. Best to hope you can just discourage them from doing this to you again."
6013,King 🔥💦💦
6014,You deserve the happiness bruv. Celebrate yourself and praise God
6015,Kinda wanna say congrats but those emotes are really distracting
6016,"Not to be a buzzkill, and you may already be doing this, but for those who might be in a similar position and are not already doing this and should start. When you get a big raise like this you might be tempted to start spending money on what is probably considered wasteful by most. It’s a good idea to allocate a healthy % of your new monthly income into diverse investment accounts such as a roth ira[roth ira](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp), ~3months total expenditure emergency cash fund[emergency fund](https://www.wellsfargo.com/financial-education/basic-finances/manage-money/cashflow-savings/emergencies), college 529 plan account[college 529 plan](https://www.fidelity.com/529-plans/what-is-a-529-plan), paying down any high interest debt[how to pay down debt](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/personal-finance/how-to-pay-off-debt), saving for a house down payment[Saving for DwnPymt](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/saving-for-a-down-payment/), and etc.

It could even be a good idea to start looking into life insurance now while you’re young and it’s cheap, considering you’re a parent. Even if you decide against the life insurance policy, most companies will offer to pay for the extensive blood work required for the policy. So you can get a rather in-depth health check up for free!

And if you decide against the college 529 plan for yourself it’s probably a good idea to open one for your child. The 529 plan is a college savings investing account that offers no tax on gains made in the market. Funds can be withdrawn whenever at no penalty for qualified education expenses(laptop, food, tuition…). 

sorry for any formatting issues, on mobile, idk how link txt here, oops. also i’m bad at grammar so if there’s too many commas, too bad.

I am not a professional or anything, as u may or may not be able to tell, so take everything i said here as just some friendly, non-legally binding, advice and please don’t sue me, thanks for reading if anyone even does.

[Edit] Congrats on the raise🎉 almost forgot lol"
6017,"Thats awesome man, real glad for you 🗿"
6018,Congratulations man 🥳🥳🥳
6019,25 cents actually ;)
6020,Definitely gonna start! Thank you!
6021,"The young kids would call this a ""poggers moment"""
6022,Congrats man! Your child has a great man as their father!
6023,Yes entirely this
6024,"I don't think this is asking ""permission"". You are asking for assistance to get get somewhere. You are an adult so you should be able to make the decision yourself and be uncontested as long as you fulfillled any other known obligations that would occur in your absence.

Just ask them for a ride. Don't think too much about it. I don't know your parents or any other cultural variables that might get in the way, but if they are nice people, they should say yes anyway if they aren't busy.

If you have access to it, you could always call a service like Uber to drive you there. It's pretty inexpensive for short trips."
6025,Why do you need to ask for permission?
6026,"In the years before I turned 18, I already prepared my parents that soon they won't be able to decide what I can/cannot do anymore. I did stress however that I'd still listen to their opinions/advice, while stating that I'd be free to discard them if I wouldn't agree. My main idea was, if they want to stop me, I wish them good luck.

So when I turned 18, I announced to them that I was going to make my first ever solo trip abroad for two weeks. Their jaws dropped, but they weren't too surprised even, because I ""warned"" them in the last few years. My mother was even kind enough to drive me to the airport. I really enjoyed the trip, shared photos with my family, came back alive and ever since they fully trust me in making my own choices in life. I'm 20 now.

It's definitely hard to bring something like this up, but I believe it's rewarding in the end. I wouldn't even call it asking for permission. You don't even strictly need any legally speaking, as you're an adult. Don't start with ""May I do this?"" but rather ""I'm going to do this!"". Then ask for a ride to the bus stop and be honest about your plans. Honesty is key. Just keep them up to date and tell them where you'll be heading. Especially the first time when they might still be skeptical/overprotective and you need to gain their trust. They may not agree, but respectfully try to tell them that they cannot decide about such things for you anymore. And that even without their consent, you'll find a way to the bus stop. Good luck!"
6027,Just say mind if you give me a ride to the station. You're 19 they can't really say no unless they're busy
6028,"You could just lie and say you are meeting a female friend if its ""that"" kind of parents.

Or just dont ask permission, just tell them something but not quite like "" im doing this, will you help me or not? Im doing it regardless."""
6029,"love it 

i have to decorate my room and i have been putting it off for sooo long now"
6030,Looks great
6031,Beautiful! Currently in the process of redoing my room. String lights make such a noticeable difference to the atmosphere of a room at night.
6032,What the fuck please teach me this
6033,It makes me so happy that I have these string lights as well because I love rainbow colors as they’re really stimulating to me(I have sensory issues and the colors help soothe me). Highly recommend looking on Amazon or eBay for some cheap plug in ones to add a great atmosphere!
6034,"Yeah! I’ve had it since I was a kid when the night light pillows were a thing. I have an irrational fear of the dark, so my mom got two of that one(I think the other one is in my closet atm) to help me sleep without my tv. Unfortunately, it takes a very long time for me to fall asleep, so the pillows didn’t work nearly as well as they were supposed to, but I still love them."
6035,Thank you! It took my about 3-4 hours to complete but I’m so happy with it!
6036,Wow that's so cool sadly I share rooms witu my brother and he hates that stuff. I WANT THAT THO FUCKKK
6037,[deleted]
6038,I’ve been wanting to try someone thing similar in my room but I’m just worried that the lights would end up hurting my eyes after spending time locked in my room. Looks really cool though
6039,"Holy aesthetic, that looks cool!"
6040,I can promise you it’s worth it!
6041,Thank youuuu! Took me about 3-4 hours to complete but I love it so much!
6042,"I got literally everything off of Amazon. Two sets of LED waterfall string lights, a set of warm white string lights(the kind that don’t get hot cause I’m not destroying that canvas picture), and cheap set of LED strip lights. Plus a good amount of command hooks."
6043,"Mine didn’t hurt my eyes, but I suppose it’s all dependent on the person not necessarily on the products"
6044,"Well, hopefully when you get your own place you’ll have the ability to have that kind of creative freedom"
6045,It’s a salute lol
6046,[deleted]
6047,Yeah. I was 20 when the pandemic started and in 7 months ill be 23. it's wild.
6048,"Studies have shown that time ""feels faster"" if you have less novel experiences or memories, I think this has been exacerbated by covid because everything has been closed down so wr cant do anything new or fun! Once this whole charade ends and we go back to normal, time will feel normal again."
6049,Sounds like you’ve made off well in your old age
6050,"I feel you. I was really sick from 14-19 and felt elderly, which really messed with my mental/emotional understanding of “aging into adulthood”. Told myself that I was finally going to let myself be a kid and take back those last couple of years so I could catch back up to reality. Then I had sexual assault/abuse induced PTSD that swallowed me at 19. Pandemic started when I was 20, and now I’m 22. Let’s just say the adjustment disorder I had has compounded, and it sucks. It’s embarrassing to admit but it’s true."
6051,I feel the exact same way man...
6052,I was 17 just getting out of Highschool and my whole world felt like it was ending now I’m 19 working a job just trying to move on through the shit storms I agree 100% though
6053,By that time most of us will be old hags deprived of youthful experiences
6054,"Dude I left my country to study law in the UK. I spent the first year all depressed and homesick in a 300 year old tiny accommodation. The 2nd year was spent stuck indoors because the town flooded after like 50 years, and the pandemic hit before the start of my 3rd year and final year. 

I am really having a hard time comprehending how fast these past few years have gone and how I couldn’t get a chance to travel while I was away from my home for the first time. 

My undergrad years really flew by in a blink of an eye and now I wonder whether this is what adulthood is gonna be till the end."
6055,I was 19 when it started and now I'm about to turn 21 this year was terrifyingly quick
6056,"Yup, I was 19 just turning 20 now 22 and it feels weird to say that still

Sucks not getting a 21st birthday as well as least in my family that was the big special one."
6057,I have almost the same age as you and I feel almost the same way as you.
6058,It’s wild. I started at 24 and I’m going to be 26 next year. I was lucky to have graduated in the summer of 2019 in college because if not it would have been rough. I salute to those who didn’t have a graduation. It’s very much scary. I sacrificed my social life in my teens to do it in my 20s and now... derp
6059,"I wasted my years literally "" it was all yellow"" from i moved to nanas and the first years i literally neet memes and games was my life and tbh i was fucking happy. but it was all an illusiion a very sick slow growing one each day passing of my fake illusion of happiness. i shouldve went to college something... fuck im gonna turn 23 january. I guess what snapped me out of it was my nanas old husband died and had to move into his trailer and also i neglected my oral health badly and now i got cavitites and some gum recesiion but no i dont think it s full on periodontits level 3 or 4 i think its early or mild. so i can treat it no teeth are loose but only one thats broken cause a cavity even then it barreeeeeeeely moves like at all or maybe it dont and im anxiety ridden. tbh. ive been seeing myself wishing for another lockdown and thats a very bad mindset. its just me wanting less stress again cause of the eiphany i had. plus my mom and aunt had to move in for a bit mom got mad at nana and left cause she was still dealing with connections to her past abuser and my aunty actually got a trailer up above us we helped her move in and stuff.i should have done something anything like a part time job something the older i get the more HOLY FF even though it was fun times literally never getting those times back and was living in ignorant bliss. fun while it lasted. always had social anxiety. but recently the depression kicking my fucking ass into the ground over and over me trying to formulate a plan and how am i gonna turn my life into something reasonably good im numb af most of the time but i get hope sometimes looking up remote 3d modeling jobs ive got 2 years experience in that. i kinda fd around trying music then i did 3d modeling and still am. most dont require a degree it just needs skill which i do have some skills in it maybe its the depression. 

My shorttime plans.

Sort out my mouth health needs polishing and scraping of tartar. Get worst cavities filled or as much as we can afford.

learners permit and driving im gonna get my brother to help me learn. even though the practical use is good i just think i will feel so much fucking better that i actually have liscense. same goes for my teeth then its really just mental which i can cope with as long as i got my immedite family with me cheering me along. i can game again without feeling guilt ive starved myself brushing twice a day mouthwash when its too mucky in there flossing the teeth that can be smile zone is alright in all respects just nasty tartar but not cracked just thin along gumline. a really bad tooth thats got a crack on one little side of the molar at the gumline hoping worst comes to worst a crown ill even put a metal one on it.

i gained weight from crazy snacking 6'4 245 at 18 i could wear slim larges  in hs now 6'4 290-300 double xl shirts 38 waist but i say 290 cause ive been on this diet thing for more then a month.  cause tbh my old home never was snacks for me just school breakfast and lunch then dinner go to bed repeat. now im on one a day diet i dont even snack at night ive only had a 12 inch steak and cheese sub today and water all day i quit soda as well. cause my teeth too. 

im hoping i can turn my life around for the better this year. no more being lazy as fuck about myself impeccable oral hygeine dont let mental shit cloud my head and brush and shave talk to ppl lose weight get buff as fuck. cause really unless i had the courage to commit suicide which i really dont right now. 

idk why but will smiths "" best shape of my life"" inspired me on youtube and he was working out good and stuff but the mental got too him just he was supprressing alot and it just made me feel relatable a celebrity ive watched since i was little hes got really bad problems too. and hes positive too i sometimes watch his other videos i really like the guy. i immediatly kinda felt better? or more relaxed when i click on youbg adult subreddit to find the cover art smiling thing sitting in the chair but behind or inside horrible fucking existential tearing at my very being and screaming crying while trying to look normal and ok outside. relatable i guess"
6060,26yo grandpa??? How
6061,"Lol, not literally 😂🤣"
6062,"I get not wanting to grow up, but if you're 23 and still haven't yet you gotta find a path that gets you there. Psychedelics helped me immensely at right at 22 to stop feeling like a teenager, but idk how sane it is of me to suggest that lol so I'll just mention it. Watch Peter Pan cause the whole message is about growing up (this I also watched on acid). Btw this was during the pandemic in 2020 that I had those experiences.

Since you're already at college I guess just try and meet new people and get out. If you're vaccinated and are using hand sanitizer you'll be safe and keep others safe."
6063,Bro I was meant to go to America last year for studying cause I wanted to get that experience (Australian uni/colleges kinda bland lol) but didn’t get to! But I still got extra 2 years to go cause I might take up honours. You can always take up a post degree with whatever degree you doing if you wanna further excel your degree and I guess in a way you still get to be at campus. Or you can always take a semester off or so and take up some short courses that could benefit in the time I’m 22 btw ! But I get you cause covid really stole our 20s and part of out youth which sucks. I was literally freshly 21 when covid started now I’m half way into 22 wtf 😭
6064,"I definitely feel this deeply.  Every time I think about how much I am missing out, and continue to miss out on in college, due to this fucked up situation it gets me so angry.  People tell me to just reconcile that that's how it is and move on but it's feels do goddamn hard to move on.  The only thing that keeps me sane is to look forward instead of back and try really hard not to think about it."
6065,"We all lost a year of our lives. Losing a year in the 20s stings extra hard. Honestly best thing to do is recognize the loss, and try to work toward what you want to still experience. You're not done with your 20s till you turn 30."
6066,"Yep, my university experience has been fucking ruined."
6067,"Awe guys, I keep seeing posts like this and it breaks my heart truly because I know exactly where you’re at. It’s a weird transition into adulthood that adults didn’t prepare us for. It’s not their fault nor is it anybody’s, but I think if you keep looking for the answers, you’ll eventually find them. Not to be corny or anything. Our age group is separated more than ever and it sucks. If this sub would want to make a massive group chat on telegram for us young Adults, I’d be down to make it!"
6068,"I’m about to be a junior, thank god i still have time"
6069,"It's so awful. I got a year left but as a Super Senior. I hope I can enjoy this past year but most of my original friends have left by now and now I'll be a bit older than many of the students there (23, will be 24 then). I dont feel like I have nearly the experience I would be expected to have at my age though, and now it feels like COVID truly is still not going away. We got people yelling about how the vaccines will kill everyone, and you got people yelling at anyone who simply asks any question about COVID, or even shaming you for saying one word about how dissapointing everything is."
6070,"This is like reading my life story (I'm not trying to undermine you btw, just trying to relate). My whole family including me got infected by covid, and my mother is in the hospital right now. I'm worried because I don't know what will happen to us especially to Mom, and I'm sad that I haven't seen my friends and my boyfriend for more than a year. I'm also scared of the future because I don't feel like I'm ready to have a job, or if I will get a job during this pandemic for that matter. I just wish this is over soon."
6071,"Yeah I graduated early, so my 3 years became 1.5 years. Really sucked."
6072,I haven't even started college yet I feel so behind but oh well nobody in my family has ever gone I plan on being the first I turn 21 in December by the time I do go I'll probably feel so old compared to the 18 year olds.
6073,"Saaame I’ve been thinking about it lately, I was starting my second year of college when quarantine started and now I’m almost on my forth and haven’t done almost anything fun (I don’t have many friends in the university so I guess it wouldn’t be a lot different but still) 

On the other hand it would take me like 3 hours to go to the campus, just for one class sometimes, so I’m on an internal battle there lol"
6074,"If it makes you feel any better, I lost the second half of my senior year and I'll never get to walk at graduation after 4 years.

Just remember that after graduation, your life is now what you make of it. There are no more rails to follow(unless you go to grad school). Remember why you went to college in the first place and try to have the time of your life everyday.

Good luck! Enjoy the college you have left, I'm sure everyone else will be itching for that too."
6075,"IN MY OPINION: Nothing of value was lost. College was the most shit time in my life. Maybe it's different if you come from a wealthy family or live in one of those places where you can just go and study and not have to worry about paying for it or anything while you do it, but life, for me, didn't start until after college, when I had disposable income from my career and tons of free time to actually do things other than write papers and study."
6076,I settled to change my major to an easier one because COVID made it so much harder for me to concentrate in school anymore. At least I am now close to graduating.
6077,"*Flair: ""17""*"
6078,[deleted]
6079,"I felt the same way. Now at 25 I’m not nearly as pessimistic as I used to be, but I still don’t really assume that I’m going to make it to age X the way a lot of people seem to. It’s hard to actually care about saving for retirement, for example, knowing that so many people I’ve known never even made it to retirement age."
6080,"hi. i relate to you 100%. i’m 23. my mindset JUST changed from that like a month ago, and i had the mindset you were describing my entire life as well. 

you’ll find your way (: 🖤"
6081,"Yeah, can relate. I'm transitioning ftm and looking younger than you are is like the quintessential trans guy experience. in the early days people often assumed I was like 13, now I just get ID'd when buying alcohol. But I knew what I was getting myself into lol"
6082,"I feel exactly the same , 21 tomorrow , ANOTHER UK lockdown because the gvt is stupid. Honestly don't know how I got this far 🤷"
6083,"As a kid, I always thought I would have died before hitting 20 so I never planned out my future. At 23, I'm still drifting around aimlessly so definitely find a purpose with your life before wasting away years like I did."
6084,Yeah I’m 20 and people say I look 16 or 17 I hate it. I just wanna look 20 lol.
6085,"I already turned it around! Somewhat. The lockdowns of 2020 threw me off course. But at 19 I finally figured out what was wrong, went to see a bunch of doctors about it and now I've got a new name, a new voice and most importantly no depression or suicidal thoughts. It's the hardest thing I've ever done but so far it's been very much worth it.

I think I just need to give myself time and set some new goals that aren't ""survive""."
6086,"Yeah, the restrictions suck. I was finally breaking out of my shell in 2019 - got a job, started working towards my transition, went out with people and all... And then covid came and I was left with my thoughts. 

I often joke that I'm 15 and 35 at the same time because on one hand I have no idea how to be an adult and I missed out on all the trial and error that people usually do in their teens, but on the other hand most people my age seem so youthful and carefree and I feel very disconnected from that."
6087,I love looking young. Try growing a beard if possible.
6088,"I feel kinda the same! I think also that the pandemic and everything has affected me a lot. Last year at this time I thought I was finally getting my shot together, I finally made friends at uni, had a job, money to travel....
Now I feel lost again, I don’t have a job anymore and I’m not even sure I want to work in the field I’m studying. I also struggled quite a bit as a teenager and I was also suicidal. My plan never went further than what I would do after uni and idk in many ways I still feel like I’m 16 lol"
6089,"I’m turning 21 in October and I also planned on not being alive for high school graduation so being an independent, self-sufficient adult with a “big-girl” job is definitely weird, to say the least. 

I hope you’re doing better now than you were. If you ever are struggling and need a friend, I’m always here"
6090,"I’m turning twenty in two months and are experiencing similar feelings, it’s in a mixture of lostless and thinking that everything is fake. That its one year less on this earth, and that is quite miserable to think about. However it is also one more year spent on this earth which is far more beautiful. Try thinking about the things you would like to do THIS YEAR instead of the age associated with it. I hope you have some better thoughts soon"
6091,"im also about to turn 21, also never expected to live till adulthood because of a couple suicide attempts, now im just trying to figure out my life the best i can. i still havent fully internalized the fact that im still alive and will be for a while"
6092,Happy birthday for tomorrow :)
6093,"I'm trying to, trust me. As I see it, my life really only started last year so I've got a lot of catching up to do - because while most spend their teens finding out and then building on who they are, how they like to interact with others and learning how the world works, I spent mine trying to survive and find out what the fuck was wrong with me so I missed out on most of that.

But I'm mostly optimistic about it. Maybe I'm not exactly where other people my age are but I still have time."
6094,"I'm doing a lot better, thank you. I was fortunate enough to have the kind of mental health issues that had a solution, so I transitioned and it's mostly good now. (It's not a cure all. I still can't force my brain to concentrate on things, I still have a mild case of emetophobia and I still have to undo years of psychological damage done by the state I used to be in... But I *want* to live and that alone was worth it.)"
6095,Found Carson
6096,That's a great attitude to have and that'll carry you a long way. I wish you all the best.
6097,Yeah I grow it out but can’t get a full beard. Tho I’d look weird with a beard anyway.
6098,Doesn't seem very confused to me.
6099,"> Ok nevermind you are confused dude

you must be mistaken, I'm dudeimconfused, Not confused-dude"
6100,OBS is great for this. If you have the skill to pull it off of course.
6101,This guy knows
6102,"I'm considering actually doing this damn 

Luckily I just make some bullshit about my internet being bad"
6103,how?
6104,Ok nevermind you are confused dude
6105,Ah my mistake. I must have confused you for someone else.
6106,Interesting note is that the librarian is a boomer lol and that's what makes it surprising
6107,BLACK PINK IN YOUR AREA
6108,just shush her loudly problem solved
6109,Hmm not too sure about that but the library has that song blasted quite audible lol (the please keep silent rule /s) XD
6110,Is that good or bad?
6111,"I nearly burst out laughing after hearing it tbh. To be precise it was ""Kill This Love"" that was blared."
6112,Agreed with it though! However my knowledge of Kpop is turd as well lol
6113,"Blackpink...  considering the music is played in the library that’s an Oof. 

Their music’s usually lively and loud, and far from mellow (except their song named Stay)"
6114,I keep hearing this almost everywhere lol XD
6115,"2NE1? That’s like Blackpink’s “older sisters” (they’re under the same agency)

They were super popular and one of their members is a super famous celebrity in my country (she still is active in my country’s media industry). I remember seeing them in person and the mall was so packed with people

I’m too addicted to K-pop that’s why I know them hahaha"
6116,You can go and calmly remind him [where he is](https://youtu.be/DHhy2Gk_xik).
6117,shush him then
6118,"It's a he, not a she lol"
6119,Cool... well a love of music is something that Transcends generations. My grandma listens to Bastille and Smashing Pumpkins ... so not all boomers are Dismissive Of newer music.... Sorry I don’t know more about Kpop... my knowledge pretty much ends with this... lol... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o
6120,K... cool....
6121,Thank you :) You too!
6122,ok
6123,"Thanks, it feels good hearing this! All the best to you"
6124,Oh man... I really needed to hear that!  Thanks!
6125,Ayyyyyy

6164,"Ref:

Young Adults Make Rational Sexual Decisions

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620925036"
6165,"I read the article (it's really short) and the rational decisions these young adults are making are about contracting STIs. Not even like how often they wear a condom or anything. Just would they have sex with someone who has a high chance of giving you an sti? 

From the article:
""The research involved presenting 257 participants with hypothetical “sexual gambles” in which a photo of a potential partner’s face was shown alongside an associated, though purely hypothetical, risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection""


Why do they sound so surprised that young adults are making these good decisions??"
6166,"Casual hook ups nah, relationships, forsure. 

Myself and everyone I know played it really safe when deciding if they should start dating someone. Maybe the fact that casual hook ups are more normal means not being in a relationship has more pros then before (compared to waiting till dating for the hanky panky)  

So if someone is going to give up their promiscuous life, it should be for someone pretty good. At least thats my half baked guess"
6167,"Yes, of course. Casual sex. As opposed to ranked sex."
6168,I don't get the implication *sex with romantic partner -> possible infection*. As if condoms don't exist. This study is absolutely useless.
6169,I can't cry anymore unless I listen to sad music while intensely concentrating on what is making me sad
6170,"I'm glad you cried, especially with the ""fear of emotions"" thing. I'm working on crying; the other day I seem to recall I went up to my room and shed a tear or two about something. It wasn't important and I can't remember what it was, but I felt better for it! Keep crying"
6171,"The only thing strangers say to me is ""what are you staring at?"""
6172,"I was you for a good while, dude. It took a good jump start to get my emotions flowing again. 

I was numb to a lot of things. Didn't feel particularly sad, but looking back on it I think there's no way I was happy. I then visited my grandmother on one of her final days. She had pretty severe dementia and couldn't remember my name, she could slightly remember my Mom (her daughter). 

As a little treat to her, we showed her a picture of her husband who had passed a few years back while playing a song that they had at their wedding. She had the biggest grin, and I hadn't seen her smile in quite awhile. Suffice to say I stepped into the hallway and couldn't stop the intermittent crying for a couple days. 

It's not like everything went back to normal with my emotions after that, but slowly it's been returning to normal. Real emphasis on the *slowly*. Still, the first is certainly the hardest. 

I do hope your emotions get a real kick in the gonads sometime soon, friend. As strange as that may seem to say, it's what proved to work the best for me."
6173,"Hi! Thanks for sharing your story! Thanks to that you're closer to your emotions, it helps to write it down. I hope things are gonna go better from this point now on. Let yourself feel, in the long run it's gonna be better 💜"
6174,Ive definitely been waaay more emotional during the quarantine and been crying it out more often feels good tbh. I know how it feels to bottle up your emotions because of masculinity. Im a big dude who likes power-lifting so crying makes me feel like a lil bih but sometimes a big mf just needa feel small. If you ever need someone to talk to about your feelings this strangers dms will always be open
6175,What are you starting at?
6176,This is great! I love that you shared this. I feel like I don't get to see enough good families online.
6177,"Middle East & North Africa is counted as a white region by the US census, so you could identify as Asian but the “correct” answer is white"
6178,It’s mainly for affirmative action stuff and data
6179,"(not american) I'd just decline to self identify. What the fuck even is race, anyway."
6180,Most of Turkey is technically in Asia
6181,"Not true, UK does it too for a load of job applications. At least I have the benefit of saying White (non-British) lol"
6182,[deleted]
6183,I guess you are white now. I have a ton of issues with these too as an American Indian who is not affiliated with a tribe. Even on this one you can see the asterisk that says must be affiliated.
6184,"At least in britain you normally get what feels like 50 options, plus an 'other\_\_\_\_\_'"
6185,"That is true, it's strange how few options this has considering how diverse the US is"
6186,"And everything is always in relation to whether you are Hispanic or Latino. For, some fucking reason"
6187,It's such a weird question. Surely your nationality should be a more important fact to them then your race.
6188,"Asians are over represented in most professional careers, therefore most companies prefer other minority groups. This makes applying as a white person easier, though still difficult, compared to Asian applicants."
6189,Decline to answer
6190,Turkish here. There used to be a Middle East label but it now counts as White. This was from standardized testing and the change I saw was around 2016
6191,I would recommend you select Asian... but white can work as well
6192,"I'm pretty sure they consider us as white, take this with a grain of salt though"
6193,"I used to think it was for statistical purposes but now reading the other comments here, I’m not so sure anymore."
6194,white
6195,They're still legally required to guess your ethnicity if you don't self-report.
6196,">”Far east, Southeast Asia, or the Indian Subcontinent”

White usually includes middle eastern, and they don’t mention it anywhere else, so put that.

Though including Hispanic and Latino on this table makes absolutely no sense because they’re also ethnicities that have nothing to do with race."
6197,Middle Eastern is placed under White in the US
6198,White LOL
6199,"Decline. It's only for data collection purposes.

Source: from UK. But most jobs, unis etc that you apply to will ask this here aswell. It's mostly for data collection purposes so they can boast diversity."
6200,"They ask for your race because they have diversity quotas to meet, to be eligible for tax benefits. Its a fucked up system"
6201,India Smirked
6202,thats the most confusing bit lol

6223,You too pal
6224,"Nah, you are"
6225,You are the cutest out here. You gotta share some of that cuteness. It is not fair to us that you have all the cuteness and have left us begging
6226,"Liar. You got all the cuteness, not me."
6227,You too qt pi
6228,"Well, I am just saying. You could consider sharing some of that cuteness you possess"
6229,Why are you lying? You are clearly the cute one here
6230,Nah you are

6244,Hmm. Well points for honesty.
6245,I only got the latter; just chill man it'll all come in due time you have time you have this you have that. As I grew into my 20s I realized it was just that they really just wanted a cute baby never really expected me to succeed anyways. Man I *wish* my ass has parents that woulda pushed me to succeed. Always being told you have time isn't realistic cause you don't. Hope you all realize how valuable it is to have at least one other human being on this Earth who is as logistically concerned with your success as a parent

6248,"Why move out and pay rent, even if you have a job and some money in the bank xD? That’s my strategy anyways."
6249,"The purpose is to have a good time. 

Play your games. Make your friends, and enjoy it while you can. 

Having a good job is just an enabler for those things."
6250,My first bachelor was socio-educational care work. Now I’m studying to become a teacher in secondary school.
6251,i havent even started uni and don't know my purpose still
6252,This person doesn't need religion. This person needs Avenue Q.
6253,"Thanks, I guess there’s no black and white goal.  I guess I make those for myself.  I guess that’s why people like adulthood.  You make your own world."
6254,Life doesn’t have a purpose for anyone though. We should just get on with it and do things that we enjoy and make the most of the temporary period of time in which we exist.
6255,May I ask you what you are studying now? And what did you study before that didn't satisfy you?
6256,Unfortunately that’s true.. I don’t like what I do.  I couldn’t find anything I liked in time.  Money is short and now I can’t change.
6257,"Always challenge yourself, create new goals and stick to them. Create yearly and decade goals to push yourself and become a better person through the process. I believe in you"
6258,You could try religion?
6259,"Maybe you can try to climb higher up the ladder at all the jobs you will have and eventually lead a company you stand behind and want to work for.

Or maybe the goal of your job is to manage a company out of a crisis or something.

I’m studying architecture and i probably don’t want to be an architect. I’m probably not creative enough to become a world class achitect. But i’m very interested in building physics and maybe want to master in that. I get super excited when i think about helping to a sustainable future in one of the most important sectors in the world. 

With a business degree you will never know where you will go. A business degree doesn’t automatically mean you have to do boring big company desk work staring at an excel sheet all day. 

My dad had studied economy and my mother law and they don’t even work really in their fields anymore. My dad even has had its own company for a while now.

So keep striving for goals you can ser for yourself, in whatever way, and if you pursue these goals. You will get further than the office jobs you’re afraid to be in for the rest of your life."
6260,I'm pretty much in the same boat word for word here. I just haven't been vocal about it. Life is a bitch.
6261,"Honestly it’s hard to say what our purpose is, but I think you were on to something when you mentioned happiness. Sure, ideally you enjoy your job and find happiness in it, but even then you want your life to amount to more than your job– it’s just a means to a more fulfilling end. And yes, things like art, anime, etc. might make you happy in the short term, but there are other more long-term goals you can set for yourself as well.

Personally, I’ve always wanted to learn a bunch of languages, get good at piano, and do a lot of other things that will require a good amount of effort on my part. I don’t know what those dreams are for you, but you might find fulfillment chasing after them and catching them eventually. 

I have the same question as you (as do all of us since no one can truly answer it), and this is only my interpretation of an answer, but when I’m chasing those goals of mine and noticing actual progress in myself as a result, *that’s* when I feel satisfied with how I’m doing as a person. Just my two cents lol"
6262,"If you like making music, spend more time making music. Need structure? Take lessons. Music is the best thing in the world and when you can make it yourself, it is even more rewarding. You can also play with other people and meet new friends/musicians."

6265,Be an incredible person that people remember and make some dope fucking memories
6266,That’s true
6267,"Exactly! Make the best out of any situation, whether it be making money or being a great overall person. There’s always something we can improve on!"
6268,"I don't care much for Facebook or Instagram or whatever new messaging apps people are using. I mostly use Reddit and discord. My wife gets pretty sucked into the bad parts of social media where she feels a strong need to fit in with what everyone else is doing or wearing. She gets really depressed because she compares her life to what other people put on social media. I try to help her by showing her all the great things in her life now and encourage her to enjoy what she's doing on the moment and not long for what other people have. 

Also on a different note, as a vr enthusiast I feel very conflicted about what Oculus (Facebook) is trying to do to the industry. Yes they are funding great games, but they make those games exclusive to their platform. Almost every other vr platform tries to include as many headsets as possible, but Facebook wants it all to themselves."
6269,"How do you define ""seriously""? As in like  for example sending out tweets every time you do anything?"
6270,Bruh no-ones forcing you to join instagram
6271,I use it to look at all my friends and feel lonely when they go out without me
6272,Do people forget reddit is a social media lmao
6273,reddit is social media you idiots
6274,I've seen only like 2 posts in the past couple of days
6275,"I think its super important to go in knowing that people are posting their best moments and not their worst. Going into social media and comparing yourself to still photos is extremely unhealthy.

As for Facebook, they are really doing what any wealthy corporation would do, trying to maintain as much of a monopoly as they can."
6276,absolutely based
6277,"Yeah like that. Also, not following influencers and people that post every part of their life.

I only follow things i really care about (music, art, some memes)"

6281,Yah. But new places or groups give me first day of school memories so...
6282,"I have no hope I’m 18 living on my own and my opinion is that having to fight for the rest of your life just to afford shelter isn’t worth it.

I want to kill myself really really bad"
6283,"hey dude, ik it doesn’t mean much coming from some random reddit stranger, but life does get better. i’ve had my fair share of dark times already at 22, so i understand. there are always people willing to help, whether you believe it or not. stay strong. you’ve got this!"

Get better soon man, damn"
6289,"Not everyone can become happy from the same life. So it could be a number of things; maybe you haven't found the right group of friends yet, maybe you haven't found the right hobby, maybe you haven't found the right spouse, maybe you haven't found yourself yet. 

Look I wish I could give you some life changing advice but the truth is we're all kind've lost. Life really is a rollercoaster, some are ups and some are downs. Its just the downs can seem WAY worse than the ups, for me my trick is i'm a very positive person, it try to wake up happy and go to bed happy. Obviously doesn't work all the time but one can try. 

Just keep going, try new things, try boring things, learn something stupid, set challenges (for example no social media for 3 days, see what you want to do). I know it sounds ironic and cheesey and all but things will only change if YOU change, they won't magically change on their own. 

Fyi I don't want to preach or come across as condescending, this is just what I did. If you ever feel alone send me a text! I'm always up for a chat"
6290,"I'm 19 and life is definitely seeming like it'll never get better 
I'm with you"
6291,"Also 22, definitely feels like the prime of my life was around 6 years ago and it's all been going downhill since. Hard to stay motivated when you think you'll never reach the same peak of your life again"
6292,"Tbh, I wouldn't be so jealous of them lol Those 19 year olds are doing stuff way to fast. I can guarantee a lot of them aren't far developed in the maturity category, it's just a blend of independence & money so they drop it on the first opportunity they get to feel free

Ik it sucks seeing younger people (or in my case, people my age) going off doing all these things but that's likely because they have some privilege, whether it be financial, social, etc. So they have a headstart to these kinds of things.

All you gotta do is put in the work, then it'll come as a big payoff when you can finally start travelling to those places you like. I mean most of us here are 18-23, we have a long long time to enjoy the best of life. It just takes longer for some to make it"
6293,"im 21, spends most time at home, watches youtube, netflix, video calls friends but still works out and eats healthy, i kinda enjoy it"
6294,"As a 19 year old, my opinion is that those other 19 year olds aren’t doing their job to flatten the curve. I can relate tho. Although for me, my last year of high school was the time where I was gonna spread my wings. But then COVID happened lmao."
6295,"I’m kinda where you are as well. Most of the friends I made here in college dropped out, moved, or moved on. Most isolated I’ve ever felt, with lots of difficult introspection and anger sprinkled in. this sucks"
6296,"U literally just described me to a T. I'm also 22, in my last semester and feeling like times up. I didn't really live it up like you said in college mostly due to me becoming stuck in this comfortable routine of work school home work school home because it was easier to do that as an introvert than to make the effort to meet people. I kept think thinking friends and fun will come eventually, next semester I'll be outgoing.

Then before you know I'm 3 years in I realize I basically know no one and I didn't ""spread my wings"" or have the time of my life like I thought I would in college. But I guess it's important to just make the most of the time I have now. It hard not to look back at what could have been but I keep reminding myself that if I keep looking back on what could of been these last 3 years are gonna repeat themselves and I'm gonna be stuck again at 25 regretting not meeting people and living my life. It's hard not to resent myself for putting me in this situation or get sad or jealous of seeing other students living it up 
Zoom is not making it easy either.
Best if luck man to both of us. Here's to fun and adventure in our futures 🥂"
6297,"Suh dude, I live in constant fear that I’m already a failure & ima grow up to hate my 9-5 job where I have no life & barely anything outside of work. So you’re not alone bud, but we are in control of our destiny so just work towards what you want to become. Lay 1 brick a day so eventually you’ll have layer a whole house but you gotta be consistent & never give up"
6298,I am 22 will be 23 in July. I feel like my mental health is down the drain and feel like my motivation to move forward with my goals is to prove that I’m not a failure.  I’m at a standstill rn after getting my bachelors degree..I got nothing to show for it. :/ I’m convincing myself this a normal way to feel in your early -mid twenties. A part of the human experience...?
6299,"As I now approach a year of college spent in pandemic, I couldn’t agree with you more. College was already hard enough. My anxiety and depression were only worsened by the academic pressure, and I wasn’t able to “make new friends” or “find my place” like everyone said I would. I place myself in social settings and still feel entirely out of place and unwanted, and Zoom U has only made it worse. I’m spending so much money and acquiring so much debt for an experience that I will probably end up resenting and that is really killing my motivation. All this to say, I understand what you’re feeling, and I’m here for you."
6300,"I fully relate. I also can't tell you how many people I know who blossomed after college. It's not over.

I feel like it's a product of our society, there's all this pressure to live while you're young or something. But you're still young, and there's a whole lot of life left to live. Ya know?"
6301,im 21. 22 in June. I can relate to nearly everything that you say.
6302,❤️
6303,"Ik what you mean by time feeling like it’s going fast. Try learning something new, like a language or how to play an instrument. That should make u feel more in the moment."
6304,"I know that feel. But 22 is still good, turned 24 and I miss being 22 lol."
6305,Don’t worry I’m about to be 23😕
6306,"When I turn 22, the only thing that's gonna change is the number behind the twenty. The substantiative changes regarding my maturity, life situation, outlook, etc will be because of environmental influence or my active input; it won't be because some number changed by one digit."
6307,"It’s crazy hahah cause even tho it’s a while back it kinda isn’t ? Like 3 years ago definitely wasn’t that long ago to me. Tbh I just wish I could be 20 turning 21 again 🤦🏻‍♀️
Like I just feel like reclaiming that 21 so bad aha"
6308,"My 20 and before was lit and then my 21 was basically taken by covid lol. So I feel like missed out, I was also meant to sort stuff out with my friends last year as we had a bad falling out 😭 and it’s been a year now. Covid made it hard to talk things out 
So I just wanna call up and hopefully make things right. But also I wanna just make the most of 2021 man. Like I feel like 22 is no longer the “kid” stage lol and 21 was the deadline but idk aha"
6309,"Aha thanks heaps tbh lol i graduate mid next year! So half way into being 23. Also I’m Indian aha so I still got a extra few years till I need to move out (around 25-26) and that’s when I’ll be finishing my masters anyways. I just kinda wanna make amends hopefully and just get back to normal. Aha I’m feeling a bit better now, I also remember I was kinda depressed when I turned 21 but then covid just ruined it. And now being 22 I wanna be 21 again lol. So I’m gonna have to make sure I make the most of 22 even if the fkn pandemic gets in the way I’ll have to find ways aha.
Thanks heaps though and I’ll definitely have a go at the gaming stuff!"
6310,These comments are refreshing because I get so in my head about this stuff and it’s nice to see people who feel a similar way. And I feel you except I’m worried about being 20 next year because I feel like a high school freshman instead of a college sophomore.
6311,What if I told you you were 16 about 6 years ago?
6312,"This made me feel better. I just turned 22 as well, just curious how did you feel when you did turn 22 like did it get to you ? 😂
I still feel 19/20 lol"
6313,"When u turning 23, since it’s now 2021 for me. I’m going to turn 23 end this year 😞
And how was 21/22 for you ?"
6314,"Oh shoot! Happy New Years😊

Turning 23 in March. Just graduated in December so it feels like a lot will change. I’m going to have to move to a new place. Honestly we are still young. Play the long game bro. Enjoy your years and cherish what’s ahead! That’s what I try to do when I feel nostalgic and find myself in a bit of sadness.

Dang I just realized my whole 22 is about to start and end with pandemic lol! 21 was nice. Got to enjoy being on campus - playing sports, hanging with friends, etc. 22 feels a bit lonely but I’m making the most of it by trying to self improve and treat myself well. 

How has your 21/20 been?"
6315,"That’s tough. Idk maybe a video call or a few good gaming sessions could do y’all well. It’s nice to fit in fun and it’ll keep your heart young. I usually do board games with some of my mates (colonist.io, monopoly, among us). 

I got to graduate a semester later than my mates last May and I’ve seen them starting to “adult up”. A lot of things will change but you can still have your fun. Once I have to pay these bills I won’t be feeling like a kid anymore haha🥲"
6316,"Nice, I’m Ethiopian so I feel ya haha. Gotta move for a work opportunity but hopefully will be home for masters. 

Yes, do it. Make the amends. It’s worth giving it a shot. The pros heavily outweigh the cons imo. Glad you’re feeling a bit better. I think the best way to frame those thoughts is in thankfulness. I’m honestly grateful for all the good times that can even make me feel that way. Embrace the change and you’ll find a new set of good times can come in. 

Happy New Years! Hope you have an amazing 2021!!! Peace and blessings to you

P.S. you wouldn’t happen to be a mate from my ML CS (334) class? that’d be crazy haha"
6317,"Yeah it must feel terrible, going through a breakup is hard as shit... If you need to vent or something dont be afraid to reach out"
6318,"I’m sorry. My gf of 3 years broke my heart about a month ago and it does get easier. I’d say just focus on yourself, try new things, explore what makes you happy instead of anyone else. Maybe things will work out and you guys will find happiness in eachother again, but I think it’s healthy to grow by yourself for for a little while and make positive changes. Simple things like eating right and taking care of yourself can make the hurt less glaring when your alone, but I think it will still always be there. Hope you find some happiness eventually."
6319,That fucking sucks.
6320,There's probably a reason why Jessica hasn't talked to you.
6321,"Hi OP, I've been in you're shoes. It sucks alot. Sorry you're going through this. Hope you find support in friends and family"
6322,I feel that. Happened to me a couple months ago. Found out she was cheating on me though so I’m better off. It’s still so hard to find someone to call your best friend again. I miss being comfortable with at least someone even if it was all a lie.
6323,"Happened with me after 6 years, highschool and college. It hurts, but let it.  Life will go on. It's like working out. You're injured rn, don't be upset if you cant go back and lift the way you used to. Give it a few(or alot of) weeks and your back to normal, with a little bit better idea of what not to do/what doesn't feel right. 

Speaking of, working out does wonders. If your body hurts, you usually won't feel your feeling hurting as much 😂"
6324,"My comment has been hugely misinterpreted but its alright it does seem like that without context. As for reason, im really scared rn cuz she was going through some very bad things last time i talked to her and she clearly needed me, then just, went off... Hasnt been here since then and im really worried cuz she loves me a lot, and i love her a lot. Im not gonna say a lot just, im very scared. Long distance stuff gets hard. 
Anyways, its alright :) have a nice day.


I posted the comment cuz i thought maybe she thought that i dumped her which is never gonna be the case but anyways..."
6325,I know this is not funny and stuff but this reminds me of 'WE WERE ON A BREAK' from friends
6326,"Is ur name Jessica by any chance and have u been missing off discord since Oct 21?


EDIT: for the first time im downvoting myself, sorry if i came off as insensitive im truly not. But its alright i deserve these"
6327,"Definitely know how you feel. I'm the same age. Ya gotta remember everyone's not the same, life isn't a race and you don't have to be anywhere by a certain age."
6328,"I'm 25. 26 in a few months. 

I look back at 21-22 like it was *fucking yesterday*, and realize that the next 3-4 years is gonna fly *even faster*.

Buckle up, lol."
6329,Just wait I got cancer at 22.
6330,I am sorry to hear that.
6331,It feels so close to me.
6332,"I guess it feels a bit like when youre 12 and you look at 17-19 y/o ppl, and you feel like a kid while theyre teens transitioning to adults. But ofc when youre 22 the differences between you and a 29 y/o arent so noticeable, bc youre both adults. Maybe it feels “far away” bc these ages are on the opposite side of a span of 10 years (22 is early and 29 is late)."
6333,"Because it feels like they are fully functioning adults who have figured out their life. They work a proper job, have a partner/family, etc. This is in contrast with what the early 20s people are."
6334,"I agree, though it can be hard to remember sometimes. I think it mostly comes from comparing myself (and being compared) to my peers, and the 'common' courses of life. Meaning like you go to high school, then college, then get a job and what have you with all those life experiences in between. For me, due to certain circumstances, I started high school later than the norm. I'm not in college and have no idea when or if I will. So maybe part of it is feeling like I missed out on some things? Idk, maybe I've been thinking too much on it."
6335,"i'm 21 and i've had depression amongst other things on and off for as long as i can remember. i think the future looks far away because i can't see myself growing old and living on, because some days are honestly harder than most."
6336,I’m 22 and feel like I’m 43 and i hate my life so I mean could be worse
6337,"I think you're putting too much thought in it. 

I've done all those things (meaning hs and college) and still feel like I haven't accomplished anything or I'm missing out."
6338,I used to feel the same way until I met people who were in their late 20s/early 30s and realized how young they still are. Lots of people are still trying to figure their shit out even at that age. I’m still afraid of getting older but it seems a lot less scary when I meet people that age and realize my time isn’t running out as quickly as I thought lol
6339,Bro I’m 20 and I feel the same fuckin way. Bout to turn 21 and I feel kind of sad? Because that’s like the last age milestone for awhile
6340,20 is the final age of transitioning from teenhood to adulthood. 21 though is your last age of adolecense. But 21 you can pretty much do anything in the eyes of the law so RIP.
6341,"No problem!

I'm always down to listen if you ever want to talk."
6342,"I am 24, I feel like the 30s is just around the corner... somehow makes nervous the fact that I will be in my 30s in 5-6 years......"
6343,I'll be 22 in about a month. Still feel like I'm 18 but the fiscal+social realities of adulthood bounce me back to earth.
6344,Yeah I definitely know how you feel man. I just turned 22 back in February and I feel like those people got their shit together better than me. I don’t even feel like an adult haha.
6345,I understand. My parents use that against me all the time. Such an annoying tactic.
6346,I see. I've been told I overthink things and I know I do. So thank you for your input. Obviously it's not a good feeling but I'm glad to know I'm not alone!
6347,"Thank you, that would be nice :) I'll keep it in mind."
6348,Why not
6349,Puncuation is your friend.
6350,"shit, it's interesting as hell. thats a good enough reason, right? I think the real question here is why they formatted it like that, lol."
6351,"I'm only 17, but I feel this way all the time. You're not alone!"
6352,Yeah being 20 feels really weird. I'm also starting college late because I went into the military so it really feels like all my peers are farther ahead in life than me
6353,Same. I've just turned 23.
6354,"Maybe cuz you have ""boy"" in your username :D"
6355,"Don't matter how ahead they are than you, at least you're not graduating with tons of debt. Plus in a couple of years, a few years difference in age won't mean much. 
Disclaimer: am currently 19"
6356,I think they know. What’s your point?
6357,I feel 100% the exact Same way.
6358,"I'm the opposite. I've felt like an adult for quite a while now, but I turn 17 near the beginning of this year."
6359,"From what researchers have said, your mind doesn’t stop developing until the age of 25, so in other words, it makes  sense to still feel like a teen, because your mind hasn’t fully matured yet"
6360,"If it makes you feel any better, I still have two years left of school and I only took a gap year so I’ve pretty much just been lost in academic terms"
6361,You’ve been a legal adult for 2 years now.
6362,If ifs and buts were candy and nuts...
6363,Big RT in the internship part
6364,If internships are proving hard to get being involved with extracurricular is a great other way to build marketable skills
6365,"Feel free to pm me your resume. I can look it over for you and help you out. I have gotten interviewed for literally every job I’ve ever applied for. 

Resumes get interviews. 

Interviews get jobs."
6366,"I’ve not even started my university and have this fear. As a going-to-be IT major, I’ve already started to do some small projects and growing my github."
6367,What degree?
6368,"Absolutely get some placement experience whilst doing your degree. 

Degrees are now in such plentiful supply that to stand out you need to have something else more than the next guy. Even if it’s just a couple of weeks in the summer, it’s something to put on your CV that shows you’ve done more than the bare minimum."
6369,"I'm in a similar train of thought. The best thing we can do is keep on applying, and while applying get some other skills to add to your CV. Whether it's skills in macros on excel, a course in a program relevant to your field, do more extra curricular just for that extra line in your CV. Keep on doing interview practice, watch videos on it, nail everything else you possibly can while applying. If you don't get a job you can do all this with your free time"
6370,"Even then you could be doing better than your friends. I have a lot of friends that are currently homeless/without jobs, while i'm sitting at home wondering why i'm not doing anything different. Sometimes you have to be grateful for the situation you're in"
6371,"See I am the person who fell of the big boat and just drowning. (Was at uni and dropped out, now back at home with parents)"

6374,I feel like young is really too obscure to judge here. Being 26 with a master's degree in software engineering and being paid 150k is certainly possible. Not the norm but certainly possible
6375,"Also can't relate, 17 year old software dev here who just bought my second house."
6376,"Also can’t relate, newborn over here who just bought my tenth house."
6377,"This. My best friend has $50,000 in the bank. I have $80,000 in student loans. The difference between him and I is that I’m pursuing the career goal I’ve had my entire life and the job I’ll eventually get will be able to pay off my loans. His career goal is to invest money into real estate properties and become rich. If I just compared how much money we had, I’d be setting myself up for failure. I just have to focus on my own goals and not worry about anyone else."
6378,"Not really, just because someone has a high paying job and a house doesn't mean they're happy either. Assuming they took a school loan + mortgage implies they now have a lot of debt, their job may be stressful/not enjoyable, and maybe also aren't operating under their budget either. What I'm saying is, it's all subjective. Take some time to think about what success and happiness means for you and work towards that."
6379,It's weird when I see people having two kids that I graduated with but to each their own. Everyone has a different path and different goals.
6380,"Don’t think about what other people are doing and how they’ve got more than you—this thinking is destructive and causes extreme anger. 

Someone always has more of something than you do—it’s a lost cause. Few people have everything, and alot of people who seem happy are actually miserable."
6381,Everyone has their own path. Remember the only way you should be comparing yourself is to your past self
6382,Are you in the trades?
6383,Oh neat I sort of do logistics for a company
6384,"As a uni drop out, I feel you there bud. Tho I'm 22 and my peers(ex batch mates) just have wayyyy higher salaries and seem to be on the right track whereas here I am completely lost just going from one day into the next. No direction because everything just seems very bleak from pov so I don't bother."
6385,"I mean, there’s also kids up to 10yrs younger making 10x more money aswell"
6386,"Money isn't everything... I have a very well-paying job at 21 with no college at all. I have everything i want and can literally buy just about anything i want. ill be purchasing a house the beginning of next year. Im not happy though, I work my ass off, ive sacrificed relationships, friendships, my own personal free time for my job. Success is subjective. If you love what you do any its  enough to support yourself, thats successful in my book"
6387,"Ngl I do, I often think “damn i shoulda became an __”, but at the same time, similar to you, I’m JUST starting out. So really, it’s not a fair comparison as your salary will grow, and hell, you may even fall into a different, higher paying role than you imagined.

Additionally, some people may not have as much in the bank as their image portrays. Technically, i could put a down payment on a house and make the monthly payments, but god forbid I lose my job I’d have to foreclose almost immediately. So it also depends on how you spend your money."
6388,"i am not, I work for a logistics company"
6389,What do you do?
6390,"I may have talked myself up. I work for a utility company and I am responsible for scheduling and receiving deliveries, maintaining our warehouse inventory  and making sure that the right parts are going out to the right job sites."
6391,Remember that those people likely got into those jobs due to generational wealth or nepotism. It’s a very small percentage of young adults in high power/paying jobs that got there by their own hard work.
6392,That's totally yeet dude
6393,"Can't relate, I am a 23 year old software developer who just bought my first house."
6394,Congrats on the job and thanks for the suggestions.
6395,Congrats! I'm still unemployed but I feel like LinkedIn is amazing and Indeed is very good. Handshake and Ziprecruiter are sub par.
6396,"I just wish I wasn’t 21 almost 22 in covid literally covid ruined my whole plans of being 21 man !!!
 
In a way I got shit done though but damn I didn’t turn up at all this year"
6397,Jealous. Mines been GARBAGE along with most people... Just wanting corona to be over mostly
6398,I don't care at this point. It's better to look at the future then remisicent about the past.
6399,"Mines been mainly trash but the caveat has been being able to save money cos I'm stuck at home and paying off debts

I won...but at what cost?"
6400,I honestly don't know when it will get better. I have no faith that it will be 2021
6401,"Yes, everything will be magically better on 12:00 Am 1/01/21"
6402,You’re insanely lucky. Almost everyone I know has had a terrible year smh
6403,Same but I'm 20
6404,"I relate to this, I just turned 21 a few months ago"
6405,same here but to be honest with or without covid my life didn't change to much
6406,Same. Wanna go back to 17 it went too fast.
6407,Would you like to start a NEW GAME+ with the current equipments and money to carry over into 2021? The settings and environment will still be the same.
6408,Work wise this years been the best for me. Other than that its been pretty shit
6409,Same :)
6410,"yeah, except that future prospects be looking grimmer than cold war era"
6411,is this an exaggeration?
6412,"honestly, we're so deep down the 'customize your own reality' thing that I'd have to ask you how science-friendly you are just to answer that"
6413,As a former college athlete there Nova sucks.
6414,That has nothing to do with the professors’ research skills
6415,People say that a fair amount where I’m from
6416,"Seriously a big problem that seems to happen to a lot of young people from what I've heard and yet when I look around me, walking through downtown, I see people my age in big friend groups, having fun. I don't get where people get friends as an adult, it seems very difficult :c"
6417,I'll be your friend!
6418,Bruh same let’s be friends
6419,"Picking up a hobby helps a lot. I rock climb and I’ve gotten so close with some of the frequent people i see that I was invited to a couple game night. I don’t have trouble making friend luckily, but I definitely think a hobby can help a lot. It started with boba runs after climbing, then getting food, then we started hanging out outside of the gym. Good luck dude! You got this"
6420,yeah it is for some reason esp if you’re socially awkward
6421,"I hope you're having a nice day mate and making some friends out there ! (Same here, all of my friends on high school was gone but somehow some of people try to reach me out while in quarantine) :))"
6422,"How did you start rock climbing? Since you always need someone to secure you, I was wondering how you actually meet people because I felt like it’s more like little groups always climbing together"
6423,"Embrace your awkwardness :) I’m really awkward, and I just tell people upfront so they know what to expect, most of my friends find it really amusing. It’s just a personality trait, not something to be ashamed of."
6424,Let's connect :)
6425,Sent you a PM. Wanna be pen pals?
6426,My advice doesn't really work during the pandemic but going to the local gym and picking up a sport or hobby is an easy way to make a few friends
6427,"I think the hard part is finding like minded people. I found them when I joined a club at university, I was so surprised finding people who had the same interests and humour as me. So maybe join a club that’s focussed on something you’re passionate about?"
6428,Friendship? When you tell me how please tell me cause I dont know I only have internet friends
6429,I feel the exact same. I just graduated college and  the 2 friends i made during college just stopped texting me back. So i have like no friends and now that I graduated I don’t know how to make more friends.
6430,i love you (:
6431,"So depending on the rock climbing gym, they’ll have different focuses. There’s a type of climbing that doesn’t require any ropes (bouldering) because it doesn’t go up too high. Check out some videos if you’d like, but that’s how I started and everyone takes turns on the wall encouraging each other. I definitely recommend you at least try it a couple times"
6432,"I’ve been climbing occasionally for the past year and a bit more in the last few months with a few friends, so that’s where I got the feeling from that people tend to go in groups or pairs and not really talk too much to other people. But yeah I can imagine bouldering being a bit more open in that sense since you can go alone and I’m not in the US so people are less likely to start a conversation anyway I guess."
6433,"100% the easiest way is to pick up a hobby or skill and stick with it. If you put yourself out there into that community you are bound to make friends with people who are also passionate about the same things you do. I’m having an issue that is kinda parallel to this. I have a lot of friends but I’m not really close with anyone. We hang out all the time but if I’m going through something no way I would want to tell them. Best thing I think you can do though is not to worry about it too much. I’m a Christian so imma say God, but you can substitute life, has a way of giving you things when you’re least expecting it. Focus on yourself and how you are and what you’re doing and people will notice that you’re an incredible hardworking passionate lovable person."
6434,"Hi there, friend"
6435,[Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/wiki/making_friends).
6436,Be the change you want in life. want to go out more? go out more
6437,"I didn’t feel it for longer than you have been in school yet. First year, I had friends and a good time, but we didn’t really do anything. In my fourth semester though, we sort of merged with another friend group, and it’s been the best couple years of my life since then.

That’s just my experience, and everyone’s mileage will vary, but also keep in mind that there’s no one definitive “college experience”. It is what you make it"
6438,"Well, life's not a movie. That's how it is for a lot of people."
6439,"Honestly I'm kind of in the same position as you but I'm really fine with it.

I dont go out to a lot of parties I haven't had a lot of luck with girls and I dont have that many friends. But I'm seeing more and more that this is the norm and not an exception. And honestly I'm still having SO much fun. My flatmates are my bros and we have a lot of fun. Parties are great and all when thehre big college wide things but honestly house parties are more hyped up than they should. 

Find the fun in the small things, shenanigans with friends, clubs, dinner with flatmates or maybe even road trips if they're up for it. No one is going to remember that one house party or who was there, but me and my friends will always remember the time our friend dropped a huge burger on himself (he's now named after said burger). This incident happened on the way back from buying groceries in Walmart and it's one of my best memories from recent years. 
That's the REAL college experience."
6440,"If you're there to succeed then you're doing the right thing by avoiding parties. Unless you can ABSOLUTELY afford to lose both the evening of drinking/partying and the following morning dealing with hangover and fatigue then you're in no position to be doing it. The nature of college is to be very busy, even if you have good time management skills. I had a small taste of the college experience and I can tell you if I had gone any deeper into it I would have flunked out and been screwed over now. Trust me, you're not gonna miss out on having fun if you don't do it in college. I'm only 20 and I'm still doing some pretty cool stuff, but I also have a job and other responsibilities so you have to divide up your time accordingly. I promise interesting things will come your way"
6441,"I'm already going to graduate and I feel like I haven't accomplished anything with my life so far. I've made friends for a semester, but they either drop out or stopped talking to me.
It's pretty rough going to college everyday with your break always being alone, but I can only work through the awful assignments with some hope for a better future like I have for several years."
6442,College(University?) free here? Um WTF just paid $8500 for this year. Student loan just ticked over $25k and I'm only 3rd year.
6443,I’m in my second semester and haven’t been to a single party. I came to college to get a degree. I have friends from Highschool going to colleges away from home for the experience. I don’t really understand the point of the college experience.  I assumed it’s like the classic high school experience. My Highschool experience was completely different than any of those movies or what people told me. I assumed college was gonna be the same way. Everyone’s experience is gonna be different and you shouldn’t go in with expectations.
6444,Don’t worry. I found that the college experience was more hyped up
6445,"In college, I never drank, did drugs, or even go to a party. The most exciting it got for me was when our dorm was evacuated due to a gas leak and we went to my roommates' boyfriends' apartment for an hour. Watched him play video games as he vaped. I sat in silence. It was awkward."
6446,"first of all, highschool IS a waste of time. secondly, I think a lot of people feel that. I think it stems from the glorification of college in popular media, and it creates a generation of kids who feel like they aren't living up to the ""expectation"" put forth my our popular culture. don't sweat it."
6447,"there's no such thing as a universal ""college experience"" or any type of ""experience"" in life in general. don't hold yourself to some sort of unnecessary specific expectation of what your time in college is supposed to be like. I feel like you're only setting yourself up for failure if you go forward with that mentality. It's definitely not just you, I remember feeling very similar in my first year or so at college.

look, I don't know you or what you're going through or what any of your situations are but, I guess if I had to offer any advice I'd say that you could benefit from just doing whatever you need to do to get something if you want it. not to sound like the generic ""real men do x"" article advice but if you want to go out more hit up your friends and try to see if they wanna go out more often, go to more parties, ask that girl you met up with on a real date, etc."
6448,"It’s true that proactively pursuing a social life is the only real way to get one, but I think it’s still more important not to rush into it. Take time to absorb what your life is like as you look to better yourself. Ya know, quiet time wouldn’t be as good without all the crazy moments. You can also lean into it. Nothing wrong with keeping connections light to avoid the many pitfalls and land mines that conversation can have. I definitely haven’t jumped this hurdle but I still made my way around it by falling in love with my alone time. Not needing people to get by is not a character flaw, it’s really just one of many fluid traits that grow with you. If you look at it that way, you might not feel like everything so far has been a waste."
6449,"Doing all my college online to specifically avoid the social partying aspects of it. There's nothing wrong with not having the ""college experience"" but if you want to go out and do it, just do it. Nobody cares so just do what you want."
6450,"My college experience (in the Netherlands) was absolutely fantastic,  mainly due to the groups I joined.

Now student life here is a bit different than that in the USA, but I reckon the same general rule will apply if you want to get more out of your uni life: join some groups.

Join a sports team. A hobby club. A whatever. Meet more people and make more friends."
6451,"Nope, and heeeereeee’s why:

I got real lucky. I went into college having a decent idea about what I wanted to do with my life (but stayed malleable because I knew it’d change), and it only took a couple months for me to realize what I’m actually passionate about. 

Lucky for me, the school at my university that handles the program I’m in is decently highly rated and provides a lot of opportunity. For example, I’m a sophomore - and I’m studying abroad in the Netherlands for a semester. A year from now, I’ll likely be doing a semester in Washington DC. 

There also a lot of career prep resources, so now I’m pretty prepared to start looking for internships and my career once I’m ready to do that. 

That being said, I also go to the biggest party school in the state (I think?) and haven’t been to a single party. I’m just taking every academic opportunity I can, and incurring loads of debt of course"
6452,"College is free here in NZ so many people go to college primarily for the social experience. Its really cool for it to be free because you always hear about how crazy it costs in the US, but the use of tax payer money to pay for it is very controversial because of people exploiting it just to basically party."
6453,">I don’t really understand the point of the college experience.  

Generally speaking -aside from getting a degree- it's to have fun and enjoy the relatively largest amount of freedom you will ever have (though that will depend on your country, experience and preferences)."
6454,"Great point mate, thanks for contributing to /r/young adults."
6455,"What percentage of people go to uni in NZ?

It's 2k a year in the Netherlands so close to free, but no one does it just to party. We definitely do that a lot, but at the end of the day everyone wants a degree to start their career with.

Plus, there's still costs involved in living if you're in uni."
6456,"I’m 15 and don’t even have friends, we are not the same"

I still consider 1998-1999 very much with the  early 2000s aha cause y’all are only 21/22 even tho I’m scared to age. Realistically we all still young asf. And I just found out our brains don’t develop until 25 from a late teen stage 😭"
6479,"I was just like that at 19 actually. I didn't want to think about turning 20 and never thought I'd be able to handle turning 21 but it all went well. Some will see you as an adult at 18 and some will see you as one at 25 or at 30 or whenever the neuroscientists say that our brains stop developing. Stop stressing about your early 20's, not that much will change in how other percieve you during those years. Also most of us are in the same boat as you, I lost my whole year as a 23 year old due to the pandemic, so I can't deny I'm quite depressed about that too."
6480,"I had a dream about school last night and when I woke up it felt like I was in a different dimension

6481,"Wow thanks heaps !! Yeah I really wanna start a YouTube channel as well like and just do fun shit. 
I think the one thing I’m most cut about is not being able to go experience college abroad just for 1 term (4 months) aha! I wanted to do it during 21 but then pandemic and now international flights 😞.
But bruh the ideas you gave actually made me feel like there’s hope. I’ll define you give these a go especially gaming lol !"
6482,"I feel the same way, like people have just done so much at these ages, and here I am, along with everyone else our age, just stuck inside cause of a pandemic? Like it’s a waste of life the more I think about it, and we can’t do anything about it. My 21st birthday last year was the same day they enforced the lockdown, and I never had any plans for birthdays, but cause I was at university with these new friends, I was like yeah I’m actually gonna do something about it, then covid happened, and I feel it’s gonna be the same for the next few years. Oh well, I felt excited to do something for my birthday after years, and it just got taken away. Bummed me out, but we move on"
6483,Wow kind of glad I'm not the only one thinking like this.
6484,"Gonna be 20 in a month, 19 was chaotic with a lot of spiritual challenges. This year I vowed to take my deepest issues on

6485,"I pressed skipped on 21 and now I’m 22, turned it end of last year but wish it was few months like more into the new year so I don’t gotta worry about the next age already. Like some of my friend of the same class year still have a few months left of being 21 and literally I never been so sad just for a few months 😭"

6487,"Well, dont worry about people seeing you as full adults haha. No insult meant, but 21 is still pretty young. Its like the adultness is probably slowly setting in now.

Well, while worrying too much never is healthy, it is a good moment to reflect. Are there things you wish you had done? Or done better? You still have time to do so! The pandemic will pass, so use this time to make a plan. What do  you want to do next year? 

Thats the best part about being 21: youre old enough to do ANYTHING YOU WANT. Let that sink in. Really. Ofcourse, we have to make plans and prioritise, but the coming 5 years its okay to fuck around a bit a try out things. Go on the adventures you want. 

Being doubtfull or anxious about the future and what you want to be in this huge world of ours is super normal. Healthy even. Dont worry. Go and find your path young warrior."
6488,"I wanna do a mixture of things tbh! 
Like make up (also I’m a girl btw but the way type is very bruh girl lol) 

But I also wanna do
•Uni vlogs, including other fun shit 
•Gaming 
•Lowkey maybe some pranks lol but nothing fake 
• get ready videos 
•travel ones (one day 😭) 
• Mukbangs 
• some vids with my guy 
• challenges


But I’m thinking to maybe start hoping on tik tok first, only cause I know allot people say the views are quicker there. So I might do a challenge or two and maybe upload something funny then slowly transition my way into YouTube."
6489,"Thank you so much ! I feel much better and ahah no definite not taken as an insult. Like I still like being seeing as sort of an adult but like u said still young to do anything and yeah I guess it’s still settling in. Thanks so much I feel motivated to write some plans now even if it’s indoors 
Thanks heaps !!"
6490,"It’s truly wild. I was 20 when covid hit, turned 21 in quarantine and I’ll be 22 this year.. and we still not out... Is it just me or I feel like I missed out on a lot of experiences I could’ve had? I’ll be 22 soon but I feel like I’m still 20... i feel behind >:("
6491,"Yoo, 27 here. I had exactly the same. Felt like the best part of my life was behind me.

Guess what? I was wrong. Things only get better. For me atleast. I'm less insecure, know what I want to do better, and I'm just more efficient in all things I do generally.

Don't worry. You're basically free to live the life you want until you get kids. Feeling shitty about past choices only makes you afraid to make new ones in your future."
6492,"Since I turned 18 I been generally upset about aging but recently that’s started to change. College is not for me and I’m excited to get the hell out and live my life. Time moving faster is a blessing for now.

I turned 22 end of last year but honestly even tho it’s like only by a few months,  I wish I turned it this year even if it was in jan just a month later instead cause it’s got me worrying about the next age and then next year ☹️ I also feel fkn 20. Like I skipped 21 , I did go out a bit when restrictions lightened but it’s still not the same with allot of stuff still closed. 
Class was also mainly online I want to cry. But also it’s crazy we were actually still 19, 2 years ago just before being 20. But yeah I wish was 20 or 21 again tbh :( definitely would do anything to take Atleast 6 more months of 21. 22 just feels weird"
6502,"I don’t want kids anytime soon for sure😭
So at 27 like what you see a 20-22 year as ? I feel like after 21 I won’t really be that “kid”. Even though I know it’s not a kid but I mean like the way people see us. Idk I just wanna make YouTube videos and want to get back on campus so bad ☹️ I just want to be happy again like I was just before the pandemic even at the beginning of 20. 

Like should I even be worrying? 😞"
6503,Dude when I was 19 I thought the same like I thought it’s all goods until 23 Atleast and it’s going asf. Since I’ve never actually seen a full matured 21-23 year old but the pandemic just changed my whole mindset lol

6567,"only thing I can tell you, search taoism (at least watch some youtube vids). I'm not close to being ""enlightened"" but it helps. Society is tormented the most by their distorted perspective of the world, an event it's always good or bad, that way of thinking is intoxicating on long terms. The only true and real thing is here and now, what you see, hear, smell, touch and taste. You don't have to give up your lifestyle to change, you can still be ambitious, only thing required is to be aware of your reaction to events, ""is this a not healthy reaction?"". ""Worth"" is a concept used to describe possesions, not ourselves, do not invest too much time on that concept.

For example. You don't NEED to have kids. I can imagine you would want them at some point in your life but keep in mind they will take a lot of time and money. Also maybe don't live in a house that is too expensive.

Wanting it all sadly comes with a cost. Some people don't mind working for that cost but from the post I make out that you are a lot like me and value free time a lot. You have to ask yourself the difficult question what you value more. I mentioned kids because I know a lot of people (including my dad) that are stuck in the 9 to 5 cycle because they have a family to support."
6570,"Hey, I just turned 20 a few days ago (heh, 20 on the 20th of December, 2020, very funny but unimportant), so in terms of life experience and related advice, I may have little to offer since we're in about the same place. Still, I want to offer the advice/experience I have.

I'm sorry if this feels violating, but I took a look through your recent posts and it looks like you've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and are in therapy. I'm glad you're seeking help for this, having anxiety and/or depression is so difficult and it says a lot about how strong you are for being able and willing to get help! I was never officially diagnosed since my therapist was against diagnoses and never recommended seeing a psychiatrist, but I struggled with what I believe was mild depression and anxiety from around age 12 through 19. In my case, part of my depression was feeling hopeless about the future. I had no passions, I was lonely, I hated myself, and I thought it would never get better. I thought I would be stuck living a joyless life, and sometimes that thought left me in a very dark place mentally. It took a LOT of therapy to get out of that mindset, a couple years' worth, but CBT really helped me. Now, I would say that I'm no longer depressed and my anxiety has decreased, and my self-esteem has greatly improved. As such, I have much higher hopes for the future. I'm not saying this to gloat and I'm sorry if it comes off that way: I just want to tell you that it's possible to feel hopeful again after depression. I don't know for sure if this hopelessness that you're describing in your post is a direct result of your depression/anxiety, but I think that it's possible and even likely. The best part is that you're already taking steps towards feeling less hopeless by seeking therapy, and potentially medication (I never took any, but my sister did for her anxiety/depression, and it helped her immensely). It's a long process, but it's worth it. You might already know all this, making this info redundant, but I just want to share that you're not alone in feeling like this, and I think that you're on the right path.

To answer the questions you pose/the thoughts you share in your post directly, here's what I think: feeling hopeless like this and losing interest in the things you used to enjoy isn't necessarily what growing up is. For me, those feelings were a product of my depression. In my opinion, growing up is the increase in responsibility and the decrease of security due to our capacity for emotional, mental, and physical maturity. That itself is scary as fuck, and I think everyone dreads or hates that at some point, even our parents. But I don't think that these feelings of hopelessness necessarily define the process of growing up or becoming mature: the thought processes that lead to hopelessness are a result of depression, which blots out our ability to see the good parts of life.

It's absolutely valid to hate the thought of taking the stereotypical path in life, of working a 9-5, retiring after years of unrewarding toil, and then dying. I never EVER want to find myself on that path myself. But it's important to remember that there is SO much we can do to avoid taking this path. Yes, there are barriers to taking the less typical path, like the hard work/heavy financial cost of higher education (which can give us opportunities for exciting and atypical careers), but it's possible. Depression blots out this hope for other possibilities in life beyond the mundane. It took me so long to figure out a potential path I wanted to take in life because of my depression. Everything I tried my hand at was exciting at first because it was new, but once the newness wore off, I was left feeling like it would just lead me down the same tired old path as everyone else. Seeking help for my depression finally changed that, and I've found something I think I can be happy with in the future. The best part is that you're on the path to finding your atypical path right now by seeking depression/anxiety treatment. It'll take a while to feel or see a difference, but it'll be there.

If you feel stuck on this path of working a 9-5 you hate, retiring, and then dying, if you truly feel like it's unavoidable, then it's also important to remember that there are things outside of work that can help make a person happy. There are hobbies and friendships and vacations and little things like drinking a nice chai tea latte or watching an amazing movie. Depression makes it hard to find joy in those things or to even seek these things out, which presents another significant barrier to feeling less hopeless, but again, you're taking the right steps to treat your depression, so you're already breaking down that barrier!

This comment is already way too long but there's another thing I want to address: what do you mean by ""true happiness""? If you mean something like ""an ultimate and unending state of pure bliss and joy and the absence of sadness and pain"", I would have to say that I don't think such a thing exists. If you mean ""being able to feel joy and having more happy than sad days"", I'd say that it's absolutely obtainable for a large number of people. I don't mean to say this to make you feel more hopeless. What I mean is that by placing this ideal on the idea of true happiness, if we don't feel this exact feeling of pure and unending joy, it can actually breed and exacerbate hopelessness, and keep us stuck in depression. This idealization of happiness puts a further barrier between yourself and actually feeling truly happy (i.e. having more days of feeling generally happier than sad). I'm not saying ""unending joy doesn't exist"" in order to make you feel more hopeless, and I'm sorry if your mind takes you there, because I know such a statement would've sent me spiraling when I was more depressed. What I'm trying to say is that merely being able to feel joy, and just having generally more positive/happy days than sad ones, is a worthy and obtainable goal to strive for, and is enough to make life worth living.

As much as I wish it was possible, we can't get rid of pain or sadness. We will experience those things in life. Depression makes those feelings more frequent and/or all-consuming, and blocks us from feeling much joy or excitement in things. We feel only or nearly only the lows in life, and very infrequently get to feel any of the highs. The lows of a depressed person tend to look and feel like bottomless pits, while the lows of someone who isn't depressed may more frequently look like small indentations in the earth. That difference is why seeking help for depression is so crucial here: feeling less depressed can lessen the severity and frequency of our lows and hopelessness and allow us to experience and increase the frequency of the highs in life. Seeking help for depression can help us have more happy days than sad ones, and can allow us to feel joy and be hopeful. I think that being able to experience the highs in life is what makes life worth living, even when there are lows. And the best part? There are lots of people whose depression gets better, less severe, or even pretty much cured. There isn't anything special about these people except that they got help. As such, this definition of true happiness, the capability of feeling joy and having more happy days than sad ones, is absolutely obtainable. That is part of what keeps me hopeful.

Regarding dying with no regrets, I think that the things we regret now may not always be things we regret, especially when we have depression. I spent a lot of time regretting the fact that I didn't get the best grades in high school as a result of my undiagnosed ADHD, after I got diagnosed. I hated myself for not getting treatment sooner, because in my mind, I could've gotten into a way more prestigious college if I'd gotten treatment back then. Depression made me unable to see the potential silver lining in this, and I thought I would always look back on what I saw as a personal failure and regret it. But once I got less depressed, I realized: I've made lots of friendships at the college I'm at, and I've met my absolutely amazing boyfriend as a result of going here, things that never would've happened had I not ended up at this school. I'm not going to tell you to just ""look at the bright side"" in order to stop regretting things, because that's pretty horrible advice for someone who's depressed and feeling hopeless: I can't cure you just by telling you to be more positive. So many people tried to get me to do that myself, and it just made me angry. Turning your negative thought patterns into more positive ones is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy's job (assuming that's the type of therapy you're getting), and it's a longer and more complex process than me telling you to ""think positively"". But basically, what I mean is that you may deeply regret certain things right now, and these regrets may be exacerbated by your depression, but you might not always regret these things because once your depression has lessened, you may be able to see the positive sides to a lot of the things you currently regret. And as I've been saying, you're already beginning that process, which is amazing! (Note: I'm not saying that you'll have no regrets when dying if you seek treatment for depression, because I've never experienced that and couldn't possibly know. I just think that having regrets now, while you're depressed, isn't a good indication of how you'll feel on your deathbed. Also, having regrets on your deathbed might not necessarily be a bad thing, but normal and not an indication of failing at life.)"
6571,"CONTINUED (ran out of space, sorry!):

Basically what I'm trying to say in my very longwinded and hopefully not condescending way (I'm really sorry if I come off like that!) is that seeking help for your depression is the best thing you could be doing for yourself based on the things you've shared here, and you're already doing it. Depression can cause hopelessness about the future/in general, and idealizing happiness into this unobtainable unending feeling of joy can further make you feel hopeless/depressed. Depression makes it hard to see the positive parts of life, and hard to feel that suffering through the bad parts is worth it to get to the good parts. Even if it doesn't feel like it will get better right now, you're already on the path to feeling hopeful and finding a true happiness that revolves around having more happy than sad days because you're seeking treatment for your depression. It's so hard to get to the place of finding and seeking help, so I'm really happy for you!

One more important thing: sometimes, when one is depressed, it's hard to feel like depression can be treated successfully, which can make everything I've just said feel unobtainable/very contingent on whether or not your depression subsides. I don't want to exacerbate your hopelessness by telling you these things when you feel like you'll never get better, so I'm sorry if I've made it worse by saying these things. But the reason I'm not just deleting this comment, and I'm instead sending it, is because I think that 1) depression is absolutely treatable and it does actually get better (I'm living proof and not an exception to the rule), and 2) by giving you a definite answer on what I feel is the common cause of these thoughts/questions you're having, I hope that it'll make these thoughts feel less threatening and easier to deal with. You're not weird for having these thoughts and feelings, and they stem from a common source (depression), so by treating the source, which is definitely treatable (even if it doesn't feel like it is), it'll be easier to quiet these thoughts/feelings. Also, even if you don't feel less depressed, you can still experience happiness and good things in life, and I don't want you to feel like you can't unless you get treated. It's just more difficult, not impossible; even so, life is worth living!

I hope you have a good day, and if you celebrate Christmas, Merry Christmas!"

6574,"I feel you. I am feeling really daunted by the prospect of getting through school, finding a career, etc. being locked into these kinds of mundane tasks that I don't really want to do. & life seems boring and tiring now rather than the adventure it used to be (for me anyway).

I agree that a hobby is good but at the same time is there time in your life for a hobby? If not see if you can make some time even if that means cutting your screen time (ie social media scrolling) drastically. It helps to have a project to do or something you really enjoy even if it's just a game to play through or knitting or something. Because it can get you feeling excited about life again, even if it's just a small part of your day that you look forward to and are excited about.

I don't know what to say aside from trying to find and include more things in your life that get you excited to get out bed, so that you feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. It's a real struggle tho ain't it."
6575,Exactly. Living on yourself or with a partner requires far less money and stability than maintaining a family. In an ideal world you shouldn't have to worry about money but sadly this isn't the case for most of us
6576,"Yea psychadelics combined with talk therapy can be helpful with solving depression, PTSD, and several other problems. Using them in a clinical setting is extrenely expensive though unless your insurance pays for it. OP if you read this and happen to have good insurance look up Field Trip Health."
6577,"One of the (many) reasons I don't want kids is that I want more freedom. I can live on less if it's just me, and if I only have to provide for myself there's a lot less pressure to have a ""stable"" job that's guaranteed a certain fixed amount of income."

6581,"Find something that you don’t hate is the advice I’d give. It’s okay if you don’t have a dream job in mind, but know what you like and what you don’t along with what you’re good at. 

For me, I realized I hated desk jobs. I cannot happily go through life sitting at a desk eight hours a day. I like hands-on activities and meaningful interactions. I accidentally realized I love teaching and spending time with kids, despite the fact that they can be little monsters too. 

You don’t have to pick a career. You can go through life without a specific professional plan. When employers ask, you can say that you’re flexible and open to new experiences in life while wanting to maintain a stable income. I think the best loophole to that question is to say you have no expectations, but you’re open to new opportunities and experiences. It makes you sound excited for new possibilities rather than unambitious."
6582,"Just wanting to be able to get threw life is perfectly fine by itself. As long as you are happy with it go with it. Just because other people seem to have a perfect job they usually don’t have it. What you see from other people’s life’s is just the fraction they show to you and social media makes it worse. 
Just focus on yourself. Are you happy with what you are doing? Keep it that way"
6583,"Oh for sure. I don't want to be directionless forever but I wish there wasn't so much pressure to have things figured out so young. Even retail jobs are like ""why do you want to work here"" and I struggle to come up with an answer."
6584,"I was like this for a long time.
8 years behind a bar and another year as security.
Looks it's not a bad way to go, but my partner communicated to me one day that I was just getting through a lot of life and was going from being ""ok with a stable job"" to ""really not ok with a stable job"". After so many years, shit wears on you.

Do something, do anything. But eventually you'll have to find out what is it you like and what it is you'll do even if you have to do it for free."
6585,"I feel the same way. I am in my senior year at college and I don't particularly hate my field of work but I'm not exactly passionate about it either. I think once I start actually working instead of thinking about the work, I will know exactly how I feel about the field. And if I'm not ""passionate"" about it, I'm sure it'll still be bearable because I've been studying this for years and it's been bearable so far and if not I'll find something else.
And so far as being employable, most employers look for people who want to learn more, especially if they're new to the field of work. And passionate or not, most of us want to learn about new things. If you can direct the interview in that direction I think you should be good.
In the end happiness is all that'll count and if what you do doesn't make you especially happy at least make sure it's not causing you any misery."
6586,"You want a stable job? Look into construction. You'll work really hard, but you'll always have work. Spend 5-10 years in a trade and you'll be able to work in any city in the world because every city builds buildings or fixes toilets/lights. 

If you're not afraid of getting your hands dirty then trades are the way to go for a guy like you. You can also make pretty good money with certain trades.

Edit: Also it requires no college and is mostly on the job training. Plumbing for example is 4 years of work as an apprentice then you can go get your journeyman license and you'll be making $26/hr+ by the time you'd finish your 4 years. Thats starting wages for plumbers btw. An experienced journeyman can make 35/hr+ if they are good and know their stuff. You can also open up your own business if you ever suddenly do find you have some big ambition."
6587,"Nah yeah I get that man, like being honest I couldn't answer that well either. I would always ""I like what you do here I think I could fit in"" or some bullshit"
6588,"Best responses include an anecdote about your past work, volunteer or educational experience that you feel relates with that particular job opportunity. This will help the interviewer envision you in the position and understand why you’d be the best suited candidate, as they’ll gain a better understanding of how your past experience and skills align to the role."
6589,"When faced with a choice where all the options are “meh, whatever,” you should usually just pick one (arbitrarily if necessary) and commit to it. I don’t see why that would be different just because it is a big decision."
6590,"In that case just do whatever you hate least/makes the most money. If you don't have a situation you want badly, pick whatever is most comfortable"
6591,"Lucky you. Tbh. 

I'd say be easy as is and just do as much as you can handle, and consistently learn more (academically or life stuff). You might not have a goal or target, but you can always look forward to no regrets and making the best of all your opportunities.

I often look back at my life wondering what I lost by being tunnel visioned on material goals. I mean, I'm happy, I laugh daily.

 I'm sure I'd be sadder if I didn't achieve my financial goals, but then again, the opportunity cost, when it comes to experiences and relationships is definitely something I work with. Stuff like kids, festivals and long term relationships make me curious

Edit

You can just express to the interviewer that in these unstable times (esp considering the way the last decade turned out),  andthe shifting nature of economic and industrial markets; you want to put yourself in a position for growth, experience, maximising your opportunities and gaining skills in a variety of fields so that you can be better positioned to apply yourself to solve the emerging problems the future promises. Something about knowing being a jack of all trades is a risk, but not wanting to lock yourself down as the environment is constantly shifting"
6592,I'm not all that interested in making a ton of money. Plus going back to school to study something else when I already have thousands of dollars of student loan debt doesn't seem like a great idea.
6593,If you don’t have a passion or a career target then study something that’ll land you a lucrative job. You’ll have the money to pursue your favourite activities.
6594,Congrats!
6595,Hey brother better late than never!
6596,"Congratulations! Now hopefully it's my turn, I'm in the same situation for the most part"
6597,Congratulations!
6598,Good job
6599,"Hit close to my heart. Knowing things about yourself is unsettling, but powerful. You can be in control. You can use that to your advantage. Hope you will be okay"
6600,"This is fantastic. Regardless of whether this is appropriate to post, I am so glad you did.

I won't make promises of your future; I have no control over it. I can't tell you with calm certainty that life will get better, that things will be alright, that everything will work out in the end. In fact, I don't want to say those things, and I don't think you really want to hear them either.

Those are the lies of an optimist, and it would seem that neither of us fit that label.

What I will say is that it's ok to be sad now. It's ok to hurt, to feel the pain that comes with loss. It's ok to not know where to go from here, to not know where the next step in life will take you.

But please, make sure that next step happens. And the one after that. And all the ones that follow. You have such a gift for writing, and the world is better with you in it.

So I must ask a huge favor of you, and beg a promise of your future, because you do have some control over it. Please promise me you won't stagnate in this dark place in your life. Promise me you'll take some time to laugh, to do things you enjoy, to continue writing wonderfully. Promise me you'll take those next steps towards your future, whatever it may be.

Regards,

AgraZero"

6613,How you doing mate?
6614,"Yeah not bad, you?"
6615,"I believe in you, just go up and ask about his day and whatnot. Everyone's favourite conversation topic is themselves, so get him to talk about himself as well; it gives you intel and makes him enjoy speaking to you at the same time. Best of luck"

6636,About in the same boat!
6637,I have haha. I’m ok now as I’m on antidepressants but it’s just one thing that makes me continue to cry
6638,I know i cant speak for all of class of 2021 but COVID has made the 2nd half of junior year and senior year so far much easier. Stressful from the election and covid but not from school/college admissions
6639,Often times when I’m upset about something else or feel a particular kind of pain again or am reminded of something from a while ago I end up consciously or subconsciously spiraling until I’m crying about something awful that happened when I was nine. It’s weird but triggers (some people don’t like that term in this context but I feel like it describes them best) come in the weirdest forms sometimes and a lot of times I don’t even pick on them. Maybe try thinking about or getting help for whatever is triggering you and whatever pain it brings up for you? Sometimes I find that if I try to follow the thread of feelings/emotions between my memories and the current moment it at least helps make a little sense of the chaos. I’m sorry you keep getting sucked back into the past I know how hard and upsetting it can be. There is nothing strange or wrong about getting upset by things that happened at any point in your life. Heck people in their 40s and 50s still end up in the therapy for things that happened to them before they got to high school. Keep your head up.
6640,"Dude, I still cry about middle school!"
6641,"Hey there, I'm only 20 so I'm a bit younger than you, but high school is still something I find myself thinking about a lot. It's honestly gotten a lot better with therapy as well as some personal development on my own. I hope you're able to find something similar that helps you mentally move past from this time in your life. I wish you the best of luck with your journey <3 you're not alone"
6642,"Avoid prom would maybe be my best decicion ever, people always say ""just go to prim, go dances, partys (of people who you dob't want to meet), etc. But in reality everthing could be worse, my prom just was cringe and sad shit, make my parents feel embarrassed of me until today, and I don' wanna go btw, just pressioned by other people who actually i didn't give a fuck until the last month when I just tired of being myself, wish could be at home playing xbox instead."
6643,I hated high school so much that my nightmares are just me dreaming that I'm going back there as a regular student
6644,I swear I'm the only one that had a good time in middle school.
6645,Yup. 6th and 7th grade were probably when I had the most fun. 8th grade was forgettable.
6646,"6th and 7th grade were great (especially 6th). 8th grade was decent.

I went to middle school from 2011-2014, feels so close yet so long ago at the same time. I miss it dearly."
6647,I’m turning 22 sooon!! And I feel like everything was going good even after high school! Like I didn’t even really miss it until last year whenever covid started and then so much more shit happened that has never happened. Like I turned into a depressing movie. Covid basically took away so much of me being 21 that I started stressing it the pandemic lasts too long. I wanna make the most of my early 20s so bad
6648,"A good rule of thumb in general is that if you feel the need to cry about it, it's healthy for you to cry about it. Feelings need to be resolved or they just ferment and hurt you endlessly. Perhaps you've just repressed that hurt for so long that you're just now actually confronting it. Talking about it, and trying to understand exactly *why* you feel what you do, and what exactly it is that you *are* feeling, are the healthiest things I can think to do."
6649,"Idk if it is normal, but your definitely not alone. Highschool was awful for me until senior year and even afterwards it still wasn't a walk in the park. I was so happy when I graduated and still have nightmares/dreams about that place."
6650,"Fuck highschool, no prom , no friends, no quarter from teachers or staff. I was lied on, talked about, bullied by teachers and students, it killed my ego. Whatever feeling you can think of when you read ""nerve"" I lacked it or it broke. I just wanted kind, honest friends, helpful teachers that could be understanding. But I instead met weirdos, instigators, users, and assholes. I am a completely different person since those hellish years in that educational correctional facility, no more unnecessary kindness , no unintiated conversation, no more people in my house, nothing but me an family. I am done being used and never getting helped so no one is getting helped by me."
6651,"I don't think it's weird. A lot of people have bad memories that makes them feel bad or even cry like you. Every person deals with mamories in different way. If crying makes you feel better, then cry. Let it all out. Let your soul and spirit feel better. If I were next to you and I knew you have a need to cry, I would hug you, let you cry on my shoulder and pet you on the head"
6652,I didn’t even think of it this way but same thing happened to me. Skipped my senior prom since I was in a long distance relationship so I would’ve just been alone at prom. Didn’t have anyone sign my yearbook either. But honestly I just get sad about high school because I miss my friends. I made no friends in college so the only people I talk to are my friends from high school. My school is 1000 miles away from home so all I get is FaceTime calls. I feel you
6653,"I am naturally nostalgic and I have a hard time letting things go, even if they’re bad things (ex. old relationships.) I cried about high school last night.  It was overwhelming and I felt dumb in the moment.  But when I think about it, the high school years are our formative years, and for many people that means they very significant.  I think people who write off high school as meaningless and not worth grieving/processing are doing themselves and others a disservice.  Maybe that isn’t the case for everyone, but for the most part, people remember high school and their teenage state with very potent, concentrated, and intense emotion.  We don’t experience life the same way that we did when we were 15.  The teen years also bring a lot of firsts and lasts - loves, true friends, heartaches, deaths, grades, concerts, etc.  All in all, it is a very important and influential time in terms of personal development.  Yes, we can and should move forward, but we also shouldn’t beat ourselves up for crying when we remember things and are flushed with old emotions/memories.

For me, I have to remind myself that I’m not stupid for crying about the very deep hurts that occurred, or mourning some of my last moments of innocence and youth, whatever the case may be."
6654,"Look, I have no mental health issues and I did not even consider going to prom, and I did not buy any year books the entire 4 years I was there. It's not that big of a deal. 

It's fine to look back on things you wish you did differently, but you gotta teach your unconscious self to not have strong reactions to simple memories. You cannot affect those things, so all you can do is learn from them what you do and don't want to do, and move on. It's going to make your life easier if you can master the art of moving on and having fewer mental weaknesses."
6655,"Nah I wouldn’t say so; feelings are feelings mate and we can feel however we want.

I can relate as I had a high school experience that wasn’t exactly what I had hoped for, and it really took a while for me to find closure with it. I still think back on it from time to time and can get a little blue, but I found I really started to find acceptance in it when I ended up doing what I wanted to do then. For me that was finding one of my first major friend groups that I could experience the things I wanted to experience with.

Hope this is helpful, hang in there <3 feel free to dm if you wanna talk"
6656,"Anti-depressants don't cut to the roots of the issue though. You might have to do some reflecting... I'm in the same boat, got loads of hurt from the past that is still there and it takes a lot of time to think through and experience. It might be worth writing what makes you feel sad and why you think that is. Try to go deeper by asking ""why"" each time.

Example: I feel really sad that my friends left me at school. Why does that make you feel sad? Because I trusted them and they broke my trust. Why might that have have really stung? Because I have severe trust issues. Why is that? Because my parents weren't there for me when I needed them. << Then you've got to a root where there is much pain that you can spend time reflecting over and coming to terms with.

Best wishes xxx"
6657,"Its not even that hard being a ""adult"". Noone knows wtf were doing. Sorry for your loss though dog. Now get to work champ"
6658,Sorry for your loss man
6659,"Sorry for your loss, may he Rest In Peace 💕"
6660,You’re happy...that your father who was supporting you is dead?
6661,"My grandma died about 7 months ago, last one on my moms side. I also hadn't seen here more than 3 times in the last decade. Doesn't change the fact that you're gonna feel sad, if you're anything like me, you probably feel even worse because of that fact. 

It's okay tho bud, thats the way of life. Have to celebrate the life they lived, not mourn the one they lost! 

Feel free to talk if you wanna talk, always open to listen and give you my own perspective."
6662,"Lost mine March ‘17. It’s ok op, it’s normal. Hope u are dealing with it well."
6663,Fell lucky then. Losing one whom you have cared for and loved closely for years is a heartbreaker
6664,It happens. It’s hard but it happens to everyone. We get you. It will get easier.
6665,Sorry for your loss OP
6666,"She was my last grandparent, her husband died on the 70's, my other grandma in '98 and my other grandpa in '01. I'm not super sad because it was expected and I've only seen her twice over the past decade. Its still a unique sadness that I cant really explain."

time heals"
6668,[This](https://youtu.be/k0GQSJrpVhM) talk is good stuff do listen to it op!!
6669,Been struggling with a break up that happened a year ago. It’s better now but damn it fucked me up hard for a while and it’s still rough even now
6670,"It absolutely is. Especially when every single thing reminds you of them in some way. The fastest way I was able to stop thinking about my ex was by thinking about him, which sounds counterintuitive but it’s true. I allowed my mind to wander back into all of the good times, the bad times, and everything in between until they were nothing but that: *times*. 

If I felt like I needed to cry about it, I did. If I needed to be angry, I was. If I missed him, I’d miss him. Personally, I had to feel in order to not feel anything anymore. It’s not easy, but the feelings do subside and eventually all you’re left with is a thing that happened to you."
6671,"Oh yeah, same for me rn"
6672,"I feel you bro and there is no easy way to get over it, but eventually you will"
6673,"Yea, I felt that with the first girl I felt in love with.

And the second one.

Weirdly enough the third time, it was so much easier to just move along.

It hurt so much the first times. But after that. Idk.
I could move on so easily. Hopefully its the same for you."
6674,"I've been single my entire life, so no."
6675,"Yep. I'm noticing it's making me act awful so I'm trying to limit myself with things until I can get over it. 

Honestly it's one of the worst feelings I've had to deal with so far so at least that means my life isn't going that badly lol"
6676,"Basically me lol.

  


Recently I discovered the only people that I talked to from my course we're only messaging me to ask for help, and then it extended into some polite conversation which died very quickly.

  


Do you have a club or society your involved with? If not, find one of your hobbies, and find a club associated with it. Having a group chat with like-minded people always encourages conversation.

  


And I wouldn't delete anything. Reach out to some people. A favourite tactic of mine rn is to send a cute animal video (I recommend r/babyelephantgifs ) and wish them well in quarantine. At least it'll give them a smile, and they might want to have a chat too."
6677,"For all you know your friends are sitting around thinking “ no one ever texts me “. Take the initiative and text, call , FaceTime, send a letter to anyone you care about. There is no time to play games or feel sorry for yourself. You’re not the only one feeling isolated. The only way to keep engaged is sometimes having to be the one engaging. Take it on yourself and stay connected."
6678,"that's the thing though; he has been initiating conversations and planning things out, but people aren't reciprocating with the same level of initiative to text or call him first as often."
6679,"My hobbies are playing guitar, coin collecting, and genealogy."
6680,"Same here, sometimes I send them memes to have a conversation but this does not work"
6681,"I'm not sure if OP meant in the time frame of the past few months or just the past few weeks, but I get where you're coming from."
6682,"I also feel that.

Almost every interaction I have with other people is because i initiate it. Other wise no one will talk to me.

That or they need something from me."
6683,"Everyone is all messed up right now. People need some slack given. No one knows what tomorrow is going to bring and are thinking a bit more selfishly than normal. 

This isn’t real life. Real life will come back but as of right now everyone needs some slack"
6684,"Relatable. I am feeling so lonely right now that all I want to do is sleep. 
How do you usually initiate the conversation?"
6685,"Yeah I can relate. I get drunk so I have an excuse to talk to old friends, so if I say something dumb (which I invariably do) or they are wondering why I'm texting them, I always have the excuse that I'm drunk."
6686,"you mean can, not can't? simple typos"
6687,Are you me? o.0 I feel a little related to that. lol
6688,"What if they feel like that, too, with most of their friend group and you're the only one to reach out to them"
6689,Everyone 2 busy swiping right on tinder and sexting =\
6690,Unlikely. They have more friends than I do.
6691,"Yes, correct."
6692,"You can’t talk to me, fam (: just reply if you feel like having a new friend"

6706,Jumping excitedly when I hear a tune I recognise and proceed to sing it.
6707,I watch youtuber gamers like a 13 year old boy as a 22 year old woman.

6709,Dude uboat and flatbed riding is the best retail extreme sport
6710,Interesting...I don't even ask because I usually have no reason to go out unless it's for school -\_-
6711,I do that too!
6712,Humming along with the microwave
6713,"I am with you, lonely brother/sister."
6714,You're never too old for Lego.
6715,Is playing Magic the Gathering considered immature? I really don’t know.

6719,"I still sleep with my Teletubbies blankie, on the same bed as my mom."
6720,Picking my nose
6721,"I watch cartoons like my little pony, old cbbc shows and stuff from my childhood. It’s too good"
6722,I lowkey enjoy some cartoons and kids shows but I haven't really enjoyed any in a few years. There's been some here and there that I've enjoyed but eh.
6723,I drink juice straight from the bottle... And I eat spagetti-os when I don't want to cook
6724,I sleep with a teddy bear every night and I love snuggling with it (I spoon my bear and my bf snuggles me LOL). We love it.
6725,Do donuts in the school parking lot at 1am
6726,"Take stairs two at a time, sometimes 3 if I’m in a rush"
6727,I feel this same way. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and that feeling of one day meeting “the one” is slowly fleeting. I don’t do dating apps either because I don’t like that back and forth with someone just for it to not go anywhere. Also I don’t want to date around because I’m still holding onto the notion of being with one person forever.
6728,Relatable. I’ve never dated in my life or kissed a girl and I’m 19. Im not even unattractive (I don’t think). It’s mostly because I’m shy and introverted and I don’t even know how to flirt really. but here’s to hope I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
6729,same I feel embarrassed using dating apps bc i don't want ppl I know irl to see me lol
6730,"I've kind of accepted it. I'm out of school now, and I'm not one to go out and meet new people. So unless it's just dumb luck or I meet someone from a future job. I don't see it happening. I know there's Tinder and other apps to meet people but I'm just not a fan of those."
6731,"Nope. I did give up early on though figuring that loving myself was all I could ever remotely hope for. So I tried my damndest to get there and I’m still working at it. From that I’ve grown to think that “love” is a matter of conditioning and developing a tolerance over time to account for ones presence in your life. Eventually the tolerance becomes an appreciation for what they add to your life. All the while they do the same and the hard part is respecting that how they see the process isn’t exactly how you do.

Then again I’m an inexperienced introvert who’s likely not lived a quarter of his life yet"
6732,"I can not even imagine the possibility of me being a husband or just dating someone, but this is because i am apathetic."
6733,I despise the notion of meeting new people with the specific intention of dating them. I'd rather just be friendly to everyone and have friendships escalate into relationships. The unfortunate reality is it's not very practical or time conscientious.
6734,listening to music and going to the cemetery with someone sounds good but seems impossible without dating apps. also now i'm out of school I literally don't know how to meet new ppl lol
6735,Just do it if that’s the only reason. They’re using them too if they see you so who are they to judge?
6736,Never say never. It might hit you when you're not looking and catch you by surprise.
6737,"Tbh I know things are hard and weird right now, but as someone in the best relationship of their life (3 years and so so happy) all I can say is that it happens when you least expect it. You can’t force it. The right person is gonna come along at the right time ❤️"
6738,Oh that's another completely good point!!
6739,I am completely the same
6740,"These days at least Im very ok with it not happening. Im already enough, yknow?"
6741,"I mean, for me whether or not i do it doesn't matter. I've learned from my background that true happiness isn't found in other people. I'll make myself happy with or without romantic love. All I need is the love of my friends, family and pets."
6742,"Maybe soul mates are real!! Just pretend like they are. Personally, I'd kind of like to be in a relationship, but not FOREVER. I can't imagine being with someone for over a year... or you know, whatever. I guess I can't imagine being in a relationship at all"
6743,Wtf r u me
6744,God I hope... well actually I don't care that much. Fank yew
6745,"Same. Maybe you'll find the right one someday, there has to be some guys like that out there somewhere"
6746,At least I'm not alone in this....
6747,I was like that the had my first relationship at 23/24 (this year)
6748,Bruh i feel😞gonna be 19 and never even dated a guy. Ik it’s gonna be much easier to meet people once covid has passed but rn the idea of meeting new people doesn’t feel possible—-and even before covid i was hella introverted like you so meeting new people was so hard. Hang in there! :)
6749,"Yeah of course! :) also ik doing college pretty much virtually makes it especially hard to meet people, i’m dealing with kinda the same thing rn—making connections virtually is HARD when you’re an introvert. I think things will be easier next year :)"
6750,"Sorry to hear that man :(( i’m in kinda a similar situation, i was supposed to be in my first year of college right now but i had to take an unexpected gap year bc covid so i haven’t been able to make any new friends either :// keeping in touch with friends from high school is really good to have but definitely not the same as meeting people. Good luck with everything, i hope you’re able to meet some people :) a lot of my friends in college right now are having the same issue, everything is just extra fuckin difficult now"
6751,"I feel this way but for different reasons. I'm not like super attractive or anything like that but I've always find it easy to meet people and going out with them. But I always get bored, maybe I just haven't found the ""one"" or maybe just monogamy is not for me. I feel like I'm never going to find love because I get in love so easily and so fast, and then I get bored of that relationship like 6 months later."
6752,"Tbh I'm really happy with myself and I don't think I need anyone right now. I may have developed a liking for a girl but she has a bf so I cant really do anything. But I'm happy single, so that's a plus ig :)"
6753,"Well call me late to the party here but I definitely think this

Social anxiety is my only friend and its not a good relationship. I have trouble conversing with strangers and even more trouble chasing romance.

I like to stay wishful but I also wanna be semi-realistic that if I keep losing my opportunities, love isnt just gonna fall into my lap"
6754,"Dating apps are fun, and you see irl friends all the time but it's not a big deal at all. I actually got reconnected with 2 old friends i had not seen in 4 years because i swiped right on one of them."
6755,"I appreciate this reply, thank you"
6756,Yeah it’s def a struggle. I have plenty of friends from high school that I still talk to by texting and calling. But I have 0 friends at college and it sucks.
6757,"I can tell you how I see my place in all of this. These are the same questions that cross my mind.  All of this is bigger than one person, bigger than me or you.  One thing that I've realised is that I probably cannot change anything, I cannot stop Global Warming or change the Economic and political system. But what I can do is try. This is not about the end result. There is a problem and what can I do to solve it? No matter what the end result is."
6758,[deleted]
6759,"It kind of spooks me man. Thinking about it. I was thinking to myself ""I'd love to join in the protests, but how could that damage my fragile future?"" Then I think of the young men who were born in worse times than i was. Young men, younger than me, who stormed beaches to get turned into ground beef by machine gun fire. Young men born for dying. Insanity."
6760,"You could also just live your life, try to build as much wealth as possible and then when you are a position of financial power (or even political power if you can), try to better mankind and leave a better future for your children. As much as we wish that all problems would get resolved, it’s not gonna happen. Look at the previous times this happened. Did it really change?"

6762,I may not be from America but don't worry mate this shit will die down like it did in 92. As for the corona virus just stay home mate. Ye ain't getting any help from the orange goblin so just try your best to stay safe. My country has currently gone 10 days without a corona case and its all because we have a strong leader that put us before themselves unlike the goblin. All we had to do was stay home for a few weeks and then we were let off our leashes
6763,"I’m mean this riots are a disgrace. It’s like they forgot what the movement is about, all they care about is fucking shit up. Now martial law will probably be implemented where the riot occur till order is restored."
6764,"Not to justify what some of the police are doing to protesters, but they're not just destroying big brands. I've seen videos of small businesses being robbed. And just because I don't have a personal investment doesn't give me the right to destroy the same stores I'll depend on 5 days later. If businesses can't continue out of fear of robberies, where exactly are we going to get our food and supplies? Out of our ass? Maybe it'll impact decisions made by higher ups but it's retarded to go and ramsack and burn the same businesses you depend on. This is why police are pissed off."
6765,"I'm 19 and in the same boat. Really all you can do is try to solve it in your own ways, with what's directly around you. If not you're stuck with the status quo - the rioting, the lockdowns, the same economy you talked about. Remember that small things can always lead to bigger events, but doing nothing leads to little to no change being done."
6766,"I’m also in your position, and honestly I’m trying to grow as a person. Doing the 75 hard program, doing my summer class and working on getting my real estate license are my goals this summer. Always try to keep up to date about current events so I can have an informed opinion, and trying my best to zone out all the negativity that’s going on. Keep your head up and continue to make every day your best day!"
6767,[deleted]
6768,"Personally just doing my own thing. Destroying and robbing your own community is stupid but maybe it works. Unless you have some kind of influence, there's not too much you can do. And the people with influence don't want to be vocal because then the mob will go after them. How I see it, we're born to die, but we're designed to survive until then. Vaccines take years to decades to reach the public, and we're all gonna get it one way or another. We're young and (hopefully) healthy so if we do get it, we'll likely build an immunity. Wish things were back to normal again. Also, fuck china"
6769,"Guess we should just burn down our own homes and destroy farms, that will surely make things change lmao. can't be angry when you're dead"
6770,Of course they're self-serving. That's the point of capitalism. They make what's in demand so they can get rich and in the process supply us with goods. That's how businesses have ALWAYS worked. But I mean we can just burn them down and destroy everything. And for what? People's lack of information and understanding?
6771,nice
6772,nice
6773,Sent it to my boyfriend and we both aren't that into it. We own every cd of tøp but this just does not interest us like the other songs they made.
6774,nice
6775,"Oh that’s rough. I hope you have a speedy recovery. 

Maybe you could send photos/short videos of your surroundings privately with friends. (E.g. Instead of describing a jigsaw puzzle you’re building, you send a photo of your work in progress)"
6776,"That’s really good for a pic of stars, especially if you don’t have any bougie lenses. 

Might I ask where this is? I need to find some good places where you can actually see the milky way"
6777,"Poo, I’m a north easterner. I don’t get views like that without driving 4-5 hours and then freezing my nads off. 

Was just in CO a few weeks back and didn’t get any good views of the stars then either 😭"
6778,"Canon T2i, 17mm f/2.8, ISO 6400, 8x20 second exposures"
6779,"Wow, beautiful! Can I ask what did you use to take it?"
6780,Nice picture!
6781,"No need to overthink it. If you enjoy it, so be it! It does not matter what you see others doing or what they may or may not think of you. To some it's completely normal, while for others, not really hanging out with their parents is theirs."
6782,"Dude, I dont know what country you live in but over here its uncommon for kids to move out. We live with our parents throughout college because most of the times our colleges are close to our homes.

This means we all go out as a family to buy stuff , Or eat out, Or even to the park. And you find other people older than us hanging out with their own parents.

What im trynna get to at is that its completely ok. Its better than living alone or going out alone. And like you said, parents aren't eternal, spend time with them."
6783,My moms my best friend. Fuck everyone else. Do what makes you happy
6784,"Hey, I’m with you! I’m 22 and I spend a lot of time with my mom. I used to be self conscious about it but with COVID, there really wasn’t a lot of other people to hang out with. I’ll be moving out in a couple of months and I’m kinda nervous about it! It actually makes me feel better that I’m not alone in spending a lot of time with my parents lol. In different cultures, it’s normal for extended families to all live together, anyway. Western society doesn’t really have as strong as a familial unit, so I think it’s cool that you’re so close to your mom. Just because it’s not as common in our culture doesn’t mean it’s wrong :)"
6785,"No! It’s okay. I’m 21 and I still spend a lot of time with my parents. Like we will go to the grocery store, mall, etc. nothing wrong with it."
6786,"Nope. I am 19F, my mum has always been my best friend. I still love my friends, but often pass on a night out in favour of sitting on the couch with my mum, doing our nails, watching trash on TLC and eating chocolate. We go shopping a lot, im always telling her about work and she'll tell me gossip about something she saw that week. Parents can be amazing☺️

If spending time with your mum is what you like doing then there's nothing wrong with it."
6787,"I'm 22 and I hang out with my mom all the time! I think we're the lucky ones, personally, because I know so many people who actively avoid their moms and it doesn't look like a fun time."
6788,"nah it’s not weird. It’s actually really cool to have a good, chill, relationship with your Mum. Loads of people would love to have that.

It’s also fun to have friends your own age just cuz you can probably do stuff with them you can’t do with your Mum, but you absolutely should not feel ashamed. I don’t think the vast majority of people at 21 would consider it lame and honestly if they do they’re immature."
6789,it’s fine. i go to the store with my parents all the time. i do stuff with my friends sometimes too but it’s hard to schedule with school and work (plus covid so we’ve barely seen each other this year). i work in a store and i see kids i graduated hs with with their parents all the time. it’s totally normal. i get what you mean when you see other groups of friends hanging out bc i feel the same way but remember they probably go to the store with their parents all the time too
6790,Which country u from?
6791,Alright man! Halfway to 40!
6792,Must be nice being 2432902008176640000 years old.
6793,"Happy birthday !!!

Man I wish I was 20 again but 20 turning 21 lol.

But nooo I gotta be 21 turning 22 😂"
6794,"Happy birthday bro, itll be really fast now. I'm 22 and it seems like it was months ago I turned 20"
6795,"the ""liberal"" states are probably better (I live in Florida so it's pretty fucked [but also not as bad as it could be]) but the overarching federal government is such a shit show regardless of what's going on. the entire government needs an overhaul if you ask me - or honestly just throw the whole bitch away - but maybe therein lies the problem: my thinking is so different from this country's that I'll always feel unsettled regardless of how much change is made..."
6796,"Honestly if my family wasn't here I'd love to move somewhere else for a multitude of reasons. It's not a bad place to live, but there's definitely bad things about it and I'm very tired of dealing with it."
6797,I'm not sure if there's anywhere else I could go. Every country has its own problems and I don't know which one has less problems than the US
6798,"In terms of ""basic life necessities"" like healthcare, education, decent pay, days off, unlimited sick days and a safe environment it shouldn't be too hard to think of a few countries with less problems than the USA."
6799,"yessssss

im Indian but I've lived here all of my life and I have a great desire to just move to India. I know the political climate their sucks but at least I wouldn't have to think about it so much. 

I don't think my parents would want that though oof."
6800,"I don't want to leave my family, nor do they want me to leave, but I know that I wouldn't be happy living my adult life and [hopefully] raising my kids in this country. If I do stay, I'd just be delaying the inevitable because I know deep down that I belong somewhere else."
6801,mad props to you my guy. I'm truly beyond happy to know that there are people like you who want to stick around and right the wrong. I really hope that being American won't feel like a stain on my existence (I'm being hella dramatic but I'm sure you know what I mean xD)
6802,Help me move to 🇩🇪please😣
6803,"Yeah, I've thought about it. Though I'm mostly concerned with the US's national debt and other issues that could lead to political instability (as we're already seeing right now). I don't know where I would move to though. New Zealand, maybe? Ireland could give me EU citizenship, but I don't know where in Europe I would go.

It's all a question of whether or not I would really have a better life in another country, and if so then by how much given the costs involved with moving."
6804,"Personally I don't, things seem bleak but there are good and bad aspects of any country, and focusing on the bad exclusively will definitely bum you out. 

I will warn you though that ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" may apply here. So if you do want to move, I'd focus on wanting to move to a specific country because you like it there, not just because you're upset with things here. 

And look into that country closely, because all countries have politics, you don't always hear the extent because you don't live there.

I have a friend who during the 2015 time period wanted to move to the UK because she hated the constant insanity of the 2016 US election... so she started spending time in the UK to get away from it all... right as the Brexit ordeal began."
6805,I'm with ya there. My thoughts on the evils of the global economy and why modern capitalism needs reform probably aren't what most people want to hear...and even moving outside the U.S. won't change much as most developed countries are economically similar to the U.S. (although they may be ahead on certain things like healthcare which does count for something).
6806,"Nah, I like it here. Sure it has problems but everywhere does"
6807,"Yes, all the time"
6808,Yeah but I can’t really imagine moving to another country so imma just suck it up
6809,Also how it would affect one's career is another thing to think about
6810,"i've definitely thought about it. i have family in a lot of places and i could leave pretty easily if i wanted to.

but at the same time, my little cousins have told me that they really want to see america. i want them to see it too. but not like this. i want them to see what america's supposed to be. a place for everyone, anyone who's been oppressed, or mistreated, to feel safe and comfortable with the freedom to be who they are. that's the American Dream that I grew up believing in.

You're right, at this point I don't know if it's possible for us to have that. And I might be really stupid for thinking I could help change anything. But I'm gonna damn well try"
6811,"That’s my plan, I have double citizenship so I’ll probably move to the uk or some Eu country after or for uni"
6812,I rather stay and fix it. It most definitely is an uphill battle but I just can’t imagine leaving this country for another. All though if I had to choose another country it would either be Australia or Japan.
6813,"If you have an American citizenship, I'll trade you my Indian citizenship"
6814,"I’ve thought about it hard, but there’s also the knowledge that someone has to be in charge of the tone and direction; I don’t want to leave that to the idiots in charge now or to anyone who doesn’t think climate change is real because we can’t afford to. 

but honestly, it feels really hopeless— my only dream in life for years has been to just be able to make a 70k salary by the time i’m 35-40, because that’s all i can hope for at this point. there’s literally nothing else. 

i don’t really see a point in staying here with everything, but there’s also things keeping me here and nothing at the places i’d consider going. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
6815,"I've thought about this for years and years, but it wasn't until about a year ago did I think of it much more seriously. I started to learn Danish, because Denmark as it is now is pretty much everything I would want from the US. Universal healthcare, an incredibly competent and compassionate government, a very strong safety net, a highly-educated populace, beautiful cities, strong traditions that make having a family sound wonderful, and many more. There's a good reason why all the nordic countries constantly compete with each other to have the 1st place title of happiest people on Earth.

I know this isn't an easy goal I set out for myself, but I think it's worth it and I'm gonna see how far I go with it."
6816,"Yes. My mom says that if all the people like me leave it won’t get fixed, but honestly I’m so tired. It’s hard for me to imagine being happy here"
6817,I think about packing my bags and going to Canada about every 3 days.
6818,Nope. It’s my home. With whatever problems you’re talking about it’s still a pretty good place to be imo.
6819,Yeah I want to flee to Canada
6820,"I have a separate idea, split the country into 4 smaller countries with their own govt"
6821,"To think the problems the United States has are exclusive to it is just naive. Every country I’ve been to: Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Peru, England have all had racism. Hell, Australia didn’t even consider indigenous people as citizens until 1967. Peru has a biiiiig racism issue against people speaking Quechua. 

What’s even more ironic is that many countries, especially the ones I just listed, are even more racist towards black people than in the United States. This is likely because they don’t see black people as frequently as we do because Black people tend to not live in Australia or Spain or Peru. 

So while it may seem like the US is hell, go live in another country for a few years and you’ll realize many problems persist over there."
6822,"It’s not something I really think about, since there’s no way I could afford to move internationally, but I probably would if I could."
6823,Would love to move to Canada.
6824,"Yes, but I know I’ll stay and try anyway. I’m studying to go into therapy and I will work in this country to help people even if it sucks. Doesn’t mean I won’t go to other countries and live there, if only temporarily, but still. 

The state of things makes me really frustrated anyway, since I want to get out of here soonish at least for a while, but that means I’ll have to spend some years when I get back trying to get my American license to practice and delay working here even more. 

The best option seems to be to continue studying here, get my license, work for a few years to gain experience and connections, and THEN leave the country for a bit. Ideally, that would mean that when I come back, I’ll have an easier time getting back to work here. 

But that means I’m stuck here for several years. 😭

And none of this even touches on places I’ll be comfortable staying in for a while, if I can even afford to go in the first place. 😫"
6825,"> Try to stop caring

This ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️"
6826, You're right thanks
6827,"Why do you care who's judging who? That ain't your business. Wait if they actually DO something, then maybe you can care a little. Life's too short."
6828,Thanks :)
6829,I feel ya man. I feel like I'm so different from everyone around me and that I'll never fit in because people are to quick to judge me because of how awkward and weird I am
6830,Yea I dropped all the people like that. Find the real homies my guy.
6831,Yeah sometimes it be like that I don't know how why
6832,"The sad fact is that people don’t think about their actions or perceptions. They usually just mirror the world around them. That’s the importance of being the change you want to see. Many angry people just need an example of happiness to mimic because they’ve forgotten what it looks like. It’s a slow and grueling process, but hearts are made to feel and eventually they will."
6833,"You're right 😔 tbh I'm just insecure, but I'll work on that and keep to my own business"
6834,"YESS. I'm so awkward, people tell me my message are dry af, and i sound monotone on the phone and even in person sometimes. All throughout high school i was scared people would judge me and think I'm weird cause i like anime so i rarely talked about it, so i missed out on chances to make friends who shared that interest. I remember wanting to join the volleyball team, but i was sooo insecure i was too scared to try out. I hate how much i missed out on 😔. 

I feel like i don't even fit in with my family and friends tbh. I feel so different too. Like Ik I'm weird but i think I can be pretty cool sometimes 😔"
6835,😪
6836,"By that i meant people who are just being themselves and living how they want, i didn't mean it as people that are just chilling or being lazy. Sorry if you misunderstood"
6837,"I am weird but sometimes can come off as interesting and cool as well. Human beings are weird. Also I feel like liking anime, video games and movies should be normal but I find it so hard to find people that share these interests. I understand not everyone likes underground metal music but the normal shit I like I don't get it"
6838,Yeah but you learn to live with it without it effecting you and you just have some people that don't be like that for you
6839,"Exactly. If people can accept people's different likes and interests, instead of judging or making fun of them, then I don't think I'd be feel like this. I don't think we'd feel so ""different"", because if the idea that everyone is different or weird is widely accepted and encouraged, then we would be able to celebrate and enjoy being different. I'm happy that there are people like you who can relate, and understand that humans are weird :)"
6840,Yeah i really need to work on not letting these things affect me. And yeah some people are toxic and i guess i should learn to live with that thanks :)
6841,Naw thank you. I'm glad I'm not the only person that feels this way
6842,Yep
6843,"You're right, and that emoji at the end killed me lmao, really nice touch in my opinion. I agree with you, my girl friends are so quick to judge other people, and some of my boy friends do it too, but I'd say not as much.

I don't understand, but maybe, at the end of the day, it's about learning how to live with it without it affecting you. Perhaps they'll even change their mind if you tell them how you feel about them judging others."
6844,"I felt like this in HS. I moved a thousand miles away and, after a bit of searching, found a town I love where people love me for exactly who I am. I learned so much from moving here and am a better person with a much healthier way of life emotionally and mentally. Best thing I ever did to leave my hometown behind. Their ""happiness"" for me is real backhanded whenever I go visit. I dont even care. They're still in the same place doing the same shit as when I left them. They know what's up."
6845,"That's just what human ego is like, were all just on our own journey doing our thing that we forget what we do and say effects other people around us. They probably don't have il intention but more just acting on impulse."
6846,"Maybe people should start doing something more productive and useful with their lives then ""just vibing"""
6847,"Thank you for your wisdom, i appreciate it :)"
6848,">You're right, and that emoji at the end killed me lmao, really nice touch in my opinion.

Lol thanks, i thought it accurately showed my emotion there.

You're very right, I'd say i really need to work on not letting these things affect me. And like someone said in another comment, ""be the change you want to see"", I'd say this and telling people how i feel about them judging others, like you said can change their minds. I guess by first improving myself, and letting myself be happy without negative vibes from others bring me down, i can eventually share that happiness and good vibes with others. :) Thanks for commenting, i really appreciate it (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.)"
6849,"i have the same problem. just have to be a little more expressive and open. as for things like volleyball you just have to go for it even if you're scared. it'll give you confidence because your brain will know it works out. you just have to own who you are and people who can't accept it just aren't your friends. the best friends I've had were people i could share experiences, thoughts, and feelings about things with and not feel like i have to walk on eggshells. hell, i was socially anxious to where id shake and had no friends for half of highschool. got more life experience and this computer nerd is off to the air force now. people project and aren't always right or perfect at all. don't let anyone tell you who you are, man!"
6850,">Many angry people just need an example of happiness to mimic because they’ve forgotten what it looks like.

Wow that's so enlightening. I've never thought like that. That's kind sad but also kind of beautiful, idk how to explain it . But, wow.

> but hearts are made to feel and eventually they will.

Wow you are absolutely right. You're words are honestly so inspiring. 

This makes me want to better myself and become an example of happiness, the change i want to see, as you mentioned. I'm so grateful for you comment, thank you!"
6851,"Wow it's great to hear how you've grown, I'm really happy for you and mad respects! And yeah I've been trying to be more expressive and open, little by little, cause that's definitely something i need to work on.

>people project and aren't always right or perfect at all. don't let anyone tell you who you are, man!

You're right, i usually take things too personally, when in reality people may just be projecting their own feelings, or insecurities. I'll definitely try to pursue my interests, and overcome any fears that may present themselves. I wanna learn to love myself and be more confident about my appearance, interest, and hobbies, and accept that no one can tell me who i am, like you said. Thanks for your comment, i really appreciate it!"

6853,I often wonder the same why friendships are so hard to maintain. Dreaming is always fun though and I know exactly where you are coming from
6854,"yeah friendships are hard to maintain, sometimes I wonder why friends don't put an effort to maintain and I the only one who have to  put effort, I am not complaining but could be nice if people put effort to be my friend...."
6855,Yeah out of fear I never did that either I just try to remember my dreams then cause once I recall being inside the dream but I wasn’t able to control it
6856,I can't even dream
6857,"Thanks. I appreciate your help. I will definitely try them out after the public exam. I am unable to connect with people at the moment because I am forced to study everyday, which makes me super stressful(and there is nobody to express my feelings to). Hopefully, things will change few months later."
6858,"Same. When I was young, I used to have friends that we considered each others as sisters. We were so close that we nearly met each other at least once a week. When we were apart from each other, we connected to each other through Facebook and Whatsapp. The feelings were mutual. It feels much different now. There is no one I can consider a ""best friend""."
6859,"Well, that's sad. I have heard that everyone dreams but some just can't remember them."
6860,"Sleep paralysis sounds scary. I think I have experienced it twice, but not the typical ones like people have described."
6861,Same happened to me randomly but then it was all good
6862,I feel like u manifested this post because I was just talking to someone about this. That is all I have to say.
6863,Yesterday I dreamt I was hunting mice with a young Bob Dylan. Felt so real...
6864,Yeah everyone does dream but it just happens that I don't remember them since I was 13 or something. I do want to have the feeling of dreaming again.
6865,"I know that feeling and it indeed sucks, but you gotta get over it. Just be the person you want to be and let them do. I also don't have that thick skin, but it's something you can develop over time. It's not easy I know, but just don't give up. Don't quit on yourself. I myself haven't really figured it out either, but you just gotta believe you can do it, and then you will do it."
6866,"Whoa whoa whoa     

whoa.   



You've learned a lot. You knew how to do things, but now you know how you need to do things - what I mean by that is even if you know how to split firewood VERY well, and liked to make sure it's all symmetrical and perfectly stackable, but take a long time to do so, the world doesn't need a small bit of the BEST quality. It needs a good quantity of decent quality. A lot of jobs are like that. I daresay most. Perfectionism is an extreme, and it takes some people some tough experience to figure out that 'better' isn't always best.    

Kindness is always worth more when it's hardest to give. And it's often thankless. But it helps make someone honorable, and more worthy of any blessings that come their way. You're in no small company when you give, help, or carry thanklessly, or aren't rewarded in accordance with your deeds.     

I wish you luck on your job hunt, and may you learn every lesson possible from your negative experiences, and gain savviness."
6867,"When your dickhead boss is yelling at you for some dumb shit, listen to what he says, get the gist of the point he's trying to make and then completely ignore the rest. Then, just dont make the same mistake again. Ask questions if you dont understand something. I cannot stress the importance of question asking enough. If nobody answers the question you've asked and they start hollering, then you should probably find another job. To grow thicker skin you have to get used to fuckers who hoot and holler for no good reason. Some people are just assholes 🤷‍♂️. 

Never stop being kind, but dont be a pushover either. Dont end your life because you have shitty coworkers. Just ride the wave and do your best and you'll eventually learn how to efficiently do the job. Why settle for quality over quantity when you could have quality AND quantity? 

If you have any questions or just need to talk to someone feel free to DM me. Have a great night :)"
6868,"You’re totally right. I’m trying to learn to take more aggressive criticism at face value (is that the right term, I’m sleepy) and take away the info and try to put aside the scary feelings it gives me. Still probably gonna cry because I’m just a soft pillow, you poke me and I have a lot of give (?) I’m still very young and the business side of life sucks ass. Working hard (now I am lol) on becoming independent and finding better work once I become independent."
6869,"Likewise man, I just hope this subreddit doesn’t turn into a r/teenagers 2.0. I like this community small haha."
6870,"I joined like a day ago, but I really like this sub too. Everybody’s mature and chill. And, thanks for being so sweet!"
6871,"I love you a bit more, and I am serious."
6872,How serious?
6873,Here have my updoot
6874,As much as I can be!
6875,"As serious as when In  1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table"
6876,"Aww, thanks. Now if only the people I know in my real life felt the same..."
6877,"I just want to say that we all love you including myself! :) If I could, I would give you a hug cause you’re too wholesome."
6878,Well I want you to know that you are just as special. Keep being beautiful.
6879,Yeah there has been a lot of karma whoring over there lately... (Still no hate)
6880,Love you too!
6881,Love ya mate
6882,Because us men are then coolest and chillest
6883,"Fuck, this almost makes me cry

Thank you so much for being part of this beautiful community <3"
6884,Do you really mean it?
6885,Same. I would hug you so hard!
6886,Thank you so much
6887,Love you more man!
6888,"As serious as when Triple H battled Undertaker in Wrestlemania, where Shawn Michaels was the referee"
6889,Oh shit
6890,love you too James
6891,I love u too op
6892,"It won't. I do not think so, at least!"
6893,[deleted]
6894,Thanks
6895,I love you guys too. SO MUCH!
6896,I love you more
6897,I love you more
6898,Aww James I’ll love you more if you tell me where do you get all those porno memes from
6899,"Time.
It will take some time to move on.
What's very important is, that you gain distance. Resist the urge to write or call her. Maybe even remove her from your social media, the less reminders the better. And if you feel the urge to tell her something, then write it down on paper and put it away. Eventually you will start thinking less about her."
6900,I feel like Jesus Christ HIMSELF told you what to type when replying to this... this was worded beautifully and I can also relate to it too.
6901,It takes time. Sometimes a lot. Try clearing your head. Get out with friends. Do things you love to.
6902,"I feel you. But keep in mind that when we are young, our feelings, our ideas keep changing. Our feelings are not strong as they should be. We are still learning, experiencing. Of course what she did is wrong but you should be the mature one and look forward in your life. Don't allow anyone to affect your life. You are the most important. Keep living. ʘ‿ʘ"
6903,"Similar thing happened to me back in January. Dated a girl for almost two years just for her to ruin my trust and leave. I was devastated for the longest time. 

July has been the best month I’ve had all year. I felt true happiness. I got closer to my friends (through FaceTime), I was able to further my career significantly and do what I love every single day. 

Find a passion, get closer to your friends or make new ones. Time will heal."
6904,"Same stuff happened with my ex, we were doing so good and then she had a so called ""guy best friend"" and started spending more time with him than with me, then she left me"
6905,"That’s how people work. We are humans, feelings come and feelings go, that is life."
6906,I wouldnt want anybody to come back who lied to me on that scale
6907,"That’s how girls work, you don’t have to do anything to make her want to leave you, she just stoped feeling you, I know it’s hard but the only way to “win” in this situation is to move on and forget about her, she might come back but it’s useless"
6908,Guy over here is gonna live like Supertramp
6909,definitely taught me a lot for sure.. 3 years together
6910,Shit why not. It’s prime run with the stallions time. I can’t wait till I’m like the older coworkers just watching the months on the colander fly by and I’m 30
6911,"Best of luck but I don't think it'll work out, update us in the future to prove me wrong"
6912,28 yr old girlfriend? Chad alert
6913,Dont let your dreams be dreams
6914,Kind of couch surfing. And stacking chips. I might finish out the year and get a 2 week vacation go out for a bit come back then put my actual 2 weeks in and yea line up a job in a town for a season then go north when summer comes back around. When the snow comes in go back south. Just getting jobs as I go. I’ve been homeless before and I was way worse off.
6915,"I’ve always wanted to drive across country, how are you calculating the costs for this? Are you gonna save up for it or just leave and figure it out as you go?

Sorry about the breakup bro"
6916,No doubt.
6917,Thought I was in /r/vagabond for a second
6918,"sounds pretty cool man. I think I might like to do something like that someday, but I probably won't. or maybe I will. tell us how it goes."
6919,Like Into the Wild? But with a happier ending?
6920,"God, I envy you so much. I've been hearing the call of the wild ever since I discovered the vandwelling lifestyle 5 years ago. I have too much going on in my life and a girlfriend who isn't on board unfortunately, but the latter may be eventually fixed. Be sure to update us!"
6921,"Wish I could join u. Ever since I was young I had the desire to travel the world. And its gonna sound sadistic but I wouldnt mind leaving everyone behind. 
There's nothing but work and misery left on the road ahead and at this point I just want to spend it all, learn about new cultures, see the world from other perspectives, and after all is done.. I think im willing to die."
6922,If you get to be anywhere near Yellowstone National Park and are in need of a job let me know. I work with a lot of hotels in the area and they are always needing help. I can make introductions for you.
6923,Will do
6924,"Haha I hated that book. But no. I don’t think I’ll leave my car behind or anything like that. I want to meet people, not bears and shit"
6925,I will bud thanks for cheering me on.  She was the right person but as cliche as it is it’s the wrong time I have to do this or I’ll end up looking back thinking what if and I know it would eventually eat away at any relationship I’d pursue
6926,"I get you, I personally wouldn’t be able to do it that way, I’d just save up and live on the road for a month or 2 in a little van or some shit, I wouldn’t just go from job to job"
6927,"I on the other hand actually know ill be happy to die but not for as long as my parents live since I dont want them to be grieving. Had that since I turned 14, also the reason why I want to see the world but this ""go to work and pay the bills"" is seriously dragging me away from that dream."
6928,Much love man.
6929,But thank you.
6930,I will.  Thanks for the support
6931,Sometimes I feel that I’m not suicidal but ready for it. Happy knowing whatever it is could possibly be better than this.. if it means it’ll make you happy you should try to chip away at your goal of seeing things in the world. At least that’s the conclusion I’ve come to
6932,"Yea, some people fantasize about living in the wilderness, like the old times and stupid stuff like that, but im telling you, there is a reason cities and civilización exists.

Good luck on your Journey tho. Sounds life changing, maybe eyeopening."
6933,Yea but In a perfect world this is what I want to do for maybe a year or possibly more
6934,Exactly man. I’m just done with the system. I need a change you know. Have to start living and not just get older and older. Suicide really puts a lot of grief on close family. I know from experience. I couldn’t do that to my mom. But I refuse to just sit idle. Have to at least try
6935,"Well done , congrats"
6936,"Good job brotha, keep it up."
6937,iPhone 12? I literally just got the same phone today too!
6938,Where can I find the wallpaper
6939,I just typed up Mint green wallpaper iPhone in Google Images. 😁
6940,Looks really dope! But wdy mean single layer thing?
6941,"Thanks, it was the first time using that method"
6942,"I did the sketch, lineart and water coloring on a single layer in my software, that's why the colors aren't uniform"
6943,"Thank you, I went out of my comfort zone and I'm eager to go further with that style"
6944,"Typically, young adults are people of ages 17–30. 

But you can join at any age though. It's not like anyone is checking, and there's no way to (dis-)prove it if you lie."
6945,It's pretty loose. I tend to go by whenever you decide r/teenagers is more annoying than relatable.
6946,"Hey, as long as you can be mature and avoid breaking the rules you'll be fine. People come here to escape the immaturity of r/teenagers, not necessarily the age (although that plays into it because if I see another meme about high school I'll blow my brains out)"
6947,"I don't think 30-39 can be considered ""young"" adult... you're just an adult at that point"
6948,"18 is the start of young adult, but that's just my opinion. :)"
6949,"That happened at the end of last year/beginning of this year 

I'm only 16 so I might be too young for here still"
6950,"Holy shit this is the most factual statement I’ve seen all month. 😂

Now that I think about it, yeah. Sums up the switch 100% I don’t think I could have stayed much after 17 when I switched. They can’t take shit seriously ever."
6951,Thank you :)
6952,That's true but just culturally there's a huge and distinct difference between 16-25 year olds and 25-34 year olds
6953,"It talks about it in the sidebar I believe but it really doesn't matter, anybody can join the subreddit. It's not like you will get banned for posting something in here. Everybody should be and is welcome here."
6954,"r/RedditForGrownups
r/Adults/"
6955,"17 is the accepted minimum age for young adult around here. But if you’re mature and just sick of r/teenagers and it’s bullshit. You’re welcome no matter the age. Only problems someone younger may have is relating to other users. Many of us are working/living alone/college, ya know. Adulty shit— 

~~and we’re funny unlike r/teenagers ;)~~"
6956,I just hope that this subreddit doesn't get Eternal September'd into Teenagers2.0 but for 20+ year olds. Having memes strictly on weekends is a god send.
6957,"Well, my karma clout is going up so I guess I was successful at not being r/woooosh lol"
6958,I’d say this subreddit isn’t really about age. It’s more about maturity. It’s the in between between understanding you have responsibilities and wanting take them on and having control over your responsibilities. Being a young adult is all about figuring out how to deal with the responsibilities that come with growing up and if you grow up early or if you don’t figure it out till you’re 40 that’s alright. We’re all here to learn.
6959,I'm 14 I just joined here to see how it was
6960,do people just like... completely ignore the side bar lol
6961,"Bro it's not that deep really, no offense. If u like the posts here, participate. If u don't, don't haha. 16 year olds aren't idiots who r ""too immature"" to participate here just like how 20 year olds rn't idiots who couldn't possibly think something on r/teenagers is funny. Just do u"
6962,"If you're only 16, you may quite like r/feemagers, which is aimed at a similar group (teenagers). It is a safe space for female teenagers (hence the name), but I've always found it to be a nice community- after all, women do emotionally mature about 2-3 years quicker than men LOL, up until about 28 where it evens out. It is open to both genders, but do be aware that misogynistic comments are tolerated far less there than r/teenagers"
6963,"There isn't one, or more likely people get more responsibilities as they age and don't need so many online communities"
6964,Ah yeah I guess I see what you mean.
6965,Not tryna get r/woooosh in here lol
6966,"Oh trust me, I know. But that's still just two subdivisions of young adults. There's a big difference between a 13 year old and an 19 year old, but they're both still teenagers. There's a big difference between a 3 year old and a 10 year old, but they're both still kids."
6967,Idk I’m 14 am I even allowed
6968,And what would be the next step after this sub?
6969,"I'm not arguing maturity but I think, by definition, those would be teenagers."
6970,"Here's a sneak peek of /r/Teenagers2 using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/Teenagers2/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!

6973,Apparently so. lol
6974,I ADORE this channel
6975,I found this for their Winter olympics marble races and I love them.
6976,O'rangers for life
6977,I do not. Some people are very fortunate to have home lives they can miss
6978,I feel.
6979,"Currently 4,000 miles from home, and will be for the next five months

I feel you on this one"
6980,Same
6981,"Im leaving home for college in two weeks, I feel u bro."
6982,"I feel you, before I left for college I thought the term ""home sick"" was just an expression, but no, its definitely real. It will get better, stay strong!"
6983,Thank u sir
6984,I felt that
6985,"first year of college 3000 miles from home, i feel you"
6986,"Hey bro I am currently in the same position as you. I know its hard but try to keep it going, Music does not only help the listener you can put all your emotions into it and it feels very therapeutic.
Try to make music for you, its one of the best tools for expressing yourself and you can always do it you dont need anybody else for that. Even if you would never get an audiance you made music that is important to you and that helped you if it can help others someday great if not you still have your wonderful pieces of music to enjoy and be proud of yourself. 

 But dont feel bad if you dont do anything for weeks, depressions a bitch"
6987,"I don’t have passion for life either but I fake liking my life just for my parents and it’s a little bit cliche but you need to find someone or something to keep you grounded. 

You may be just in a rut right now but I hope you’ll get out of it. I too am in a rut right now and only I know bc I can’t tell anyone and often times when I try to tell someone I’m depressed they’ll just answer with that “ Just be happy” bullshit."
6988,Don't give up!! It can be challenging at times but I promise you it's worth it. You matter!
6989,"Do you have the instruments? I think you're a guitar type of person, but I need you to tell me. Or do you like the vocal part? Or maybe playing the guitar and singing?"
6990,What kind of music do you play?
6991,"What genre of music do you like? I would like to listen your music, keep going and create a masterpiece!, I'm sure that me and other people with depression will find it relatable"
6992,"Getting the motivation to start writing and performing music is tough my dude. I would absolutely suggest searching up some beginner videos for what you wanna do (piano/vocals/wind instrument) as well as some beginnger music theory videos. Even just knowing a little more feels like a big improvement.
Best of luck buddy ❤"
6993,"Now l'm intressted, could l have a listen?"
6994,"Hey, I'm sure you CAN do all those things. I'm not an artist, but I know making it in the art world (music, drawing, movies etc) is super hard. I know for a fact that talented people struggle to succeed. It's not fair, but struggling to be professional doesn't mean you're not talented. 

Plus, depression kinda lies to you and can make everything seem pointless and horrible. I hope telling yourself that can help you hold on. 

Keep focusing on your music. But please try to get professional help for the depression if you haven't already. Depression is an awful battle and can seem hopeless often, but you CAN WIN. Therapy helped me a lot. Meds might be worth looking into too if you havent yet.

I'm rooting for you to keep living. I'm rooting for you to keep playing. I'm rooting for you to win this."
6995,"There are always options, other medications you can try. Please call 1-800-273-8255 to talk to someone, it's free and completely confidential."
6996,"I'm also a struggling musician, dude. You're not alone at all in this. But don't give up. The world needs more musicians, and it especially needs musicians who have an important message."
6997,"So i channel myself into slam poetry to deal with suffering and wanting purpose. I got down when I was watching videos of Twenty One Pilots. My brain was like ‘this dude thought like me but wrote amazing poems at 17, was like performing in his early 20’s is helping masses now, and I’m in a fearful ball of anxiety and so hopeless why cant you pull it together!’ people have even said they think I’m talented at slam poetry but their are hundreds of talented people and slam poetry doesn’t effect people the same way music does so I would think what am i doing??
I try and tell myself that fighting my battle each day is enough even though I want to compare and wish i was so much more. And maybe my poetry will mean something but even if it doesn’t I’m the only one that wrote it. I’m the only one thats lived my specific life. And maybe one person will resonate with it instead of 10 or thousands and that on matters. Just one day at a time. Hopefully something of that related to you."
6998,"You have to have hope. If you're here, you're young, meaning now is the time to put everything you have into your dreams. All successful people got where they are by starting with a desire and a drive to make it happen. However, I think that your depression goes beyond this. True happiness and hope can always be found, regardless of career. When you find inner happiness it's amazing how things start to open up because you see possibilities you didn't see before. 

&#x200B;

I'd recommend two books for you if you're interested, one is ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill, the other is ""Ask An It Is Given"" by Esther Hicks. I have to be honest and say some parts of these books are a little ridiculous and corny but they opened my perspective on a different way of thinking about life- and why putting your happiness first is genuinely the most important thing you can do for yourself, it will help you both emotionally and practically. The negative self-talk will only bring you down and bring you nowhere. Change your thinking to change your life. I promise it is possible for things to improve to a huge degree if you want them to and are willing to focus enough to get there. In my experience having an interest in music tends to mean you're a very deep-feeling and soulful person, that's a strength and you can use it to your advantage instead of letting yourself get dragged down by it. As bad as you feel, as failed as you think you are now, there is equal possibility for the same degree of joy and success. Also understand that even if you feel alone with how you feel, you are NOT. SOOOO many young people, now more than ever, are really struggling. It's sad but don't feel like you have a rare or unfixable issue, being human is tough for most of us!"
6999,I feel like this is exactly what I needed to hear
7000,Right now my girlfriend is what’s kind of keeping me grounded. I’m still here for her
7001,"I mostly play bass, but I also play a bit of guitar. I’d like to sing and play, but I’m not a great singer"
7002,"I like all kind of music, progressive rock, metal, punk rock, classic rock, everything like that. I don’t have anything really fully written or recorded yet, but maybe if it works out someday I’ll post it on this sub!"
7003,Thank you ❤️
7004,"Thank you. That really means a lot. I actually just started a new medication this morning, so here’s hoping that helps a bit"
7005,Thank you. The amount of support I’ve received on this post has been overwhelming
7006,I've played anything from stuff like Tame Impala to Artic Monkeys. Old band did originals but so far just doing covers in this one but we'll see where it take me.  :)
7007,thx man :) I'm glad I helped a little
7008,"It can be taught, techniques and tones. No different than other skills which can be practiced and improved. Think of talent as head start, but you can still win without that head start."
7009,That would be awesome!
7010,Thank you!
7011,"Unfortunately I don’t have anything fully written or recorded, but if it ever works out and I have something I’m proud of, maybe I’ll post it to this sub"
7012,Thank you. I needed to hear that. It’s inspiring that you’re able to push through your depression and follow your passion. You’re very strong
7013,"Thank you for taking the time to write this out for me. It means a lot. I’ll have to check those books out, hopefully I can start to feel a little bit better soon."
7014,MCR is back and hinting at a new album.

7071,"One of my friends I meet my freshman year was in a similar boat. He was very depressed and didn't go to any classes or do any he and eventually dropped out. He decided he wanted to live closer to home and explore other majors at a different school. He started getting help after he dropped out and moved back home. He started at a new school and is doing better. I am unsure of anymore specifics bc we weren't that close. 
Everyone goes through school at their own pace it doesn't matter if you take longer than your friends, even if it feels isolating. 
Make sure to ask professors for help if you are struggling, they are also people and are usually more accommodating than you would expect, however there are always exceptions. 
One way I stay motivated is by having a dedicated study space and by pretending to be interested in a subject matter, and tricking your brain into liking it. 
Different subreddits may be more useful for information on this topic as well."
7072,"Seek help from an academic advisor! Trust me, you are **not** behind. You just need a new game plan to approach college in the right way. I've heard stories about a lot of people who have difficulty adapting and are even required to withdraw. Eventually, they come in with a fresh perspective and new ways to help them succeed in school, and end up doing super well!

But the common theme is they need support: They can't do it alone. So find your support, take a break if need be, and come in with a fresh mind! If you want, my university's subreddit is r/ubc and I've seen a lot of really inspiring stories about failing, then succeeding :) :) :)

Good luck! Don't compare yourself to others, because everybody has different advantages + disadvantages than you do. Just compare yourself today to yourself yesterday!"
7073,"Thanks dude! Whenever I get a chance to talk to people like you I don’t know what to say. I’m hoping for tight friendships and to experience and learn more about myself because it’s hard to stray away from what i told myself i was for so long. I don’t really know what I want anymore. Also, how’s life been after the service? Miss it or anything? In my head it’s a great idea but i still feel worried I’ll somehow hate it or regret it"
7074,"Same!  I had depression bad in college and the thought of going back another semester literally made me feel sick, so I joined the Navy that summer.  That was 7 years ago, and even though it is challenging and things hardly ever go as planned, I'm actually happier for it.  

It was definitely the most impulsive decision I ever made, but it has opened me up to new experiences and I've learned so much about myself and I've grown more as a person.  

Remember to keep an open mind and use this time of financial freedom to really discover yourself.  And take advantage of tricare too to get mental health care, if you feel the need.  I'm excited for you, and I truly hope your next 4 years are amazing!"
7075,"I dropped out after my first year of college. I didn't do well in any of my classes so they took my scholarship and suggested I take out the equivalent in loans, I said FUCK THAT. That summer I signed up to my community college, stayed there for 3 semesters, improved my GPA and eventually got accepted to a 4yr school where I finally got my bachelor's in computer engineering.

As long as you're determined, it's possible- don't give up!"
7076,"I went to one of my college's counselors and signed up for short term (one semester) individual therapy. I didn't have outside therapy and this was right outside campus so it was easy for me to get to. I know there's usually a long waitlist but calling right when school opens (and also probably me self harming and having suicidal thoughts at that time) helped me get in a spot in a week or so.

Psychologists outside of your school helps but I found that the ones in the college can connect you to things that directly impact grades. My counselor helped me sign up for the Disability Resource Center (I didnt know depression woud even count) which got me longer test times and I think I could even get dates of assignments pushed back but I didnt go for that. Also found out about how I can have a class marked as Incomplete instead of a Drop or Fail, which meant that I can finish up the last bit of the class after the semester.

I didn't try this personally but if youre feeling alone, maybe group therapy in your college would be helpful.

Speaking to someone helps tremendously. Yes, you should talk to friends but also if you're struggling it doesn't hurt to reach out to your professors either. Don't use depression as an excuse explicitly, but you can say that you've been struggling and will still try your best to stay on track despite the circumstances."
7077,"I failed my first two semesters as well. The biggest thing for me was quitting my job and taking out a loan so that I could focus on school. I got the help that I needed, opened up to some people about my problems, and worked hard on really believing in myself. I just finished my first ever 4.0 semester (I think ever) and I am well on my way to my second. Believing that I could do it was huge for me, but it definitely took a lot of work and professional help."
7078,"I've failed many classes do to depression and anxiety mixed with piling on too many classes in one semester. I'm in my third year still getting my associates. I still have at least 4 classes left which I intend to space them out. I get where you're coming from, I sometimes feel the same way but every adult that I've talked to said that it's perfectly normal and it's very overrated to get schooling done so quickly. Even some of my best professors switch majors over 2-4 times while in school. You can't compare yourself to others because it's your life, you are going at your speed whatever that may be. Please take care."
7079,Failed first year of college due to depression and a whole identity change. Take a semester off. Maybe start off small again at a community college. Take it easy. Those classes aren’t as important as your well being. I took a semester off. Got a part time job and chilled and took care of myself. Started off fresh on a new spring semester rested and ready to learn at a lower level college and got on the deans list. We all grow and learn at our own pace. It’s okay to take the time to take care of yourself.
7080,"I tryharded my first year of college, it was easy when my roommates were good friends and we'd all be studying the same crap.  After that, I moved into a different apartment and while I was still friends with those people too, we were all studying different things so I'd kinda be doing my own thing, and that's when I started having serious time management, prcrastination, and motivation issues. I've had to repeat so many classes. However, even though I had to take a math class 3 times and only passed it with a C in the end, I am now a senior mechanical engineering student about to finish. Failing classes is not the end, as long as you know what you want and will still chase after it."
7081,"Yeah.

I applied for the next year, sorted myself out and ended up on a course with people I enjoy the company of.

So it all worked out in the end."
7082,"I didn't fail my first year I failed half of a semester. After that, it was a lot of studying and talking to professors about leaves. Basically keeping my mental health and my studying in check. You still got this. Talk to your professors study a bit more."
7083,"Yeah, I failed my first year of college too.

Then I decided to major in something else because I realized being a computer science major was not for me, so now I'm studying something that's a lot less demanding and I got a pretty fun job where I'm able to choose my hours and shifts and it's pretty awesome! 

I can't say I'm not depressed anymore, but the lifestyle changes that come with having a job and a somewhat easy major makes life a lot more bearable. 

You just have to make sure you're enjoying the thing you're studying at the moment because if you're not, then there's definitely something else out there for you to learn and love, and you don't have to get a job if you're unable to, you can just find something else that you love and do it at home, like a hobby :)

I hope you get all the clarity and help you need <3"
7084,Woww kudos!
7085,"I’m truly sorry you’re going through this. You aren’t alone. I was sexually assaulted and didn’t realize I was depressed until about halfway through my second semester, I just thought I was lazy and dumb. I felt dirty. Failing all of my classes only made it worse. I was referred to a progress counselor whom I talked to everyday for about a month before I broke down and told her everything I was going through, and she walked me to health services and helped me make an appointment to see the campus therapist. She helped me cope with my assault, as well as knowing that my friends would be moving on while I’d have to redo my classes entirely. 

I think the best advice I can give you is that it’s okay and you shouldn’t feel bad about being behind. Go at your own pace. If you need to take a year off, do it. If you wanna dive right back in and try again, do it. A 4-year degree in 10 years is still a degree. 

We don’t know each other, but I fully support whatever you wanna do and you can message me if you ever wanna talk. You got this. ❤️"
7086,I failed calc 1 because of a shitty professor and attention split between other classes. Keep your head up high. Rome wasn't built in a day.
7087,"I failed several classes over the course of my two years. After the summer of 2018, I decided it was just best to cut my losses and leave without a degree. My GPA was on the low range of normal, and it wasn’t going to improve with another year."
7088,"You’re not alone! I went into college as a CS major since I wanted to work in the tech industry at the time. Turns out I bit off a lot more than I could chew! It was lots of math (something I was never good at) and the curriculum was more catered towards hardcore programmers. I was failing some important classes I needed and I fell into a deep depression... considered taking a semester off.

I ended up seeing academic and career advisors and figured out that designing is more of my thing, so I changed to graphic design. I’ve always been pretty artsy, so my new major suits me well. I was a bit worried since art degrees are usually seen as more “worthless”, but went ahead anyway since this would make me happier. I’m now taking some summer classes to catch up, and I’m doing a lot better in my new major.

Don’t be afraid to reach out to someone about your options — even if it means dropping out! Exploring is a part of being a young adult!"
7089,"Not from the US, I made a test and got into a public college, failed first year too. Turns out I hate engineering.

I am still struggling but atleast I finished first and second year.

Honestly just push yourself through it. Or if you have money just change careers to something you actually like.

There is no secret, if you have questions, aks, if you need help, ask for help, shame and fear will be your biggest problems. But you have to do it. There is no other way."
7090,"I totally shucked up my first semester of college grade wise but for different reasons. I was also in cross country so my sleep schedule was very different from friends but I tried to power through anyways. My sleep schedule became about three hours a night if that so I missed out on plenty. About halfway through I was recommended to drop a couple courses and decided “no I’m friggin better than that” and it hurt my GPA to say the least.

I can’t really relate as far as mental health goes but I do remember thinking “I’m thousands of miles from home, mostly alone, about to be kicked out of my sanctuary (running), and it’s now or never”. I didn’t *need* to fix things but every fiber of my being felt like that was the case. I took it one step at a time by limiting the time I spent out, staying at other places for sleep if necessary, scheduling a tutor to keep me accountable, checking in with my teachers constantly. I came out barely passing most things and with a lot of help. Even after all that though I made a point to hold onto those teachings in the next semester even if there wasn’t the same self placed pressure.

I’m actually reading a book called “Grit” right now and it goes into saying that the difficulty in doing most things is just showing up everyday. For different people that can apply to different tasks so don’t wear yourself out trying to keep pace with everyone else. It’s not that they’re ahead of you on the path of life, it’s that they’re on a completely different path with different obstacles that can’t be compared to each other. You seem to have it in your mind to try again so you’re already on your way you just need a plan and to take each day by the horns."
7091,"I failed my first year of college too. I mean my GPA was like 1.8. I don’t know if I was depressed but I just started not going to class and just kinda made a habit of it.

I’m in second year at the moment. I’m looking into reapplying to college with a different major. But I’m not putting my bets on it tho. But I know that it’s not too late to bring up my GPA. Retaking classes is an option (which I plan to do). With online classes due to covid, I’m making an effort to, at the least, be present to class and submit all of my work. I mean I got a 3.3 this sem which is not that great but a huge step up for myself. Hopefully it goes up every semester.

Just know that it’s not the end of the world, and in the grand scheme of your life failing two semesters is probably nothing. Just try to learn from your mistakes and reach out if you need help. I’m sure your college offers counseling (academic or psychologic). Talking to other adults who have already graduated helped me a lot. It will get better. Hang on:))"
7092,"I reenlisted!  I still dont really know what I want to be when I grow up, but the military just turned out to be a good, structured lifestyle.  Since I'm in a medical job, I'll have some skills and free certifications to find some kind of job if I get out.

Take advantage of what you can, not just for your career, but for your interests and hobbies too!  I'm working on becoming a tattoo artist on the side, turns out I really enjoy that stuff.  I wouldn't have known if the navy didnt take me to California, Texas and DC.

I think the key to figuring these things out is finding what truly makes you feel some kind of passion.  I know the military isnt the answer for everyone, but as for myself and many of my friends and mentors, it changed my life for the better."
7093,Thanks for the encouragement. I really hope I figure it out. Life takes us somewhere but at least I know happy is what is at the end. Hopefully.
7094,"i know that feeling of heartbreak and it really really sucks but keep your head up and I’m sure overtime it will get better, just take your time and try to think of it as a great memory and experience instead of the end of the world. I mean you’re 19 and that’s super young and you will meet a lot of other great girls that will make you forget your ex easily. Maybe it also just wasn’t the right time but don’t give up my friend ❤️"
7095,Better now than after making a big decision (marriage) and with kids. You are young and supposed to make mistakes.
7096,"There's lots of great comments already about how you're not alone and that it's not the end of the world, so let me suggest this: work on yourself. Get some new clothes, redecorate, something to change yourself and your mindset. Also you should probably get rid of everything from your ex so that you don't have constant reminders sitting around for you to dwell over. Speaking from experience, working on improving yourself is the best way to get over someone. I wouldn't be as focused on my physical and mental health if it weren't for me trying to pick myself up from a low place. Best of luck and I'm always down to dm or something if you want"
7097,"You're 19 mate, I know it's hard but time heals all and youll feel better

Plus 19 is way to early to be thinking about marriage and seriousness, as much as it hurts, enjoy your youth while you can"
7098,"extremely similar situation here.

please, please dont let yourself get beat up over it. i wallowed in my own sadness for 2 years and i got over her in 6 months, but the lonliness and the feeling that i was alone never left.

i finally learned to make myself happy alone. so once i fifnally felt better, i decided to hit her up.

&#x200B;

she is still with the man she cheated on me with and now has a baby. while the conversation we had was a little bitter, it felt good to get closure. in the end she is happy, he is happy, and while i wish sometimes that i still had that feeling of love, i dont want any of it to be from her.

im 21 now. picked up PC as a hobby and now have something to occupy what was my vacant mind.

in the end, i guess my advice is to occupy youre mind with something you love. 

 i  learned that instead of ignoring that feeling of wanting to be scared or couldnt sleep, a short cry later and i felt a bit better. its apart of our emotions. dont let it control you. i promise if you just keep your head up and focus on school, youll come out on the other end of this."
7099,"Dont feel bad because you’re young, your feelings are real and valid no matter what age you are. I understand that feeling of losing who you thought was going to be your partner for life, and now you need to completely rethink your future and how it’ll play out. You didn’t just lose a gf, you lost your future plans and that’s huge. Don’t be afraid of feeling sad and low, honor those feelings and then let them pass through you to carve a path to better times. I’m thinking about you and wishing you the best homie"
7100,Thank you. I think when the gyms open again I will get back into shape.
7101,"Of course man, life is so hard for everyone right now and so many people are feeling lost and hopeless. I've fallen victim to that many times over the past month too. I'm sure you'll figure things out, and if you need to get anything out I'm happy to listen."
7102,"I can’t offer a huge amount of help, but just wanted to say that i was broken up with on NYE a few months back & i truly thought my world was over, we lived together, he was my first love & we had a puppy together.... only 4 months later and I hardly even remember who he is. i promise you it gets better!"
7103,"You are not alone bro. Everything’s gonna be alright at the end :) enjoy Uni, give yourself a time to process all of this, protect yourself from corona, and take it easy man 😉"

7105,Thanks you.
7106,Thank you for the support. It really helps.
7107,Thank you. School is definitely something I’ll use to distract myself.
7108,Thanks for pointing out the future part. I realize that’s the biggest reason I feel betrayed. I go to uni and study a hard program because I want to support a family and we’ve committed to that. Now I can figure out if I actually like what I’m doing. Cheers my guy.
7109,Thank you and I hope you’re thriving as well!
7110,Thanks bro. The bro’s really be being there for me rn. Cheers.
7111,Really good advice I hope I remember it when those days come. Cheers to healing my guy.
7112,"Of course and if you ever need to vent about stuff you can always dm me, I know I’m just a stranger and have no idea about your problems but I would try my best to make you feel better and listen"
7113,"Atleast for me, some calm music would help me when I was feeling down. I made a playlist specifically for myself that started out sad and gradually changed into a more upbeat tone without being in your face. Maybe something similar might help you? 

I listened to (and still do) a lot of EDEN, Halsey, and Phinneas o'Connell.
 I hope it all turns out good for you. I was in some pretty dark places at times. I just hope you dont get to where I was. <3"
7114,Thanks. I’ve realized I don’t have much to vent about. It’s just over. Shocking but it’s her decision not mine and no matter how much I play scenarios in my head nothings going to change so I might as well just move on.
7115,"I’m really sorry about that. I’d say maybe try to get rid of everything that would remind you of her too much and make you feel sad again, it will really make the process of moving on faster. Not sure if that helps but I’ve been through similar heartbreak before and I would cry every single day almost all day long and listen to sad music and just look at stuff that would make me feel worse, until I actually decided to distract myself with fun things and then I slowly started to forget and kinda get over it. It’s a long process and at the beginning I never ever believed I could ever get over that person because I really thought he was the one but it DOES get better if you work on it trust me"
7116,Thanks I know I’m young but I’ve always been liking to the future. Maybe now I can slow down and live my age and not put too many expectations on myself
7117,">FIND YOUR LIMIT

>DRINK MODERATELY

Piggy backing on that, I'd recommend finding your limit with people you know and not at a party.

Need to know your limit to...know your limit. It's not the greatest plan to go out partying when you don't know how much you can handle."
7118,"Work out what type of alcohol you like before you go and stick with it.

Don't do more than 2 or 3 shots, you will regret it. 

Make sure you go with people you trust that will be okay leaving early if you need to.

Make sure you always have a buddy with you, the worst thing is losing all your mates in a loud, dark club."
7119,"Thanks, i'll remember."
7120,I think a techno club would be great to start out. In normal clubs u will always see people forming circles with their group of friends while dancing but in techno clubs u can dance all by yourself without anyone minding. U might see a hell lot of people on drugs though what may seem disturbing at first if ur not familiar with that kind of stuff but most are more friendly than someone who is drunk. Expect higher prices if u go to a techno club as no one is spending money on drinks cuz everyone is on pills or smth else.
7121,I started partying at 21 so don't worry about being late or whatever. Most important for me was to have reliable friends who wouldn't leave me behind & would take care of me if I get drunk. People are different when they drink so be careful with drinking if you go out with them the first time. It'll be fun :)
7122,"Thanks, honestly, I constantly think about what I'm missing out, so these words calm me down."
7123,"Don't try to make up for lost time, dont get too caught up on it. Going to parties and clubbing is nice and all but if ur not responsible you can easily fall into a vice."
7124,"Ask if you can see it? I know the feeling, I had the same issue with few professors, as well. They would marked my question with half points or 0 just because they can, as it gives them some type of satisfaction, power, idk. Don’t give up because some professors gave you lower grade, some are just straight assholes, some do make mistakes and apologize. Sand the email, worst thing it can happen he or she won’t reply. Don’t worry too much, some things you cannot change, walk past by them."
7125,"I honestly recommend talking to your instructor about it. It may seem daunting but if you’re honest in your approach and tell them that you’re trying and that knowing where you went wrong on your test might help you improve as a student, they may be willing to show you your results. Or even just talking to them about how you prepared and still are feeling lost, they may be able to explain things better to you one on one vs the whole class environment. 

What they never tell you is that learning how to deal with these situations is also preparing you for the future. It’s not just the materials your professors are teaching you that will help you in life/your line of work; they’re also teaching you how to work through adverse situations and how to communicate your frustrations and needs in a constructive manner (or should be). 

Regardless of my advice; that’s a shitty situation and I’m sorry that you have to be dealing with it. I hope your situation improves and that you come out better on the other side. You can always pm me if you need to chat."
7126,"I had the same thing happen, went to prof's office hours a d went over it for a while and he gave me a lot of points back"
7127,"Saaaaaaame here. Literally the exact same situation. 

Want to be a nurse, so I went into college expecting to work hard and to get the grades I need. Spend *hours* of time doing homework every night, really focusing on chemistry cause I know I need that down. Went to study sessions, did the practice tests. 

Exam time comes and I get a 68%.....^yay

This is just chem 101. I have chem 102 and probably 15 intense bio classes headed my way. What the hell will I do in those classes if I can't manage chem 101 even while putting all my effort into it? 

Motivation got shot through the damn face, but gotta keep going at it anyway. You aren't alone, my guy. I'm right there with you"
7128,Chem 2 was my hardest class throughout undergrad & Pharmacy school lol. Don’t let it get to you.
7129,Blockbusters and chill wasnt a thing
7130,Nothing stopping you from making it a thing homie. Drive to that last Blockbuster and fulfill the prophecy
7131,We had a local rental shop here called Choices and I used to rent loads of DVDs and PS1 / PS2 games there growing up. Unfortunately they closed around 2007ish. I remember being so devastated. I get so nostalgic thinking back to it
7132,Fuck yes. Some of my favorite memories are from going to Hollywood Video and renting games or movies. It's cool I cam watch whatever whenever now but I miss browsing the movies in stores.
7133,Blockbuster was the best! Movies AND snacks in the same place? Heck yes.
7134,"Yeah it was. 70% of dates in the '90s were people going to Blockbuster, renting a Puppet Master movie, and then not watching the last two-thirds because they were too busy having sex."
7135,"I still only buy games physical because I like having the collection and being able to trade them for other games/sell them when I want to. And movies, fuck if I'm going to buy a movie then I'm gonna buy that physical too lol. Hate paying for downloads, I prefer to have something physical to show for my $"
7136,"I loved it as a kid. I could only rent one movie/game at a time so if I couldn’t choose between two before my parents went to the register, I’d place the movie or game all the way in the back of the shelf it belonged to, hoping no one else would rent it before I came back. Blockbuster and Hollywood Video were my favorite stores to browse through."
7137,"That's the same as just scrolling through Netflix or whatever service basically with extra steps lol, I want a store that I can walk around and physically view products in."
7138,"Apparently unpopular opinion but HELL no, I have few memories of blockbuster and GameStop and I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with that shit anymore. I absolutely hated having to go somewhere to just buy a game or a movie, it just felt like a waste of time. Also, I always remember blockbuster stores being super grimy and dirty and I’ve heard only bad things about them

Streaming is so much better imo, it’s nice to just instantly pay for and download something"
7139,"there's redbox, at least in nyc"
7140,Not at all. Trying to pick something to watch with my parents waiting on me was so much worse than having the freedom to find and watch whatever I want to.
7141,"I'm not sure really.

Every movie at my local blockbuster was always scratched and to scratch a Bionicle Movie DVD.... well that's a crime against human decency."

7151,i just wish we were more active. lmao.
7152,So this is where our fallen comrades go to
7153,A lot less cringey. I came here for a more sophisticated experience. R/teenagers is mostly people asking if their crush likes them or just making the same jokes over and over again
7154,"Im 15 

So im not young adults

My teachers call us young adults"
7155,"Yeah, but I still check in - love ya'll. I'm also not good with posting; it's why I left most social media (fb), or never had it (just about everything else.) Still have all my work related stuff on LinkedIn, but I rarely even look at it."
7156,"Careful what you wish for, more people is normally what makes subs turn to shit. Just look at r/teenagers"
7157,Hell yeah!
7158,I agree
7159,And without the shitty memes about highschool
7160,I feel like moving here. I hate the current state of r/teenagers since it's full of karmawhores and shitty memes. Not even sorting by new helps
7161,That's true
7162,"No it's not, it teaches you how to think about (and control) your money so when the car breaks down you're not anxiously running around wondering what to do. If you have no money saved at all and are in debt investing isn't going to help you"
7163,Save as much as you can! Try and build yourself an emergency fund of a couple thousand just in case something goes wrong. Then have your regular savings in another account. Makes you feel way more secure and in control of your money. Good luck!

7165,I didn’t even know it could go negative lol
7166,Bro that shit’s in the past. I fella forgot about that lol move on.
7167,"If you know how much money you’ll need until you get paid next and are able to pay with cash. I used to work at a credit union and I’d avoid multiple overdraft fees by pulling the whole amount of cash out of the ATM at once. That way, I was only fee’d one time. Verses using my debit card multiple times and being fee’d for each purchase."
7168,"I have faith in you my man. Hey, also I was wanting to apoglize for bothering you nearly a couple months ago and my post about how I think my life should have been life. I am sorry. I wasn't trying to bother anybody, I was just upset and was wanting to have a discussion with everybody about how I felt."
7169,America be wildin
7170,"I know that, but I was looking through your posts and you seem like a really cool guy, lol. I hope life is going well for you my friend. 🙏"
7171,Can I hold some money?

7174,"I don't know if it's common I don't really hear people talk about it but I'm in a similar situation. The last 2 semesters were really hard on me so I decided to take this semester off to get help and focus on fixing myself but also because of the zirus. But I say go for it, it really helps I've been feeling better and I think I'm ready to go for next semester!"
7175,Its okay to take a break in order to help yourself.
7176,"Your point about returning home seems like a good one. That's actually why I made this post - I came home last night. Recently I've been thinking about 200 things at once and always panicking. But I had the rationale of ""I live alone, I'm broke, COVID is happening, nursing applications open in a week, of course I'm busy.""

Then I was home and talking to my brothers, and still felt like my head was on fire. Still does, for some reason I just hadn't noticed when I was living alone. So difficult to hold a conversation, it feels like...hm, it's very hard to describe. It feels like shouting something to someone as you drive by them at 40MPH. Just so difficult to get the words out cause you're moving too fast. 

Anyway, I think moving back is a good idea. Thanks for that, and thanks for telling me about your experience! Very helpful"

7178,"I don’t think it’s bad to. I never really have been afraid to take alternative paths because the default always sounded crazy. Going straight from highschool into debt and stress is supposed to be the right move? I dropped out and took another path and will be making twice as much as I’d make had i stayed the 4 years. Without the debt and burden on my parents. 

But you shouldn’t just stop because of fear. Why are you so anxious? Feel free to take a semester off. Stop worrying about doing what’s common. That’s how you end up with people thinking the only way to have a decent life is through crippling debt and working 10 jobs at once."
7179,"I had a friend in my first year when I was also in my first year. 

She is just going back for her second year and I just graduated from my fourth. 

Not everyone does things in a certain order or a certain time frame. Live your life to be as happy as you possibly can both right in this moment and in the future. If you are so bent on getting that degree to be happy in your future, that it is taking away from present happiness, that is not good. 

Always chase positive mental health."
7180,I did. It was the best decision I've ever taken.
7181,"from what I’ve heard, it’s normal. I’ve taken this semester off because just at the end of last semester because I was suicidal and took the steps to get better. I’m almost certain the numbers of people mentally unstable through college are far higher than what people think"
7182,"I took medical leave for the first semester of my junior year of college because of depression and anxiety. I was at my lowest point in my life. I'm glad I did it then when I only had myself and my then fiance now husband to worry about. It would have been a million percent more difficult to keep putting off my mental health and have a mental breakdown when if I had kids and a job to juggle as well. Please. If you can do it now, do it now. Don't wait to prioritize yourself."
7183,"There's no time limit or due date for your degree. Go at a pace you are comfortable at. It's like running, you go all out at the beginning, you'll gas out. Going at your own pace will be easier mentally on yourself, which you need if you are struggling, and will ensure you have the energy and capacity to finish eventually. Sure, it won't be 4 years, school is over, boom here's the bachelor's. But you will finish, which is what is MOST important."
7184,"Couldn’t agree more, had the exact same happen to me. Really awful anxiety and depression kept me hidden away and failing everything. Instead of using Christmas break to fix myself I let it continue into the next semester and failed out of college. Took a gap year (YWAM) and am now set to graduate in a month with a 3.2 (from a .9) and bachelors in digital media. If I hadn’t taken that time not only would I have most likely killed my self but if I didn’t I’d be a shell of my current self. 

It’s a bummer to be a semester behind, but it’s far worse to try and force something and get stuck with the consequences. It took 3 years and around 50k to work out of the hole my first year left me in. Love yourself and take the time, there are many valuable skills u can learn outside of college that won’t ruin you"
7185,"I don't think it's bad at all! What do you plan on doing with the off time? Also many people don't realize thus but when your not working or going to school you're actually living life (that is, you have the opportunity to pursue and do what you want)

Good luck with the freedom :) we are always here for you!"
7186,It should be
7187,"I started having anxiety on my first year of college and its one of the reasons I failed all but one of my clases 3 times in a row witch in turn got me discharged from school, I could not get my shit togethet.After that I started seeing a therapist and applied for a different college. Now im finishing up my first semestre and i am doing pretty good, so dont worry to much, you are not alone."
7188,Yes it's normal! I took a semester off and it was such a good decision.
7189,Yes it is fairly common. Anybody that would judge somebody for doing so is just a bad person.
7190,"I would say it's pretty common! There's no shame in taking a mental health break, especially if you feel like it's impeding your productivity and causing more harm. 

I took a quarter off my sophomore year of undergrad after my best friend died the previous quarter. Had I not I probably would have failed out of my major. My best advice would probably be to have an action plan of what you want to get done during your time off. This doesn't have to be concrete but it's much better to have a plan than to sit around and wallow in depression. For example, I said I would make an effort to go back to therapy, start medication again, and reach out to my university's center for accessible education in order to get the accommodations I needed. Taking time off for mental health reasons is definitely not talked about enough due to stigma, but I can assure you that it's completely normal to feel like you need to take a break. 

(Also if it makes you feel better, needing to take a mental health break is not an indication of your success in the future as I've struggled with mental health all my life and am now thriving in a well paying job I love)"
7191,"That's great to hear about, thank you for sharing! 

That end bit you have on there is particularly reassuring. I've been thinking that, as a college student, these are the years where I really start to shape myself. Following that, I've been thinking that an anxiety problem now means I'll have an anxiety problem forever. 

Very nice to hear that you did not have that experience! That's reassuring. Thank you again"
7192,"Yes! It's very common in my community! I know multiple people who have done this :)

It's ok to rest when you need it. Your mental health is more important than school will ever be :)"
7193,"It's fairly common, yeah. I've done it and many of my friends have done it as well."
7194,"I'm not sure how common it is to actually take a break, but I had a few friends do this and I came close. I already had anxiety and college just made it WAY worse. I thought it was just burnout—I was emotional, couldn't focus, was maybe a quarter of the student I was in high school. I tried anxiety meds to try to stop by mind from racing, did a little counseling, tried different course loads, and nothing really helped. I graduated in May and just found out a couple months ago that I actually have ADHD!!  I'm just starting to get the care I wish I'd gotten in school. I ended up doing pretty well academically in the end, but also ended up shirking some leadership responsibilities and isolating myself from my friends, which was a huge mistake.

All in all, I wish I'd listened to my gut and took a gap year or some time off to work on myself before going through that hell. I'm still paying the price.

A couple of my friends did take leave of absences for similar reasons and ended up transferring into totally different programs closer to home and getting help, and they're much happier.

You're definitely not alone, and it's great you're already getting help and thinking about your needs! That can be really hard. Good luck!"
7195,"Yes. You can go your degree at 26, 30, 36. Whenever you're ready. But your degree shouldn't cost you your long-term mental health. That's not something you can drop out of. Your career isn't a race. If you need a semester off to make it to the finish line in one bit, it's better to finish late and in one piece than in 1st place and crumble as soon as you step off the podium. Burnout is real.

Be mindful some colleges only allow a 1 year gap between studies"
7196," I actually love getting older (21 , so maybe that’ll change).. every year I feel more and more comfortable in my own skin, I gain confidence, and I find new ways to invest in my future. Granted this year has been a weird one with a lot of extra time for introspection... but I’m really looking forward to growing old with my love and eventually buying a house, those simple things."
7197,Turning 23 in a few weeks and I feel like ive wasted my life so far. I hate it.
7198,"Less responsibility back then. I feel the same way. I'll be 23 in December and I always look back on my late teen years and I'm like, damn... which I could have the same kind of 'fun' lol."
7199,Good to know. I'll skip that age.
7200,I’m turning 23 next month... I feel like 2020 cheated me out of what other wise would’ve been a really cool year. February felt like such potential and then everything went to hell 🙁
