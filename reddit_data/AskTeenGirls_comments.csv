Unlike tomatoes, mangoes actually taste like fucking fruit. That’s why girls don’t like tomatoes! They pretend to be something they aren’t, a fruit, but we all know that tomatoes are actually unholy abominations of the fruit kingdom, and they aren’t even vegetables either! They are deceiving, but mangoes are what the perfect fruit looks and tastes like: Shiny, smooth, original shape, tastes godly, chicks love that type of stuff.

361,I say connect-I-cut for spelling
362,"The true sinners say Febuary and libary.

In all seriousness, though, it’s a result of the retaining of archaic spelling for words which originally made phonological sense when written (something not uncommon for languages, but used in excess in English). For example, would, should, and could were pronounced with the l, and the gh in rough, light, through, thought, trough, etc. (distinctly varying pronunciations) were digraphs all substituting for the same one sound (which I believe were similar to the German digraph pronunciation of ch, or ç in the IPA). The spelling of Wednesday is just an example of the same feature, albeit to a far lesser degree."

452,She hid the chandelier in Berlin
453,"High prices, if we're being honest"
454,"Pretty much this. The name “Victoria”, suggests some kind of classiness and allure. Someone very prim and proper. While her secret may not necessarily mean her “naked body” but the fact that behind closed doors she wears all sorts of racy lingerie."

she'll appreciate it if you treat her like an adult btw"
542,"What did you do when you took away her electronics? Like, how long did you take them away for? Would you just give them back the morning after?"
543,"I would take them away an hour or two before bedtime, and give them back in the morning."
544,"Try taking them away before bed, or whenever you'd prefer, and hold onto them until she starts going to bed at the proper time on a regular basis.

For example, if she's been going to bed when she's supposed to for a few days, wait an extra day before giving her electronics back"
545,"instead of a bedtime, set her an early hour to get up at, and if she doesn't get enough sleep, it's her fault, because she knew, when she will have to get up. plus, if she only gets 5 hours of sleep, (like 1am to 6am) she will probably be so tired, that she will go to sleep earlier the next day."
546,She’s old enough to deal with some amount of sleep deprivation. She bares the consequences so just let her do what she thinks is good for her.
547,"An interesting idea, I will definitely try it. Wish me luck though because I can't imagine she will like it :p"
548,"As a teen, scientifically her body is going through changes, as well as her “internal sleep clock”. Her body is programming to have more energy longer, hence the reason it’s difficult for her to fall asleep at a reasonable time. There’s many different things to try & possibly combine all of them:

1. Get her to be active throughout the day. Burn off some of that energy. Make sure she’s not lounging in bed all day, or it’s difficult for her body to understand when it’s time to “chill” & when it’s time to actually sleep. 

2. Less screen time, definitely. Technology is additive & if it’s at her hands she could easily stay up all night on electronics. Teach her responsibility with this though - don’t completely take it away (she will resent you) but teach her healthy amounts. Technology is great for socializing & learning, so teach her how to use it as a tool, as well as in moderation.  

3. Melatonin. Melatonin is a non-additive drug & it’s impossible to OD on it. It helps your body create more melatonin to relax & let your body know it’s time to sleep. It won’t knock you out, like many other “sleep drugs” on the market. 

4. Make sure she has a comfortable area to sleep - this is so important. She needs to me comfortable with her surroundings (living with you, etc). Pitch black rooms help a lot, relaxing sounds can help, comfortable pillows & blankets, etc. 

5. Setting a routine genuinely really helps - even if it’s not at the same time every night! If you take a nice hot shower, put on a face mask, brush your teeth, wash off the face mask then wash your face, read a book for a while, then shut off the lights & snuggle into bed (or something along the lines of this - whatever she would like!) it’ll help her relax & set a sense of stability. 

6. Be understanding, but be firm. Understand it’s a difficult transition in her life. Understand she’s going through changes. Understand this must be hard for her! However, be firm. If you create rules, stick to them. If bedtime is 11 on weeknights & 11:30 on weekends, make sure you keep to your word. 

When I was 13 & 14 I went though a “phase” of insomnia. I would not sleep for NIGHTS in a row & even on nights I didn’t get some rest, it was difficult to fall asleep. With a combination of these things + growing older, I eventually got a good sleep routine. If anything, the exhaustion will eventually catch up to her & she will figure it out. You’re an awesome brother. Best of luck :)

Edit: someone mentioned you shouldn’t take a ton of melatonin at once, even if it is impossible to OD & they’re absolutely correct. 2 mg is plenty for one nights sleep. By my statement I simply meant it’s not harmful, nor will it knock you out, like many other “sleep drugs”. :)"
549,"Physically teenagers require 9 1/2 hours of sleep to physically function. https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/sleep-disorder-center/sleep-in-adolescents
It doesn't matter how much sleep you think you need, you're typically wrong. This number can actually peak at 11 hours for some individuals. 8 hours is the number for fully fledged adults. A lack of sleep can cause a number of things including but not limited to exhaustion, slower learning, lack of comprehension, aches and pains, slower brain development, and weight gain. Sleep is way more important than anybody realizes and we should be encouraging people to sleep as much as they can. It's the only period of time where your body and brain can repair itself because it's not spending energy keeping you conscious."
550,"Be firm about it. I myself had some sleep issues where I’d stay up for hours in school nights. Maybe find something to inspire her to sleep. I know it sounds stupid. I got really interested in lucid dreaming, and that requires healthy sleep. There’s also a lot of really bad health effects from lack of sleep, especially when they start at such a young age. Scare her with some statistics. That helped me."
551,Yeah with homework and sports it’s pretty much impossible to get more than 8 so.
552,"YES!! Not saying you do, but talking down to someone in teenage years is something teenagers hate, so always try to make them feel like they're on a different level to you emotionally/mentally (which they actually are)."
553,Tell that to our teachers.
554,Oh damn imo 10pm is so early. I don't know when does her school start?
555,Bruh I don't have a bed time but I just go to bed at 10 most nights
556,Yeah I think around 23:30 is when she should go to sleep to get the 8h of sleep. I treat 8h of sleep as a golden number for being well rested. But also I always stay late even that I know when I should go to sleep.
557,"It doesn't sound stupid, it sounds like a good idea and I'm happy to look into it. Thanks!"
558,"8:30am, but she needs to leave home by 7:30am"
559,"This is a high effort post, I really appreciate it. She definitely doesn't get enough exercise at the moment, it's something we can both improve so I'll give that a go. I'm also going to speak to her doctors about melatonin I think, I've heard a few good things about it now and I'll see what they say. I've tried talking to her about whether she is comfortable and feels safe with me, but I never know if she's lying tbh.

I'm glad to hear you are doing better sleep-wise, it's such an important thing, yet it's such a pain in the ass to get right sometimes. Best of luck to you too, although something about your writing tells me you are less lucky and more hard-work-y.

Edit: I didn't give you silver just so you know"
560,"Lol yeah, they never do. Best of luck trying to get her to go to bed my guy"
561,Lmao I wonder how many of us actually have time to sleep 9 1/2 hours.
562,Agree!
563,You’re also 4yrs older and probably more responsible than she is rn
564,"8hrs is expecting she will get up and just leave. At the very least she needs to plan half an hour for breakfast and getting dressed, but it’s definitely more reasonable to allocate an hour for that. Hence 1030 sounds like a good time for 8 hours of sleep."
565,If she has An iPhone go to screentime then click on downtime.  Set downtime from whatever-11.  I assume she is staying up on her phone.
566,[deleted]
567,"I'm not going to (I swear), but I actually think our mother would be ok with that, as messed up as that is."
568,"Exercise definitely helps! Make sure it’s during the day - too close to bedtime & it can actually give you a boost of energy. 

It’s difficult to go through such changes & it must be difficult for her to be able to open up all the way. Keep doing your thing - be empathetic & give her a shoulder to lean on. If she hasn’t already, she’ll come around. 

I appreciate the kind words, keep doing what you’re doing :-)"

I have mostly guy friends because I feel like I can just be myself around them more, without having to worry about "" is so-and-so wearing Nike and Adidas at the same time?! ew!"". Plus boyfriends are the best, and hugging them makes me want to turn into a pile of marshmallow fluff."

661,"(Boy btw) The color of hearts is a massive factor I think people need to remember about texting, I'm assuming she knew reds meant love, if she didn't then that's would make sense but still be weird. But the amount of times I've had my friends come up to me and brag about yellow and blue hearts is mind boggling to me"
662,"My thoughts: of she cheated on her current boyfriend with you, it’s not too unlikely she’ll cheat on you with someone else if you get together"
663,Thanks I appreciate it
664,But you also have to take into account the person. I dated a goth girl and she only sent black  hearts. 🖤
665,"No problem man. But just a heads up I've dated a girl that sounds exactly like the girl your describing and I can not recommend to you enough to not get involved, cause chances are if she's willing to cheat on her current boyfriend she'd be willing to cheat on you. But hey I'm just some random dude on the internet and I for sure as hell dont know everything so take it with a grain of salt."
666,[deleted]
667,Regardless she isn't being loyal to one of you teo and that's already a red flag
668,"Yeah but I’ve got a friend that we are close and she sends me the black heart sometimes, but just as a friendly token. Orange/yellow hearts are friendly as well, blue hearts are usually a “thanks for listening to my sob story I feel a little better”, and red/pink hearts are definitely a “I like you”"
669,"“if she cheats with you, she’ll cheat on you”"
670,"dude im one of those girls who says i love you to everyone like  138458 times a day and if I had a boyfriend I would def create boundaries and make my intentions and relationships clear and instead of saying ""i love you"", itd be more like ""night, i love you dude"", so your friend might be right"
671,"Believe your friend. It sucks because you like this girl, but you dont want to be involved with cheating at all, I can guarantee it leads absolutely nowhere good; I havent been cheated on or been helping someone cheat but I have has personal experience with it in the past and no matter how you're in the mix of it I can say nothing good is gonna happen to you regarding relationships for a long time. Best wishes and I hope you can get over her since its looking like you'll have to."
672,"Yeah, chances are she cheated on her boyfriend. I don't know anybody who says that stuff to everybody."
673,Big oof it’s been 2 hrs
674,"I know someone who does this, but you’re right I’m pretty sure absolutely almost no one does it too."
675,"your friend is right. trust me. i’ve been through this before and i’ve heard that excuse from the person who cheated on me. and please, don’t date her. i hate to be blunt but you probably aren’t the only person she’s texting this stuff too. if anything she probably has other guys on the back burner in case her boyfriend dumps her so she can rebound quickly, and i promise you she’ll probably end up cheating on them also. don’t get yourself involved with a person like that, you deserve better. i’m sorry you’re going through this /:"
676,Oh no😣
677,Always trust a friend than a girl.
678,"thats rough ive been in a similar situation. she aint worth your time anyway

also u can add a flair to your name with your age and gender it helps add context"
679,same lmao
680,It sounds like her relationship may be leaving her unfulfilled emotionally. Stay away from her because she sounds like she might like to cause trouble. The drama is unimportant chief.
681,Ditch her ass right now like u/tqtzling said. trust your friend
682,No
683,Agreed. Context is also important.
684,"I had this happen to me too, just reverse. His gl found our “friend” texts and got mad. Hseemed like he wised up to his crazy girlfriend and they broke up and he said he’d date me. Thinks where the issues started. 

I was pining after him regardless of this asshole girl he’d dated for like a year and a half. He had me erapped around his finger, able to bang her but still talk to me.

Just walk away. I should’ve instead of pining after a guy who was manipulating me."
685,"Your friend is half right. She wasn't cheating on him, and she probably does talk to everyone that way (so do I), but she was leading you on and got caught."
686," My female friends tell me they love
Me daily doesn’t imply romance"
687,"Hearts are already a pretty big indicator, as they symbolise affection. I'm aware you can change the colour of a heart to show the kind of affection, but if it wasn't a yellow one (friendship) then we may have a problem.

Secondly, I wouldn't be saying ""I love you"" to anyone other than my boyfriend, parents or friends. There is a chance she is joking of course but this is only for friends who affectionately tell me I'm annoying (""Haha love you too""). Girls do say I love you to each other a lot of the time, but as to whether they say this to guy friends, I doubt it.

So.... I'd go with your friend's advice. If she cheats on her current partner, she'd probably cheat on you.

Of course it's your choice if you want to go through with it but that's really telling what kind of person she may be.

EDIT: on second thoughts yes it does happen but it is almost always followed up by ""joking"" or ""platonically"" if the girl really does not want the other to think they harbour feelings for the other person. So if it's not obvious that she does not like you, and she sends you such stuff, chances are she does like you"

709,Where is my third nipple??
710,Im confused. Where is my third boob?
711,"Could I just say that, while I don’t condone staring at boobs, it’s not always (perhaps not even usually) a conscious thing. I often find myself just zoning out and unfocussing my eyes, at which point I just stare into the distance and if there happen to be boobs there it can get awkward. Of course it does happen intentionally too but don’t always be quick to recriminate."
712,It's not even remotely perverted to educate yourself! Knowledge of anatomy is important.

Either way, I still think the boys locker room memes are funny"

750,It's weird because she's 15. Lots of people make accounts where they share porn and NSFW content or make NSFW textposts while they're in relationships but she's 15 and publicly (aggressively) lusting after adult celebrities. No one needs to hear a 15 year old girls sex fantasies about some adult.
751,That’s weird. Talk to her about it if it’s bothering you.
752,I mean if my gf was making theses posts I'd be concerned too.
753,What songs would you play?
754,"Dunno, I guess I feel like it's sligthly weird."

760,"No you’re not over reacting, just be honest and tell her how it makes you uncomfortable. Good luck✨"
761,"From what comes to my knowledge, many girls say stuff about celebrities (not necessarily NSFW).

I’d still say it’s not normal though"

766,"What if a guy made the same thing for female celebrities? 
He would be labelled pervert and creep. 
Yes this is 100% not normal behaviour."
767,"Definitely not. A relationship is set with boundaries and if she’s pushing them with the Twitter account, it’s well within your right to talk to her.

My boyfriend and I have agreements to make sure each of us are comfortable and can trust the other."
768,I would talk to her about it.  I think that's pretty weird.
769,Glad to be back
770,"Wtf? 

Nah bro you aren’t overreacting, that’s fucking weird. 

I generally don’t give a shit about nsfw accounts, but this girl is 15.

Who even wants to know about a kid’s sexual fantasies about real life adults?

I’d be super uncomfortable if I was dating a guy like that.

In a relationship, you should respect boundaries. If this is making you uncomfortable, you should really talk to her about it."

778,"no it’s understandable to not be okay with that since it’s inherently sexual. if she doesn’t respect your feelings that’s a red flag.


side note: nsfw twitter is no place for teenagers i was on there for a little while and it really warped my perception of relationships (among other things). if i were you i’d try to get her off altogether but don’t force it."

I ordered a badge, cuffs, the whole shebang, and I wore all orange. I also got this little heart pin off Amazon, and I put it on the blue shirt, tucking it under the collar. At school, she goes, puts on the shirt over her own, buttons it up, and I go to fix the collar for her. I unpin the heart and present it to her.

“Officer, I think you’ve stolen my heart, I’m going to have to cuff you”"
783,"Ya say that now, the girl I asked said “fuck no” and walked away."

785,Guess nobody ever gets asked out
786,"Well.. I might do this in a few days (so it hasn’t actually happened yet) but this girl I’ve been talking to, is in an ongoing meme war with me, and we make memes that are very personal and cute. So I think I’ll make a meme that asks her out.. not sure"
787,Yeah but atleast got a couple answers in ATB

Then she moved and it didn’t."
789,"I've never dated anyone BUT if I were to ask someone out (which i probably wont because I lack confidence and wont be able to really tell what my emotions are) here's how I would do it: 

1. Are you gay? Because I'm gay. We can be gay together 

2. Are you trash? Because I want to take you out. Even if you're not trash I know for a fact that I'm complete trash please take me out.


Also one time my friend asked a girl out by sending her a playlist where the titles made the sentence ""will you go out with me"". We're in middle school they dated for like a month."

800,"My freshman year a sophomore in my math class and i had been talking for a week or so and he told me he had two questions to ask me at the football game. Im a cheerleader ans a baton twirler for my school so after i performed at halftime he met me at the bandstands (surrounded by a ton of people) and asked me to HOCO with a sign that said, ""HOCO would be b'aaaaaaaaaaaad without us so wool ewe be mine at HOCO?"" We got so caught up in that and the fact that i had to go back to cheering thag he forgot to ask me the second question. He called me after the game and asked me to be his girlfriend. 

My 5th-grade year i told a guy that i liked him and like a week later he came up to me on the swings and was talking to me very awkwardly and then another guy in our grade came up to us ans asked if we were dating. The guy i liked said ""yes."" Then he stayed by me and after the other guy left the one i liked hair said, ""So? Would you want to?""

893,Much more noise pollution our side probably?
894,well that's what I do normally
895,Damn ok
896,Let's attack one problem at a time ok
897,"During the day, there is a lot of background and idle noises, like the wind and animals, and if you live on a busy street, cars and people.

But at night there isn't much of those noises"
898,Nope
899,^
900,bro that’s kind of gay
901,Hell yeah it is

906,"reading these answers, i’m starting to worry if girls do this to me"
907,Nice
908,"They probably do, if you think about it."
909,Can you link the post about the bulges? For.... research purposes?
910,"~~(Girls can be gay too)~~

There are good asses and bad asses and idk how to describe it ~~but captain america got some nice ass~~"
911,"And what do you like about ass? Were the ones doing you, which is why we like it, but what makes you like it on us? Assuming the ""F"" in your flair means your a girl."
912,Nice
913,Just stare at their ass to assert your dominance. Don't let them win
914,Obviously
915,Nobody had the balls to ask but this guy did. Not all heroes wear capes
916,I wanted to comment exactly this with the . and all
917,"When your so short your at butt level of all the tall people, you would look at more than a few asses throughout the day, whether you want to or not"
918,Nice
919,"Lemme tell you a story:

My friend was (and still kind of is) basically scared of anything sexual. She hates listening to anyone talk about it and I can’t imagine she even thinks about it. However, my classmate’s ass has completely transformed her. Every time he walks by she goes “daaaaamn” and she talks about it all. the. time, and honestly I agree. I was gonna go get water in the cafeteria two weeks ago and I saw this amazing ass and I just couldn’t stop staring and then I kind of recognised it and when I looked up boom it was my classmate. 

TL;DR: asses are amazing especially my classmate’s, we love you E.

- Sincerely, a girl."
920,Yes
921,dude thats a lil gay ngl bro
922,Hentai!
923,That's Americas ass
924,Nice
925,Nice
926,Hell yeah it is
927,And we're called pervs for that
928,the equivalent of tall guys looking where they’re walking and accidentally have some boobs get in your sight
929,Nice
930,"some people are just bad at texting i guess, i know a lot of people like that who are great irl but over text have terrible replies. she probably thinks that her replies are fine if she’s always the first one texting you, she probably just doesn’t realise how hard they are to reply to."
931,"That always be a bit of a turn off. Not really sexually but like I hate dry convos.

But this comment is kinda dry so I guess it’s hypocritical"
932,"I got no answer, but I can relate too 100%"
933,"Same here. The girl I’m dating now is suuuuuuuuuuper talkative irl, but practically mute if texting. I thought that I’d upset her about something the first two weeks just because she never really texted."
934,"I try to keep a nice, wet conversation, but typically when this happens to me, it's usually guys trying to hit me up."
935,"Like are we guys expected to keep the conversation interesting without having the girl actually contributing?

Sometimes it just ends with me desperatly asking questions to somehow make the girl interested while she just responds with; *""Oh, idk""*. Even if she was the one who contacted me.

Girls of Reddit, Please answer this mans question for all of us"
936,"A yes, I too like my conversations nice and wet."
937,Is she ExAmish?
938,"Indeed, it's the best kind of conversation"
939,Bruh face sammmeee
940,Maybe you could ask her to ft if she's not into texting or she's bad at it
941,"Yeah I’m a terrible texter, the worst you’ve ever seen"
942,"Somethings people are bad texters, I have the problem where I can’t really talk in text very well but if it was in person I’m fine"
943,"This was my first idea. OP ask to call or FaceTime, it might be easier for her to talk over that!"
944,"You know what they say, “If your conversation isn’t moist, you have no choice” or something like that idk"
945,Wet convo > dry convo
946,Words to live by
947,"Yes, as the saying goes, ""if your convo ain't soggy, you ain't ready for doggy...""

^^plskillme"
948,"If your convo isn't damp, you're a tramp

^idk"
949,"I kinda get stressed out about texting and embarrassing myself. Unless i know the person pretty well, i prefer to talk face to face (although that doesnt help much anyway, i just prefer it)."
950,Yeah cause I’ve gone to the chicks house and it’s super chill and when we’re texting I get so damn anxious and annoyed
951,"If your convo isn't steamy, you're a filthy commie
 
*I think this is a good point to stop...*"
952,^agreed
953,"i'm also an incredibly bad texter, but can hold a convo irl"
954,"Tbh then you should say that to the guy you're texting, ask to meet up or talk on the phone etc."
955,I need to find a girl like that! I absolutely suck at texting...
956,"She might be a bad texter, I know I am and I have a lot of trouble making conversation over text but in person I’m fine"
957,"Generally we’re trying to see if you are interested too. If I hit someone up, I feel like I’ve made the first move and if they feel mutual, they should try to make a bit of an effort. You shouldn’t be expected to always carry on a conversation, but if it’s early in the texting stage, she’s most likely trying to gauge your interest level."
958,Aight I fw it

960,"i think something simple you can give her with a lot of meaning is perhaps a name necklace w/her name on it, not her deadname! she could wear it forever & always think of you, itd really symbolize your acceptance of her imo. you can get them on etsy or other sites for around $15!"
961,"Oh, the name on the birth certificate is Tyler so I will talk to her about changing it. Thank you alot!"
962,"I'm a cis lesbian, so I'm going to come at this from an LGBT perspective, but keep in mind that I don't have the same struggles that trans people do. 

The biggest thing you can do to help her is loving her unconditionally. I constantly sit in fear that my parents will find out I'm gay and kick me out of the house, so the fact that she felt safe enough to come out to you is a good sign. Try to avoid misgendering her (which you seem to be doing great at, might I add) and use her new name and I think those things will greatly relieve her dysphoria. Also, maybe take her shopping or have one of those mom-daughter date things where you get your nails done or something like that. I know with the quarantines we can't really do that, so maybe even just sit down with her and talk about whatever girly things she wants to and paint each others nails. Its affordable and accessible. 

Also, Ace might have some other ideas on this."
963,"you’re all good, it’s like the name on their birth certificate. 

for example, before she came out to you, you probably referred to her by a male name right, for example joseph. 

that’s a “deadname” because it’s like a name that reminds them of i guess before their transition? sorry i don’t know a ton about trans issues, but i do have a few trans friends haha. however, referring to a trans person by their deadname can be really triggering, because it reminds them of their body dysmorphia and being misgendered.  

if she hasn’t come up with a new name yet, maybe you guys can discuss it together? for example, josephine instead of joseph!"
964,I'm sorry what does dead name mean?
965,"I'm transgender so I might be of some help. Try to use her new name and she/her pronouns alot more than you usually would. Ask her if she would like to go buy some more feminine clothes. If she wants, let her grow her hair out. If she's 16 or older, you might want to ask her if she'd like to start HRT. Those were all the ideas I could think of."
966,"no problem, good luck!!!"
967,"Oh no I am really sorry! Some parents really dont deserve to be parents! I would NEVER do something like that to a child for expressing themselves

And thank you for the advice!"
968,"She is 14 so I think we will wait on that, I will let her grow her hair out and try and buy some nice clothes when i do have the money"
969,It’s marked girls only so I’ll say here; treat her like a human being
970,Of course my love for her will never change and she is still a person
971,"I’d suggest reaching out to a professional and maybe her paediatrician (but make sure they’re open minded and not transphobic). They can help  open a discussion with you and her daughter, and to figure out what’s next to do and to see if she’d be right with hormone blockers. I’d suggest maybe a therapist that specialises in exactly this situation, in order to help her navigate this. 

In terms of how you can support her, make sure to let her know you still love her no matter what and you want wants best for her. Treat her the same, she’s the same person, just a different gender. But she might start letting you in on a different more feminine side of her."
972,"Hi! 

Just by the fact that you are here means you are trying to exept her for her for who she is and is a sign your a great mother!

I am not trans but gender fluid, if you want more advice I would say go on r/lgbtteens and ask how they feel.

Also this advice is coming fromy experience with trans friends. 

Youre saying daughter so im asuming shes MTF (Male trans Female) meaning she was born a boy but feels like a girl? 


1) First thing you do is make sure she knows that you love and support her. She will always have a home with you no matter what. Even if you know that you have supportive parrents coming out is a nerve racking experience. The worst outcomes play in your head over and over. ""What if they hate me?"" ""What happens if they send me to conversion therapy?"" ""What if they kick me out?!"" So make it clear



2) ask if she has a name and for her pefered pronouns. Some trans people are fine with their names but others arnt. My male name is Gregory for example. Ask her for her name, make sure that you use this name and not her dead one. It may take a while to get used to it but just the fact that you're trying is good!



3) ask who shes outed to, who its ok to say their name in front of. I have only outed to one close friend, she calles me by my male names on those days but stays quiet in front of my mother. Asl who knows and who you can tell.




4) Complement her femine qualitys ""that is a pretty dress!"" ""You really know how to do makeup!"" ""You look beautiful sweatheart!"" Complements are very upbringing, when you complement a trans person on their pefered genders qualities and is so upbringing and can quickly turn a shitty day into a good one! (If they are a trans guy do the same but in vice versa ""nice jacket!"" ""Nice hair!"" ""Look at my handsome young man!"")




5) Dont be afraid to correct people they've outed to. If somebody that knows they are trans and still uses the wrong pronouns or name be quick to correct them. Even when you do it dont just brush it over go ""oh im so sorry I meant, [correct name or pronoun]"" and dont be afriad to get firm if they are obviously doing it on purpose!




6) ask if they want any clothes to go with them. This can include chest binders, masculine clothes. Makeup, dresses, skirts. Anything to help them deal with their dysphoria




7) you cant quite yet due to the fact that we are in a pandemic, but when this is over help them look into LGBTQ+ comunitys or hangouts in your area they can go to if they need support that yoy cant give them. (This is not a reflection on your parrenting skills, im just a believer in you cant quite understand something unless youve been through it) so they can reach out to somebody that understands the situation better. Still be there for them and make it clear you can go to you for anything! Also when this clears up, pride parades! Its very uplifting being surrounded by people that been through what youve been through. Dont worry alot of people go. LGBTQ+ Singles, couples, trans people, gender fluid people, parrents of LGBTQ+ children, bisexual people in a ""hetero"" relationship and even straight people without lgbtq+ children just there to show their support!



Honestly you are such a great person for reaching out! I wish I had a mother like you :) 


Your child is very lucky!"
973,"Okay so. I’m a trans girl. I have four/five big things that you should always keep in mind:

1. User her name and pronouns. If she wants to be called Jessica call her Jessica. If she wants to be referred to as she or her then use she or her. You don’t need to do it 100%, just try your hardest!

2. Do not overemphasis the fact you’re using the correct words.

3. Don’t force her to come out to others or pressure her to do so. From your other comments I can tell that you definitely won’t be able to pay for hormone therapy, which sucks for her but that’s life. This means it’ll probably be a while before she’s okay with coming out to others but it isn’t certain ofc.

3b. As an offshoot: Don’t make decisions without her approval. Ask her if she wants to buy a skirt before just buying her one. Ask her if she wants makeup before buying her it. Ask her if she wants to stop getting haircuts before refusing to give her haircuts. This is HER journey, not yours. You are however the person who can help her with this journey. 

4. If you need to ask a question or have something defined for you ask it. A lot of words are probably gonna be knew to you if you aren’t already familiar with trans culture. It’s okay to ask!

No matter what just make sure she’s happy. Love her and make sure she feels safe. 

Good luck miss! I’m so glad to hear you want to help your daughter :)"
974,u/Acethebot might have some good ideas too
975,"You both might want to look at hormone blockers, which delays puberty until she's ready to start HRT, so she doesn't get the negative effects of going through the wrong puberty. You're an awesome parent."
976,"what the fuck? she clearly just referred to her daughter as a her, because that’s who she is, a trans girl. it’s not “transphobia” it’s transphobia. you’re blatantly misgendering her, the reason why that suicide rate is so high is because of bigots like you."
977,Thanks for @ing me Jude <3
978,Ooooh Naomi is cuuute
979,"Then you are doing a lot more than some LGBTQ+ parents, thank you, keep it up!"
980,[deleted]
981,Thank you so so so much dear! Also I am sorry but what is gender fluid? I dont know alot about the LGBT but I want to learn
982,"Thank you, I will look into that!"
983,"I am going to try and save money for her therapy and things, and I was thinking of getting her a small gift and thank you!!"
984,Hello. I dont think it was very nice of you to refer to my daughter as a he. And I dont want to force her not to be herself. She is clearly happy being a woman.
985,No problem. Do you mind not calling me jude? It's an old reddit account and Jude's my deadname.
986,"I will, because it is the truth. You are quite a hateful person"
987,"I don't know much myself, but from what I do know Genderfluid is like belonging to neither gender- some days the person might feel more masculine, and others more feminine."
988,"Yeah, it's fine, you had no way to know. It's Nao or Naomi."
989,"Thrift shops have a lot of cute clothes, especially ones geared for females. I do most of my shopping at Ross too if you have one nearby. You can get a nice T-shirt for like as low as $2.99. And if she wants to experiment with makeup tjmaxx usually has Sephora brands on clearance (just make sure they’re tampered not with). You’re such a sweet mom trying to do what you can for her :)"
990,Its hot
991,Just don't stare cause it makes us uncomfortable ofc. But personally I don't care.
992,Hey I just saw you ask if you could change your name
993,Bill cosby 🤤
994,I wish I could change my username
995,Not really. Noticing is fine.
996,What's wrong with the name pizzaspider? It's sexy.
997,You know how I said pizzaspider is a sexy name? Well kittensmasher69 is a fuckton more sexy.
998,No?? It’s not a secret I wear a bra
999,Yep
1000,No I don’t. If I’m wearing a top that exposes my bra I’m expecting there to be soke looks.
1001,Guess I found Shane Dawson's undercover reddit
1002,"I mean, my bra isn’t a secret. If a guy makes a comment abt it I’d be annoyed bc “bitch ur wearing sweatpants and I can see your dick, I think you’re being a hypocrite” but other then that I wouldn’t care"
1003,"Eh, it happens, just don’t let me catch you staring"
1004,I’m saving this comment oml
1005,"I’m fine if they notice it, but if they comment about it then it gets annoying."
1006,I agree with this statement
1007,Bill Cosby UwU
1008,not really
1009,"C'mon, you know why."
1010,Do u think we get freaked out if someone sees our bra lmfao? How pure do u think we wanna be
1011,Thats fair
1012,Secretly they're prolly waiting for comments too
1013,"I know I'm gonna get downvoted to Oblivion, but it is nothing but natural to notice it and stare for a moment, ofc not staring like a creeper, but you get what I mean, I hope."
1014,"Idk but there was this one girl that just looked at me funny and I thought that it might've been creepy. That girl was ~16 years old btw, so you can't really blame it on age."
1015,But why
1016,"I guess just glancing would be fine, but if someone stared or even looked for more than a split second it would make me pretty uncomfortable."
1017,Eh
1018,"Nah we're not. Awkward boners are the worst. Try to hide em and it hurts. And if I just let it be then it'll stay there forever. So what I do is where big ""drug rugs"" or mexican ponchos. Than I don't gotta hide shit."
1019,"sometimes a glance happens here and there unwillingly. If you have a crush on 'em then as a guy you might have to think *""don't look""* but if it's a platonic friend then you might not have to worry about it"
1020,Yeah if someone punches you you have the right to slap them into the next realm
1021,Send her to the shadow realm
1022,Yeah if the girl hits you definitely
1023,Proceeds to slap girl into oblivion

1028,sexism🤭
1029,"Yes! ""Hitting a girl"" is a thing of the past and I do believe it's unfair now that we have equal rights. If she's beating you up that bad, fight back! As my dad used to say, punch a bully and they'll be your best friend. Works every time. And if you still don't want to hit her or she's stronger than you, talk to an adult."
1030,HER GRANDFATHER GAVE HER THOSE CARDS
1031,Equal rights equal fights
1032,This
1033,"Not even in self defense? Like in this situation, things could have gone out of hand had he not hit her back."
1034,If it's in self defense.
1035,Equal rights means equal fights cause we believe in true gender equality
1036,Equal rights Equal fights

1038,It's you again huh
1039,[removed]
1040,gender has nothing to do with why you hit her. you hit her because *she* hit you. self defense is never wrong
1041,"Hell yeah, she deserved it."
1042,Walked right into that imperial ambush
1043, If a girl is being a bitch its alright and a girl like that is literally asking to get hit
1044,You were trying to cross the border right?
1045,Don't not defend yourself because you're worried about being punished.
1046,"These hands bisexual. You hit me, you hit the floor."
1047,So it’s ok for girls to be toxic and shit. If girls are assholes hit them.
1048,"Yes, we need equal punching rights"
1049,"If anyone, of whatever gender hits you, you should be allowed to hit them.

1079,Love this
1080,But...they're all my favourite hoodies :c
1081,If I had a boyfriend I don't think I'd give it back unless he asked. But then I would be sad that he asked for it back.
1082,My ex held my hoodie hostage for several weeks. Until she burned it. Yeah. Not kidding.
1083,"Jesus Christ, good thing you let her go she’s gotta he crazy as shit to burn a fucking hoodie just because she’s salty"
1084,"Ive had 4 ""borrowed"" from me, they have been gone longer than my dad"
1085,"Never, it's our hoodie now."
1086,I blindly gave my gf one of my fav hoodies to make her happy and i don't want to make her upset by asking for it back
1087,sounds like I'm not going to give out my hoodies anymore
1088,Tell her that you have a different one for her that smells more like you
1089,"Yeah, it was a really messed up situation and I feel sorry more than anything. I saw her parents and siblings be emotionally abusive towards her and I know her older brother played a part in convincing her to do it. They both have attempted suicide and it’s just a really shitty life situation for her, and again I feel bad more than anything."
1090,"Lesson of the comment section, don’t give a girl your hoodie unless your willing to never see it again."
1091,I want a guy's hoodie :/
1092,Sounds like.. a thief in denial
1093,Like....3...no....5 million years after we broke up and got recarnated on other planet and I'm the guy and your the girl. I'll want my hoodie back.
1094,"Well, maybe you guys can share it. She gets it for one week, you get it for the other. It'll give y'all an excuse to see each other. It'll also be like a cute little thing between you guys."
1095,Never lmao I still have jackets and boxers from guys.
1096,Boxers? You steal his underwear?
1097,I felt that
1098,Well let’s just say I’m still borrowing it
1099,"I’ve been without my hundred mill club hoodie for a week now. “I’ll bring it back tomorrow, I promise” she said. But tomorrow never comes"
1100,"Wow didn't know girls liked our smells, thought that was just a me thing."
1101,Lmao I wish I was joking
1102,"Ig, plus I like her smell(you know what I mean?)"
1103,"Lmao I don’t steal it, I wear them and never return it. Clean ones not the ones he had on."
1104,Trade? I have like 5 since I stopped getting taller at 15 (5'8)
1105,"Yeah I can’t imagine having that fucked up of a home life. My mom had it bad when she was a kid, she’s working a lot now and doing college to let us have a better life"
1106,Never
1107,"Never. Once you've given your hoodie away, you're never getting it back, unfortunately."
1108,"Wtf. I can't imagine this in reverse. ""ah yeah bro i just wore her panties and never returned them. Ayy don't worry tho they were clean lol"""
1109,When we need them to smell like you again. But if your a bootyhole don’t expect to ever get it back.
1110,"Jeez idk dude. Could be they are interested and chickened out or a group decided to mess with you. Sorry it happened

Edit: typos"
1111,I highly doubt it
1112,"What the fuck, that’s such a shitty thing to do"
1113,That's a bitch move. Sorry that happens.
1114,This happened to me bro and it sucks
1115,Yeah. it's why I don't do it
1116,"Good, that type of stuff can really fuck with someone, I hope those people realize that"
1117,Yeah literally anytime these 3 specific girls text me I immediately think. What’s the prank this time
1118,"I had it happen to me once but I immediatly knew it was a joke because A: That girl had a bf, and B: I look like someones puke on a pile of shit"
1119,Especially when you have anxiety and confidence issues
1120,[deleted]
1121,A bunch of them got together and tricked me into thinking one of the group was into me so when I asked her out she said it was a prank and they all laughed at me

Just act normal if she doesn't say anything cuz it's not that bad for everyone but know she could be moody so don't try to start shit lol"
1154,Only if I complain about it I guess like anything where IM bringing it up first like if was really bad maybe i’d go “babe btw i get really bad periods in a few days ima be dying over here” but i’m on bc so periods aren’t a big deal for me

1157,"Cuddles are on the table?

Nice."
1158,"For some girls, periods are very mild. Others will be crippled in bed for a day or more from cramps. So, for one, don't assume all periods are alike. 

If you have a car, leave a bottle of ibuprofen in your glove box, or if you have a day backpack throw a bottle in there (schools tend to not like the idea of students carrying any type of medicine around though). If y'all are out watching a movie or something and she gets cramps, then bam, you're her hero (also a bonus is you'll have it for if you have a headache or anything). 

Mood swings can be bad sometimes or nonexistant other times. If she seems irritable then do not make jokes or stuff that can be taken offensively. And if she snaps at you out of the blue while she's on it, don't take it personally. 

And food. However, beware with the food, cravings can change from month to month. But still: food. 

Hopefully this helps a little. If you have any other period-related questions just let me know or PM me."

1168,"actually i like your approach. you’ll probably get a direct answer and she might laugh. periods are so different for different ppl so it rly is a matter of asking. for example i’m bitchy for like 4 days, in pain for 3 and i’m good. that’s not universal. some are minimally affected, some girls are bitchy throughout and in extreme pain all the time so. gotta ask"
1169,"Off work!? Kidding? No!! A period shouldn’t interfere with someone’s life like that. Why should the guy even worry that much? They’re not that big of a deal. I’m on mine and i never get cramps and my mood is the same.

1217,Yeah and when you wanna say something to your crush you either don't say anything or say something fucked up
1218,Yes. For me having a crush is physically and emotionally exhausting and I was always upset at myself for not being able to talk to them. I’d get on the bus on my way home and get frustrated or sad and cry.

We are literally stereotyped as the “hysterical” gender. Friendships are made for life.

1370,"No it doesn’t, at least mine. I actually own a ps4 and tested it and it doesn’t. Maybe that’s because I shower literally everyday because my busy schedule"
1371,"You only removed it cuz it’s toward a mod

*I know your secrets*"
1372,yikes PCMR better
1373,People who do like 2 things a day sometimes shower every other day. (cough me)
1374,And only if both are in a heated gamer moment
1375,"Hehe fucking console plebs

1383,Yessss
1384,"Honestly, a boyfriend, girlfriend, or just a bunch friends to hang out with is what I want lol"

1386,That was brutal
1387,[deleted]
1388,literally every single day of my life
1389,But don’t just go out with anyone. I was so desperate in 8th grade that this annoying girl that wasn’t my type at all gave me a little but of attention and I asked her out to the 8th grade dance. Biggest mistake of my life. I should probably make a post on it.
1390,If you want human garbage I’m available
1391,Lol nice save bud.
1392,"Honestly yeah. I mean I know my family loves me, but I guess it'd be nice to have someone who thinks you're just equal to them. Someone who loves you and you can just talk to and be there with"
1393,;)
1394,I got you if you want to talk and get to know each other ;)
1395,I’m jk lol;)
1396,"Yeah, a girlfriend would also be fine"

1398,Bahaha he shot his shot and it bounced back. I think he may be dead.
1399,"hey, don't say that stuff about yourself. it can be really hard when you have low self esteem, but just remember that someone will always love you for who you are, no matter what. there's 7.7 billion people on this planet. you're not ugly, you're not awkward, you're loved. go out there and do your best to have fun, you never know who you might meet along the way :)"
1400,Always. Even a boyfriend like platonic friend would work
1401,Doesn’t literally everyone :)
1402,;)
1403,The biggest joke I’ve ever told myself is “I’ll get a boyfriend in high school” lmao nope high school senior and zero experience
1404,Give me your phone number
1405,i just like cuddling bro
1406,;)
1407,So much. I'm just too picky
1408,Before I got a girlfriend I was like this but 10 times worse
1409,Thx bud
1410,has she considered medication? i was put on celexa a year ago and it really helped alleviate anxiety about my grades. if she continues cutting you need to tell her parents or a teacher. at some point she becomes a danger to herself.
1411,Talk to a therapist. Idk about you but in the place where I'm coming from we have a school therapist. Even if she's going to a different school. That's the best advice I could give you.
1412,This would also fit on r/insaneparents holy shit
1413,This is a great comment and I hope OP reads it
1414,"Have you tried contacting a medical or therapeutic professional? It’s an easy way to bypass both her parents and yours. Also, have you considered showing any evidence to your parents that this is legitimately serious?"
1415,"Agreed: talk to the counselor.

The counselor at op's school should be able to help op's girlfriend"
1416,"You need to go to her parents. If she is harming herself something is very wrong and her parents need to be made aware so they can help her. If not her parents, then another adult, maybe a school counselor or something like that. Other than that support her when you can! It will feel good to have someone showing her love and support."
1417,This needs more attention! I agree with this guy
1418,"I’m not exactly sure on how to set something up with a professional as we don’t have any way of transportation without parents. I have heard of doing it virtually, but neither of us have any way of payment.

Also, my dad once threatened me into telling him her situation. He said if I did, I could stay up for another 30 minutes to talk to her. I didn’t, then he threatened to take my phone and computer so I had no means of talking to anyone, so I caved in and told him. He just said, “Just tell her to exercise more. Her metabolism will fix itself. It’s part of growing up.” I don’t think I’ll try explaining again anytime soon."
1419,[deleted]
1420,"As someone whos been in her position before, the first thing to tell her that if she's self conscious about her weight 'Eating less' isn't a good plan to lose weight. It leads to anorexia, and additionally when you do eventually eat you just put weight back on because your body is building up fat storage for the eventual starvation to come. Tell her that there are healthier ways to lose weight, especially for a teen girl whose body will be changing a lot in the coming years anyway. Let her know you care and that you want to support her through this. When I was in a similar position all I wanted to hear was that someone cared. And if you do break up, don't let it be the end of your friendship, but also don't cater to her as if you're still dating. Her mental health is not your responsibility though it may feel that way sometimes. She won't get better unless she wants to, and it can be hard to want to get better when it's easier to just sit and feel the pain and insecurities."
1421,"My parents are extremely tech-savy with my dad working in the field of IT. I won’t go for the Net Cut as they’ll know I did something, but I’ll definitely check out the first method. Thanks for the tip!"
1422,Stfu retard
1423,No problem its been handled.
1424,"Heyo, I don't think this is the right place to post this. I recommend r/advice if school has started for you please contact a counsellor and tell them your situation. There is nothing much you can do.

If the counsellor doesn't listen tell your teacher or any teacher. They will listen. Doesn't matter you are in different schools. They will reach out. 

Good luck,"
1425,How tf did you bypass my circle? I was able to use a vpn for it but my parents were able to tell it was a vpn. Maybe they're more savvy than your's. I haven't had that on in years though
1426,"Wowie you’re funny aren’t you? Go be an edgy cunt somewhere else.

u/Gamesareunderrated A ban on this clown would be appreciated."
1427,"I know I'm a guy, but I've been in a similar situation, regarding cutting. She did it for a different reason, but the end result was still the same. Honestly, it's no fast process to get her to stop, it will take awhile. What I'd recommend is, for one, is to just compliment the way she looks constantly. Make sure it's not forced, but do it nonetheless. Also, try to see her more often. I know you have distance between you two, but if for whatever reason she wants to talk with you or be around you or really anything, just go. Even if your parents tell you no. How would you get to her? That's for you to figure out. I also wouldn't recommend trying to guilt her into stopping. That usually just makes them feel even shittier about themselves. But yeah, I can't really think of anything else besides those three things. My situation was different from this, so that's really all I can say that'll be helpful.

As a side note, I'm wishing the best for you. I really hope you manage to help her through this, and hopefully it won't mean sacrificing the relationship. Godspeed random guy"
1428,"this might be a little personal, but i was in the exact same position as your gf and still am not 100% comfortable with my body. making her promise not to do it again wouldn’t work, imagine it like a scratch you can’t quite itch or an addiction, a simple promise isn’t realistic. the best you can do for her is sit her down and share small portions of food as often as you can, so she doesn’t feel guilty about eating it all herself. tell her to talk to you if she feels the need to self harm and try to take her mind off of it. it might not work all the time since people tend to relapse often before getting better, but it will help her. lastly, tell her how beautiful and important she is often. not every minute of everyday, but whenever you want to tell her. she’s so young, i remember being in that position at her age and it’s really not pretty, i hope the best for both of you 

edit: i saw a couple people saying that you should tell her parents or force her to see a therapist. DO N O T DO THAT. she might lose her trust in you, as someone who was forced into therapy at her age i can definitely tell you that it did not help me. remember that this is something she has to figure it out, but be there for her for support"
1429,Not cool man.
1430,No worries but he's been punished.
1431,"My friends live like 20 minutes away. I doubt they’ll ask their parents to drive to my house to drive me 30 minutes, then pick me up later. That’s someone putting like a 3 hours taken out of someone’s day."
1432,No. I’m telling you there’s literally no way I can get there.
1433,Bruh there’s a place for this stuff somewhere else. This is serious shit and I need it handled. Now go collect red arrows somewhere else.
1434,"OP did mention that they go to different schools. Unless OP's counsellor knows, or can track down, his girlfriend's counsellor, it won't do much more than help OP deal with the fact that his GF cuts, instead of helping his GF not to cut"
1435,What sport does she play ?
1436,Yo what did he say
1437,Sorry about my friend he's a cunt I don't know why he'd say something like this as soon as he told me I came to apologise because he's a bitch and what he said was unacceptable. Im not asking for you to forgive him because you shouldn't I just wanted to say sorry.
1438,"Yes, I have had those conversations, but they don’t seem to pull through. That’s why I’m asking this sub for advice. No, I can’t take her for a walk, and you’d know why if you read the entirety of the post. So what if I’m 14? Does that make me not allowed to help people I care about? I’m trying to take care of her insecurities and worries. If you’d take a look at my post history, you’ll see that I’m reaching for advice on how to take care of them.

Also don’t preach whatever shit you have here. This is a fairly serious concern I have and I want serious answers."
1439,I'm glad to hear that
1440,Bruh if he broke up he deserves it back.
1441,You can get it back if you offer a trade of a different one. It's basically your only chance
1442,deserves and getting back are two different things. Yea he should get it back but I know plenty of girls who wouldnt if it was on bad terms
1443,"Talk with her, not with us."
1444,I've never been in a relationship but fuck that u paid 80 for it she should give it back it's not hers like if she actually is nice and understanding she should give it back if u ask and just explain it's Ur fave hoodie and if she gets mad then it's a dumb thing to get mad about considering its you're hoodie that you paid for like hell no don't let someone just take ur 80quid jumper fuck that :0
1445,Honestly so many people without flairs comment then you only ‘remove’ a set few comments
1446,This made me laugh for some reason
1447,"Couldn’t agree more, you’ve got to ask her. It’s your hoodie and there is no reason she shouldn’t give it back if you ask her."
1448,I can’t be online 24-7 unfortunately but I remove any I see
1449,Get reading Trump: Art of the Deal
1450,"No one's saying he doesn't deserve it back, but he won't get it back if they broke up on bad terms."
1451,"this happened to a guy i know. a hollister hoodie, his favourite. she still has it and actively wears it, 2 years later."
1452,"Im gonna get whiteknight downvoted but Id say hes probably kinda asking if youd ever give your bfs hoodie back if he asks... so like... would you, easily or with effort?"
1453,Hahahahahahaha no
1454,I think the purpose is so they can enforce girls only posts
1455,[deleted]
1456,"Holy punctuation, Batman!"
1457,"If you're still dating, you gotta trade a different hoodie otherwise she's not giving it back until you break up
edit: forgot to add my personal perspective lol. I know that a lot of people on here are saying that if you break up you won't get it back but I honestly would feel weird having my ex's hoodie and still wearing it without permission, especially if it ended badly. So it really depends on the girl, you know her better than we do so you're really the only one who can make an educated guess, the rest of us are just going off of our own experiences and comfort levels, but I personally would definitely give it back if you asked (although a trade would be preferable) Also, BE ASSERTIVE! Don't let her say no to a trade, if she's like me she'll say no at first but if you explain how important it is and she realizes you aren't joking then she'll probably give it back"
1458,Punctuation can suck my dIcK
1459,"Yeah but some people are paranoid with their relationship and how fragile they feel it is, and the need a bit of a helping hand, such as if most girls would or wouldnt give back a boys hoodie."
1460,"I dumped my ex on pretty bad terms (for her at least, she was nuts) and I ended up getting *most* of my stuff back."
1461,😬
1462,"if they break up on bad terms and/or he’s a jerk in the end he certainly won’t get it back. my relationship ended on bad terms bc my bf was a dick and i threw all his shit out, so it really depends"
1463,Wtf
1464,if you really want it back talk to her. maybe you can switch it off every two weeks.
1465,:// sorry bro you gotta get yourself a new hoodie
1466,Well I don't assume he's a dick
1467,"ask and if she's not an asshole, she'll understand and give it back"
1468,"If she's reasonable, ask for it back. Tell her you understand that she might want to keep it because it smells like you, but that one was really nice and really expensive, and you'll give her a different one that smells just as nice. She'll probably understand. If you don't have another one and you have the money, you could even go out with her to pick out a not terribly expensive one and then she'll have even more control over which one she gets. That's just if you don't have another one or she's really really disappointed or something, I wouldn't start with that offer though. I hope that helped :)"
1469,That’s not right
1470,"I hate where the comments are. Also hate how if I click to see replies, then hit the back button on my phone, it just closes comments completely then I have to scroll all the way back down to where I was"
1471,"Ugh, yes, I hate that you have to scroll a little bit down and tap a button now. I prefer the old design by far."
1472,Its absolute garbage
1473,It’s been about a week and I still have 0 fucking clue where they are half the time
1474,yeah it's so annoying
1475,"It sucks, I keep scrolling down for the comments"
1476,where the hell are the comments
1477,"It's almost like they're trying to hide the comment section, it's so annoying"
1478,I just got it today
1479,I can relate on the back button thing. Apple users be partyin rn
1480,I got used to it. Sometimes I still scroll like a madman to the bottom of the screen tho
1481,🧐🧐 i can't find them
1482,"Technically there’s a back arrow that allows you to go back to the rest of the comments, but I’m so used to hitting the X on the right that I keep closing out of them anyway"
1483,"Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if they are, considering how many “kid friendly” changes they’ve been making. It may just be a shitty redesign, though, who knows."
1484,"I quite like it. Sure, I'm not used to it yet and keep scrolling down for the comments, but in general, it's not too bad of a change. Just new."
1485,"I don't use YouTube on my phone so I haven't noticed, but I do really hate the new recommendations tab at the top of the homepage. I will never use it and it just gets in the way."
1486,Not a very good detective then
1487,it's bad
1488,"I hate it, why do they have to change a good thing"
1489,If werent for the fact youtube has such a large community most people would have probably used other services
1490,"I mean I'm fine with the comments, idc.

But I hate the massive thumbnails. They're so obtrusive. I hate those.

Why would they ruin something that was perfectly fine?"
1491,🤫🤫
1492,"Now, if it's not broken, why fix it?"
1493,The comments is ducking shit house
1494,i dont see the new redesign
1495,I don't really use youtube on desktop but even when I do im surprised by how shit they made everything with buge thumbnails and barely10 videos fit on the monitor.
1496,we need an alternative service!!!
1497,"Me

The comments flip flop around more than a dying fish"
1498,"Yes omg, every time!"
1499,Be glad and do not update the youtube app

1501,"Honestly in my lesbian teenage girl experience, I was extremely worried about making any of the other girls uncomfortable if they knew I was gay. I think generally gay girls are very aware of all the other girls in the locker room and not wanting to offend anyone becomes our first priority."
1502,i realize it must be a paradise if you're lesbian
1503,"Lots of talking and just peeps changing. 

“Hey can I borrow your perfume?”
“Spray me!” -Girl standing arms spread as her friend sprayed her with perfume 

“Who has a pad?”

“I gotta pee can u change fast?”"
1504,A girl I used to like made fun of other girls who were taking off their clothes and made fun of their body. I guess that’s probably like sometimes?
1505,Tf
1506,"just a psa to anyone reading, 
wear clean underwear, wash your underwear

Idk why i have to say this"
1507,Some people talking while some are changing clothes. Only a few shower cause were scared of getting judged on our bodies. That may only be in my school tho
1508,That’s such an asshole move
1509,"get in, change, get out. chat a little bit. there was this one bitchy girl who said my surgery scars made it look like she could “unzip” me but other than that no drama or pettiness. sometimes we make memes in there"
1510,"We, boys, also never shower in the locker room. Its kind off emberessing, I think.

Edit:
When I'm at school we never shower. But when I was rowing we always showered after training. It depends on the ""culture"", at school it is weird to shower because nobody does it, but at the rowingclub it was normal and everybody did it."
1511,ok thats pretty chill
1512,Lots of silent judging
1513,"Same in boys locker room, or do i just go to the wrong boys locker room?"
1514,That's a big fat lie
1515,"If they have nipple piercings, then yes, you are in the wrong room"
1516,Changing and asking other girls if they have deodorant
1517,"I’m bisexual and I’ve never stepped foot in a locker room while people are changing because of that. I have crippling social anxiety so the thought of making other women fear me because I’m some pervert scares me. I know people at my school are so nice and are definitely not bigoted, but it’s just become a habit at this point. Just change in the bathroom across the hallways instead."
1518,That’s interesting! I’ve heard that in our school they compare and show off their body parts. Might be just a rumor tho
1519,Bro my dick grew bro I think it tastes better bro you should try it bro but like no homo bro
1520,"""Yo did you hear that sandra broke up with he boyfriend"" ""ha guys I got a sick note i dont have to do PE!"" ""Dammit i forgot my deodorant"" ""What did you say to me (this one is often followed by play-fighting and being rough)"" kinda just chatter and joking about, and a ton of delaying too."

1522,Why *do* you have to say this? Do people or do that regularly?
1523,is same for me
1524,Also waiting for your friends to be done changing and using the restroom before going to class.
1525,Same in tha boys lol. There's always one person that has deodrant which everybody then will use

1562,Once he turns 16 I don’t see it as an issue
1563,Secks
1564,Your a year older. Yes. Date him. I would.
1565,She could be with him without secksing him
1566,"nope, you are a pedo and must be arrested. I'm calling FBI right now"
1567,How would that make a difference?
1568,"i agree, neither i do. but there are some people who find it weird for some reasons"
1569,That applies to you too /s
1570,My gf is 16 and I don’t really think it’s a big difference at all

1574,"I wouldn't have an issue with it either, but I think we're getting the wrong ages... In Jan 2020, she'll be 18 and the boy will be 16. Is that okay? I have no clue."
1575,Yeah but that’s what the 16 comment is referring to
1576,"It does but generally, because girls mature earlier, guys are the younger onese as to why people might find it weird(I dont personally)"

This is such a small age gap. Go for it honey!"
1580,"i say its okay, after all its just (almost) 2 years difference, no big deal. 1 to 2 years age gaps arent bad, they are pretty common from what i have seen around"
1581,Yes
1582,no mouth secks
1583,Omw for secks
1584,It’s a small age gap. Nothing wrong with dating him. I personally wouldn’t but you do you :)
1585,It doesn’t matter as long as it’s legal and both people consent
1586,Both but boy give mouth because gentle men
1587,"it would only be strange if you were in high school while he was still in with grade, but since you are both older and in high school your at a relatively close mental maturity.

you should be fine it’s not that big of a gap in the end"
1588,"I don’t think it’s weird, but one of my friends (15F) is daring a senior (18M) but she won’t date a freshmen, even if he’s 15 because “it’s weird that they’re younger”."
1589,"Considering how small of an age gap that is, I seriously doubt anyone would have much to say about it in the first place. I'm guessing he's a grade level below you, which probably makes that small difference more noticeable, but still there's a 99% chance you'll be the only one to really care about it."

1620,How far are you into the relationship. If you only talk and stuff and it’s the beginning you just gotta let the romantic stuff progress naturally. Other than that just lie that you’re going places with friends and have your parents drop you off. Im 15 and my parents are completely clueless about my bf lol.

1806,it’s normal dw

1824,Time to woohoo
1825,"Same here my gal. It’s just biological timing really. It’s kinda annoying in my opinion since it’s like “I got work to do but I’m just thinking about ass”. Just do what ya gotta do, one of your other comments said you have a vibe so that’ll come (lol puns) in handy during these kinda days. 

And don’t worry about it masturbation being unhealthy that’s a stupid myth it’s actually rather healthy. 🤙"
1826,Oh okay. Interesting
1827,I can't imagine not masturbating
1828,That makes sense. Only I haven't had sex yet but all I can think about is making myself cum
1829,"Personally I don’t do it, but I wouldn’t say I “force” myself not to do it. I just don’t get any urges to and  I don’t really need to. Sure masturbation may be fun, but surely it’s not as fun when you feel the need to do it because everyone else is doing it."
1830,"I do sometimes, or if I’m ordering food or something like that I’ll play the situation out in my head before doing it and still inevitably be awkward as hell."

1859,"All the time, even for conversations I know will never happen"
1860,"Not crying because of what they did, crying because they got caught."
1861,"yea sorry I meant everyone, but I said girls only cause of this post lol. And honestly I’ve never been in relationship but that seems way too manipulative and annoying."
1862,because they realized they lost established trust and a relationship theyve been working on over a chain of decisions where they could have stopped at any moment.
1863,Then don’t cheat in the first place?
1864,Yep. Not all the time but a lot of the mans feelings are pushed to one side like it hurts just as much and we also have to put a brave face on to not show weakness which is a task in itself
1865,"I have a answer, my friend cheats allll the time, she gets bored and dosent know how to tell them, so she dates someone else at the same time, she cry’s because she hurt J and her new boyfriend was like nah we can’t be together you cheat, then she had no one, but for some damn reason she kept doing it, each time she’d end up alone till she forgot how not to cheat 

And she knows she a horrible person

And that maybe one day she’s gonna do that to the wrong person 

And be killed

Idk that’s what I think but what do I know I’m only 14


Edit: she’s 14 and bi, she’s really nice to her friends but honestly isn’t good at dating"
1866,"Oh, we are in a good mood this morning/day, aren’t we?
But for real: Are you trying to excuse cheating?
And yes I have experienced a similiar moment, but I have/had enough control of myself to know, that it is wrong and so I didn’t do it, like every other human with some sense of moral should do."
1867,It could also be what they did. Ever hear of guilt?
1868,"This. My ex left me because I tried to tell her that I was feeling emotionally neglected by her, and apparently she didn’t like that. Then a week later she was complaining to me that she felt “sooo single”. Like tf?"
1869,I ain’t buying it the 2nd time
1870,"Idk guilt, anger, sad, remorse ?"
1871,Cheating on someone is much further than a simple lack of self control. Cheating on someone is actively making a decision to be unfaithful and then hiding it from your significant other. It’s not “powerful control” to resist cheating on someone. It’s doing what any *decent* human being would do.
1872,"Guilt? Yeah they knew what they were doing. If you wanna cheat, spare yourself the “guilt” and break it off with whomever your with first."
1873,You definitely shouldnt
1874,"Ngl but alot of guys including my current boyfriend actively avoid talking about their feelings and would rather talk about my feelings than his. I think its because he has depression but alot of people I've dated worked that way. Like they'd rather worship their woman and like their feelings dont matter.

I think its a societal thing and that girls shouldn't have the blame just on them. 

Especially while we're teenagers everyone's really focused on them selves and  has a really hard time realizing what's best for people around them."
1875,To look like the victim and be given forgiveness? Idk
1876,Why are you friends with a person who does this?
1877,"Well depends on the person, not gender, cause boys can react the same when getting caught out of regret or guilt.
But anybody who cheats are clowns so period. don't take bs."
1878,And how old is she?
1879,"I am unable to think of situations where someone would have legitimate struggles staying faithful if they were a decent human being. 

Stop defending people that cheat. Everyone knows that it’s morally unacceptable. I wish you luck maintaining a long term relationship with anyone with that attitude."
1880,"They probably just feel sorry they got caught, and now they have to face consequences."
1881,If we just cut out everyone who’s messed up instead of helping the world would be even more fucked up than it is now lol
1882,Feels bad man
1883,I’m saying you can avoid guilt all together by being a decent human being.
1884,"“Guilt” “remorse”

I dunno. If a girl cheated then started crying, I’d think she just wants sympathy. Fuck that"
1885,"Well, if you lack said control you shouldn’t expect forgiveness."
1886,2nd time? Man you shouldve left the first time... sorry you went through that man it sucks
1887,Dodged a bullet there
1888,"You’re not wrong, but if someone cheats, I’m probably going to assume that they are most likely dishonest in general. It’s hard to trust someone after they violate such a fundamental trust."
1889,"Bullshit. “Sorry, I’m sure it would be nice but I have a girlfriend” is a very simple thing to say. If you actually want to kiss them, you don’t deserve either girl."
1890,"RIGHT??? Like take your beautiful auburn hair, cute freckles, greyish blue eyes and get fuck out"
1891,"I totally get that it can get annoying if someone does this constantly, but everyone gets insecure. Sometimes, more than others. I don’t think that just because someone is traditionally attractive means that they deserve to get shit for being insecure.

I also think that it’s totally possible for more traditionally attractive people to feel insecure about their looks. For example, girl gets called hot, but then celebrities are Also called hot and she just compared herself to the hot celebrities and sees all her shortcomings. Also, traditionally attractive people can oftentimes get mixed signals from people. For example, sure, her friends tell her she looks pretty and all that jazz, but then they feel insulted that she’s even insecure and that feeling of insult comes across in their response, making it seem like they’re lying. It just builds up even more insecurity."
1892,yeah they should stop the cap
1893,"No one can feel great about themselves 100% of the time. Body dismorphia and overall lack of confidence is extremely common, especially around our age. 

I always try to convince them that they are pretty great and if they say they don’t believe me point out one specific feature that’s extremely attractive on them and describe it in great detail to try and convince them. 

Sure, I’m not exactly happy when they do this, tbh I may be a little pissed, but I don’t think it’s right for anyone to call themselves ugly because the majority of the time ITS NOT FUCKING TRUE. Also, no one, even if they aren’t traditionally attractive, maybe even unattractive, should call themselves ugly. So overall, if anyone calls them ugly, I do have an emotional response (not exactly insulted, but irritated at the fucked up beauty culture that leads them to believe they aren’t enough), not because I’m making it about myself, but because that kind of mindset isn’t healthy."
1894,"Reminds me of those books where the mc is ""beautiful but does not know it"""
1895,"No because everyone feels bad about themselves sometimes, it’s not about me when they are not happy with themselves"
1896,"Eh

Subconsciously guilt tripping tbh"
1897,"I'm not attacking you lol

I just answered your question with the reason why I don't do that"
1898,No. Some people are insecure and don't know the positive sides of themselves.
1899,"Not personally attacking you at all, just pointing out some observations of the world I’ve made lol"
1900,"Yup, most of these comments just shift it back to themselves and are so self-centered.

Like no, your friend is having a bad day, console them rather than thinking about yourself all the time and taking it as an insult"
1901,"No, not really. They might be pretty and straight up gorgeous to you, but if insecurities depended on what their friends thought of them, then people wouldn't have insecurities in the first place. 

They could genuinely be feeling like they aren't good looking and if their friends take it as a joke or in a non-serious way because ""how could they possible be insecure?!?!?😱😱😱"", then that's not fair to them.

1904,No... It's normal to have periods of having less self esteem. I would totally understand the behavior. It's not meant to be insulting.
1905,omfg yesss
1906,I mean I can understand actual insecurities but when people are just compliment fishing it’s pretentious as balls dude. Usually you can tell the actual insecurities because when you talk to your friend and re assure them they let you know what you said helped
1907,"no because i’m on the opposite end of that. everyone i’ve ever met basically has told me i’m pretty but i’m still super insecure and there’s a whole bunch of things that i legitimately hate about my appearance. i don’t say i’m ugly for attention or whatever but i think i could be much more attractive, and people thinking that i have insecurities just because i don’t look like i got hit by a truck is pretty immature and ignorant. i’ve had eating disorders my entire life sometimes you just have to let it out a little to deal with it"
1908,"Erm I get called pretty all the time, but since I have body dysmorphia I don’t really know how I look. I just pick out every flaw about myself in the mirror 24/7 and I think I look like a hideous monster.."

1910,"Firstly, I do believe I’ve said this before. If someone is genuinely confiding in me with their deep insecurities, then I shan’t say something like this. I have damn tact. 

Secondly, I’m well aware everyone has the right to feel insecure, it just be like that sometimes. I’m supposedly “good at piano”. Doesn’t mean I don’t get self conscious about my own skill. I usually say these things as a freaking joke. I say it to make my friends smile. If I see they’re being serious, I sit them down and have a talk with them on why they might be feeling this way.

I don’t dismiss insecurities because I see someone as conventionally attractive, dang"

I’m so sorry, I’m just used to jumping to my own défense on the Internet. Many apologies :( I hope I wasn’t rude"

2009,"Normally, I'd all "" gamers are the most oppressed minority,"" but since this is a wholesome sub, I'd like to share my honest opinion. The way the gaming continue community is so toxic to anyone who doesn't fit the profile for ' classic gamer. ' 
Girls, noobs, anyone who they don't think should be playing games is crushed under the heels of  'real hardcore gamers.'
Not only is it mean, but it discourages more people from playing, which is dumb. If you have a cool hobby or interest, why wouldn't you share it with as many people as want to?

And it isn't just the gameplay part of the industry. A tiny portion of game devs and people who work in the gaming industry are female. Investigations have found that female employment is discouraged by both employers and male employees. Once hired, female employees are often bullied or creeped out until they quit. There have been found to be multiple counts of harassment from employees and employers. I would love to link these investigations and studies, but I'm on mobile right now. 

Really, my overall message is this. Gaming culture is fucking toxic with new players, and even fucking toxicer with girls. And it's sad, bad, and needs to stop.


Edit: Plus, there's nothing better than a gamer girl GF.

Edit 2: The media is right. Video games cause violence. My friend played Dragon Quest once, and two weeks late he was in Indonesia braining endangered Komodo Dragons with a rock."

2039,I do that a lot
2040,I agree with what you’ve said but not totally. Girls insecurities and expectations of what they want to look like don’t just stem from what we think guys want us too look like. I’ve had stupid insecurities about my body for **way** longer than I’ve been interested in boys.

2042,"They hire their managers. They are the ones who make shitty manuplitive content. Would you stop blaming DeBeers for running modern-day slavery for diamonds just cause there's ""a market"" for them? Would you stop blaming poachers just cause they want money?

My point is that they have no one to blame but themselves"

2045,"Oh no, I definitely agree. 14 and 15 year old 'influencers' set such a large image for young teens. And not even taking a hit at an actress, but actresses like Milly Bobby Brown are even dressed and done up in adult clothing it's so wild. Like, it just enforces the fact that ""teens are basically adults"" and it harms them by making teens expect 'love' and freedom in life. And then tv hires adults to play teens (see Pretty Little Liars) so even teens expect to look like adults. No guy or girl is gonna have a flawless face at the age of 14-17, like. I can't even explain in such little words how much hollywood and instagram have influenced teens."

2047,Instagram makes me hate how I look so much tbh. These girls are all so ridiculously stunning and I have so many flaws :/
2048,lol no shit instagram influencers are detrimental for teen girls and people in general
2049,"I believe it does affect young girls but so do magazines, celebrities, models etc. If we’re going to study why girls have low self esteem let’s not blame ig for continuing the trend of exploiting girls insecurities for profit. That is a market and a demographic and to only bash ig for it is wrong. Girls are trying to be paid in the society created for them because they have good genetics. They are not THE problem but just what will happen as the cycle continues. Those girls growing up felt pressured to be pretty like they now make other girls feel. It’s a cycle that’s moved onto IG but IG isn’t the cause of it and neither are those girls."
2050,"i agree yeah, and for the most part 99% of those girls are so fake personality wise and it sucks"
2051,"That last part... Really makes me think to be honest. 

Some might also think having an uglier boyfriend guarantees that that boyfriend never cheats, heh. But from the perspective of a guy, it seems like with a more beautiful girlfriend I'd work more to keep her because I'd feel like I need to make up for the looks that I don't have.

I'm not sure if I would seriously feel that was, but it's a lingering thought"
2052,"I agree, but also not. I think it depends on the girl's (or boy's) who is following these people, too.   The most of them would get insecurities, this is true. But there are some who will (at least eventually) think that ""Man, I could look like her"" and starts to eat healthier, do sports etc. But the first step is always accepting who we are, our body, and our own beauty. Because every single person is beautiful in his/her own way."
2053,Rule 5
2054,Rule 5
2055,"I think you're looking at this the wrong way. These influencers don't exist in a vacuum, they exist in a culture. I don't think we should push those models down or anything, instead we have to fight the core issue. Girls shouldn't feel pressured to be gorgeous. The same counts for boys."
2056,"This is true, or at least a lot of it is. There are definitely some unrealistic expectations set up by society, and it’s become very competitive. Only the “best” girls get the spotlight. This is both true for social media and actual modeling. This competition raises the next generation, so those who perfect the cycle and look (and are also lucky) end up on top, therefore refueling the cycle. However, a lot of girls insecurities are not focused on guys. A lot of them are focused on themselves or others just not in that way. Our minds can create our own insecurities without worrying about finding a date. Sometimes this is due to other overpowering problems or just not caring about guys. But overall, I would say I agree."
2057,"I guess for the general teen girl population, yes. For me, no. I don’t follow them so I don’t get the idea in my head that I need to look like them. Body image as a teen can be very bad because of the societal push of “standards” and if you don’t fit into the standards, society wants to make you think you aren’t beautiful or attractive."
2058,"Yes, but that's a really heteronormative and incorrect way to say it. I'm gay, I'm asexual, and I still get feelings of inadequacy over my appearance. I think that there definitely a link between the way girls see themselves and the way they think they can attract boys, just based on my experiences of dating around in the queer scene, but it isn't an enormous link. Most girls don't base their entire identity and self worth around the way they think boys see them. It isn't just about boys and being attractive in a sexual or romantic sense, but more about how a presumed outsider sees them. Fitting in within a community is an important aspect to keep in mind with this. Girls don't just want to look good for themselves or for boys, but for other girls too. We keep raising the bar for what is and isn't ""average"" beauty. The girls you see on instagram are ""normal"" and they are absolutely gorgeous. This will certainly change the attitudes girls have when it comes to appearance, but not just in the way you described.

Side note; not just girls are affected by this, in my experience the boys that regularly use instagram or see pretty women on social media have higher standards for what is beautiful in their real life too. But that's just my experience, and I'm not a guy."
2059,"Yes but actually no

My insecurities don’t just stem from what boys think of me and what they want, it’s mostly things that I wish I had or things that I wish I *didn’t* have. Yes, those women are beautiful and I would like I be pretty like them but my insecurities have been around a while before I started to like boys."
2060,"Yeah there probably are some... but I wouldn't bet on it. It's far healthier not to have such a big focus on how someone looks and instead actually taking a nuanced look at their true health. I'm just as healthy as one of my friends, but I need to eat bowls full of food and I'm still really thin, and she eats normally, exercises regularly (and is super healthy), and she has a bit of fat everywhere. She can't look like those models, I don't think anyone can. Even the people on instagram don't really look that way, they use face tune, lighting, fillers, surgery, makeup, etc. I really don't like this idea that having a higher ideal in the form of beautiful models will inspire girls to be healthier and more beautiful. Not only is it incorrect, but it's also harmful. Being beautiful is not the tax women have to pay to live in this world, and the same counts for men.

I think the sentiment that high standards will make some girls want to be better also relates to fat shaming. A lot of people think that shaming people for being fat will inspire them to get healthier, when in reality that is completely false. I'm not saying fat shaming and instagram models are the same, but there's a link between beauty culture and fat shaming."
2061,"This! So many girls think it's their duty to be pretty, but it's not. I don't think we can fight the issue until we remove this idea that to be a good or normal person you have to be attractive according to some arbitrary measure."
2062,Yeah this applies to guys as much as girls because Instagram is distorting what people think we look for. Also standards for male beauty are screwed by social media.

2067,"I believe this can indeed affect us in some way, especially when considering relationship standards. It makes the average standard a bit higher, making them look for boys who look the way they want it without considering thier attitude. But for self esteem, I don't see the connection for that actually, maybe when girls feel ""less standout"" when they have a more handsome boyfriend? It does happen though! I heard there's even a research where girls are happier with boyfriends that are uglier than them. XD"
2068,They really just do it so they can get rich easy
2069,"same with porn, that’s why most radfems are anti-porn"
2070,it depends on the girl but I personally wouldn’t mind still being friends afterwards. might be a little awkward though.
2071,I would want the guy to tell me how he feels straight away because it would be better for both of us in the long run and as long as they guy still wanted to be friends I’d want to as well.

2075,Happy microphone day
2076,the truth
2077,"Thanks for the answer. I updated the post better explaining the situation, would you care to read it and give me your opinion?"
2078,just tell her your honest feelings but be kind with your words. If you like her only as a friend say that you value her friendship but you don't see her in a romantic way etc etc. What I mean by being kind with your words is that you should have some tact while rejecting her. For instance if the main reason you're rejecting her is that she's ugly then obviously don't tell her that
2079,Of course!! I read your update and I do think you treated her fairly. Telling her how you felt up front is much better than leading her on and hopefully she’ll still be happy with just being your friend.
2080,Thanks. I'm really relieved
2081,wait.

2088,"I think you handled the situation really well, I know she’s gonna be upset for a while but she’s not going to hold anything against you. It’s sounds like you were very kind and sincere about it and that’s definitely the best way to go."
2089,Yaay thx
2090,Epic. I was really worried about that thanks
2091,That is really impressive. Your English is better than most people’s that I know
2092,You handled it great. Hearing it like straight up but still showing they care for the person is a great way to do it.
2093,I can’t answer your question but I just want to say that you’re really well spoken haha
2094,"I suppose it would be best if he told me he didn't like me or feel that way for me before I even told him. Whether if it would be just because he had a suspension or actually knew I liked him. That way I wouldn't feel as awkward if I had told him then got rejected, plus I would be able to move on easier if I knew before getting the courage to say something. Otherwise if I were to tell him and get rejected, it would break my heart for I've never liked anyone before, but I'd still remain friends cause I care about him so much."
2095,"also i feel like you might wanna keep your distance (literally maybe) a little bit after this so that she doesn’t think you’re warming up to her or your feelings changed or anything, (unless they did) 
like if u cuddle a lot and are super affectionate she may have gotten the signal that you like her even though you don’t."

2098,That's relieving. Thanks for the feedback
2099,"That's an interesting answer but I think most guys wouldn't do that, mostly because we can never really know if you're interested or not, and trying and guessing wrong would be seen as a sign of extreme pride and egocentrism. Nice answer tho, appreciate it"

2104,"1. Take the [Sexualiy IAT and Transgender IAT](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) from Harvard to get an objective measure of your prejudice. This test can help you get a deeper understanding of your attitudes and beliefs.
2. Get even more educated on the topic and don't express your disgust
3. Surround yourself with people who are not homophobic or transphobic
4. Confront your disgust. Knowing someone who's gay/trans is the best way to overcome it. You can also watch some LGBT+ movies from time to time.
5. If you are well educated, you know that there's nothing wrong with being gay/trans. You may still feel disgust, but you don't express it and you don't let it influence your opinions. If this is the case, it will be very beneficial to join the LGBT+ community and/or surround yourself with LGBT+ people.

It may take some time to adjust, but it's 100% possible."

Instead just accept that’s the way it is, even if it confuses you. Also remember that even in the LGBT community there are varying definitions and there are also varying viewpoints as well as liars/misinformed people, so make sure you become better versed in this stuff but also make sure it isn’t just one person telling you everything. I can say with personal experience it’s very hard to change your views or thoughts or feelings on a subject but you can still do it.

This is probably a jumbled mess but yeah lol I hope it helps"
2108,Please don’t act creepy
2109,You don’t have to cut ties with religion to not be a bigot.
2110,"I suppose the best way is to get to know some LGBT people and get used to them. Every gay person I've met is so normal that you wouldn't be able to tell they were gay unless they mentioned it, so keep that in mind."
2111,I’m trans and i have a lot of people in my area that are Muslims or have Muslim decent and they all seem to really hate me and harass all lgbtq+ people so I’d say just try to distance yourself with that part of religion cus it seems very toxic as far as I’ve seen. Maybe make one or several lgbtq+ friends if you can?
2112,"That was a very interesting test, thank you!"
2113,"First off, kudos to you for recognizing your prejudice and trying to stop it. 

Secondly, exposure will help. Get to know people in the gay/trans community. Watch/read movie/books with gay/trans protagonists. The more exposure you get, the more you will see them as normal people and the knee jerk disgust will go away"

2115,"I stand to disagree. I’m proudly Jewish and non-binary.

Edit: why am I getting downvoted all of a sudden."
2116,I thought it was intended as a joke
2117,STFU
2118,It’s different for different people. Leaving religion behind and becoming an atheist is a decision I have no regrets about and generally improved my life.
2119,Honestly I had the same issue coming from a conservative family as well. I find that talking to people on lgbt groups in the internet likely helps. Recognizing your prejudice is the first step so your on your way. ❤️
2120,"I had that same feeling, for quite a while, I was so scared to be trans yet here I am!"
2121,Don’t think this is helpful advice. They understand this already. It’s the knee-jerk reaction that they want to deal with.
2122,"Thank, I will :)"
2123,I did
2124,"Well that didn’t help nor answer my question, but fap harder I guess"
2125,You don’t have to be friends with people just because they’re  LGBTQ. The very least you can do is start talking to people in the community. They are just like you and I and are mostly very kind. By just striking conversation with someone who is LGBTQ can really help you in this process.
2126,pretty homophobic and transphobic if you ask me :) </3
2127,"You could try looking at some LGBTQ+ subreddits. I would not advice participating (at least in the beginning), as those are usually spaces where people come to feel safe and discuss the discrimination they face, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a look. I found that subscribing to non-binary subreddits helped normalize non-binary people and a lot of interesting ideas about gender for me, so maybe exposure to other ideas will help you to.

There are however subreddits that are specifically for asking questions about queer and trans issues, such as /r/asktransgender, which might be beneficial to check out. Here, you can ask as many questions as you would like, as long as you stay respectful, and you dont run the risk of making random LGBTQ+ people feel like they have to justify their existence (I'm sure that is not your intent, but it can be a problem if you ask random queer people to explain their identity to you. I'm not saying you would! Just that it's something I see a lot of.)

Finally, be kind to yourself. The past is unchangeable, but the future is not. How you treat people now matters a great deal, and the fact that you are trying to educate yourself shows a lot of progress! If you have questions about LGBTQ+ issues, or just questions in general, feel free to ask me! I love talking about it :)

Edit: Jammidodger on youtube is also a great resource for understanding trans issues!"
2128,Try researching about the immense struggles that Queer folks have had over the decades.
2129,"I’ve though about doing that...but making friends solely for that purpose just feels a bit off to me honestly. Plus, as not to offend any of them if I do make friends with them, I’m trying to educate myself more beforehand...."
2130,Idk about you but I’m on team everyone sucks.
2131,"Yep, 100%. It’s a simple safety precaution. I just don’t understand why some of these people are *so* stubborn about it. Like, sure, it’s a *little* inconvenient, but I think preventing the spread of a disease, thus saving lives, is a lot more important than convenience. And it’s not like it’s some sort of protest invented for Trump... wearing masks has been around for *centuries*."
2132,"As a Republican, it hurts me that some people in this party aren’t wearing a mask for like no reason. Like all the people I’ve spoken to beleive COVID is real, maybe they don’t exactly know how dangerous it is. But I think they are doing it just to spite the dems."
2133,I fuckin hate the two party system. It literally just encourages polarization and an “us vs them” mentality
2134,And even THEN there’s polarization
2135,Yeah for sure. This isn't a political matter. It's a matter of life/death + the safety of your peers. Refusing to wear one is just you being a dick. Be conscious of you and your surroundings instead of blaming someone or a group of people for COVID.
2136,"The only thing they were saying in the beginning was 'it will go away soon' and 'we have it under control'

Well LOOK WHAT HAPPENED"
2137,"Iirc two million deaths was without preventative measures.

>Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the flu kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year.

COVID deaths in a little less than 6 months: 467,000 (actual number is much higher)

Also bear in mind that COVID's current mortality rate for closed cases is ~10%. That number stays the same if you remove countries from the numbers that haven't been reporting recoveries."
2138,Everything is politicized these days. It's silly.
2139,politics is dumb
2140,Yeah ik it’s dumb. I saw that they also refuse to follow social distancing
2141,"I think it's super dumb too, but please don't let trump rallies color your opinion of all Republicans. A lot of them hate him."
2142,Nobody is social distancing at the protests either.
2143,"It's really terrible that our governments basically got us into this situation by believing that the virus was a hoax and actively fighting measures to contain it until it got really bad, then violated everyone's rights by putting them under house arrest indefinitely, and are still making no effort to fight the virus.

Having to wear a mask is not the issue. (Although for some people, it could be. They may not be able to get enough air through a mask, or may not be able to afford a mask, but that's not the point.) We shouldn't have to significantly worsen our lives by removing in-person interactions because someone decided that letting people know the virus existed would make the country look bad or because someone wanted to spend our money golfing.

Almost everyone in almost every government (especially ones like the US and China) need to be removed from power and experience consequences for what they did."
2144,"Saaaame, it’s a dumb system that as you said, creates an “us vs them” situation, even though it’s a political SPECTRUM, not two stark opposite sides"
2145,"Yeah, like idk if you saw the Trump rally but literally nobody was wearing masks, no social distancing, literally just morons"
2146,I am just saying selective outrage is not right
2147,The Coronavirus doesn't care that the protests are about racial inequality it's still going to spread it.
2148,Damn right about that. People so obsessed with shit like who’s right or wrong and if you don’t agree your a fucking stupid (insert name here). Polarization is so strong everything is political now. We ain’t gonna get anywhere if we keep bashing heads against one another. The idea to agree to disagree civilly is dead.
2149,"Well now I'm really confused because according to [this](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) the CDC has said actual deaths are almost double.

Conflicting evidence from the same guys is fun"
2150,"Most if not all of the protests are outdoors, where it is exponentially less likely to catch the virus. The Trump rally is in an enclosed arena where everyone's breath just circulates and before you know it you're breathing in what the person on the other side of the place was breathing out."
2151,I’m republican and wear masks I just never leave my house.
2152,"Exactlyyyy. I see so many Republicans at my school always promoting shit like “the left wants blah blah blah” and like nah bro that’s a fuckin straw man argument. And same with some people bringing up gun control soooo much. I’m more right for a lot of things like gun control but also like can’t we all prioritize climate change, privacy, human rights, and education for at least like two terms?? Maybe reform the immigration system so it’s not shitty while we’re at it? (All US problems)"
2153,"The protest is to bring light and justice to the racial inequality in America, the rally was unnecessary, and probably won't earn trump any new support."
2154,"even if they didn’t work, that’s the worst case scenario 

putting a piece of fabric on your face is not that large of an inconvenience, and we don’t know for a fact whether it works or not, so why not just bear with it for now? It doesn’t kill you"
2155,There’s risk involved with every protest.
2156,"They want the freedom to be stupid and hurt others.


Because best case scenario, the experts are right and masks can prevent transmission.

Worst case scenario: The EXPERTS are wrong and masks don’t do anything. So you are mildly inconvenienced by a piece of cloth, and you’ve given others piece of mind. 

But no. They demand the freedom to be a jackass"
2157,"Trump got warned about it in December and didn’t do batshit until it started getting bad in March don’t tell me they were right about everything, all Republicans did was pretend it didn’t exist"
2158,[deleted]
2159,I agree it’s and to add on it’s not about republicans not wanting to wear masks it’s about republicans not wanting the government to have the power to make them wear masks
2160,"Yeah don’t force it, let it come naturally"
2161,"i expect it to take a while, its very difficult for me to really open up to people so i always think that it could be the same for them"
2162,I would expect no less noble elephantboob
2163,Idk but I’ve never opened up to anybody and then recently I met this one girl and I somehow felt like I could trust her with my stuff. I don’t know why but I told her way more than I’ve told anyone else.
2164,Wow now I've got an image of elephant tits stuck in my head
2165,"When he is ready and would be comfortable with me knowing and me telling him deep secrets, it has nothing to do with his long y'all have been together, it is how slow or quick relationship is"
2166,I’ve been in that situation before. Hopefully it works out well for you.
2167,Not too fast. Make sure you're comfortable with them.
2168,Your welcome
2169,Sorry i cant answer but what does opening up involve? Im ns ive done it
2170,thx man i sure hope it does too
2171,never do something you’re uncomfortable with. we can tell. also not all girls want someone who’s going to spill their guts to u on like day three. my first boyfriend told me he loved me like 2 weeks in to our relationship and then was like “arent u gonna say it back” i had a damn hear attack
2172,Idk maybe a few weeks?
2173,"don’t worry. people open up in different ways and it doesn’t have to be crying and sharing your darkest secrets. a lot of people express closeness or trust with someone through things like sharing music, inside jokes, etc. just take it slow and i’m sure she’ll understand!"
2174,"I've never understodd why you get together with someone if you don't feel like you love them to some extent at least, just seems really weird to me"
2175,love is a very strong word to me. we were still in that stage of dating where we just went to movies and got food. we’d only kissed once at that point. i feel like love is a huge milestone. love is i would die for you. i don’t feel like i could say that to someone so soon
2176,i try not to have any expectations when it comes to this stuff because it’s such a personal thing & everyone is different
2177,"I want that kind of connection, but I tell maybe one person thing sometimes just so she can help clear my head a little. I think it'd take a while for me, and I'd have to really love and trust that person."
2178,This is a good question girls i write a lot on relationships if anyone wants my extended answer come check out my blog its packed full of advice when it comes to relationships [davissquad169118002.wordpress.com](https://davissquad169118002.wordpress.com)Davissquad
2179,maybe in a year i expect that he is open to me
2180,"I have only like really opened up to this one girl that I met earlier this year. We are a thing but not in a relationship and I don't feel like I have been able to fully open up to my male friends but it felt so good to open up to someone, and especially to her. When I first really opened up we had basically met just 2 months before that (but we had hung out together 24/7 for 2 and a half weeks.)"
2181,"I was thinking more like a pair of boobs and the right one is just a little tiny elephant butt, with the tail hangin' down just danglin'."
2182,Wow. You couldn't have put it more aptly.

2195,New corona strains looking at you rn
2196,"I painted my nails instead of paying attention in german class, online school is actually so ass"
2197,"""those masks were so cool omg 🤪"""
2198,Seeing how many much worse time periods have been romanticized I wouldn't be surprised if Gen Alpha or whatever gen after them romanticizes the pandemic. Tho I hope they don't
2199,ye but they shouldnt *wANT* to wear masks even when shit is normal 😭
2200,"it will always be a thing, how common it is & less feared will change tho"
2201,oh rip yeah it’s probably worse now because of covid but school before covid was better right? or is in person at your school really bad
2202,"The generation after Alpha is called Gen Beta. 

Somewhat unfortunate name, ngl..."
2203,oh nooo😭
2204,Well they'll probably do that but I think wearing masks when you go outside and are sick is hopefully going to be normalized like in asian countries. So masks will probably be a thing in the future fashion wise or medicalwise
2205,"LMAO yeah you right, imagine they all just start wearing them as like a fashion statement💀"
2206,"not the next generation, maybe in a few decades."
2207,"I agree, I think wearing masks when ill should be normal here. In Asian countries people also wear masks to help protect against pollution, and in a way its a part of fashion since its so normalised."
2208,"idk if it was better before covid, but only this week ive had so much fucking shit thrown at me, and i just cant handle it. my math teacher want us to have 4 fucking exams and the year ends in like 3 months."
2209,Shit. You right they gonna turn this into some Disney sitcom high school musical that’s just as bad as tik tok is right now.
2210,“I wish I could just be locked at ✨ h o m e ✨ the entire day🥰🥰”
2211,"This will DEFINITELY happen, haha. Even the worst periods in history are looked back on fondly by people who didn't live through it"
2212,I’ll just remind them about how awful being in a pandemic was.
2213,"I agree, but I also kinda like masks bc they keep my face warm in the wind. Also I can pretend sing in public while listening to music and no one will judge me lol"
2214,What kind of songs if you dont mind sharing?
2215,"Yes, but (and this sounds like a flex) she’s my gf and her name is Eliza so our song is ""Helpless"" from Hamilton (and yes I know I’m a guy)"
2216,"Well, here's the [link](https://open.spotify.com/user/tatumverbatim/playlist/5m3zK8eoxYlu9gz2rjHRsx?si=R48drc_RQhW8Ab0RLfqRog) to the playlist lol. It's really long but we were in a relationship for a while so I just kept finding more and more that made me think of him."
2217,"Yes, the song is Share your address (by Ben platt) and it’s only bc one time I was absent mindedly singing the song and he goes “hey nice voice OP! Turns out you cans do more then just skate” (that’s actually what he said, he added in the skate part bc I’ve been skating since I was two and it’s a known fact that I skate on the regs, not figure skate, I play ringette haha) and so now whenever I hear that song I think of him bc I literally never get/hate/ don’t believe compliments but he was literally so genuine abt it and he’s just so nice and he has a nice ass and ahhhh"
2218,"This dude didn't throw away his shot, and in the process blew us all away."
2219,honestly
2220,wow we've got a similar music taste!

2239,Sometimes when I’m playing a song on an instrument I associate it with a person. Last time it was love story on piano. Before that it was nothing else matters on guitar. It’s an endless cycle.
2240,I’m a guy and I do this with girls. And after a break up I know I’m over her when I listen to the song and don’t think of her.

2244,I get less motivated to do anything when I'm forced to do it
2245,"yup, and it usually puts me in a sour mood since I'm being told to do it."
2246,"yep, happens all the time and it’s seriously annoying"
2247,"Yep

Me: “ok. I think I should finally be productive now”

Mom:”you haven’t done *insert chore*”

Me: “well now I’m not going to”"
2248,"all the time, but then if I don't do it, they get even more pissed"
2249,ME
2250,Yeah I hate it
2251,OMG this is a true statement it just makes me want to do it less
2252,"yeah, motivation is gone"
2253,"Yeah! I think I've figured out why it happens too. There's something satisfying about when you choose to do something for yourself because it makes you feel accomplished, that's why you were going to do it in the first place. The second someone asks you to do it, it's not *for you* anymore so the satisfaction is gone"
2254,Hell yeah. I often feel like not doing it afterwards because it feels as though I was forced to do it
2255,Yes.
2256,"Literally just as I'm about to do one chore, she asks it and I'm like 'well now I'm not doing that'"
2257,"oh all the time! I dont know if that's just my pettiness, but all motivation to do something just... \**whoosh*\* gone out the window when she asks me to do something that I was GOING TO DO ANYWAY. And then I get angry and snippy and we get into an argument argh."
2258,Glad to know I'm not alone
2259,this is like my go-to conversation starter.
2260,"I’m about to play piano, my mom yells at me to play. I don’t want to play anymore"
2261," Yes especially when it’s something like cleaning my room, where I don’t particularly wanna do it but it really should get done. Like I was gonna do something without getting ask to do so but as soon as she asks it takes that independence away and her going oh wow I didn’t have to ask."
2262,If I feel like cleaning and my parents walk in and say something like “hey good for you for cleaning” I immediately dont want to clean anymore
2263,"Yessss, I'll be starting to clean and she'll be like go clean and all of the sudden I don't wanna do it!"
2264,Its the fact that its now an expectation
2265,Yes !!! I remember finally getting into reading LoTR and I told my mom since she loves reading and she started pushing me to read and I just stopped. Some day I will conquer those books!
2266,"yes, all the time"
2267,yeah
2268,lmao yeah
2269,Yes
2270,Yeah that's why I stopped doing home work and now I have to go back to school for 2 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting next Thursday

2284,"That’s a nice door you got bro

*shakes leg up and down lightning fast*"
2285,"Ok dude real talk. That is completely untrue. Here’s my guesses on why your sister said that:

1. She happens to like guys that she can “fix”. Idk maybe it’s some kind of complex but it’s not a universal thing.

2. She thought of a flaw of yours that may prevent you from getting a gf but doesn’t wanna say that flaw to your face.

3. She can’t think of any reasons why u don’t have a gf (which isn’t even that weird dude, I’m starting my first day of college next week and I haven’t had a bf) but she’s just trying to tell you something so you don’t feel bad?"
2286,"Oh god, here we go again. Your sister probably has a type and a bad one. Don't listen to her or change who you are because you want a girl to like you. Unless you let people take advantage of you because you are 'too nice', then you are fine."
2287,"Depends, popular girls like popular boys which usually are f boys"
2288,"I think the problem is exactly that, you don't show your assertiveness and therefore girls don't really want to hit it off, try to show it wherever you can like while talking to her for an example don't change your opinion just because she doesn't like yours and has a different one etc."
2289,I don't do them but if someone else wants too that's none of my business.
2290,Sorry. maybe not where u live but I live near Los Angeles and my school is some  rich kid school and literally at least 75 percent of guys are f boys and 75 percent of the girls are thots. It depends where you live I guess
2291,*clicks pen back and forth while staring into thin space*
2292,Of course I want a nice guy! Why wouldn’t I? I don’t want some person that vapes and goes to clubs and drinks alcohol and goes through girlfriends like crazy?
2293,"this seems like bs, I mean I'm 16, and whenever a girl (ANY AGE) talks to me, I say ma'am, and this one girl melts every time I say it"
2294,Maybe who knows. My sister is... interesting... sometimes she is my best friend other times she is... less then that.
2295,Thanks haha. Like I said I don't get taken advantage of too often except by my own family but no one knows about that. But I mean heck it's family what am I going to do? Let them suffer?

2332,"Idk I feel like empowered or something after, idk why lol."
2333,"2-3 times a month?

Oh dude... I do it 1-2 times a day... once in the shower and then in bed"
2334,i do it often and occasionally I'll feel disgusted lmao but the pleasure overrules the disgust tbh
2335,"Honestly yeah, I tried it like twice and it did nothing for me, was boring, and it made me feel guilty and gross. Never again.

Edit: the thread that I have caused god damn"
2336,[deleted]
2337,"I heard a lot of girls say that its boring untill they found the right spot.

Mabye try something new?"
2338,"interesting that girls find their vaginas way more disgusting than boys, I swear most guys wouldnt hesitate to stick anything up anyones anything"
2339,this!
2340,"sometimes youre sitting there, dick in hand, rumbling and fumbling and afterwards you realized you just nutted to  [HD uncensored lesbian tentacle roblox hentai](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/393/635/e2a.jpg)"
2341,"For me, no. As long as I don’t watch some weird-ass porn that makes me regret my life choices, I’m fine."
2342,So we're offing people now? I'll get my chains
2343,"I hate myself for this, but it’s sadly quite true."
2344,"Maybe, it’s just the thought of shoving my fingers up my vagina that weirds me out. I don’t think I’m horny enough to go searching for the right spot"
2345,"most girls masturbate by stimulating the clitoris, I've heard. From what I've been told, fingering yourself really isn't too effective."
2346,"I second this, pure imagination, unless you have aphantasia, is perfectly suited to your sexual preferences as opposed to porn and it doesn't require long searching for the ""good"" videos"
2347,🏅poor man's gold
2348,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2349,I'm gonna pass on that link
2350,"Same, but I somehow almost always end up on some weird-ass porn that makes me question my life choices."
2351,I don’t really feel disgusted although it depends on the context. I’ve dealt with sexual assault and it felt pretty disgusting when I did it for others in a sense. I will say that you’re definitely under average at 2-3 times per month but sometimes I go a month without doing anything so it’s not that abnormal
2352,Mood
2353,Ive got past the point of feeling disgusted after the age of 13 and now if i dont do it at least twice a day i get random boners
2354,i usually just feel lonely after
2355,do it coward
2356,"That’s not the only way to do it tbh, you can also just rub your legs together or press something on there, fingering isn’t the only way"
2357,"✔️ Report
I’m in this picture and I don’t like it"
2358,would they keep it confidential?
2359,"Yes, he'll ask you. Because if you want to take the pill, he needs to be reasonably sure you're not pregnant.

It's not obligatory to tell the truth to your doctor. It's just stupid to lie to him. And you don't have to discuss this with your mother around you. It should be fine to tell your mother that you came to an age that you want to see your doctor in private. I've never had sex, but I'm 100% seeing my doctor in private."
2360,If the doctor does tell your mom anyway that’s a huge lawsuit against the hospital!
2361,Ask your mom to leave the room when speaking to the doc and say stuff then. The doc isn’t allowed to tell your mom without your consent.
2362,"Yeah, my parents are never in the room when I have doctor's appointments. It's totally reasonable to ask your mom to leave."
2363,"Where I live, you get the right of confidentiality at 14 years old. Yes, they would keep it confidential if you ask to"
2364,"Less risk of getting pregnant, many teens have sex. Plus it can lessen someone’s period symptoms"
2365,"Maybe it’s easier, but birth control taken by a girl is a good way to lessen the chance of getting pregnant. If your condom breaks, at least you’re still protected with birth control"
2366,Birth control
2367,Money!!
2368,Someone explain what that pill is?
2369,The pill can help lessen period symptoms.
2370,Girls take these that young? I didn't know.
2371,"Yep, I understand, I just hadnt heard any girls taking these, thanks for explaining"
2372,Nope that isn’t true unless you’re at risk of hurting someone or hurting yourself
2373,"Yea that’s not going to work because then your mom will be like, “why don’t you want me in there” and she will automatically know your having sex."
2374,[deleted]
2375,Lots do just like it's not really something openly discussed by a lot of people
2376,That she can't make because she's not 18
2377,[deleted]
2378,"quick question, why does she want you on the pill? i have endometriosis and went on when i was 16, before i knew how to really treat it. it was awful and really messed with my body."
2379,If you say you don’t want her in the room the doctor will have to ask her to leave
2380,Yeah that’s kinda true but I’d just tell her that it my business and that I want some privacy :/
2381,"You could say you’ve heard they ask questions you find embarrassing and would be more comfortable if she stepped outside. Think of a topic she knows would be sensitive for you or she doesn’t want to hear about and she won’t push it. Detailed mental cycle questions, bowel movements or puberty (body hair, body odor, genitals, breasts, acne) for some examples."
2382,"she says i’m at “that age” with my boyfriend, implying that there’s the possibility of us having sex and she doesn’t want me to end up pregnant"
2383,Bad bot
2384,"gotcha! that’s good. i keep seeing people say things about taking BC to lessen periods, but that can be a whole other problem that BC won’t help! 

but in that case, ask to talk to your doctor privately. it’s totally confidential and will get you the care you need without involving your mom if you’re not comfortable :)"
2385,Uhhh why does she want you on the pill then?
2386,"Yep, I see ya"
2387,wait so it's compulsory to have a user flair
2388,"Huge thanks for the advice, but I do have a small concern. If I tell her that her body is perfect the way it is, wouldn’t it encourage her to keep her habits as she may think the way her body looks is due to her eating habits?"
2389,"Let me rephrase. Tell her that you think her body is perfect, no matter how it looks. Encourage her to eat more, bring her favourite food for her so she eats a little more, maybe talk to her parents and your parents about it. It might be intimidating, but her parents are in the best position to help her. Good luck man!"
2390,"Please flair yourself.

To flair yourself on mobile go to the main page of this subreddit and find the 3 dots on the upper right side. Click those dots and find the option change user flair and click that. Once you have clicked that you can find your flair there."
2391,Still good advice none the less I believe.
2392,"contact camhs or beat eating disorders because that sounds like anorexia to me and it only gets worse, trust me ):"
2393,"Please confront her or talk to her parents. I’ve struggles with my eating habits as well for a while and what I’ve learned from experience that if you have eating problems and somebody is asking you questions about it, you’re going to avoid it as much as possible. And there’s probably much more beneath the surface that they’re hiding, it can get pretty messed up, but remember that it’s not something they’re doing it’s something that’s happening to them. My advice is to have a conversation with her or have her parents have a conversation with her and let her know there’s a way out of her eating habits.

I wish you the best of luck!"
2394,do not tell anyone’s parents and do not tell her to eat more. my parents were told and they force fed me. it was extremely traumatic and i had to go to therapy. bringing food is a good idea but definitely don’t tell her to eat more. honestly if someone told my parents i had an eating problem that would be a break-up-and-publicly-shame-them level betrayal
2395,"Make her food, take her out to eat, words of affirmation, lots of attention and love, reassurance."
2396,sorry sir this is reddit nobody has had experiences with girls source: everyone /s
2397,"Damn, identifying info is required to participate in this sub? That's kind of messed up ngl."
2398,"I've had friends with eating disorders and to see them going through that is heart breaking. I've struggled with eating problems myself and you should try to get her help as soon as possible. The longer you let this sit, the worse it's going to get. Eating disorders are the most fatal mental disorder. If you trust her parents, you should tell them, if not, maybe talk to the school counselor? Just don't force things onto her. Don't make her feel overwhelmed. Eating disorders usually are about control. If she doesn't feel in control of her life, she might want to be able to control her body. Basically what I'm trying to say is, talk to a trusted adult before this gets any worse. This is going to fuck up her health in the long run."
2399,"Nah, you only need your gender."
2400,"each individual case is different. of course it sounds like an eating disorder, but it might not be. also not everyone has the same thought process as you, so they might appreciate the effort. Obviously the choice should be carefully considered and tailored to the specific case, but something needs to be done, even if they just get her therapy rather than force feeding her."
2401,"DISCLAIMER: I have experienced an eating disorder so I feel like my advice is a little more highly weighted. DO NOT COMMENT ON HER APPEARANCE. unless you are afraid she is going to actually die, it’s none of your business. It’ll piss her off big time. like enough that she might break up with you for it. Maybe bring her foods she likes more often so she might want to eat it, but that’s all. it’s her body, she can do what she wants with it. I’ve only had one BF and he was in the same boat I was, but if she’s underweight and has eating problems DO NOT BRING IT UP. the last time someone actually said more than a few sentences about my eating habits (i’m not proud of this btw) I lost my shit. Try to encourage her (without telling her) to eat when you are with her, other than that there is nothing you can do. however, if you think her life is in danger you should tell a trusted adult. and I cannot stress this enough: DO NOT JUST TELL HER TO EAT MORE FOOD, SHE WILL BE UNBELIEVABLY UPSET"
2402,Do you have any specific advice for if I don’t trust her parents or if we don’t go to the same school?
2403,I am asking you why you said no when you're already flaired.
2404,"Yeah, id try encouraging healthy eating and stuff like if you can take her out to places with healthy food and always try and encourage her to eat more nutritious stuff when you can. Dont try and force it as it can be uncomfortable and make sure she knows shes beautiful when shes healthiest. I knew someone like this, i dont talk to her anymore so take this with a grain of salt. Good luck i hope she gets better soon i know how it feels."
2405,"As someone who has been in that situation ( of the unhealthy eating ) 

Get her one on one and tell her that you care about her and are worried 

( She knows what shes doing to herself but she just wants to be ""skinny and pretty"")

You need to tell her that it's not about eating less it's about eating healthier. Tell her that if she doesn't stop that she will die or cause serious irreversible damage to her body.

And that this information is coming from someone who does understand and know what it's like

It's not about changing your diet it's about changing your thinking.

❤️❤️❤️ Please be healthy"
2406,this is just my opinion but if someone told my parents i had an eating problem I would deadass end their life. broken up with and publicly humiliated. I would be unbelievably angry
2407,THIS IS THE ONLY GOOD ADVICE ON HERE
2408,"if someone had an eating disorder/mental illness, i wouldn't think of it as ""ratting them out"", but rather bringing it to light. I'm currently suffering from depression and anxiety, but i'm too scared to tell my parents for fear that they might get mad at me for not telling them sooner. It might be a similar case here."
2409,"Lol, knobhead"
2410,"Source: had an eating disorder. no offense but definitely do not do this. it will be an absolute shitstorm. someone tried to do this to me once and i was so pissed we ended up getting in a physical fight. you can tell her she’s perfect or whatever but do not voice your concerns. 

If you tell her you are concerned about her weight she will take it to mean she is disgustingly ugly and try to lose more weight or possibly become suicidal because she kind find a way to please everyone at once."
2411,"Please flair yourself.

To flair yourself on mobile go to the main page of this subreddit and find the 3 dots on the upper right side. Click those dots and find the option change user flair and click that. Once you have clicked that you can find your flair there."
2412,"Jesus Christ thank you so much for this. I was kinda skeptical with using other people’s responses as they were mostly from uh... guys. But are you sure there is nothing else I can do? I’m only able to see her once a week for 2 months (as we go to different schools), but after that, maybe once every month. Is there anything I can really say when calling or texting with her?"
2413,Fuck off
2414,i only said this to my ex when she said she thought she was fat and was going on a diet.
2415,"You could present her with evidence to why she shouldn't do these kinds of things. Like, it can cause heart problems, you'll always be cold, you'll have low energy levels, etc. Try to push her to get help without specifically ""you need help"""
2416,"you’re so welcome. i’ve been on the other side of a very similar situation. there’s some good advice here and also some things that are basically the exact opposite of what you should do. if you don’t trust her parents i wouldn’t tell them about it. also, people will be more willing to eat if it’s food they really like, so maybe get her some small snacks you know she likes for her to eat throughout the week.  when texting or calling, compliment her a lot, lots of love and affection, but keep it mostly about her as a person and not necessarily how she looks physically. say less specific things like “you’re so pretty” or focus on one part of the body at a time (your hair is so soft, etc) and avoid saying things about the fact that she is underweight, as she will likely interpret that as an insult. right now it’s more important that you make sure she doesn’t lose any more weight or feel any worse mentally than it is to actually fix the problem. i also have a question about any medications she might be taking. If she uses anything like Adhd medication or antidepressants, those are appetite suppressants and it may be that she just doesn’t get hungry anymore. if she is purposely starving herself it will be easier to temp her with foods she likes. hope this helps :))"
2417,this only works if they aren’t already underweight. thinking you should lose weight is not the same as body dysmorphia

2457,I can’t even be around the “nice” homophobic people. I’m also pansexual but he didn’t know yet so he was in for a surprise.
2458,I second this
2459,"I severely distaste homophobes simply because they're dicks. If I came across a homophobe who was respectful about it (like they wouldn't date you if you weren't straight, but they still respected that you weren't; or they still date you because they like you regardless of your orientation) then we might get along; but all of the ones I knew were too open about it and were just assholes. Full disclosure, I'm straight, but my experiences with those people were all very unpleasant."
2460,Came here to comment this lmfao
2461,"You know, I make gay jokes and stuff but they are jokes ya know, they aren't serious. Now if he makes jokes than that's fine (to an extent) but if he is really like ""gay people are dusting"" then yeah you did the right thing."
2462,I fourth this
2463,"I'm too poor to give you an award so I'll just clap

👏👏👏"
2464,Same for me
2465,I third this
2466,"I think i might be able to. Im not overly religious but theres this one boy that goes to my school, hes very nice and welcoming and i do like him. He's religious and says that being gay is a sin and i disagree and im bi. I hope he can be more tolerant with lgbt people because hes very kind with other things like rape. I opened up to him and he was probably one of the most helpful people in terms of comfort. Hes a good person hes just not all the way there i think. I could be biased, because im attracted to him, but he doesnt think they should be sent to conversion camps or anything, so I guess it vould be worse."
2467,I feel like most people don’t even hate homophobic cause of what they think it’s more of what they do
2468,That’s like asking what’s wrong with being racsit? It’s wrong because they hate people for stuff they can’t change and are hateful assholes that’s why.
2469,"No, just like I also wouldn't date someone whos racist, sexist, anti Semitic, or Islamophobic"
2470,Same lmao
2471,"Nope, I couldn’t understand people with that mentality and I’d end up getting upset with them. It definitely wouldn’t work out."
2472,Same here !
2473,He pretty much said that all gay people are going to hell and that he wouldn’t even change in the same locker room as a gay person because he doesn’t want them to try to suck his dick. Stuff like that then it just got worse.
2474,He doesn’t seem like a terrible person tbh
2475,"I feel like it's gotten to the point where people just frown at the word now. If they know someone is homophobic, they no longer bother with that person. I'm personally willing to get to know them before I judge, but all of my experiences so far have had negative results."
2476,I’m pansexual but I don’t be looking at girls tits in the locker room. People have self control even horny teens.
2477,Lmao same
2478,Press x to doubt 🕵️‍♂️

But no cap no one's ever called me good looking outside of the internet :(("

2483,"Yeah, I feel way better anywhere, but school. But I think its mostly my uniform, its too big for me and I look kinda weird."

2553,"On the flipside, I see anybody who can play guitar even at a beginner level and get jealous.

2556,Yep :(( *sad musician sounds*
2557,One thing about the exotic fish keeping industry.. you need to want to learn simply boring facts and gotta accept not so appealing truths about the hobby... most kids dont want to change the way they view the world so it leaves most older guys to excel cause we grow and keep a passion where as a kid usually burns out much more easier..
2558,This happened to my brother. After third year and his exams his love for art just kinda fizzled out and im really sad cus I thought he was hella good
2559,Oh my God some of the shit they do is insane! Like you did a triple backflip into 3 handsprings then put your butt on you head while balancing 2 clubs and a ball?! Wtf?
2560,"Yes, I've seen younger people play better football than me and have better skills than me"
2561,I know your feeling as a fellow pianist but the I say to myself that these “child prodigies” probably won’t enjoy music when they get older because they were so forced to learn in an early age that they learn to hate what they do. That gives me the strength to continue
2562,"Yeah, all the time with guitar but the thing is, with these child prodigies, they probably never do anything else but practice to get to that level of ability.

I'm sad about not being as talented as them but I'm not entirely sure they have well-rounded lives all the time."

2601,"Noo, not like burning hot mercury, like just the mercury when it warm too. And we were doing an experiment that's why she said that and it sounded pretty serious. This was 4 years ago"

2603,Umm...have u ever heard of mercury poisoning?
2604,I mean he's right in theory but nobody should want to test that
2605,Yes a little more
2606,"Yes, I have. But elementary mercury is very poorly absorbed through digestion (or skin contact). The dangerous stuff about it is its vapors. I mean, of course, it may pose some health risks digesting it, but nothing super big."

This is based off of the fact that the guy already is your friend though..

Edit: adding on: this might be a bit cultural but I’ve also experienced that the guy tries to touch me more. Not sexual ofc, more like tickling, hugging and maybe giving massages. Again, this is probably sexual cuz in Sweden touching like this is very normal between friends of different genders."

because it has never happened to me"

I must be really bad at it, cause I met this guy at this driving class thing we have to do get a license, and he was constantly joking around with me, pushing the back of my chair around, stuff like that. And then at the end of the night he got all shy and asked for my Snapchat, but I gave him my Instagram cause I barely use Snapchat. Turns out he had a girlfriend and she was on his Instagram lol. I must have been reading way into everything, it’s a shame though, I liked him."

edit: i told her I liked her back and had a crush and she said she didn't like me back for clarification."

2839,"Yeah, it does seem like it. What you do with your body should be decided by you. Shaving away a unibrow isn't drastic, and it's for the better, so your parents shouldn't be forbidding it."
2840,i dont really think that at almost 17 u should ask for permission to shave your own body
2841,Straight up
2842,You gotta have a serious talk with your parents. Tell them that you're becoming an adult and need to learn to take care of yourself and learn responsibilities. They won't be around for all your life.
2843,It'd suck to get ingrown hairs though.  Just pluck it.
2844,Damn that's worse than my parents and they're pretty bad.
2845,What was their reasoning for not letting you shave ?
2846,"Im not saying go full rebel mode, but maybe start doing stuff thaf they wouldn't approve of (not taking shots of heroin or anything) that you know for a fact you can do just to show them.

Not sure of what your parents do or dont want you doing, but maybe shovel the driveway or climb a ladder or something. Maybe get a job if you dont have one.

How the hell are you supposed to grow and learn if you dont twist a few ankles or get some cuts and bruises."
2847,"Honestly if your parents say that dating and plucking eyebrows are dangerous then  you probably shouldn’t listen to them to much, you’re only young once"
2848,Your parents sounds like such hypochondriacs wtf? My parents used to be really strict but not this bad
2849,exaclty
2850,"I think it depends on the type of hair, but I've heard plucking makes your skin sag sooner, especially under the eyebrow. For in between brows though, I guess it wouldn't be a problem"
2851,"Think of it like this: if i have a mole at school on Friday, then on Monday its gone

is that VERY weird ??"
2852,"Just do it yourself man, you’re an adult now. From what I know it seems like your parents aren’t treating you like the age that you are, and that’s wrong

Edit: when I say adult I mean you can think for yourself don’t go out drinking :)"
2853,"Yeah, since that skin is pretty hard to make sag since it's flat and there's not much leeway for it to move in the first place."
2854,Over protected? More like you have controlling parents
2855,"I don’t want to be that guy but, no one, and I mean no one, is an adult at 16 years old.And I’m not talking physically or legally, I’m talking mentally.16 year olds just don’t have the experience to be considered as adults.Hell even most 21 year olds aren’t even adults yet."
2856,"Child of religious parents here, and in my experience, they kinda deserve insults lol"
2857,"For those of you who don't know, hypochondriasis is a mental disorder that makes you overly paranoid and basically causes you to think you have a condition the minute you read about it."
2858,"I’d say that depends on the person, I’m sure you won’t take me seriously no matter what I say because I’m “only 14” or whatever but I think your at least adult enough to shave your eyebrows don’t you?

Edit: not trying to come off as rude but I just love debating these things"
2859,If you need to ask this you probably are
2860,"            You are overprotected, but so was I, and I kind of managed to slowly expose them to whatever it was that was sOoOo bad for me. 

edit: After reading comments I do agree with letting your parents know that you're nearly an independent woman now and that they should cool off on the sheltering, but if they refuse that notion, the trick is to slowly and subtly do the thing.

           So for example, you unibrow, get an eyebrow razor and shave off a little bit, so that your eyebrows only look ever so slightly different. Start slowly fixing it over time and after maybe three months, it would have been slow enough that they either would have accepted it or haven't noticed it because it progressed slowly. 

Good luck my dude! Happy 2020 :D"
2861,[deleted]
2862,Definitely overprotected
2863,Your parents are EXTREAMLY overprotective.
2864,"I think you should do whatever the fuck you want because you’re 17. It’s time for your parents to learn that you’re growing up and that you’re able to make your own decisions. If they don’t trust you to be responsible and learn from your mistakes now, how will you ever become a responsible adult later on in your life? By protection you from possibly making mistakes, they’re actually doing more harm than good"
2865,"Think of it like this: if i have a mole at school on Friday, then on Monday its gone

is that VERY weird ??"
2866,Maybe tell your parents that the school nurse suggested you remove it as they can develop into skin cancers?
2867,Probably just a little weird upon notice that it's gone but then no one would think about it after that
2868,"i think the fact you have to ask this is a problem. of course anyone WOULD date someone in a wheelchair if their personality was godlike. The thing is though, that everyone takes the fact the other person is in a wheelchair into account. You have to think about things differently and think about things you never had to when you date someone in a wheelchair. It's different that dating a person who is fully abled. I think almost anyone WOULD but it's a lot to handle when you actually do and people in wheelchairs acknowledge that and respect the dedication it takes to date them. sometimes people in wheelchairs don't want to date someone who is fully abled because they fear the other person will think they are a burden. there's a lot that goes into this and I thinks its unfair to think of it as black and white."
2869,"now that i think about it, yes i would"
2870,"i don't have anything against people in wheelchair, but since i am pretty active and like to go hiking and i like to go to the gym etc. i would want to do that with whom i date as well."
2871,I'd recommend some romance in high school to be fair. Depending on what you'll study in college you'll probably have less time to date then than now. And high school is usually when you learn most about relationships because that's when then matter the least and mistakes can be made without a super huge impact on your life.
2872,If there attractive and nice yes. Why would someone being in a wheelchair be a deciding factor if you want to date them?
2873,"Honestly, no the boy could never come home with me (Bus) and our house is only accessible via stairs"
2874,Well rip me then
2875,"Nah Man.  As a male, I can honestly say I wouldn’t date someone in a wheelchair.  It’s just a lifestyle I am not prepared to live.  I’d have to sacrifice my active lifestyle. I don’t want to do that.  Now if my wife ended up in a wheelchair?  I’m there for her."
2876,Just carry him up the stairs lol
2877,"I don't think i really would, unless i REALLY love that peeson, then yes. See i am a pretty active person, who likes to ride bikes, go to the gym, go hiking etc. and i would want to do all of those things with whom i date. I have nothing against people in wheelchairs, but i think that would just create so many boundaries for me and i don't think i would like that."
2878,"Or you're being reasonable and knowing your limitations. Dating someone in a wheel chair brings a lot of stress, medical bills, doctor scares, family pressure, and emotional strain to the table."
2879,Ahh. Yes. A valid reason. You may pass.
2880,Bro ur not a bad person because of that. Just cause someone’s opinion is different than yours doesn’t mean they are bad people
2881,"I mean, if my so got into a wheelchair I would still date him but if its someone in a wheelchair from the start I would have to take a lot of things into consideration"
2882,"I’m gonna be the selfish one and say personally, no 

But it’s not because I specifically dislike peoples of disability. For me it would be more of a lifestyle thing. I love the outdoors and I travel a lot. I don’t think I could handle it smoothly. 

I don’t know what I would do if my partner (or me for that matter) were to, god forbid, get into any sort of accident that would cause them to be in a wheelchair. Major respect for you."
2883,Nice
2884,Some people don't like people in wheelchairs and the stuff that comes with it. Those people are shitty but they do exist
2885,Bitch what
2886,Oof that's what I thought about dating too but didn't turn out that way
2887,Why
2888,Those are different sports though
2889,Of course! If my girlfriend happens to be wheelchair bound then all that will change will be planning dates at places with wheelchair accessible entrances!
2890,Couldn't agree more
2891,that’s what i was thinking too. the gym is my happy place and sports guys are my favorite. i most likely wouldn’t just because of the amount of things we couldn’t do together
2892,"preach. u probably couldn’t say no on this post without getting bombarded with downvotes, even tho she is asking a legitimate question with no hard feelings"
2893,Theres athletes in wheelchairs you know?
2894,"yeah, of course! unless that becomes like tehir whole personality."
2895,"I hold anyone with a disability up to the same standards I do normal guys. Your disability does not define you, and it is truly what is on the inside that counts."
2896,"If I really, really liked them, then yeah."
2897,Happy cake day
2898,Yeah. What's the point if nobodies going to see it?
2899,"It only bothers me if the post is days old, idc if other people see the comment, tho up votes are good"
2900,Guess its just me then my bad
2901,"Nono its fine man, not caring bout this stuff is finneee"

2905,Yeah! Its even worse when you know the joke is 🔥🔥
2906,i still reply because im dumb and don’t look at when they were posted😌
2907,"Why would OP not see it? No matter when the response is made, I'm pretty sure they still see it. And if all you do is skim, why does it matter in the first place?"
2908,Irony
2909,Bruh thats me with your post
2910,Why yes I do
2911,Just testing do you see this after 14 hours
2912,"I usually don’t pay that much attention to the time, the only person I’m really answering for is op. Plus, if the post isnt brand new (like posted 10 minutes ago and has 3 answers), my comment is gonna get flooded out anyways so I don’t really care 😂"
2913,😞😞exactly
2914,Damn😔✊
2915,Wait...
2916,I've played you at your own game
2917,Oh my god... I've been tricked I've been backstabbed and I've been quite possibly bamboozled.
2918,I've also waited about 13 minutes to respond to your replies! Also I wanted to use that RvB meme but I decided not to.
2919,You absolute fucking madlad
2920,You know it brother
2921,"Ahh, I answer stuff from days ago 

I just check the sub whenever I can and scroll down through all the questions I didn’t see. Sometimes I happen to check it 2 days later and still answer"
2922,"Idc if it was posted 13 hours ago. If I’m hyped to answer it, I’ll answer it. Just better not have been deleted/removed"
2923,"so what

just answer"
2924,Eh sometimes
2925,Oh I know right! I love potatoes!
2926,3h late for a great reply
2927,"eh, not really. If the OP reads it, that's good enough for me. 

idrc if no one else sees it when I comment late."

2929,"Sometimes I try to do this, but it always ends up in me annoyingly trying to find a comfortable position, giving up, then moving to the kitchen table."
2930,Ok coomer
2931,Exactly
2932,"Hehe..
""Position"""
2933,I don’t think I ever did my homework anywhere else than in school during the call list lol
2934,Laying on it or just sitting by it?
2935,Plus your papers won’t bounce off every time you move your body.
2936,"I try, but it just ends up being super uncomfortable and hurts my chest."
2937,I put a pillow under me and like lean over it? It’s comfy
2938,Both
2939,Thx :D
2940,"Honestly the reason I can't do it isn't because it hurts, it's because it makes me incredibly sleepy. I can't actually sleep on my stomach because it hurts my neck, but it's a super good way to make me sleepy and then I just turn over lol. Idk how people do homework like that though"
2941,Ok zoomer
2942,At the same time? Or is that just me?
2943,Nice name
2944,ok ooomer
2945,"Du Niederländer, dein Deutsch ist falsch."
2946,idk. i do it on my back
2947,That’s really annoying
2948,clipboard
2949,"Ok, German here"
2950,I do this because it can make your spine straight I think cause you're back is not straight as you sit so when I do homework I try to do it like that. And yes it hurts but it's a good stretch position.
2951,Are you from Germany or Austria?

2958,"As someone that suffers from depression and bpd, with these things you just need to force it. She might not like it, but you have to force her to go to therapy, you have to force her to get out. I could sit in bed, not showering or eating for a week if left to my own devices, but i have someone that forces me out to do things and im honestly very grateful for it"
2959,I try and make her get out but she still just wants to do nothing and lay around all day.
2960,"Tell her that you’re proud of her and compliment her as much as you can, and take her to a therapist if she’s open to it. Don’t force her or she won’t be able to reach out for help when she really, really needs it. If she goes to see a therapist and has a bad feeling about him/her, take her to another. Never force her into talking to someone she doesn’t like. It happened to me and it only made me more depressed.

MOST OF ALL: be there for her as much as you can!!! Make sure you seem open and available for her to talk to when she needs you. Don’t try to force her to talk, but just reassure her that you’re always there when she needs you.

GOOD LUCK!!"
2961,"Honestly it's hard I know but you just got to do it, ask her what she wants to do, if she says nothing just pick something and then say ""hey, we are doing this in 20 minutes, get ready, no excuses and if you're not ready in 10 then you are going like that""

And therapy would definitely help especially if it's a female because it might help provide her with a female figure in her life"
2962,I'll try this sometime. I'm going to feel guilty because I used to hate being forced to do things but I'll try it.
2963,"When you're mentally ill, the best thing that can be done is being pulled out of your little dungeon of sadness"
2964,I'll see if I can her friend to convince her too do things cause she doesn't wanna talk to me right now.
2965,"I don't ever force her to anything, and there's only one person that she talks to one a daily basis and that's of her closest friends that comes over all the time to check on her. I can't get her to eat or drink much anymore. I'm always proud of her, espically for opening up to me and telling me the truth about what caused her drastic change which was that the theater teacher at her school sexually assulted her and we were able to get it sorted out (not without me getting a few good swings in)."
2966,"I was sexually assaulted a few months ago as well and I now have to go to school with the guy every day. I’m very glad your daughter has a friend who checks up on her, that’s really good. I’m glad you’ve stood up for her and let her talk to you, the best thing for her is to find something she loves and really focus on it for a while and keep her mind off the incident as much as she can. Therapy can really help to work through it, and it might comfort her to know the guy is behind bars if you are comfortable pressing charges"
2967,"Enroll her in a local Deliectical Behavioral Therapy group (DBT) and if you are concerned for her safety take her to a mental hospital, its scary, but it will keep her safe.

I've been depression, anxiety, suicide, and I've bee to a mental hospital twice. I started a DBT group last year and it helped me far more than any therapist I went to or any center I was at. Everyone's different but that's my recommendation"
2968,"Luckily we didn't have to press charges, he turned himself in after more than one report about it. I'm not always sure what she likes doing much anymore because she doesn't do much these days. Her friend is always kind and he always listens to her even on the days where she's less than thrilled to go to school. I would recommend you tell someone about your assult tho it might you get some closure."
2969,Therapy. And just ne there for her
2970,I think that may just make her not trust anymore the only person she is trusting right now.
2971,"Might try this, it seems promising. What was your experience like mighy i ask?"
2972,"I would speak to a mental health professional ASAP, but do not take medical advice from this sub. How to treat mental illness is way beyond the scope of this subreddit. I saw in another comment that someone suggested a specific kind of therapy treatment, but you need a medical professional to evaluate your daughter and decide what kind of treatment would be good for her. There are many different kinds of psychotherapy and you should speak to a professional before deciding which one to pursue. I also saw in another comment that your daughter does not want to see a therapist and judging by the events you described that led to her to become suicidal and depressed, you know she needs help and forcing her to go is the right thing to do as a parent."
2973,I always try and be there and she's told me she would rather not see a therapist.
2974,"Thanks, I have. I went through the same phase as your daughter and I eventually came out of it. Just let her know that it might seem hopeless now, but a lot of people have gone through the same thing and she’s not alone."
2975,With DBT therapy or my entire mental health journey lol
2976,Thanks for the help.
2977,We'll try it and see where it goes. I'm hoping she reacts positively with it.
2978,DBT
2979,"Hi im 17 and i was diagnosed with bipolar 2, I’ve been hospitalized four times. Maybe she should be hospitalized it only lasts about four days"
2980,"I thing I learned quickest and needed the most was self love. That was huge for me. But the skills they teach you will prepare you for life. There are four units, each with a set of skills. 

It definetly has helped with my depression (as well as medication). Its a mixture of learning the skill and then having the determination to apply it, which takes time and effort but it gets easier."
2981,"Well therapy or support groups can be very helpful. But if she's not comfortable with that, then it's up to the people around her, and her own self too. Depression is something a person has to overcome themselves. All that the people around can do is help reduce the load, you can support her and help her till she can carry herself again. 

Going out is so so important. I used to lay in bed all day and it was one of the worst things I did for my mental health. Getting out of the house, even if it is for school, runs, concerts, anything, helps so very much. 

She has to get that motivation back. The motivation to get out of bed and face the world. She must have things that she loves to do, and depression can taint that love too. But if you know that she enjoys something a lot, do it with her. She likes guitar, right? You can take her to concerts of bands she loves, maybe get her a new sustain pedal or something she can experiment with, you can take her to workshops if there are guitarists around you who organise them. 

Encourage her to try out new things, and don't give up on it. Even if you know she won't come, keep inviting her. 

Also, it's important to listen to her. When I had depression my friends thought they knew me. They thought that they knew how I felt, but they really didn't. So it's important to talk to each other, and it's important that you listen and try to understand what she feels. 

Having a good support system is also important. Her surroundings shouldn't have people who might be toxic or disregarding of her feelings. A support system is what eventually helped me out. It was my class, and though they don't know they helped me, they did. 

Hug her when you get the chance, too. It increases oxytocin levels in your body, which is associated with happiness and less stress. 

Also, help her with normal day to day activities if you can. When depressed, it was really hard for me to do seemingly normal and easy chores. So helping with laundry, or helping clean her room could be helpful. 

It's important to not overdo it though. Don't spend all of your time helping her, and take some time for yourself. It's possible she'd just start depending on you than get better herself. She has to do it for herself, and not for anyone else, even if it is her parent. 

My parents always disregarded my feelings. The entirety of the time I was depressed, it was 'stop looking sad', 'talk more', 'youre skipping school, do you know what your teacher thinks of me?'. They managed to make everything I felt a jab at their respect. So I started to force myself to do things. I forced myself to become better at what they asked, and it just made my situation worse, to be honest. 'I give you a roof to live under, food, clothes, you should be happy', and I tried to happy, I did. But all that guilt-tripping just made me feel worse. So careful about that, I guess. That's all I'll say."
2982,"I try and not force her to do things but everyone I have asked have all said it's most likely the better option. So, I'll probably make her go at least once."
2983,"I agree with this completey, please just keep trying with her. Something has to change, I've been through a stage like this myself it's such a dangerous cycle to fall into.."
2984,"No, she's told me she would rather not gobwith therapy and i  was cobfuses but respected her decision for a while."
2985,I hated it when I was growing up so I told myself I'll never force my kids to do anything they won't need it enjoy.
2986, Does she have therapy?
2987,My parents did the same thing every time and they still don’t make an effort to understand even when I tell them what’s wrong.  My parents know about my suicidal tendencies and my depression and they always make it about them.
2988,What about half a meter stick tall
2989,nope. My family are all tall asses ( except for me ) and they’re almost a foot taller than me. sometimes it’s actually a relief to not have tall guys lookin like bigfoot next to me.
2990,"I would prefer to date a guy that’s taller than me personally, but I’m 5’2” so they don’t have to be that much taller"
2991,Are ya willing to go to 1/4 a meter stick tall?
2992,"5’11 girl here, i’ve only ever dated small guys. sure it’s a bit weird at first but i honestly couldn’t care less."
2993,"If we click, we click."
2994,"Yeah me too. Why is it that short guys are considered unattractive. Like am I , I mean my friend is pretty short and girls don't like that."
2995,Im in the same boat as you. My entire family is over 6ft and im over here being 5ft6
2996,Im 1/12 a meter stick tall
2997,"I wont date a guy shorter than me, but that's because I'm 5'2 and need someone taller than me for getting things of high shelves lmo"
2998,"What if they’re like, 4’8"
2999,Im smaller than most micropenises that guys in here have
3000,"Sure, we click, we click... but is that even possible? Like I think the shortest guy in the world is still taller than that"
3001,"no, most of the crushes ive had are shorter than me. some of my friends say i think my crush is cute like a BABY when that's not true at all"
3002,4 foot
3003,"nope, not for me at least."
3004,Same answer
3005,1 foot?
3006,Well you’re kind of short (no offense) so I don’t think many guys would be shorter than you anyway
3007,Nope it can be cute
3008,"I find short dudes absolutely adorable, as long as they have good proportions. I don’t want to have to jump up to kiss a guy, ya know"
3009,Wagwan chromie
3010,5'3.5
3011,[deleted]
3012,How tall are you
3013,if you are half a metre tall forget dating I'm registering you into the guinness world records
3014,Puberty brings me down to 1/24 every now and then
3015,"I really don't mind it, I dated a guy my exact height (5'2) and both him and I where fine with it. I don't think I have much of a chance of finding a guy shorter than me."
3016,But do you mean tall as in 6ft tall or just at least taller than her? I’m guessing both
3017,I dunno what that means
3018,"Nahh he looked, u just never caught him lmao"
3019,all the time
3020,Wrong. Its the opposite for most. If we like we stare like an eagle
3021,"wait 

so does that mean my crush doesnt show interest back ? -_-

edit: idk she does smile occasionally n makes eye contact first n would go out her way just to look at me like turning around or looking back"
3022,I think it depends on the person but I don't.
3023,"too much, to the point that THEY think i have a crush on them"
3024,It's because hes dumb. Everyone knows if you have been caught staring then keep staring to maintain the power position and then after a bit pretend you were zoned out
3025,"Really? Cause I caught a guy STARING at me, but I thought maybe it was just a coincidence. I looked up and he was staring and immediately turned his head away"
3026,F
3027,yeah i look at people who i suspect may like me even if i don't really like them...
3028,"Not always, I'm always subtle because I'm embarrassed lol"
3029,No guys have a crush on me to begin with
3030,Damn here I am thinking the.girl that keeps looking at me likes me but she's probably just checking to see if I'm looking
3031,"looking through the comments i think im just bad at noticing this or just bad looking ahaha.

never noticed someone had a crush on me or that someone was looking at me in that way might just be me tho lol"
3032,"Thanks for the self-esteem boost, mate. :)"
3033,F
3034,Aww surely somebody likes you. You might just not notice or already friendzoned him
3035,Don’t call me out like this haha
3036,Maybe you don’t look around that much
3037,I love being zoned out tbh
3038,"Yes we do, lol.

if I suspect someone might like me, I become hyperaware of their very presence"
3039,Oh my fucking god it's you
3040,"Lol, gotta try that next time"
3041,Smh those dumbasses don’t know that you’re supposed to glimpse over and not stare
3042,Could be both
3043,lmfao how tf do u kno me n where from
3044,"look at my post history, i made that shitty alita battle angel meme"
3045,so do you had/have a crush on any one of them?
3046,Yes I do and then I usually catch feelings too. Though it sucks if the other person actually doesn't like me. Because then I'm left with crushed hope.
3047,"i do it quite often and catch boys staring at me regularly and i have one thing to say: it’s hella creepy like i always feel so uncomfortable when i know someone’s staring at me constantly. like, please, i feel flattered that you like me but instead of staring me down, just start a conversation or something like that so you can look at me without being creepy"
3048,me before i go to bed every single night trying to plan out my future with my crush even though 99% of the things i think about never happen
3049,"Lol you have a point.I just have a big issue with self acceptance,maybe that's a part of it"
3050,Can confirm... I daydream about girls I like to
3051,Hm yeah I get that.Sometimes I can't even fall asleep properly bc I can't stop thinking about them.But I just can't help feeling like a major creep even if i'ts just normal stuff that I'm thinking about y'know
3052,"No. Fantasy’s about people is normal, especially when you’re a teenager"
3053,"Ugh felt that on a whole other spiritual level 😩






Here Iam imagining some wedding with them and then feeling like such an embarrassment after"
3054,"Guy, can confirm. Also felt a bit guilty about it but seeing as everyone uncontrollably do it I don't think it's necessarily too bad, as you said :)"
3055,Idk if it's guilty but more embarrassing thinking about marriage living together dates and knowing that they might not even really know my name or think of me like that
3056,I feel worse about the fact I just woke up from a dream I had about a girl I was into when I was 14. On some telepathic level it feels like I’ve done her wrong.
3057,To be honest as a guy that's like a dream come true if a girl was thinking like that about you. You shouldn't worry too much :)
3058,"I always daydream about girls I like, but sometimes it goes a little too far and I daydream about serious stuff like moving together, getting married, having kids etc. even though oftentimes I don't even know them well. I know it's unrealistic and I shouldn't be doing it, but I can't make myself stop."
3059,I get that.It just feels like you mentally raped that person or something
3060,not guilty just weird cuz i know the scenarios i imagine are -100% going to happen.
3061,Lol  that's legitimately what it feels like
3062,I also feel that
3063,"When I had a crush, I felt like it was an invasion of her privacy, because I didn’t have her permission to think about her that way"
3064,"Before quarantine I had started seeing his girl, and the other night I couldn't stop thinking about her while trying to sleep. So I sent her a message at like 1:30am about how I couldn't wait until we could see each other again, which made it easier and I fell asleep quickly.

We met again at school yesterday after two months. It was great:)"
3065,lol same
3066,"Yes definitely, but in addition to imagining scenarios I also replay the one second interaction we had that day over and over"
3067,"Not at all, everyone kinda does it. I try to not let it run to rampant though, because that's generally not a good thing."
3068,"I mean it's normal to fantasise about people you have a crush on, that's what comes with having crushes. But I try not to allow myself to fantasise excessively since it's easy to fall into obsession? idk i was once obsessed with one guy and suddenly went like 'hold up, what on earth are you doing?'.  So fantasies are normal and perfectly fine, as long as it's not an obsession - then it's just unhealthy"
3069,"I don't think you need any more confirmation that guys daydream about girls that we crush on, but here it is."
3070,"I know it's hard but try not to put people on a pedestal. It took me forever to realize that I'm no better than anyone else, but at the same time nobody else is better than me. You are totally worthy of thinking whatever tf you want"
3071,">mentally raped that person

lol"
3072,i feel unworthy of thinking about her :(
3073,I don’t understand how people can masturbate to their crushes
3074,Ughh yeah its so disgusting like honestly
3075,A little guilty but I mostly just know that 9/10 nothing will come out of it.
3076,"but if a girl heard that about a guy she wasn't attracted to she would be like ""ew""

what if they just aren't attracted to you? i bet if you found out someone you found unattractive was like this but with you you would be flattered *at the most.*

i sound like a dick right now but i'm right, right? lmk if im wrong"
3077,I don’t really feel guilty. It’s a running joke that I call my crush my “husband” so
3078,"Right that’s why y I flush first, open it, and then use the bathroom lmao I know it’s extra but like it’s so annoying how loud it is. It just broadcasts to everyone “she’s on her period”."
3079,They were invented by men who have no concept of trying to use one
3080,"Teacher: what’s louder? A jet or a vacuum?

Girls: pads"
3081,"I once opened a pad in a public bathroom and a little girl from the stall beside mine said ""chippy packet"" and I just 💀. I've never hated a sound so much."
3082,*i knew it*
3083,i used to open them before i put them in my backpack
3084,"""hahaha i do that"""
3085,Lmao I do thatt
3086,"Having a child not understand what's happening or what the sound is, is funny. There's no problem. Expect that it sounds like someone legitimately jumping onto a bed made up of chips."
3087,No need to be rude damn I just don’t see *why* they’d be so loud
3088,"Actually menstrual pads were originally derived from an invention by Benjamin Franklin used to tread wounded soldiers.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_napkin

So it's not mens fault at all."
3089,I don’t fuckin know but it will piss me off until the day of my death
3090,THANK. YOU.
3091,Your everywhere I say everywhere!!
3092,They are actually not that loud but your mind makes it sound louder because of you being worried about it being so loud and so the cycle continues
3093,Isn’t that unsanitary
3094,"**Sanitary napkin**

A sanitary napkin, sanitary towel, sanitary pad, menstrual pad, or pad is an absorbent item worn in the underwear by females who are menstruating, bleeding after giving birth, recovering from gynecologic surgery, experiencing a miscarriage or abortion, or in any other situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of blood from the vagina.

A menstrual pad is a type of feminine hygiene product that is worn externally, unlike tampons and menstrual cups which are worn inside the vagina. The pad has to be changed several times in 24 hours depending on whether menstrual flow is heavy or light.  

Menstrual pads are made from a range of materials, differing depending on style, country of origin, and brand.

3095,What's the problem?
3096,Because life hates us
3097,"Here’s a hack I learned 

https://youtu.be/K1LjMx0ZbRw"
3098,pads.
3099,that’s wasting 8 gallons of water in most cases though ://
3100,the **menstrual cycle** *finger guns*
3101,I'm pretty sure they could try something more fabric-like or use a softer paper to reduce the sound.
3102,"It's horrible, once my Trans friend had to change his pad in a public bathroom and then some guy thought someone was eating chips in there. And it's so awkward when you're hanging out with friends and have to change it, now everyone knows I've started. Ahhh it's annoying, we need silent pads."
3103,TIL pads are very loud when opened
3104,"You talking mad shit for someone who’s username is literally “*Glittercorn666*”

Sounds like you need to grow up more than we do"
3105,no? they fold in the way they were when closed and don’t get thrown around my backpack. I had a specific place to put them.
3106,They are as loud as jet engines!! But I use them because tampons scare me
3107,Imagine it's 3am and your entire family is asleep and the house is completely silent. And now you're trying to open that cake container thing and a bag of chips. Except you're really ashamed of eating that cake and chips so it sounds 40 times louder. That's about the best comparison I can think of.
3108,Okay that's understandable. Thanks for the reply!
3109,"I have hugged guys that asked and guys that did the *hug gesture* (arms stretched out) but I knew them or they were a friend of friend. I wouldn’t hug a stranger, especially a guy, because I would think he would try to kidnap me or something. Now if we had a long conversation or something and he was like nice to meet you *hugs* maybe. Tell us how it went please I would love to know."
3110,If someone asked me in school I would just do it and assume that it was a dare by his friends. But if it was some random stranger I would be a bit weirded out and maybe even scared.
3111,unless she's a hecca socially awkward person like me. if some random guy hugged i would kind of wish that didn't happen cause i would be placed in an awkward situation
3112,You should update us on how it goes
3113,"Being *asked* for a hug by someone I just met at a bus stop seems kinda weird. Maybe just start talking to her and if it goes well, try for a hug the next day? If someone I’d talked to the day before went for a hug then I would"
3114,Yes
3115,"I don’t like people invading my personal bubble, with a few exceptions, so no."
3116,Yeah if you don’t smell bad lol
3117,Thanks for the reply :)
3118,I would say there is nothing wrong with starting conversation with her but the guy should wait until she's knows you enough. I bet she would say no to the guy is you asked but it seems really nice of you 👌😢🤗
3119,"I am a very touchy persoon, so I don't know, it would depend on how they presented themselves. But in no time I would be greeting them with a hug."
3120,"Definitely, as long as you didn’t give me mega-pervert vibes or you didn’t smell bad. I love giving people hugs!"
3121,I'd only hug a dude after we've been talking for more than one day and I consider him as a friend.
3122,Yes
3123,that's good to hear :) gives me more confidence thank you!
3124,Wait why do you wanna give her a hug exactly? If i was a girl i'd be weirded out by that.
3125,"dude you gotta quit feeling sorry for yourself and make some friends. It's really as easy as being friendly with people in your assigned groups. of course that's easy for me to say because I'm extroverted and I know a lot of people on this sub and its counterpart are introverted, but really you just got to find a way to break the ice. Sometimes you have to thrust yourself into an uncomfortable situation but it'll be worth it in the end."
3126,"Wait, I haven't programmed that path yet"
3127,"I probably would if he's nice, everybody needs a hug and I'm definitely a hug person"
3128,definitely not if i had just met them. regardless of gender i feel like it would just be weird
3129,"i recommend just being friendly and charismatic, people react well if you greet them as comfortably as if youd known each other for years. from there, just be smooth. if you make affection weird, itll be weird, but from the start i put my arm around my friends or hold their hands or hug them and theyre fine with it because i never made it a big deal so they didnt feel it was a big deal either."
3130,Tell us how it goes
3131,I love hugging so I would probably do it
3132,i wouldnt hug a creepy looking guy but pther than that yes i love hugging people
3133,"Probably but wait to know her a bit, don’t straight be like “hey there! Hug me”"
3134,"I’m personally a hugger so I would hug anybody who asked, but I think you should introduce yourself and get a little closer before asking that."
3135,Depends. If I got to know you a bit probably but if you came up to me on the street then no
3136,"I'd say it depends on the girl, this may just be me being a non-touchy person but I would not hug a guy I just met. It would be awkward and uncomfortable"
3137,Only if he's my best friend or he (or myself) is about to leave for a long time. If a stranger asked for a hug I would try to light heartedly  say how about a handshake instead and refuse to hug.
3138,"“____, can we talk for a minute? In private?

I’m flattered but I want to make it clear that I only see you as a friend. And only a friend. I know you made rumors of us kissing in the bathroom. That really hurt my feelings you did such a thing and makes me not even want to be friends with you at all. I know it may seem silly now but making up those kind of lies could have ended very badly. You know that’s not appropriate nor would I want you to tell people those lies.”

And if she continues those rumors or lies go to guidance and explain the situation. I don’t know her at all, but if you think it’s possible she may get mad and plot revenge of sorts go to the teachers, staff, any adult at school basically. Even the principle of things get bad enough, making up those rumors would be a form of bullying if out of revenge. And even now as she’s most likely doing it to impress her friends that’s absolutely not appropriate."
3139,"Best option* 

From my experience, this method has a 100% success rate"
3140,In the post he says he's 13m
3141,"This probably not the nicest way, but just embarrass the little brat. That’ll stop her, you’re way to old for her and she’s clearly obnoxious and lying so just put a stop to it now, before something bad happens.😂"
3142,"As a girl, I can agree that that is the best option OP has"
3143,"dude not in private, ive been down that road and the kid told everyone me hooked up in private, instead i think op should just pull her to the side (still in a public place), but just to the side so no one can hear them"
3144,"Talk to her privately and tell her that the rumors and stuff she's said to and about you have made you really uncomfortable, and that you have no romantic interest in her. Maybe throw in the fact that a relationship between a 10 year old and a 13 year old would be weird either way, too."
3145,"I think their flair is pretty normal. Homosexuality is pretty normal, however to see it in someone so young might be what’s throwing you off here. Also, I doubt that a young girl can tell people that a boy kisses her in the bathroom every day and nobody is gonna go “o shit wtf”

Edit: I’m blind in the post it says 13 m 😅"
3146,"Dude, homosexuality actually occurs in other species in nature too, ever heard of gay bees? And like, homosexuality isn't something that's appeared in the last 200 to 300 years, the Greek had been doing it for ages. Just because you don't understand, doesn't make it weird."
3147,"dude It’s definitely weird that most of the replies here are all guys and I’m only worsening the situation by replying, but the best way to deal with this is to be entirely direct and clear that you have no romantic interest in her. Or, if you’re feeling brave, ask out your crush and then she will hopefully take the hint. And even then maybe having a direct and clear conversation with 5th grader is a good idea."
3148,bruh
3149,Yeah I was referring to the 13F 13M thing but oh well :/
3150,"Yeah, I think he's already pretty embarrassed by what she's done"
3151,Shes literally 10 and hes 13 how would that give u a bad rep... wouldn't engaging in a relationship be much worse
3152,"Being left handed is 7%, is that not normal?"
3153,Do this but publicly or else she might twist it around into another rumor
3154,"She is in 5th grade. She doesn't know what it means. If it is making you uncomfortable tell her to stop and if she doesn't, tell a teacher."
3155,Ah yea so youre saying shell do worse.
3156,"I mean, he's not wrong..  
They're not saying it's a bad thing, just that it isn't a *normal* thing..   
More so meaning it's just not something you see at all times, everywhere in your normal everyday life and is an uncommon sight.

Personally I've kissed my fair share of girls and doubt it not being a ""normal"" thing..  
but they're also still right in it being rarer than most other things especially depending on where you live"
3157,"tell her that you're not going to put up with this and that you don't appreciate her stupid rumors....so basically make your point in a straightforward way but don't go too harsh on her. if she continues to bother you after you politely tell her to stop, that's when you should tell an adult"
3158,+ she won't do that ever again if u embarass her real bad..
3159,Oh yeah I’m blind lol
3160,"She's being creepy about it, but she's also pretty young. Try and let her down gently but if she keeps being weird tell a teacher, parents, etc. or just flat out tell her to stop."
3161,Why does your flair says youre 13f when you said youre 13m lol
3162,Just embarass her tell everyone that u havne't done anything and u don't even like her. That'll stop her for good.
3163,Kick her head in
3164,"What the heck XD, can’t argue the logic there, but it does seem kind of a dick move and could give you a bad reputation."
3165,"Yes, but you’re obviously not thinking about the fact that even though she’s ten, she is human and has feelings, she obviously has a voice in her class since she goes around spreading rumors, what do you think she’s gonna say if OP doesn’t let her down slowly?"
3166,Cause i just assumed shes somewhat decent but ig she wasnt raised at all then lol
3167,"It's very uncommon  
And to play off the definition of normal, it is not standard and unusual  
So no it's not a normal thing to be left handed, that is a very unique trait"
3168,Yeah same. One of my friends is super pure and never had any social media. Recently he made an insta and his @ spread like wildfire across our year and he got like 100 followers within a day.
3169,no i dont really use social media outside of reddit either and neither do most of my guys friends. some of my girl friends use instagram and snapchat which are good ways to like talk to each other or send memes but other than that most ppl dont care
3170,i asked an old female friend if we could meet up and she hasn't responded in a month i think i am about done with instagram
3171,"not really, but i only text on instagram so communication would be tricky"
3172,"Weird? Yes.

Bad? HELL NAH. I wish there were more guys like that."
3173,in a bad or good way?
3174,Happy cake day
3175,I don’t use social media. I guess it doesn’t matter to me if someone has social media or not
3176,Imo its anonymous social media. Like were all commenting so thats social but we dont know who everyone is so its anonymous
3177,oh look someone with normal parents
3178,"I only have Instagram other than WhatsApp and Reddit, but I only use it to chat and to see what my favourite band is up to/fashion/follow friends. The guy I like only has Instagram other than WhatsApp and Reddit but he doesn't use it. It's ok not to have social media but it's nice to keep up with your class :)"
3179,To me it's an indication that your priorities are straight and you don't care what the world thinks of you. I respect that.
3180,Why do you wish there were more guys like that?
3181,nope
3182,You're on reddit.....
3183,"my parents go through all my messages and i can't delete them. on insta, i can just delete all chat history in an instant. it's a lot more secure when i want to text my friends."
3184,As someone who's had people ask me for my number before it's a but more confrontational. Like if a girl asks me for my insta/snap I'm completely fine with it just seems like them wanting to be friends. If they ask for my number tho idk I get more of a hey wanna go on a date vibe. It's just a lot more casual going to social media instead of number and then you know when you have an actual reason for there number (calling them whatever) that's when you ask for it
3185,If you wanna know someone then what’s wrong with being personal and asking for their number?
3186,I honestly dont get why i was downvoted either. I wasnt trying to be mean it was just a genuine question lol.
3187,not really i only really use reddit and only use snapchat for texting
3188,"Not gonna lie, I have no idea why you were downvoted here. Unless you literally do not have any other contact info than Instagram, you should use regular MMS messaging or Google Hangouts. 

When you send me links to stuff, I don't want it to open in some weird in-app browser, I want it to open in its respective default app. And I don't want to have to be super careful not to leave anyone on ""seen"" or whatever. There's typically no malicious intent behind that, but everyone interprets it very badly. Not to mention the fact that regular messaging allows me to set your name to just plain ""John Doe,"" and not ""joh_ndoe9822650.lolhehemorelikestupididiot"" or whatever."
3189,F
3190,It isn't exactly social media bro
3191,"Explain... i wasnt trying to be mean, just a genuine question."
3192,not comparable
3193,"maybe not necessarily weird, but not someone i could find myself becoming close to. i’m online waaaay more than i should be lol"
3194,you were on omegle what did you expect
3195,Most people give their number to someone after they get to know them in my experience
3196,"Oh I have a solution for you. Hold a text, then hit the trash icon. You can then mark any texts you want to delete then hit the trash icon again to completely delete all the texts you selected. I do it all the time and it only takes a minute

Edit: forgot a step, you have to tap “more” when you hold the text then the trash icon will appear"
3197,"Tbh I find it more attractive and interesting when a guy doesn’t have social media. I, personally, hate social media and think it’s a waste of time and trivial. So when I meet someone who doesn’t have it, I’m kinda impressed."
3198,"a guy on here told me he did dirty things to my selfie

I really didn’t want to know that

I deleted the selfie"
3199,"This is a funny story lool he got chased. 

Just not the by person he was hoping"
3200,After a month break writing poems on either sub the first question I come back to is this....and it’s the one question I can’t write a poem on.
3201,It’s a shame you had to delete a selfie to keep creeps away
3202,"I talked in a voice chat with a dude for a few minutes, clearly stating that I wasn't looking for a bf at some point. He called my accent ""lovely"" and then he dmed me, but after like 2 or 3 messages he sent ""wanna kiss 😘?""

It was my first day on discord. I had to explain him that it wasn't cool, when a girl tells him she's not looking for love, to still be pushy and pretend that you want to be friends when your real goal is a relationship. I bet he's the same kind of person who complains about ""getting friendzoned""."
3203,"> Had a fetish for my voice

Same, actually. Had some weird bitch who I met on a looking for group post on Xbox talk about how she was going to masturbate to my voice and shit. Same for a couple other guys who joined the party."
3204,[deleted]
3205,"4th grade a girl chased me around the pool saying she wanted my babies


I’m still traumatized"
3206,"“if i’m not some other mans property im free game” period sis, some guys don’t know how to act.

i don’t think that’s simping, that’s being a full on creep. thanks for sharing tho!"
3207,a guy simped over me on snapchat yolo i think
3208,"Just.... why.... 

Why would saying that remotely be a good idea? Like wtf was he expecting? Ew"
3209,"Lol theres a lot more to the story but he definetly seemed disappointed.
Tried to hmu a few days back but i ignored him"
3210,"Yeah dude you gotta get married before that. I bet she wanted you to say frick to her, and even hold her hand. Smh filthy heathen what is this world coming to"
3211,"(hijacking the top comment to post my story, kinda similar tbh)


Not me being simped over, but my « friend » has been simping over this girl.

In our group chat, she posted pictures of her in her prom dress and he would always answer by « You are so beautiful » and things like that while other guys would just tell her if it looked good on her or no.

She would post pictures of random guys saying they were hot and he would agree and say they are hot too. He watched all the Twilight because she said she liked Twilight.

Recently, he started calling her « princess » and things like that (they weren’t in a relationship). She had to tell him to stop because she was uncomfortable.

For the other girl that he simped over, in the same group, he kept writing to her even when she didn’t answer. After 3 times that she told him she wasn’t interested, he kept trying. He made a second account to talk to her (like a fake account of a hot guy). He wanted me like to kinda push her so she would fall and he would her get her books (like in a movie).

He is... weird."
3212,I have never been simped over and I really hope it never happens because I am in a happy relationship with my gf
3213,"Basically, summary of r/niceguys"
3214,[deleted]
3215,"Lmao, it was hilarious. He accused me of being a catfish, and when I insisted I wasn’t, he asked me to send a few pictures of myself. I obliged as long as he did as well.

We exchanged pictures, and from that moment on, he started commenting about how pretty and amazing I was. (Keep in mind, he’s called me a catfish a few minutes ago)

He eventually tried pressuring me into sending nudes, I was like, lol no. Then he tried to send me a dick pic. When I declined, he started proclaiming him love for me, even though we’d known each other for less than a few hours.

Needless to say, I noped out of that situation as quickly as I could."
3216,"A dude tried to make me sell him selfies. I told him im a minor and refused so he decided to go full incel/niceguy and tell me.. All sorts of stuff.

Heres screenshots for anyone that wants to read https://imgur.com/a/yEWemff"
3217,Punctuation?
3218,Idk if it's called simping we still talk a decent amount but I made vector art for this girl for her number but I think she would have given me the phone number anyway I asked for her phone number in return cause I don't wanted to do it for free and be a simp but in the end I ended up being a simp?
3219,"He means that it's hard to understand a 7 lines long sentence without any commas, periods or anything. It's really hard to read and keep up with what you're trying to say."
3220,"Ahh, well, regardless, we’re glad you’re back!"
3221,[deleted]
3222,Cheers
3223,"Jesus.. He sounds.. Scary tbh. It's clear that the girl doesnt want him but he keeps pushing. I hope he'll learn some day. Compliments are nice but its a bit much when people like ""you are so gorgeous."" To every thing you post"
3224,"""gamerdaddy5"" sus af"
3225,"that’s a classic creep tactic, accusing you of being a catfish just to get pics"
3226,Good job blocking her.
3227,He didn't go batshit at me saying I was a whore or anything though. But yeah he's probably gonna get into this mindset
3228,One time a little kid asked me if I had kids yet lol.
3229,[deleted]
3230,"I mean, why exclude boys from answering? If we've got something meaning to contribute then we should be able to. No reason to lock us out just because we're less likely to have something to add."
3231,"Yeah. 

(Don't question how I was asked this, the dude asking me was like 5 years old.)"
3232,"Same here, been asked if I'm pregnant before jabs.

...Might help to add I'm trans."
3233,"I have absolutely nothing of substance to add with a top level comment and I doubt many other boys do either. And trust me, before this place had girls answer as the assigned flair like 80% of the comments were boys who had nothing to add a most of the time so yeah it’s necessary to use sometimes."
3234,"No, but when my cousin was ~5 and I was ~14, she was like ""how much longer until you have a baby?"" She was really into baby dolls and I'm like ""10 years minimum, kid"" lol"

3240,"My mum has done it sarcastically as a way to fat-shame my (15F, average weight) sister. Mum is so nasty to her and there's nothing I can do about it, and it makes me soooo angry."
3241,"YES

^(JK, I am a boy)"
3242,But still the question is are you
3243,"What a way to make someone feel old, damn. Kids really are funny sometimes."
3244,😳maybe😳
3245,😳
3246,"Yeah I got pregnant without ovaries, a uterus and a x and Y chromosome"

Shit’s like so weird man kinda trippy"
3248,[deleted]
3249,"I relate to the nasty part, for any fuck-up I might do, my mun says ""don't do it next time"".

For any fuck-up that my sister might do, my mum is like ""YOU FUCKING BITCH, HOW COULD YOU FUCK UP LIKE THIS!? I'M DISOWNING YOU!""

I just hate it so fucking much, like sheesh, you wouldn't yell at me, why are you yelling at my sister?

Edit: grammar"
3250,bUt hAvE yOu
3251,"lol my mom has asked me a couple times, idk what she thinks i’m doing in my free time."
3252,I mean like I know they have to ask but I’m pretty sure 12 year olds don’t really get pregnant a lot
3253,"I’ve been asked before at school if I’m pregnant for the same reason, and I’m not trans"
3254,Because I thought it would be funny to see the male responses and some people who identify as males can still give birth.
3255,yeah but u do it anyway ^(im assuming)
3256,But are you sure you’re not pregnant? You never know what kids get up to these days
3257,"Yes Actually. I used to look like a girl because of long hair. And I’m fat. Now I have shorter hair, longer because of quarantine. But still fat :("
3258,"Idk about this post but to be fair, faking stuff seems to be a theme recently so I see why people are suddenly skeptical"
3259,Yeah this is one of the most peaceful subs I’ve been on. R/teenagers is toxic af and just weird
3260,Skepticism is fair. Outright denying isn’t
3261,[removed]
3262,Best post I've seen on this sub
3263,"Ye it's just cringy and full of karma whores, it's gone so downhill as of late"
3264,"What happened tho, I ain’t on feemagers so idk what goin on. Is this about that no boys answering questions thing?
Or something else?

I saw some stuff yesterday over on r/atb that was pretty fucked up.. so idk."
3265,uhh I haven’t noticed anything particularly weird/unfair/bullying-like on this sub...
3266,"Being skeptical is ok 

But they’re straight up just denying it and saying it’s fake"
3267,">no boys answering questions

Is that a thing? Feemagers isn’t just for girls yanno"
3268,"wow i wouldn’t have expected that from feemagers, i’m active there a lot on my main and people there are generally super nice and understanding. i guess this just shows there’s bad apples in every bunch :/"

3270,"Well, there is that factor. I mean, the head mod has been problematic these past few days..."
3271,Yes
3272,"Speculation is not the same as personal attack. Everyone has the right to speculate. I mean, from the point of view of someone who has gone through assault herself, your story does have holes. Not that I'm speculating or judging. Just pointing out, lest you take it as a personal attack."
3273,i’m a boy
3274,Wtf happened?
3275,Yeah the ask teen subs are just a lot more chill in general
3276,[deleted]
3277,"That is literally censorship. Anything you post online has the right to be criticized, especially something as serious as sexual assault."
3278,Same
3279,"That counts as mod-abuse, technically. They could just be speculating and not directing anything at you directly. Speculation is speculation. A bit of skepticism is fine, you know."
3280,what happened?
3281,Aight but that isnt a question my guy. I dont even know the context like you cant just bail out on everyone like wtf is happening
3282,"I might miss some context, because I don't really know what is going on. What happened?"
3283,Thanks
3284,"That has nothing to do with what I said.

Safe spaces are a dumb idea to begin with, they encourage echo chambers and promote bigotry."
3285,"Personal attacks aren’t and I’m not disqualifying your story at all. However lines can get blurred. What separates a personal attack or a pointed question? If you feel that every criticism of you is an attack, then you could remove them all. That’s where the problem lies. If you don’t like those comments, DONT look at them. By removing comments all you’re doing is hiding things and making yourself look worse."
3286,here be4 this gets deleted
3287,"Jeez dude, I didn’t hear about any of this until I read these comments. Why are people like this?"
3288,Facts
3289,Why is this girls only I didn't want it to be girls only?
3290,"OK but like, toppings????"
3291,Whichever ones she likes???
3292,Youre reminding me of an rtgame stream.
3293,Ask her!!!

3295,"chocolates and stuffed animals are also very welcome, that's what i bought for myself"
3296,But WHICH ONES???
3297,"You should have wrote [EVERYONE] in the title, try messaging the mods"
3298,"Tbh, know your girl.

I'm not really materialistic, 'cause the only jewelry I'd wear are earrings. So each time my bf asks if I'd like a necklace or something, I simply decline. A heated blanket or a beanbag chair or a giant stuffed bear would be amazing tho...

Edit: some girls love jewelry. It's all about interest and again, knowing your girl"
3299,That dude will add fucking toothpaste on pizza just to torture us.
3300,"This is me searching for gifts for anyone lol, honestly, if you don’t know for sure, just get her a cheese pizza"
3301,"Oof I didn't know, I messaged them but idk when they gonna get back"
3302,Mood af
3303,This is why instead of giving people gifts for their birthdays I just bake them something lol
3304,K
3305,Pizza with W H A T
3306,Aight imma put salmon and onions on my pizza then
3307,I second this notion. And i'm a useless lesbo.
3308,Lol I don’t have a girlfriend
3309,Please do this
3310,oof that was dry
3311,Hopefully
3312,Or NUGGETS
3313,"Art supplies and makeup is cool too 🥰 but ye, Pizza with tuna is nice"
3314,"Basically anything you know your partner will like. For example by gf likes witchy shit and she lost her amethyst recently, so I'm thinking of getting her onea"
3315,They will maybe reply soon
3316,ANYTHING BUT PINEAPPLES
3317,Bet
3318,"Honestly I think so too. 

Every Instagram model after surgery seems to have this generic insta face and they get rid of any unique features"
3319,"Damn, I've never seen the Madison Beer before and after photos before


Am i the only one who thinks she looked better before?"
3320,"yeah, when i saw the dove cameron post i was shocked. now i can’t believe i thought she was born like that"
3321,"I mean, yeah, I think thats the MAIN problem. But I can also see why having surgery in the first place can be bad for young girls. Imagine you admire a celeb and she gets a nose job. You will be lead to believe smaller nose: cute. Big nose: bad

But yeah, I think ppl should be allowed to have plastic surgery, however try to love yourself first"
3322,"I always thought she was so pretty and it makes s e n s e now. Not that you can't be pretty without it, but just cuz that wasn't just genetics 🥴"
3323,"Yes absolutely!

The same thing with fitness models and bodybuilders using steroids, If you have had surgery or used steroids to enhance your looks then its fine. But when you claim you have built your physique naturally then its lying."
3324,"at the same time you shouldn't hate on a girl for wanting to enhance herself because it's literally no one's business.

It's like if i wanted to get rhinoplasty because my nose was crooked and causing me severe body image issues, which is what my cousins in Iran do"
3325,"this obviously doesn’t apply to your cousins but I think if you use your looks to become famous and influence others, they become other people’s business tbh 

and I never said you shouldn’t get plastic surgery, I said you shouldn’t lie about it"
3326,her beauty did seem so perfect it makes a lot of sense it was unnatural.
3327,Holy crap that’s a massive change. I never would have thought
3328,"Lmao right

I mean good for her it looks super natural"
3329,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AtoZplasticsurgery/comments/afwy44/dove_cameron/

before and after"
3330,"Yeah, because then you have people trying to achieve these false ideals without realizing that they aren't even naturally possible. It's physically impossible to naturally reach a goal that is artificial in nature, and that's why I think it's toxic and harmful that so many people try to hide the fact that they get plastic surgery, cause it negatively affects the people who watch them and follow them, thinking that it's a natural possibility, even though it's literally not."
3331,I saw dove Cameron and I always felt like no matter what I can never get that pretty because I wasn’t born like that and honestly it made me feel horrible. Seeing now and knowing she had plastic surgery I feel a bit better but I shouldn’t have wasted time feeling bad with unattainable expectations. She is happy where she is and I am happy where I am
3332,What did Dove do?
3333,Acting like you're flawless even tho you got plastic surgery like that didn't happen is wrong. People excpect those celebrities to be born that beautiful and then get the wrong idea. Plastic surgery is not bad but acting like it didn't happen is.
3334,"I wholeheartedly agree with you on this. But at the same time, i think that it's rather unfair when people force or bully celebrities into admitting they had plastic surgery. Maybe they're insecure like damn?"
3335,yes definitely
3336,"Yes, but there’s also a problem as in is addicting. You say i just want to get this done I’m fine with everything else, then you do something else and say the same."
3337,"Yeah, I think it's totally  fine to get plastic surgery if it makes you happy, but I think it can cause harm to some people  if someone tries to pass it of as if they're all natural, because  they're  setting a standard  that is mainly not realistic and some people  will feel down on themselves  cause they can't  compare/ achieve that ""perfect"" look , eventhough  it wasn't even natural  in the first  place...but I also don't think people we're  entitled  to knowing if someone's had work done. In my opinion  if a person just doesn't adresss it's fine too, it's non of our business in the first place, it just bothers me when people  start lying, cause it can really  be harmful  for for exp. young impressionable girls."
3338,Most certainly. I don't think anyone would care about other people getting plastic surgery if they were just transparent about it.
3339,Have you seen Trisha paytas? /s
3340,"yeah definitely. plastic surgery is fine, but it’s a very personal choice for someone and it should only be something they choose to get for themselves, not because their favorite insta model got it or because the trend rn is to have a certain set of features and it’ll make them famous."
3341,"imo some ppl need to understand that to do plastic surgery, you need to fix what's inside in order to accept fixing your appearance. Hiding it isn't the way to go because it shows that they haven't accept the fact that they've done it. why not just embrace it?"
3342,"I literally couldn’t give two shits if a celebrity gets plastic surgery. It’s their body, and they can do whatever tf they want. It becomes a problem when they start to deny it and then girls look at themselves and ask themselves why they don’t naturally look like them."
3343,"yes, i agree. claiming that its natural sets unrealistic standards that people are insecure that they dont meet. i think getting plastic surgery is totally okay because it empowers a lot of the people who get it and helps them feel comfortable in their skin, but when its used to bring down others (even if its not intentional, like claiming they didnt get surgery) that's not ok."
3344,"I agree that it is a big problem, but I don’t think it’s the main thing that’s bad. I personally don’t like how plastic surgery is encouraged despite how dangerous it is. Plenty of people have gotten seriously ill or even died from it. And all you need to do is watch “Botched” to see how easily it can go wrong"
3345,"I have no problem with plastic surgery, if you wanna change how you look then you do you boo. I believe you look better if you are confident in you, confidence is sexy and if you wanna change something to do so then ok!


But like you said, becaue people deny it makes na unrealistic body standard that nobody could possibly live up to."
3346,hmm i have mixed feelings tbh because on one hand i agree that hiding it just makes people think worse of themselves for not having those features they think are natural but on the other hand your plastic surgery is your own business and youre not obligated to tell people if you don't want to
3347,"I think that plastic surgery becomes a problem when you're not doing it for yourself.

I think it's 100% ok for someone to get a nose job. It's okay if they don't want to be open about it. There is a stigma against plastic surgery. It's not okay if they're doing it because they feel pressured to do it by others. Get plastic surgery because it will make YOU feel good about yourself, not to please others."
3348,I can't stop picturing a Karen saying this now
3349,Well doesnt everyone need to know how to cook?
3350,"Hijacking top comment: I may be wrong, but I thought that you only needed to “sit like a lady” while wearing dresses or skirts? That’s what my parents taught my sister at least, and that was to stop pervs from looking up her dress/skirt. Is it different for you?"
3351,[deleted]
3352,"Lmao fuck your teacher, I've been told to sit like a girl because I just spread my legs like a boy (what ever that means). I mean I get it if your wearing a skirt because you need privacy from it"
3353,Yep all the time. Mostly from my mum and dad though.
3354,I have a few times and it just makes me want to do the opposite
3355,"My former best friend's family were these really rich Russians and I used to stay over at their place all the time. As a kid, I never really noticed their lifestyle, I just enjoyed playing with my friend. But the family always judged me, especially cause back then I used to be a tomboy. For years at their house, in restaurants, etc. they'd always tell me that ladies don't sit the way I do. To stop slouching because I'm a ""lady not a potato sack"". Sitting wasn't the only ladylike thing they told me to do. Growing up, whenever my legs are spread, my mom would always tell me to close or cross them but she never said its because I should be lady. Overall to this day I still don't sit like a lady unless I'm in some sort of professional situation."
3356,It's what i thought too
3357,"Yeah, I actually get asked by my friends why I sit with one leg over the other, and I’m a guy. I can do what I want damnit!"
3358,"some random woman in the airport told me to sit like a lady when I was like 12 and I said okay, but then got really petty and just kinda spread myself across two chairs and pretended to fall asleep so there was nothing she could do about it. Other than that, sometime my parents tell me to fix my posture and stand like a lady, but after I (respectfully) told them how annoying that was, they explained that they don't want me to have back or neck problems and now they leave out the part about being a lady and just remind me about my posture."
3359,"A lot of us are also told to “keep our legs shut”.... That one bugs me, I’m not a slut just because I want to sit comfortably!"
3360,"To be fair though, spaghetti is literall the best food in the whole world. I can eat spaghetti with cheese and some tasty sauce for three days straight and think ""it was a long time since I ate spaghetti, I think I know what wanna eat today"" on the fourth day. You can be content as long as you can cook spaghetti and make sauce imo"
3361,"Yeah I get the skirt thing too. I don't like wearing dresses or skirts or any of that other really revealing stuff. It makes me uncomfortable. I wore a winter coat during a heat wave. Even if I do have to wear a dress, I wear leggings."
3362,Watch me
3363,Reverse psychology
3364,OP please don't fuck your teacher
3365,"My whole life, I’m a total tomboy and I still sit with my legs wide open lmao. My granny would smack my thighs in church because I would have on a dress with my legs wide open lol “I have shorts on granny who cares” “I do it’s unlady like”. Man I miss her I loved messing with her lol"
3366,indeed
3367,#**A N G E R Y**
3368,"Also hijacking top comment: it doesn’t really matter how you sit, it’s just tradition that people are trying to carry onto you, like religion that your parents grew up with. Do how you want and ignore “gender stereotypes.” Anyone can be comfortable"
3369,Comfort makes me happ happ
3370,Yeah it's good but you can't honestly only cook spaghetti forever.
3371,"Yeah, I was going to say this. I don't think the teacher was trying to say to not act like a boy, I think she was just saying not to put your legs up on a chair since that's super disrespectful at school. Although yeah, it's pretty rude to say that girls shouldn't be allowed but guys are."
3372,That is not at all what she said
3373,bro 😎💪
3374,Yes by my mom no by anyone else
3375,"Those damn commies!! 

/s"

3403,Wow😭
3404,YES OMG. Like someone tells me they’re born in 2008 and I’m like WHAT. Idk it just sounds so strange. My 2003 ass has to scroll more and more through the age list

3413,I didn't think I'd get this far
3414,Start doing Fortnite dances
3415,That would probably crush him tbh
3416,it's done figuratively. i wouldn't lay a finger on him i'd probably just insult him

3428,"This has happened to me before and thankfully I said no seeing as they were trying to make fun of me, but everyone else still got a kick out of it. Shitty move and if you do this to make somebody feel bad you are a shitty person."

3438,"Holy shit I remember that show and I loved it. Instead of watching Cartoon Network, I would love Wipeout. I always dreamed of going on it. Do you know where you could find episodes?"

#BIG RED BALLS"
3441,the what
3442,No wayyyy
3443,Yep I remember that. I think my mom used to watch it so I would watch with her
3444,THE BEST OF TELEVISION
3445,I remember loving going to my neighbor's house to play that game!
3446,"Yeah, I even had the game for it on the Wii"
3447,fuck yeah! i used to want to watch it everytime but always missed it because my dad was watching TV
3448,"yea.



but do you remember Hole in the wall?"
3449,p i r a t e b a y
3450,Back when I was too young to understand the joke smh
3451,"I freaking loved that show and actually wanted to participate too, even though I knew it was in entirely different country. I wonder why it isn't aired anymore 🤔"
3452,HOLY SHIT YES
3453,If you got Hulu some of the seasons on there.
3454,I still have it
3455,"I watched that 

It was weird"
3456,"To this day, its the dumbest, wackiest and funniest tv show I’ve seen"
3457,Samee I watched some last week and realized how good the humor was now that I get it
3458,"Wipeout was great. I like American Ninja Warrior too nowadays, but since it's professionals there's not the jokey commentary when people screw up."
3459,And there's a mobile game too
3460,I had 3 Wii wipeout games and 1 for Xbox 360 kinect!
3461,I had the original DS game... those were the days
3462,Yup. Used to watch that a lot
3463,Yes I loved that showww!
3464,"Loved wipeout, it was the highlight of a saturday evening, Richard Hammond was great on it as well. Wish it never went."
3465,I loved that show but I preferred Takeshi's castle
3466,You know what was better then the show?  Wipeout on the Wii.
3467,I did too! That game was legit
3468,"Yes I met this girl at my first Model UN, 28th July 2017. We talked and clicked but I was too much of a bitch to ask her number or insta. I looked for her at every inter school event and competition. Never saw her again"
3469,Damn even got the date and everything😂
3470,I just hope you’re not too hard on yourself! Sorry if this isn’t beneficial but I remember reading somewhere that societal expectations of women tend to harm trans women

3472,same
3473,Only been 3.5 but yeah my current crush
3474,"True, but rn I'd be happy with anything feminine. I don't need to look like that girl. I'm my own girl. :)"

I hope you find your dude tho"

3479,Thanks I hope u find her too😅
3480,That makes me so happy to hear!
3481,"It's not required for them to be your crush. You can simply be in awe and idolize their looks or personality. In my 12th, there was this girl who was perfect looking in every sense of the word. Absolutely flawless. She was kinda boring though."

If I’m going to date ever I’m gonna just sit inside the guitar store and look for people there why are they so cute

But idk if that’s really a crush it’s just people I found like really attractive and I still remember them"

3496,i was in 8th grade and he was a sophomore. i didn’t get to see him since i wasn’t in high school so i went over a year without seeing him. one day i added him in snap due to quick add and he sent me memes. he was literally my definition of perfect. i was in a toxic relationship at the time and ended up leaving the toxic relationship for him. now we’ve been dating for almost 9 months
3497,Same lol
3498,"probably me a year ago. used the word normie unironically. 'nuff said.

i still do a lot of cringey things now, i dont rlly care tho its fun"
3499,"Lmao 

Currently probably 13, I thought I was cool for doin my own thing but I was not

I assume I will eventually cringe at being a redditor let's be honest"
3500,"12, 13, and probably 14"
3501,Your most cringe years are ahead of you mate
3502,"definitely 12-13, had a fifa phase and i basically thought i was smarter than everyone because i was part of the school “knowledge bowl” competition team 

i had fun then but i wish i could’ve been a much better person"
3503,oh nooo hehe!!!

3516,**Mate**
3517,"either 12 when I thought everyone was my best friend, or rn. I can't decide whether using Reddit like this is cringey or not"
3518,"Sure.

It’s a very *very* long story, but I was the annoying attention whore kid who talked really loudly around his crush, I thought I was special for being a metalhead, I did the stupidest shit for attention, I hit on every girl I could see, it just goes on but you can imagine it was really fucking bad"

3526,angel with a shotgun😔🤟🏼🤟🏼
3527,"literally every year of my life in different ways i swear to god.id honestly say shit got bad around 8th grade for me when i got into “the emo trinity” phase and was also a hardocre dan and phil fan. i literally had a fan account that i promoted to my irls and literally posted nsfw dan and phil fanart on there a couple times AND ALL MY IRLS FOLLOWED ME EVEN ONES I WASNT CLOSE WITH. i was also really into anime and wrote a death the kid c oc fanfic on wattapd. then in 9th-10th grade i was hardcore into my chemical romance and had a big fan page for them and was super “edgy” and my friends and i would literally make flop accounts to make fun of peoples shitty art and stuff (i know it was mean trust me i am much older and wiser now). since then im about to be a sophomore in college and even though i still definitely have cringey “interests” id like to think it’s different than before. im back into my anime phase and i still like lots of youtubers and kpop and mcr but the vibe is different if that makes sense lol. but i will say i have read ...a lot of fan fiction in my day and some of that shit hoooo boy

edit: sorry a comment unlocked a part of my memory but i was also literally “boy crazy” in middle school and highschool (slightly less in high school but still) to an embarrassing point.  and now in college i dont like anyone anymore i literally think i burned myself out lmaoo"
3528,"i doubt she actually hates men, it’s a tiktok thing i’m pretty sure. cuz men used to say that women don’t deserve rights, and to ‘go make a sandwich’ or call us dishwashers so now some people on tiktok have switched roles around. like i don’t think it’s even possible to literally hate ALL men, im hoping she’s just being ironic. it’s not right to be saying that all the time tho and i’m sorry it makes you feel bad :( maybe try to talk to her ab it and tell her it hurts your feelings. if not, i’m sure she’ll get bored of saying that dum stuff eventually"
3529,"Almost every single important guy in my life has hurt me in one way or another and even I don’t hate men. 

Sit her down and maybe ask her why she hates men? And why generalising men the same way incels and sexists generalise women is somehow okay and not hypocritical. 

Maybe explain to her that incels do the exact same thing she’s doing, but in reverse and how in the hell does she expect “men to do better” (playing with her opinion, it’s not mine) if she constantly insults them?

If she says every guy she knows or sees online are shitty people maybe ask her about Karen’s, or girls that you have seen bully or generally act like terrible people, and yet you don’t go around saying ‘I hate women’ ‘all women are trash’

Don’t try to be argumentative, listen and respond calmly. I had a boyfriend who had a habit of playing devils advocate with me even if he didn’t believe in their opinion, but he was never angry or arrogant about it (although jokingly so sometimes)."
3530,[deleted]
3531,"Being white is not the same thing as being male. I’m a white boy, and I don’t take offense when someone says they hate white people, but I do take offense when someone says they hate men. Being white in the US doesn’t really have any downsides, but it does have a whole lotta upsides. 

Being male, on the other hand, isn’t the same. There are undeniable upsides, but there are also tons of downsides, like toxic masculinity, stricter gender roles, little freedom of emotions, presumption of guilt, all that stuff. When someone says you’re trash because you’re a white person, it isn’t as bad because being white has caused you no problems. Toxic masculinity is a bitch, and it’s extremely hard to actually develop a good ideal of masculinity that isn’t toxic. I think a lot of girls underestimate how hard toxic masculinity is to avoid. And suggesting that you hate men when in reality you only really hate toxic masculine qualities is really hurtful. It’s very hard to distinguish maleness from toxic masculinity a lot of the time, so it’s a punch to the gut to say those things are the same."
3532,"“Are you saying you hate *me?*” 

In all seriousness, there’s not much you can really do except make sure she knows it’s not quirky™️ to hate men."
3533,"exactly, they wouldnt say this if it was a guy saying 'i hate women'. yes, theres more history behind disliking or feeling superior over women, but sexist female-based subreddits still exist."
3534,There are adult women who think the same so I doubt it. Gotta nip it in the bud or at least put seeds of doubt in her head.
3535,bruh
3536,[removed]
3537,"That’s crazy and sexists as heck. I mean, the fact that she posts stuff like this. Maybe she’s just looking for attention. I don’t think she really means it, don’t worry"
3538,Or “God I hate black people”
3539,"She’s most likely not serious. It’s literally a trend for the “gays and the girls” to say that. It’s literally like when boys tell us to “get back in the kitchen”  “women have no right so don’t speak” “ women aren’t funny” “ women are only useful for one thing only”  except now it’s in reverse

Edit: To make it clear I’m not excusing her behavior, simply explaining it. “Jokes” telling ppl to die are not funny n gender based ones are rarely funny imo. If the op seriously wants to die over his sisters words then he needs to explain how he feels about them."
3540,no 😈😼
3541, hating any generalised group of people is bad imo
3542,In that case she’s wording it *very* weirdly if it’s just about incels
3543,"yeah that’s what i think as well. those jokes were funny for a while bc they kinda stopped all the dishwasher jokes, but if she’s still making them then it’s pretty weird."
3544,Well men brought chocolate to the Western World because it was a world dominated by men so women had way less chance to actually do that kinda stuff.
3545,you’re reading to deep into it lmao
3546,Username doesn't quite check out
3547,no men anywhere 2020 🏴
3548,You don't take offense when people hate you because of your skin colour?
3549,"tell her cause this is clearly upsetting u. tbh, what shes saying isnt right or funny.

just say like 'the things u say about hating men upsets me. can we talk about it?' or something. hopefully she doesnt actually feel this way, but maybe u talking to her will give her a different perspective on what she says"
3550,Yea it's unfortunate to see the double standards that are present when it comes to the response to sexism
3551,What a lazy and disregarding response
3552,Still think she should change her wording ngl. I can’t call every black people criminals and tell them that it’s only meant for black criminals.
3553,"Pretty much but she shouldn't get so attached to it, only occasional jokes"
3554,Eh idk I don’t think they where ever really funny tbh
3555,This is a joke right?
3556,"I mean she said

>ok maybe this man does deserve rights

Which makes it seem like most men do not deserve rights in her eyes.
Most men are not misogynistic, most men are not incels"
3557,Saying I hate men is very different from either of those.
3558,"Thank you, I just did that. Hopefully they get taken down"
3559,"Yeah, I hope your friend manages to get past this :)"
3560,"If she took photos of herself and she's under age and then sent them, she's committed two crimes: producing and distributing CP."
3561,You realise your friend can also get in *a lot* of trouble as well? Did you atleast tell her about it before doing so?
3562,"Child pornography is illegal everywhere, regardless of platform."
3563,Report him for spreading child pornograpy
3564,Yea I did. It was on Instagram so I'm not sure if anything legal would be done. She also didnt have her face in any of them
3565,"I’d say it’s pretty common to ask your partner for nudes nowadays, so I’d hope that she can use the claim that they were solicited to her defense. I wouldn’t even be mad if she claims that he coerced her into sending them. Any piece of shit that would expose somebody like that honestly deserves it.

And he’s also guilty of sexually harassing everybody he messaged by sending unsolicited nudes. Doesn’t matter if they’re his or not."
3566,"Hah. If only. 


Every now and then scores of nudes get leaked and literally *nothing* happens to the people who spread em

At least where im from"
3567,"Learn from her mistake, be responsible and don't send out nudes

Also, report him to the cops, that's a pretty big deal and is on a higher level than physical assault as an offence"
3568,"I personally don't think legal action is the move here, she could get charged with producing and distributing co herself, aswell as the guy would would get charged with distribution and everyone he sent them too would be charged with ownership.

It ((could)) fuck the life up of everyone involved but it would mostly be her that gets hit the hardest

I'm not a lawyer tho I'm just a 15 year old that's sourcing this information from people on quora claiming to be lawyers so don't trust anything I say

But personally I would tell the parents of the kid involved (especially the mom), they probably won't be happy and hopefully they'd get the kid in ALOT trouble"
3569,"I think they are already aware, dude."
3570,"Common doesn't make it right. If you asked someone under the age of 18 to send you nudes, you have asked for (and likely received) CP. You'd be tried as an adult and get 10+ years prison even for a few images. And yes, the FBI/NSA whatever knows exactly what you're doing."
3571,"Where are you from? By everywhere, I meant in terms platforms. And we get warnings from police officers about this all the time where I'm from (North Carolina, USA). Even photos that are too exposing can be considered child pornography here."
3572,I live on an island in the Caribbean
3573,"This is basically mass child porn distrubution. This is a really weird thing since even though what he did was horrible and deserves to be punished but the punishment that he can receive could ruin his life. You know, put him on a sex offender list, lower chance of being able to get a job, etc."
3574,"That doesnt matter they will obviously know who's nudes it is when they ask the boy and literally anyone else that got them, she could get in serious legal trouble for this you know?"
3575,I never said it was right. I said that because it’s so common I’d hope that she should use it for a defense since he ASKED for the nudes.
3576,Different places have different standards on what is considered porn.
3577,This
3578,What exactly is wrong with teenagers exchanging nudes with one another?
3579,Ahh I see
3580,"I do think that you are right (about both of them being potentially liable):

\> The common quirk in the laws is that there is no exception for taking or distributing sexually explicit pictures of oneself. Thus, a high school student sending a racy selfie to a boyfriend or girlfriend could subject both themselves and the receiver to prosecution for child pornography.

3581,Report his account and if that doesn't work maybe try to get law enforcement involved
3582,I think you should go to r/legaladvice what he did was a straight up crime and I think they will help you more
3583,"Bro, the girl also produced and distributed CP, she can’t take legal action"
3584,As long as they’re both consenting with no pressure from anyone I don’t see what’s wrong with it.
3585,Shit like this happens. This is what’s wrong with it. It’s also pretty hard to prove that neither pressured the other.

3604,😍😍😍
3605,What is this thread
3606,Retweet
3607,"""They"" is likely reffering to the people mentioned in the post people asking do girls like (insert thing that op has and or does)"
3608,Idk either
3609,She wasn’t referring to all of them. By they she just meant the ones with insecurities.
3610,"I don't mind these questions, because they're often asked by people who don't have much contact with girls, so I just take time to explain that there's no majority"
3611,[deleted]
3612,Yup.
3613,"""They"" is likely reffering to the people mentioned in the post people asking do girls like (insert thing that op has and or does)"
3614,see you get it! Lemme get some dirt bruh
3615,"Its because guys can be very insecure near girls especially when its their crush they just want to know for sure before asking them out but you cant give an answer to the example you gave ""do girls like skinny or muscular guys"" that is an opinion"
3616,They just want to see how many girls like a type of guys. They don't do it to see if their crush likes them back or something. They're just curious.
3617,"Because it’s really obvious and well uses satire, it had a relation to the comment, and obviously couldn’t be remotely unironic"
3618,"I could honestly care less about it. Honestly the bigger you are the more right to have to complain because they can be really annoying, especially in school PE"
3619,Girls don’t really bring this stuff up to each other in my experience unless they’re the competitive and aggressive type. We worry about those insecurities privately. I’ve had a couple of female friends who “roast” each other for fun but 90% of us stay away from anything that could hurt our friend’s self esteem for real.
3620,Yeah. Honestly i dont think guys talk about “who’s bigger”. But yeah that makes sense
3621,Bro i get jelous of how small their tits are. I got big ones for a dude smh
3622,"a little side note - why do Americans say that you could care less? surely you couldn't care less?

ive always found it a little strange"
3623,"I’m terribly skinny so I’m also completely flat and I hate myself cause no boy will ever notice me and no one can ever call me ‘hot’. It’s hard to gain weight I gain like one pound a year and I’m 90 lbs but it’s not a health issue I just can’t gain weight!!!!!! And yeah I get jealous, I’m the flattest person in my whole highschool"

3629,"“I’m gonna grab some water from the good”
Really annoys me"
3630,i mean my girlfriends and i joke about that kinda stuff but idt it’s competition or anything.
3631,"Im reality most guys fall into the average size, with the exception of the two extremes; tiny and huge"
3632,"Well yes, I constantly wish they were smaller and for them to not get in the way of literally everything, but you get to learn to live with them, and it gets better. I have a love hate relationship, sometimes I love them and sometimes they are so annoying I wish them gone, but I don't think I would change them and I just have to accept what I have"
3633,"American here. I HATE it when people say “I could care less.” It makes absolutely no sense. But I’m also the type of person who gets irritated when people use the word “good” instead of “well” in certain situations 

So to answer your question, the Americans who say that have never stopped to think about what their words actually mean"
3634,Rest in peace man
3635,Yea I have heard a bunch of roasting in my friend group lol.
3636,"At my school we do, same with butts"
3637,I just imagined a butt contest where all of you just stick your butts next to eachother

3741,Goddamn I don't wanna delete this. Please flair yourself ASAP!
3742,At least they were said
3743,[removed]
3744,no it's not bad to cry. it's okay to cry.
3745,r/cursedcomments
3746,"i would ask him if he’s okay. you can cry, it’s fine. if you’re crying yourself to sleep all the time though you should talk to a therapist maybe"
3747,What did it say?
3748,Oh haha
3749,*blessed comments
3750,What ఠ_ఠ
3751,You okay bro?
3752,Not at all
3753,"I’d be concerned if you didn’t cry ever. It’s good for you and your health, it proves that you’re human and have empathy. For real, if I see someone cry I just want to ask them what’s going on and what I can do to help them. End toxic masculinity, and let boys have feelings."
3754,Ok nvm. I still agree with your point though. Nobody should ever be made fun of for crying.
3755,Before during or after the sex?
3756,hey u/funfactwealldie
3757,Blursed comments?
3758,I'd probably end up crying too because I didnt know whether to approach them or leave them alone. And if I did approach them I probably wouldn't know how to comfort them lol.
3759,seeing a guy cry breaks my heart a little
3760,Uh... No ? I'm being honest
3761,No not really
3762,Of course its not bad! Crying is a sign that you’re *human*
3763,Why did this get two downvotes? What kind of psychopaths are you
3764,I hope you're alright OP. and it's okay. If I saw a guy crying and he was all alone I'd ask him what's wrong and offer him some comfort or a shoulder to cry on. We all need to cry sometimes.
3765,I hate seeing people cry it makes me so sad :( if I saw a guy crying I’d ask what was wrong and it they needed to talk
3766,I don't understand the stigma of why a guy crying is seen as weak. We're all human and have emotions. You crying isn't bad at all but the stress you're under is definitely concerning. I hope you're able to get some of that stress off your chest soon
3767,"Bruh, I try to cry when I feel bad, but I can't"
3768,"Insulted people's dead relatives, was manipulative, constantly begged people to buy him stuff"
3769,that’s not good i’m sorry that happened to you.  my crush said he would date a black girl but with his actions i just figures i wasn’t ready to be in Get Out 2
3770,[deleted]
3771,"The first guy I ever confessed to was in my fifth grade class. I also gave him a love letter that said ""READ THIS ALONE"" on the front but what does he do? He reads it with his group of friends who are all laughing their asses off the whole time. He then proceeded to rip it up and throw it out. It was my first crush. After another shitty experience with a more recent crush, I haven't been able to catch feelings for anyone. I always feel like crap because of those two :T"
3772,Ive only had a crush on three people but she stabbed me in the back by pretending she liked me until she got a crush on a gay junior and then cancelled what would’ve been my first ever date lol
3773,Those three flags are redder than Soviet Union's
3774,"Manipulative, pissed off both my and her friends, and even aggravated me at times. But I was a horny idiot and even attempted to date for a month. Thank god I cut that shit off, I don’t know what she would’ve done if it went on longer."
3775,Damn dodged a bullet there
3776,"This guy who liked hunting for sport every single day 

It was almost disgusting"
3777,"I'm so sorry :(

I hope you find a good dude

I'm never giving love letter again tho"
3778,He had a gf but then he started flirting and talking to me a lot when she wasn't around but never did anything about it. I ended up blocking him because he kept doing so and it wasn't right to her.
3779,oh my bad i meant confederate shorts like the confederate flag. i’ll fix that
3780,"so i  like 4th grade, me and my two friends had a crush on this guy in our class, and he literally went through the reasons why he didnt like us. 
HE TOLD ME HE DIDNT LIKE ME BC OF MY FRECKLES LIKE WHAT, i dont even have that much freckles 


but nah i dont mind tho but thats the only thing i can think of lol"
3781,A regular high school thot who decided that pretending to like me for some time would be a funny joke.
3782,This dude who threatened to kill himself if I didn't send him nudes 😐
3783,How could you even go hunting everyday? Even like once a week is a lot
3784,"What do you mean by conservative shorts. Are you referring to khaki shorts, if so khaki shorts are great."
3785,"Yeah same here :X it scarred me 

Also thank you for the kind words <3"
3786,Bruh
3787,"yikes  
mine would talk to me so he could see my friend. Plus his IG was 2 shirtless pics with a designer scarf in his bathroom. And he broke my pen. :("
3788,For sport means that he's not eating the food. He's just killing for fun.
3789,Everyone I had a crush on was nice or okay. But the truth is that I am the shitty person. :-(
3790,We live a girl who's not a homewrecker. Honestly tell his gf. She deserves to know the truth.
3791,"I fell super hard for him after he complimented me like once, he seemed super nice and was pretty hot but turned out to be one of those ""wholesome 100 keanu Elon musk everyone liked that haha big chungus redditor"" type of people and was a huge gatekeeper about gaming and it turned me off of him completely"
3792,everyday i’ve do it a few times it wasn’t that fun tbh
3793,"Lmao, yeah those are definitely bad."
3794,"You're not even in HS... I agree not ""super"" serious but idk what your intended sentiment behind that is... I think everyone knows that it wont last forever"
3795,"this one guy. (haha back when i thought i was straight.) he did a bunch of weird chaotic stuff, and at first it was funny and just a part of his personality, but in the past few months hes been getting shittier. 

he never keeps secrets, hes manipulative, he blackmailed my friend, bullied my other friend for ""stealing my best friend"" and said slurs in casual conversation. 

bleh."
3796,For a second there I thought you were getting stabbed for real
3797,Did he tho
3798,"OK I'm sorry but is your username based of the vine? The ""free shavocadoo"" one? Because I read it like that everytime I see you for some reason"
3799,Well yes but the problem is no one wants to cuddle with *me* T^ T
3800,"Yes, my friend mispronounced that vine and I’ve been using this username ever since."
3801,"I do, but for some reason family just doesn't work. Idk, like getting a hug from a friend, partner, or hell stranger feels a lot better than a hug from a family member."
3802,[removed]
3803,"All the time.

Lifehack: stack pillows behind you if you’re on your side to feel like a person is cuddling you."
3804,Vector in the corner: hey
3805,"Got it, thanks :)"
3806,me and my boyfriend are in a ldr so i get cuddle urges a lot :/

They agree, and like planned, one walks in. 

When he comes out, he's completely white and almost shining.

3905,"yes, v intellectual"
3906,"Well, what if someone wrote **OH MY GOD**"
3907,"Uh, nah, not really. They're kinda the same. If anything I'd probably say that the Oh my God is more special than the omg because the omg just kinda seems lazy."
3908,"Or if im shocked/sad for someone ""oh my god"" is a better than just ""omg"""

3914,I hear the different when Joseph says it it more surprising “OOOH MY GOD”
3915,"Yeah. Very different ""OH MY GOD"" is when your car door falls off on the highway and ""omg"" is when your crush texts you back. I don't like calling God's name in vein so I just say gosh."
3916,"i see you are canadian, what province"
3917,"i mean, same as what u/ew-im-sad said, ""oh my god"" sounds more aggressive i guess."
3918,[deleted]
3919,Honestly I’d love for somebody to be clingy with me and want to hold my hand and all that. I’m pretty starved for contact.
3920,"I encounter this in my (17F) relationship with my boyfriend (16M). Hes very affectionate, hugs, forehead kisses, squish (small tight hugs) but Ive never really been one to be physically affectionate. I think its just a matter of what both of you are comfortable with, and to figure out whats expected. Small handholding is usually a school appro. thing, and hand squeezes just tells I love you or being there for them :)"
3921,"Exactly as he does now, make dumb faces in the hall and let me tackle him for a hug if I see him"
3922,":D it's funny, because many people say that they'd never want a bf/gf from school and then somehow there is  someone they have a biiig crush on. I'm not saying that the same is gonna happen with you but it's funny"
3923,"I honestly could hold anybody’s hand, except if they’re being creepy about it. I don’t think you would be creepy about it, so here, a hand-holding transfer! 

(Add your hand here. ☞) ☜"
3924,"i'm sure you're fine but if you're even the tiniest bit worried about it, just have a conversation abt it next time you're alone, like just casually bring it up. i think every girl is different in how she'd want her bf to act in school so you should def ask her :) you should also let her know what you want bc your needs are just as important"
3925,ahaha that sounds perfect
3926,"You should've said ""thanks for the gold kind stranger"" :D"
3927,Oh my bf’s still at school and i was a early graduate this year. He hated how awkward i was with him at school like everytime i hugged him i looked so awkward and uncomfortable. He also acted different around his friends at school he was just abnormally loud and like hyper and he would pull attention to himself and im really shy so i hated it. So if you guys are comfortable by yourself it doesn’t matter. School has a way of making relationships feel awkward lmaoooo
3928,"Maybe some hand holding? School’s not really the place for PDA I think. Better to be the shy couple than the multiple couples I keep bumping into because they canoodle round blind corners. Idc what you’re doing, just stay out of the way and don’t start drama."
3929,Like we are bf and gf
3930,"You should be able to talk at school, but don't be too cheesy, it tends to get on people's nerves"
3931,Woah hold on there with that handholding. Don’t you wanna wait till marriage before you do something that crazy? Keep it at occasional eye contact for now.
3932,"I honestly just want him to cooperate with me and talk about random stuff connected to the subject to the teacher, I find nerdy talk romantic, you know"
3933,oh it's the same with me and my boyfriend. I got kind of sad at first because he wouldn't even talk to me. But he's trying to get better.
3934,"I personally wouldn’t want to much pda, hand holding, sitting beside him in class or at lunch and maybe even hang out with him on recess if he’s not with his friends is all I really ask. I don’t want to make ppl uncomfortable seeing me and my bf being all cute and cuddly in public while I myself avoid seeing couples in public showing pda haha"
3935,yes omg she also gets loud and pulls attention towards her when she’s near her friends
3936,Bruh
3937,God i want this
3938,Just talk to her and find a place where you're both comfortable
3939,They’re to far gone they’ve already cuddled
3940,There are quite a few people that don’t like pda

3946,"I lived in a p conservative country last year so my public interactions were kept to a minimum. We hugged a few times at school and he stayed next to me when I was in pain from my period, or we took short walks around school. I was okay with that. At home it was a whole other story. 

Although in our school play we had a tight-knit theatre group so we were more comfortable with them and backstage was pretty dark. We’d tease/annoy each other and occasionally small moments of sexual teasing I.e ‘accidentally’ hitting my butt against his crotch, sitting on his lap before he has to go on stage, or hitting each other’s asses with props."
3947,[removed]
3948,">Another grudge I have seen is where people think they haveeee to breakup after a small argument.

I hate that. My crush cut contact with me because of a misunderstanding. This was 6 weeks ago and I'm still hurt by it. And she is still mad about it. She refuses to communicate with me, refuses to open up, and she surpresses her feelings. I wish she didn't have such self low esteem. She is just soooo attractive to me and soo cute. I gave her two chances to communicate with me and to get through this but still no hope. I guess I just have to move on."
3949,"I totally agree. I too have never been in a romantic relationship, but social media portrays them in such a nasty way!"
3950,Maybe she is too sensitive  and not ready for a relationship?
3951,"Someone constantly talking shit about their ex is a huge red flag, unless there are actual reasons behind it. It’s rare to actually have a ‘psycho’ ex, and just because someone broke up with you doesn’t make them crazy. I hate it when I see people portraying their exes as terrible people because a lot of the time it isn’t true. Yes, there are times it is true and should be taken very seriously, but a lot of times it’s overlooked because of people who always try to put their exes in a bad spotlight. 

Personally, I don’t have a lot of relationship experience, so I guess this might not be of much help. My ex girlfriend (we dated for almost a year before we broke it off) remains my BEST friend to this day! Just because you break up with someone doesn’t mean you can’t still have them as a friend if circumstances are okay. It will be awkward, very awkward, but you have to push through it and you’ll be left with (usually) an awesome friend."
3952,I suppose even though she initiated with me. She is a year younger than me and she is also my sister's friend. And dating/interacting with the opposite gender is rather taboo where I'm from. She is 15 turning 16 and I'm 16 turning 17
3953,I think the word “ex” has a pretty negative connotation.
3954,[deleted]
3955,is anyone else bothered by <insert super popular opinion>
3956,">	people think they haveeee to breakup after a small argument. Again, if it’s a big argument about something serious then maybe. But if it’s heated but unimportant you two have to work through that together. If you can do that with your friends you can do that with your SO.

Reddit is the worst with this part. People post on, say, /r/Relationship_Advice or /r/TIFU, and commenters automatically advocate for a breakup. They don't understand that relationships aren't always smooth-sailing."
3957,"Most teenagers can't handle talking about a problem with each other. So they resort to just starting drama and hating each other for a bit. It seems that guys do this less than girls because I've noticed a pattern with girls that they screw each other over, hate each other's guts for a little while, then makeup. I can't really handle that much social stress so I just try to avoid it and talk to people. But some people just can't try to act like adults. I know that we teenagers aren't adults but we can at least try our best to be mature and act like it, especially those of us that are really close to adulthood."
3958,"Yeah I knew that before my first relationship, if I ever broke up I'd try to be mature about it, which I was. My friends still call her a bitch but I never said anything to convince them that she is, they just kind of go with the way it's publicly portrayed."
3959,"Social media exaggerates everything, not just relationships."
3960,this viral shit is very misleading i bet thats why most relationships nowadays are toxic
3961,Yeah. I hate it
3962,"You know, now that I think of it. I remember when I confessed to her that she can't talk to me because she can't have boys on Instagram."
3963,"More like forbidden, because of religious reasons and I'm speaking in terms of country not community or family."
3964,yeah FR this shit sucks.
3965,Yes I agree with this!Me and my ex are still friends.
3966,"Tbh I absolutely DESPISE the whole ""couples"" thing. Like, not the idea of people being together, but why do they always have to BE together? No one cares about yoir relationship. Stop posting couples pictures."
3967,"I’ve never really understood the concept of dating and relationships, but I do agree that if you’re supposed to be “in love” you won’t let the little things drive you apart, heck, even some more important things can be forgiven. The internet is all a big lie."
3968,"I also agree, and I get extremely annoyed with some of the relationships in my grade. 

Apparently a couple was “dating” for three days or a week

You can’t actually even go on a “date” in that time period. If you’re going to date maybe commit to it ig."
3969,I agree. I have a good relationship with my ex and through talking we've gotten through past resentments. But it's not like we want to get back together (which is what happens in a lot of movies🙄)
3970,one of my mates has had a bf on off for like a year now bc they get so mad at eachother for like 10 minutes and break up bc of that but emotionally manipulate eachother into getting back together ugh
3971,"I’m only a dick to my ex because she was a control freak and keeps trying to get back with me even though I’ve told her I’m not interested. Also she harasses me daily about whether I have her blocked or not, which of course I do."
3972,"Yes, very, me and my ex-girlfriend are still best friends, and that’s completely ok, I could rant a lot more about this if I wanted to."
3973,"It's all about perspective. If you look at my old relationship through the eyes of a passerby, or a friend that doesn't know the details, I seem like a crazy person. We broke up, I got really mad and salty, and it was all over a tiny argument. But the thing is, the relationship was toxic. All those tint arguments built up over and over, and neither of us could take it any more. I'm still mad at that person, and I'm glad they aren't in my life. The breaking point was a tiny argument, yes, but there was so much that pushed us both right to the edge before it got to that point, that I hardly told anyone about"
3974,"yeah, i don't really have anything else to say that you haven't already said, just, yeah"
3975,"I agree, like you I have never been in a relationship and I don't get the grudges that are held after mutual breakups.."
3976,I also don't like how sex is portrayed as such a driving force in a relationship and it's sort of like the end goal. Relationships where they wait until marriage are underrated imo
3977,I haven't  seen many discussions  about this in real life so I wanted to know what reddit  thinks

4004,Really? You had to say that right now?
4005,"Ed, we've known each other for a long. I remember whe  we first started out together, and how we slowly got to know each other better. I'm going to miss you a lot :( <3"
4006,Byyyyeeeee mod Ed and hello User Ed!
4007,"Damn, you were one of the good ones 

I already said bye and all that so gl with school and stuff"
4008,All of my friends have crossed that line
4009,"if you feel a friend is using you as a therapist, see how they respond when you ask them for emotional support and you'll see whether you should drop them as a friend"
4010,F
4011,When the ONLY talk about their problems and ask for help and only for help no normal stuff no help for you just them
4012,"Same here but I actually enjoy it? Idk it actually helps them and I really like doing it. There are some things I can’t help them with that I encourage them to talk about with others about but otherwise I like helping them, is that strange? Lol

Edit: to an extent. They don’t expect me to have all the answers, just listen to them"
4013,"Emotional support is when your there for someone is struggling. Just being there and listening without necessarily trying to 'fix' their problem, or giving little nuggets of advice.

Using someone as a therapist would mean you constantly go to said person for advice and expect them to have an answer to your problems, and get disappointed when they don't.

That's how I see it at least, though I could be wrong."
4014,My friend did that for 3 years of our friendship and after the 3rd year I had enough and one day stopped talking to her
4015,I wish my friends felt the same way. My friends blow tiny problems out of proportion and big problems become unbearable. They don't even take my advice unless it's the advice they want. I guess your friends have to be open to taking your advice in order for it to be effective.
4016,When the only thing they talk about is their problems and not about anything else at all.
4017,"Oh no, im scared that im doing that!! My friend and i talk about regular stuff but i also complain about shit to them. What do i do? Do i just stop or spread it out or what??"
4018,My friend talks a lot about his problems and asks for my opinion/advice on things. But he still talks about other stuff as well.
4019,"Thank you! I just dont want to turn this guy into my personal therapist because we are really good friends. I only tell him because he knows most about me and i trust him. I shall stop just talking about myself, thanks!"
4020,"Try talking about more than just yourself and your problems, ask them about their problems, talk about some common interests or anything else that isn’t about you imo"
4021,"Usually if I have to talk to someone about something serious I ask them if they have time to talk about it or if they want to. I want to make sure that they’re comfortable with helping me and I tell them that they shouldn’t feel bad and that if I ever made them uncomfortable I would feel worse and that’s true. But if I ever break down my good friends will help me because that’s a situation where I truly need them.
However, it’s important to remember that “you are not responsible for anyone else’s happiness”. If at any point you feel uncomfortable by the person you should speak up. That person shouldn’t have to feel like a burden. They can always try professional help and you also have your own life to worry about.  But if they ignore you communicating how you feel to them, drop them as a friend. They don’t deserve you and you deserve better."
4022,If they stop talking to you about normal everyday things and only come to you when they need to get something off their chest.
4023,"I am very, very trusted for some reason by almost everhone ive ever met. I can be a therapist, counselor, and best friend to almost anyone. I only trust like 3 people with my personal info. The last time someone said personal stuff was a day ago. It was something she had never spoken about to anyone before, and ive only known her for a month or so.. obviously im not going to say anything"
4024,This made me realize I’m a therapist for a lot of people and don’t have very many friends. Hmmm maybe rethinking my approach to new people should be done.
4025,There should be none. Being open with your friends is what makes for a good relationship.
4026,"Yes, that is true. People who are struggling don’t want to make things worse for themselves because they fill their heads with “what if” scenarios.  They sometimes don’t even know what they want to hear but refuse to take the advice anyway because of the way their situation is set up. If their parents are close-minded then they probably don’t want to tell them because they fear ridicule. It just depends on the person I guess and most people don’t realize that in most of the US it’s illegal to deny a child over 13 treatment when they ask for it."
4027,"You don’t have to stop talking about yourself entirely but just talk about yourself less or on occasion like when something is really bothering you and you need to talk to someone about, you guys are still friends you should be able to vent to each other"
4028,"if that’s all they talk about, then that’s the line. even if it dominates the majority of y’all’s conversations."
4029,"It's also not inherently bad to use your friends as therapists sometimes, as long as that's something that doesn't take over your relationship and or something that you're both cool with."
4030,"Okay i think i am good then. My friend and i talk about regular stuff but i also complain about annoying things in my life to them. I dont expect him to give me any fixes, i merely want their opinion and their attention. I appreciate when they describe their perspective as well. I dont get pissed when they dont have an answer, i just want them to know about my problems and understand me more, and the same goes for him."
4031,You mean M
4032,"I'm the same. Helping people makes me feel good, and if it ever gets too much I'll just take a step back."
4033,"Same here. When they start threatening suicide or harming themselves or express wanting to harm themselves that’s usually when I get outside help. One of my friends had really bad depression and relied on me for everything, it was too much. But otherwise I’d help any way I could. I’m actually called the “therapist of the friend group” by my friends, but they know that I don’t have all the answers lol"
4034,"Okay awesome, thanks for the advice!!!"
4035,For sure! That's what therapy is for

4039,"That is very good that she did so. Sometimes that can be exhausting to a person though, and them associating you in their mind with constant worry can drive people away sometimes. Idk of that had anything to do with it, but I would start taking things like that to professional help, sometimes it’s too much for people to handle having to talk someone out of that over and over, it’s too much responsibility to put on them, and it’s not fair to them. It’s also not fair to you if no one listens, but that weight should be more so on a trained professional person."

Ive gotten closer to some of my other friends this year, and we have been having a great time!  People can be weird sometimes.  Maybe one day we will be friends again."

4044,"same happened to me. so welcome to the club?jk. i say same, bc it happened also due to me avoiding insta. well, we started distancing about the beginning of school (maybe it was my fault? i started hanging more with others and she used to mention that and she was a bit annoyed by that) then, she started making plans with others and when wed be on the gorup chat she'd ask ""u wanna come with us? or u r not feeling like it "" it annoyed me sooo much. ye we talk now, but im now with friends that im trying to get used to. 
me and her were like literately best friends for three years (wed see each other every day even if it was holiday) and of course its hard for me now not being around her all the time, yah we say helllo every morning, but its kinda doing me good? im now meeting new people and discovering new personalities"

4105,Told my guy friend I liked him (this was in middle school). He said “shit”. That was pretty crushing for little 13 year old me lol. We stayed friends for a couple years though so it was fine
4106,y i k e s
4107,"""hey, I don't think we should be friends anymore...""

I literally got bullied afterwards. He started yelling at me and claimed i was ""delusional"""
4108,"well ig it was a well worth it risk. unless it ended poorly , then idk"
4109,Not worth it. I broke up with him because I was severely depressed and said I just needed a friend and he got mad at me for it. Still haven’t heard from him in over a year but I’m not complaining.
4110,"Haha. Yes, we've been together for almost two years now."
4111,I told my best friend about the crush I had on him. Was way too anxiety ridden to say it in person. Ended up getting rejected anyways. Never tried saying anything since.
4112,i laughed way too hard at the first one !
4113,told my friend i was considering suicide. she called my mom and i got grounded :/

4119,"Yikes, that's what happened to me when I was eleven, too. Sent this dude I liked a really long paragraph about how much I liked him, he left me on read for weeks until I initiated another conversation with him, where he kept calling me his bestfriend.

4129,"Funny you ask, as my answer to that question is actually quite interesting. 

- Where I live in Australia, in a country town full of mostly white Australians of principally Anglo descent, I’m short. 

- With my family, who are all of Mediterranean descent, I’m tall. 

- Last year, when I visited both Italy and Japan, I was average. 

So to conclude, how tall I am compared with other girls really depends on where I am/who I’m with."

As a cis white straight male myself I don’t really care

Like whenever someone says “kill all men” I usually just laugh at them lol

It’s not like I’m shaking because some angry woman on twitter hates me idgaf"
4159,"exactly. people have this argument that poc are “allowed” to hate white people because of mistreatment i’m the past. where i live (canada) slavery was abolished in 1834. almost 200 years ago. there is no reason for people today to hate white people for something that happened 200 years ago. not only that but it wasn’t even those people directly involved. it was their ancestors. it would be unfair to hate a wholeeeee race based on the actions of their ancestors. 

also, what about the white people who fought for slavery to end? what about the white people who helped with the underground railroad? what about the white people who have helped get poc rights?"
4160,"I get what you’re saying and it is totally racist for people to say that they hate white people, but just because slavery was “abolished” in 1834 that doesn’t mean that the effects of it are gone. Black people face racial discrimination every singe day, whether it’s directly or indirectly. Many of the the systems in place in the US are built to oppress Black people in any way possible. 

And people don’t “hate white people” for something that happened 186 years ago. They are angry because they feel hopeless, and that their lives are worth nothing. Every year, hundreds of Black people are murdered by police who get off with a slap on the wrists. That’s why they are angry. They’re angry because if they react in any way, racist stereotypes will be applied to them. They are angry because they can’t come into contact with those who are meant to protect them (the police) and know that they won’t be murdered because they posed as a “threat”."
4161,it just gets on my nerves. i feel like it just spreads more hate and it’s even worse when they try and defend saying it
4162,"^(what makes u think it’s justified?)

^(i feel like that sound snarky but i don’t mean it that way lmao)"
4163,"It's literally racism/sexism. Just because you think you're ""punching up"" doesn't mean you're not being an asshole.

Same goes for people who say 'fuck straight people' or anything to that degree. Yeah homophobia is a much more serious problem that straight oppression, but that doesn't give you the right to be a dick to someone over their sexuality."
4164,^( it’s def not a freak out thing for me it’s kinda like someone chewing with their mouth open to me. i think it’s more of a generalization issue to me. i feel like people should stick to something more along the lines of “fuck police brutality” which is a much more specific problem. also i think it’s a double standard that people think it’s ok to say that but freak the fuck out when someone says they hate any other race)
4165,Referring to a recent event doesn’t justify singling out a group based on the actions of the minority.
4166,"Yeah that’s definitely understandable

But like they just say #killallmen or whatever it’s just words lol they won’t actually attack someone"
4167,"Would it be justified for a white person who would've been bullied by black people to say that they hate all black peoples then? 

And how do i make all of my text superscript?"
4168,"I believe they’re racist or just idiotic. However, majority of people who say “i hate white people,” are moreso talking about stuff that’s recent."
4169,"“I understand why African Americans hate Jews so much.” What do you mean by that? 
Because I understand too, the African Americans that hate Jews are antisemites. I’ve heard the so called reasons and they’re crap. James Baldwin for example, is full of crap. Farrakhan is full of crap. Garvey is, in a lot of respects, full of crap."
4170,"It reminds me of that girl that said that she was white because:

She didnt have a big ugly nose like black people do

She had white people ears

Shi didnt speak like thugs but she spoke like white people

Note: She was black"
4171,"You have to realize that saying these things doesn’t mean “I hate every single man/white person on the earth and I will treat them all like shit.” It’s hating the demographic as a whole because they are the oppressors. I see absolutely nothing wrong with hating the oppressors. And yes I am white. I still see other white people trying to defend the police and trump but staying silent about the actual matters at hand. 

The black people who say “I hate white people” are not killing them or treating them all like second class citizens. The women who say “I hate men” are also not killing them or treating them like second class citizens. The white people who hate black people DO kill them and treat them as lesser. The men who hate women DO kill them and see them as lesser.

The vast majority of mass shootings, for example, have been alt-right inspired. The two major mass shootings in Canada have been incel inspired where a man specifically sought out women to kill. Many white people specifically sought out black people to kill, such as the church shooting. George Zimmerman, the cop who murdered Trayvon Martin, signs skittles packages for white men. (Trayvon was walking home from the store with skittles when he was killed.) 

How many women have been killed simply because they are women? A whole damn lot. How many men have been killed simply because they’re men? Some, but not nearly as many, not even close. How many black people have been killed simply because they’re black? A whole damn lot. How many white people have been killed simply because they’re white? Again, some, but not even close to as many.

The moral of this comment: words don’t mean much. Actions do. Women/blacks speak on their hate. Men/white act on it. There is an enormous difference."
4172,"I don’t hate anybody! I’m sorry if that’s what you picked up from my previous message because I’m obviously very emotional right now. I am well aware that not all police officers are racist.

I focused on police brutality because that’s what is prevalent this week in the media as George Floyd was brutally murdered earlier this week by racist policeman and KKK member derek chauvin, who has now finally been arrested. 

And I don’t know where you thought I said that I hate white people. I explicitly said that Black people don’t actually hate whites but they are angry that their lives have to be fought for just for their murderers to be charged even though it should be a given."
4173,"when i was talking about the “hating white people for slavery” thing i was talking about a very specific argument that has been used against me. 

not all white people are racist. you’re taking mostly about police brutality. not all police are racist and not all racist police are white. it’s fine to say that you hate racist police and police brutality because that’s a specific group. but saying you hate white people as a whole doesn’t make sense and is racist."
4174,"Bruh I've been on the receiving end of both kinds of this shit. I'm Arab but get mistaken for Greek or Italian when it's not the summer and I'm not tan. So like 3/4 of the year. I'll get the whole your  a straight white male your priveleged shit and I've had people straight up say some racist shit to me accidentally trying to be ""woke"". Both sides are dumb. Racism is racism. Don't judge based on color/religion period."
4175,"I think a lot of black people don’t say this to sound quirky, i think it’s more to express the rage that’s been unfairly pent up throughout generations of systematic racism."
4176,i remember her... that’s extremeeee internalized racism at its finest
4177,"What does that have to do with anything? If you're being an ass you're but an ass. Everyone shouldn't be treated with respect, regardless of what demographic they happen to belong to."
4178,"Ah yeah I get that

I don’t know it’s just funny to me how someone would preach about equality then want to kill someone based on how they were born

Should we kill everyone for equality’s sake🤔🤔🤔"
4179,the best part is when dr phil said “as a caucasian we don’t want you” or something along those lines 😭 it was hilarioussss
4180,"Idc about them cause they don't mean it, well most of them."
4181,^(its kinda justified tho)
4182,when i’m actually black..
4183,"its sexist and its racist. I dont care what they say, quite simply, you shouldn't say it."
4184,"White people have been oppressed too, in North Africa for centuries the native peoples there (for the most part people of arab states) enslaved white people who got stranded off the coast as result of ship wrecks and they even enslaved people from the Iberian peninsula when they could"
4185,"It's really frustrating and discouraging. I do my best to call out racism and sexism whenever I see it and make people think twice about making hurtful comments, but it's hard when the people I'm trying to help hate me just for being white. Women who say they hate men are no different, there are plenty of men who are fighting with us for our rights and if you say you hate men, you're basically telling them to not bother fighting for you and with you."
4186,"When slavery was ended, civil rights laws weren’t established. POC were still treated as second class citizens. How dare you try and simplify their struggle to just “something that happened 200 years ago”? Jim Crow laws existed back then, black men and children are still to this day targeted  by racist police officers. Dont repeat that “it was only 200 years ago “ BS again"
4187,you cant win with this guy i swear
4188,This is exactly how I’m looking and feeling rn
4189,"I love anime and all, but I would be a tad weirded out

What movie?"

4212,"Unless your using those asterisks ironically...

Chances of being a weeb are 100%"
4213,Badly
4214,Weird. I would first ask him to explain and be honest to me. In a relationship I find honesty probably the most important thing of all. I know there’s like privacy and stuff but still
4215,"Sire, my pasta is dry. Or have I perhaps gone blind as I don't see any sauce in here?"
4216,Cultured friend
4217,Lmao
4218,texting good morning and goodnight is a nice way of showing you are thinking about them. also i like if they are open with me and not keeping their feelings in
4219,Play minecraft with me
4220,"as a guy the guys who do that think they r cool, everyone just thinks they r assholes besides them."
4221,Exist
4222,"as a male who’s been cheated on in a long term relationship, 100% agree going both ways. cheating is the worst :/ i don’t mind someone being a hoe, it only bothers me if they’re doing it in a relationship yaknow?"
4223,and they have to be funny
4224,"I expect him to ask me how I'm feeling if I seem down to him, and if I am I hope he tries to comfort me lol. Oh also I would love it if he like planned things out with me rather than just being in a relationship, ya know? 😅"
4225,"Just to be open an honest with me, you’re not feeling great? That’s fine let’s talk about it. You don’t wanna talk about your feels and need a distraction? Cool let’s go watch a movie or play Mario kart. And obviously I’d kinda expect him to be like that with me too. It’s the little things that matter I think, like even as simple as asking your girlfriend how her day is going shows you really care."
4226,Or at least have a similar sense of humor to you
4227,if he doesnt then he aint the one
4228,Yes i am of the human male variety that is also capable of such tasks
4229,"Ur just going to respond ""nothing"" lol"
4230,im here jus waitin on u
4231,Oh cool that is a thing I can do
4232,I’m seen as “that funny guy” yet I’m lonely af
4233,My bf and I found the stronghold bc it's right next to our first base. Lol.
4234,"Aw, well don’t worry your still in middle school. Start worrying about crippling loneliness in high school"
4235,I want someone that’ll support me and make me feel protected and safe
4236,"Cheating is the worst! It really messed up my trust, maybe it was for the better though."
4237,Wait.... this sub is for *HUMAN* teenagers?
4238,"Coming from a guy, that is the most frustrating thing you could ever do."
4239,"ayyy, me and my gf beat the ender dragon together just last week"
4240,"Being there for me even though I'm a downer sometimes

Also me loving him

I do want cuddles though I'm in a cuddly mood and it's making me sad and I've wanted to cuddle for so long now plz come here I can pay snälla"
4241,"Ugh, they all are. And I’m not even into humans. Why can’t I find a sub with other alien teenagers like me?"
4242,Looks like we have a lot in common then
4243,"absolutely agree and relate. i don’t get why people do it tbh :( why is it so hard to just be loyal in a relationship yaknow? sorry for being so depressing lol, i’m actually in a happy 10 month relationship now. but i do still suffer from the effects of past situations sadly, such as when i was cheated on."
4244,Actually I’m having some problems with that right now which really sucks I’ll probably just get a level up in high school
4245,she was too scared to hit it so I had to do it myself while she distracted all of the enderman lmao
4246,You're very sweet and I love you too but go to bed it's 4 in the morning.
4247,Awww
4248,"Do what? Find a cut that works? Google face shapes and match up which one you have, then google 'mens haircut for [blank] face shape'"
4249,"It matters a lot imo, like you don’t have to rock up in a tuxedo daily but something other than a tshirt and shorts can be nice every once in a while. Like I started trying to dress better myself recently after throwing random long-sleeved shirts and leggings together, and I feel like I look much nicer. Not saying clothes are the only thing that matter, but a nice fit makes your physical appearance go up from my what I’ve seen

Hair could be even more important honestly, making sure you have a style that suits your head shape is important"
4250,"I already said how, google face shapes. There are a bunch of articles online with characteristics of each one and you'll be able to figure it out by looking at yourself"
4251,Ok how do I figure out the shape of my face and the name of my haircut
4252,"you could also get a trendy haircut 

im asian with straight flat hair so its always to the side n i was an average 6

during the summer i got a perm n got my hair curly with a fade n all the girls i used to know developed an interest in me n consider me a 9"
4253,"I would say most people don’t really care about clothes other than just matching and not wearing torn/dirty clothes. But the hair part really matters in my opinion.  A haircut can change the appearance of your face and bring out some of your best/worst features. I definitely  recommend looking into your face shape and seeing what hair works best. But if I see my friend/dude I’m really into rocking a bad haircut or a kinda dirty shirt I won’t mind. But for first impression stuff, definitely. I remember I kinda had a small crush on this one guy but he kept wearing the same clothes from the day before and got a bad haircut that I just wasn’t attracted to him anymore. Of course you don’t just want someone who likes you for your appearance, you want a person who likes you for who you are. :)"
4254,"The thing is I know a lot of guys that have gone from ugly to hot just from cutting their hair. And yeah your hair does matter; If it’s greasy, dirty, and uncut it’s gross. Trust me, girls notice that stuff especially if you talk a lot. The clothes aren’t as big of a deal, but they do matter. You don’t have to wear dress shirts and suits every day, but it’s a little weird if you wear the same outfit everyday. If you can’t help what you wear everyday it’s not your fault. It’s nice to see a difference though."
4255,Is wearing jeans and sweatshirt every day ok?
4256,"Yeah I’d say that’s fine!! It’s like streetwear which is pretty fashionable, looks cute too"
4257,I have naturally curly hair and people have always complemented it. Would you say curly hair is attractive? I never really liked it that much and it’s annoying to wash/style but people seem to like it.
4258,Damn now too bad I have no idea whatsoever how to do anything
4259,"A bit I guess. It's the same with guys actually. Think about a girl you think is pretty, or just a ok girl, then see her with a brand new haircut, some make up and all of this. Obviously she will look quite more attractive. 

I had a crush on a guy once, and I never saw him out of school. But as we were friends, we decided to hang out, and *oh damn*, his clothes, hair and shoes were just amazing. Sense of style is very attractive. Well, you don't have to know everything abt fashion, but try to use cool clothes and etc."
4260,"Yeah curly hair is really cute!! Don’t worry, my hair is naturally afro-textured so I get the pain when it comes to maintenance lol. All that really matters to me is that your hair fits your face shape well, and considering the fact that your hair is naturally curly, chances are it fits your face well because of genetics. And the fact that people compliment it is even better"
4261,"lol i feel u , i used to think the same before i realized what to do with myself

knowing myself i was always jealous of how others looked cuz they were clearly better looking n because of that i copy whatever they have

clearly i cant copy a strong jawline or face structure but i can copy a hairstyle

also it doesnt matter what or how much you change , you will always look the same unless a big change happens

big changes include hair , glasses , body type"
4262,"If you trust your barber, yeah. Otherwise (most often) no"
4263,"what matters isn’t what you wear, but how you feel in your clothes! wear things that sit on your body correctly and highlight your nice features, and it’s honestly shocking how much of a confidence boost you’ll get. i’d recommend watching queer eye to see how stylist tan france approaches clothing and self confidence while being aware of most people not being able to afford high end clothes, it teaches a lot!"
4264,For me it matters a lot
4265,a lot
4266,"I'd say hair makes up like 30% of physical attractiveness if not more, so it's definitely kind of important, but you don't have to have some fancy hairdo that you gel up everyday or anything. Just a simple messy look usually looks pretty good on people. Just find something that fits your face shape. If you have long hair, make sure it's taken care of."
4267,"i used to be a straight flat hair asian that averaged a 6 but since i got a perm every girl i used to know developed an interest in me n considers me a 9 now

the way i have my hair is loose droopy at the top n faded sides / back"
4268,Click the three dots in the upper right corner and select change user flair
4269,Is it safe to tell the barber “just give me something you think I look good in”?
4270,Hair is pretty big for me
4271,My taste in people ranges from well put together to person with greasy hair who looks like they haven’t slept in 5 years
4272,Don't dress like a road man/red neck. Don't dress like your homeless. Don't stink. Then you're good.

It disgusted me.

4308,"Bruh 💀 after learning and reading ab it, OCD is like scary"
4309,"Apparently mental illness is attractive and I don’t see why, all these girls who are super basic with their big lips and eyebrows and Gucci bags on Instagram who have “I have depression and anxiety” in their bio even tho they’ve never had a diagnosis and don’t know shit about it, it just pisses me off"
4310,"Never but I’ve wanted to so many times as a person with OCD

it’s not cute it’s miserable."
4311,"OCD is crazy bad, if I were to write the down the intrusive thoughts that flood my head people would never talk to me again. Anyone that fakes ocd is fucked up"
4312,"No, it's too risky tbh. I don't wanna ""assume"" immediately that they're faking it, I'd rather just don't care if they seem dodgy abt their illness"
4313,"Yeah I laughed at this girl with ""anger issues"" cause she said she ""gets into fights."" Anyways she came to school with really bad bruise makeup on her fists and I told her that she needed to blend the red with her skin more, and that bruises turn yellow, blue and brown, not red. 

We aren't friends anymore."
4314,"Well, this girl wanted to get out of gym, and started having an ""anxiety attack"", and started flopping around on the floor yelling ""I'm having an anxiety attack, I'm having an anxiety attack!"" As someone with anxiety, I was pissed, and told her to quit making a fool of herself and just do the exercises. Other than that no."
4315,YES I can’t stand it
4316,"no. i dont like assuming theyre faking it because i dont know their psyche. im not a doctor. i dont know shit. 

plus i dislike the thing where people assume others are faking it for no reason and even so like resorting to that for attention is not ok and might be a sign of a bigger issue. idk better safe than sorry"
4317,No because I don’t want to assume whether or not someone is faking it
4318,Tambino hitting us with knowledge yet once again
4319,"i feel like ocd is one of the most commonly misidentified mental illnesses, someone i know has diagnosed ocd and its not just washing your hands or organizing ur binder for school :/"
4320,"Yeah I can’t stand people who put their colored pencils or markers in rainbow order and say they have OCD like no, you’re just organized"
4321,"I have social anxiety, and my mom and sister were like “ ja ja, I have that thing too”. I know they don’t, but it hurts if they don’t believe me, and make fun of me for it."
4322,"I cannot say for certain. I don’t like calling shit out because I’m not a therapist, but... 

I had a friend of mine claim she had panic attacks. I believed her. I never saw her have one, I just knew that she claimed to. Maybe nothing triggered her, maybe not- but I do remember I had one right in front of her and she never mentioned it again after that day. 

I saw a guy that *looked* similar to a dude that had stalked me. It wasn’t the same guy, but he had a similar dark hair and shitty soul patch. And that was all my brain needed to freak the fuck out. I lost it. I started shaking. I began to cry. I couldn’t breathe. Everything got blurry. My legs just sort of stopped and I just sat on the ground with my head in my arms like a child in a mental hospital and I sobbed with fear at the sight of a random ass guy.

I remember hearing her frightened voice asking what was happening and if she should call an ambulance. I eventually calmed down and after, she just asked me really quietly what had happened. I said that I’d had a panic attack. She never breathed a word about anxiety or panic attacks ever again."
4323,It is
4324,Mental illness is attractive when it’s “suffered” by attractive people with no mental illnesses
4325,Exactly
4326,Imo it’s better to assume they are not faking it
4327,"yeah i don’t think anyone. escpecially a non-therapist  can tell the diference between fake and real mental illness. except in very clear cases like OPs example. 

i hate how common it is to throw mental illness diagnoses around an di wish people were more clear abt the differenec betweeen depressed ≠ major depressive disorder , anxious ≠ general anxiety disorder, mood swings ≠ bipolard disorder."
4328,"If any of you guys are into reading YA fiction books, check out Turtles All The Way Down by John Green. The author himself deals with OCD and the book follows a girl who falls in love, but also copes with highly distracting OCD."
4329,"No, because sometimes I don't know how to make sure its fake or not, and if you call someone out and it turns out they're not lying, then you fucked up."
4330,"There’s a difference in undiagnosed stuff

There’s people who are obviously faking it

And then people like me who can barely function sometimes due to anxiety and want to kill themselves but the neglectful and abusive parents that drove me to this place have refused to test me or get me on meds"

4335,For real 😔
4336,no but if the opportunity presented itself then i would
4337,That’s what I was gonna say :) we shouldn’t automatically assume the worst about people.
4338,"I've heard that because so much happens to baby in the first 2 years  of their life, it helps people know what stage of development they're in. I don't understand why they would use months after they're 2 tho"
4339,"yes. after 12 months just say a year omg. i’m also annoyed at how babies for first birthday are celebrated when they’re 1 years old, but not when they’re born? like why is that a thing?"
4340,When you turned 16 and 2/3s
4341,thanks u/Xx420OKBOOMER69xX
4342,Hi everyone my name is Leon and I’m 170 months old.
4343,I'm almost 195 months old and I'm looking forward to the 200th month anniversary
4344,My pleasure
4345,I can't do math
4346,"go wild, you’re only 200 months once 😫 I miss those days"
4347,That’s exactly why. Source via college education
4348,"1 year = 12 months.

16 × 12 = 192.

We both 192 months old"
4349,But then u need to take into account all the months since your birthday
4350,Yeah I can’t fucking do math and I don’t know what different age babies look like they need to stop
4351,"I think 18 months and under is a good system for the most part, but like up to 2 years is chill too. People can do what they want tho, not like it's hurting everyone. I think the system of like ""almost two""/""two and a half""/""almost three"" kinda covers it otherwise."
4352,Darn.
4353,"I mean the first 2 years it's acceptable I guess but after that, yeah it confuses me"
4354,"Absolutely! Bitch, I asked for how old your baby is, not a math problem"
4355,"No, why would it? Counting it in months is just more precise, which may feel appropriate when they're babies.


edit:  I'm 184 months btw"
4356,"I straight up missed my 200 months by 22 days and I’m now depressed about it lol
You’d better enjoy it!"
4357,I know. I just ignored them cause didn't want to bother with calculating them as well
4358,"I know that I and a lot of other people struggle with that, so it's kinda annoying when people use months instead of years"
4359,"It’s because babies develop very rapidly; a lot cam happen from one month to the next, so mothers often count by months to to let others know exactly how developed their baby is"
4360,"this. there's a HELL of a lot of development going on within roughly the first half a decade, and the first few years are jam packed with so many developments.  it's fascinating and amazing to see an infant in the first few years of life, because they pick things up (figuratively and literally) so fast. Makes you wish you could learn as fast as they can."
4361,Yes i hate it you just ask how old it is and then theh make you do math
4362,Even more confusing is when people measure pregnancy time in weeks
4363,"I don't get it. If I wanted to do math, I'd have passed my class."
4364,"It’s like that because when babies are young there is milestones like every month and the month specific age is crucial to development, what foods they’re eating etc. After like 18-24 months though it’s kinda redundant because the development isn’t so fast."
4365,It’s really weird. After 12 months just say years man I can’t math that quickly
4366,"Yeah, I hate this. As soon as a baby is 1 year old, they are 1 year old, not 12 months"
4367,"Nah, it's understandable for the first 2-3 years, after that it gets a little weird."
4368,"No not directly. It often becomes that but teenage boys are horny significantly more often than girls because of how biology works. The stereotype of the horny teenage boy often accompanies the fair polite cute perfect little teenage girl who because she’s “perfect”, could never masturbate or watch porn, which is what makes it a denial of female sexuality. Teenage boys being horny as a stereotype on its own is based on some truth and is not outright a denial of female sexuality, it just often leads to that"
4369,Let’s just all agree that teenagers in general are portrayed in shitty ways
4370,I wouldn't say it denies it but it makes it seem like boys being horny is just something that everyone has to put up with bc they're boys
4371,i agree that all teenagers are portrayed in shitty ways i’m just suggesting that for female identifying teenagers it’s a matter of feeling pressure not to show your edge and for male identifying teenagers a tweet from a classmate could land them in jail for life.
4372,That is a good point
4373,"I never thought of it this way, but it seems like it most certainly is."
4374,"I get your point of view, and agree to a certain level. But, because everyone's body work kinda differently, then I think It really depends. Yes, there can be sex-crazed girls, but also boy that don't really get that feeling as much as the others. I think that stereotype affects both girls and boys, since it does classify everyone from a gender into a box of how they behave. 

Edit: spelling"
4375,"Yesss! This stuff has been said to my face countless times



I'm that one guy who spends alot of time with the girls in his class and not the guys cuz ig I just don't rlly get along with them, it was once my friend's birthday and I went and gave her a hug, a teacher saw me and took me to the principal to tell him I was trying to get into her pants, my parents were called and so were hers, we were made to sit down and explain what happened and we got let off because the principal is a bit forward thinking in my school.


But to avoid future situations like this, I'm banned from interacting with her on school campus so that the teachers don't feel comfortable. Unfuckingbelievable.


All in the situation was really embarrassing because that teacher is the type that would go and bitch about you to everyone and now the whole school thinks that I'm trying to get into her pants on a daily basis"
4376,Yo facts 100. Most of my friends are girls and even with my girlfriend I'm still really careful cause I'm scared of someone saying something and there goes my dreams.
4377,yea never really gotten the idea that cuz we're boys means we get to violate other people's space
4378,Yeah
4379,i dont really think so. and i also don't think it's a 'free pass' cus it's kind of looked down upon. i just think that female sexuality isn't talked about as much publically.
4380,"Yeah that’s fucking stupid, I mean girls hug girls all the time and that’s fine in everyone’s eyes but the second a guy hugs a girl it’s seen as only sex driven and also when a guy hugs a guy that’s gay don’t do that apparently"
4381,[deleted]
4382,I agree with this guy completely
4383,"In short, guys don't deserve affection



:("
4384,"Its a annoying, all genders can get like this, but usually its ""wrong"" for a girl to feel that way in public so it has to be controlled or they are socially unacceptable somtimes"
4385,Now this is facts
4386,"You are not wrong about that but biologically boys have more testosterone than girls. Testosterone is the hormon that makes us ""horny"". Girls has it too but it is way too lower than boys. Sometimes when a girl is having sexual desire disorder doctors give them testosterone. I am just talking about biologically."
4387,"Nah just 16/7, rest is for sleep."
4388,I want affection and I can never get it :(
4389,"There's this thing called ""save a post"""
4390,"i didn’t say girls don’t masturbate lol, i do it all the time. it’s just that on average boys are hornier than girls. idk why people find that so hard to believe when it’s literally a fact"
4391,Me @ movies: ok bomer
4392,Teen boys have much higher testosterone as % of their max than girls do with estrogen^[source](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RNufMtkyaaE/TjXyYKSqC9I/AAAAAAAAAC0/Zupkw_wgEE0/s1600/hormones.png)
4393,"The risk you’re talking about is getting accused of something and having your life ruined, however how your putting it you’re not even willing to have a life in the first place. I mean this in the nicest way, but it seems as though you’re punishing yourself for a hypothetical that’s liable to never even happen to you. 

I disagree with your stance but I hope some day you realize that life is worth living and that’s why people are scared of having it crumble away."
4394,i guess? i wouldn’t describe it like that but it always felt inadvertently infantilising and kinda gave off a “girls shouldn’t be annoyed when boys can’t keep their dick in their pants for 10 minutes cause that’s just how they are” vibe
4395,[removed]
4396,"Yeah, but we have it worse! 😡 ^/s"
4397,Kinda?? Boys and girls both get horny but I feel like boys show their horniness a lot more than girls do which in part is because girls are supposed to be innocent and ladylike
4398,YES! I will cringe up and be like why bro? WHy?!
4399,"oh my god, I've found my people!"
4400,"I literally do that when I'm watching TV, I pause it take a breather and prepare myself for the EXTREME embarrassment"
4401,I just melt in embarrassment
4402,"Yes, it can happen quite often"
4403,"Nah lmfao, I just laugh or cringe"
4404,All the time

It's an odd feeling."

4408,"hey mr scott, whatcha gonna do? whatcha gonna do? make our dreams come true"
4409,Yes lol
4410,"yes but mostly when I know them

I experience this a lot bc one of my best friends gets really shy around teachers and people like that"
4411,Generally it just makes me laugh
4412,Yeah. Most of the times unless he/she is my opponent or something where I can laugh like hell
4413,"I just think ""oof."" I don't get embarrassed tho"
4414,Sometimes. Depends on the person. If it's my parents I go completely 🔴
4415,"Yeah, I always cringe but I don’t understand it"
4416,Yeah like second hand embarrassment
4417,Yes all the time
4418,"Oh, god, yeah. While like watching a show i just pause and really don't want to watch more."
4419,Yup
4420,"Lol yes,but mostly I'm just happy I'm not the one embarrassing myself for once"
4421,second hand embarrassment it is
4422,yeah when I watch cringy movies and i'm like ಠ_ಠ
4423,Yes which is why I don't like a lot of comedy movies
4424,I believe that's called cringe
4425,Yes and isn't it just sympathy?
4426,Always. I get second hand embarrassment often
4427,"definitely, or when your friend is talking to someone and you’re just listening to them talk, and then they just try to act cool and end up embarrassing yourself, i start to feel it myself and feel like i should change the topic lmao"
4428,i feel like only serial killers do that

4461,Lost my v card cca one year ago when I was 16 with a guy who i have been friends for over 6 years. He always used to be mean and manipulative...but somehow I didn’t care at the time. After almost two months (we weren’t exactly dating) I decided to end it. One of the best decisions I have ever made. He treated me like a shit and now keeps talking shit behind my back. Even though he begged me to come back together
4462,"I’m seeing a looot of young people answering this and I just want to say that there’s no shame in waiting. I was 17 before I did anything remotely sexual with ANYONE. If you’re sad about it and feel lonely, just remember that you have so much time. If people are giving you shit for it, drop them. I promise there’s no shame in waiting."

4483,"so uh _cough_  I guess you ***REALLY***   like jazz, huh?"
4484,"Yes, I do not recommend it. I caught some feelings for him, but he doesn't have any for me. That makes it all really complicated, since he wants to stay best friends"

4548,Definitely clothes. I tend to gravitate to guys who look like they put effort into their outfit.
4549,"yes, please trim your fingernails too"

4551,"ones that collect dirt, yes. not only boys"
4552,"Hair. So many of them just have buzzed hair or like hair too short to play with, they should experiment with it more idk I think more should grow it out, I really like long hair lol

Edit: Also i saw another comment mentioning clothing, and thats really true. Basketball shorts, baggy nike or adidads shirts, sweatpants. those things are boring. I like boys who have a distinct style, it makes you stand out. PS i have an obsession with skinny jeans, loose tank tops, and button down shirts (!!!) as long as they're not too dad, and if you want to be extra hot then  roll up the sleeves and unbutton the first few buttons of the shirt idk why thats just really hot to me. And I am also weirdly attracted to baggy jeans, bandannas, and tie dye. idk, dont ask lol. Just wear clothes that brings out your personality. there's too many basic white boys that look like this: https://i.pinimg.com/236x/7f/8d/f2/7f8df2cfdbb2b1a4da393ce3a4d22e8a--boys-hoodies-nike-hoodie.jpg?b=t
lol sorry he looks so young im just not in the mood to search for any other photos right now"
4553,What do you mean? Are there guys you know that have fucked up looking fingers?
4554,Great. I thought I was doing just fine but now I might wanna rethink everything.
4555,This guy I like does this shit where sometimes he won't wash or comb his hair and he'll wear a hat to just cover it up and it's not very attractive.
4556,"Not a girl but I see this a lot in other guys. Y'all need to make sure you put your shoes on right. I know it seems weird but I see guys with tied shoe laces that are long and lose and the other foot is short and tight, also the thing in the middle (forgot what it's called but you can pull it to make everything straight and that's where the laces cross) I see guys just not give a shit about that and their shoes look all messy"
4557,"There’s absolutely nothing wrong with“the generic jeans/T-shirt/hoodie look”, the most important part is honestly fit and simple things like contrast (wearing sth dark with sth light; sth more slim-fitting with sth more loose-fitting, etc), but wearing something more interesting like a more colourful hoodie or an interesting pattern combo etc. can be really nice too! It makes you look more confident without really having to do anything, and it’s helped me a lot too.
If you look more into fashion you’ll notice that the standards for men’s fashion are incredibly low so you don’t really have to do anything crazy to stand out lol

Some of my friends have said they don’t really want to put too much effort into their appearance because it might “look gay” but honestly who cares. Taking care of yourself and looking nice does so much to your mindset and confidence and I’m sure that’s what most girls prefer :)"
4558,Do girls wax their eyebrows weekly?
4559,Definitely the hair. Some people don’t even brush it or comb it or anything and it just looks messy.
4560,"Oof yep, I will shave until I’m 18"
4561,What kind of clothes though? I find that I usually end up wearing a t-shirt and jeans because I literally don't know what else to wear.
4562,"Say some shit to him about it, when someone of the opposite sex says something to us we’ll usually fix it"
4563,It depends. Some brows grow faster than others

4573,"Skincare. I’m not into guys but if I could give them a tip it would be to take better care of their skin, because that is hella attractive. Wash your face, maybe try to make pores smaller, get rid of blackheads. It doesn’t have to be elaborate and fancy, just the bare minimum. And don’t worry, it doesn’t make you gay."
4574,"I thought girls like messy hair. Personally, I used to have a super neat and tidy quiff but now I don’t use a comb anymore and use my fingers with the blow dryer to give it a more relaxed messy quiff look."
4575,The tongue. I should fix that on my shoes but I always just shove them on without even untying/retying them. It's a bad habit.
4576,Oh you innocent being.

4580,Yes since it hides my ugly ass face
4581,ty 🥺🥺
4582,"To whoever reading this, you are cute with or without masks."
4583,I think scars on lips are badass
4584,Grey blue. I really like them.

4586,Thankyou
4587,[deleted]
4588,No one apparently
4589,[deleted]
4590,"Aww, how sweet.

^(wait a darn tootin' second)"
4591,Thanks!!!
4592,no because i can’t smile at people so you can just see my eyes narrow when i smile😔
4593,"I bet your face is at least OK and not ugly. As I personally say ""if you don't compliment yourself, who will?"""
4594,I wouldn't have even realised if it wasn't for your comment (•‿•)
4595,"Me with my round eyes:

•́  ‿ ,•̀"
4596,haha sometimes but it also makes my forehead look huge
4597,Im always looking cute so yeah :)
4598,Kinda but it’s weird
4599,"Same reason I like mine, I think my face is ok except my mouth because I have a overbite and braces"
4600,no but it covers up the ugly
4601,"after masks are no longer required, I'm still going to just squint at people to express happiness."
4602,2 masks
4603,Yeah same
4604,What eye shape is a pretty eye shape then?
4605,"Yeah, it covers my stupid face."
4606,Yes! I second this 😌
4607,"Yeah, a lot"
4608,"Idk about that, but I’ve cone to accept that I’m not ugly and maybe I can be kinda cute sometimes, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say I’m hot, but I know I’m not as insecure about my appearance as most of the girls I know"
4609,"Not me lol, I am either ugly or somewhat ok."
4610,Looking kinda hot in that pfp tho
4611,I was bouta downvote til I saw the PFP lmao
4612,"Sometimes I feel really confident and think that I'm very hot, but most of the time I'm just like acceptable, like not that pretty but ok I guess"
4613,Guys can have insecurities too but ok
4614,I think I'm hot😳
4615,I know the feeling man.
4616,"I'll have moments after finishing my makeup, then quickly remember that I'm actually ugly as hell lmfao 🗿"
4617,this sounds bad but that's honestly me. i think i'm really cute
4618,[deleted]
4619,Fun fact: people can relate to each other regardless of gender
4620,😳
4621,Guys are allowed to respond to comments on here.
4622,Because you are hot 😳
4623,"If I ever was the best looking person in any given room, I'd probably be in the wrong room"
4624,😳
4625,OK but why am i getting up votes tho 😳
4626,Have you even read the rules? Also your profile photo shows 18+ but your flair is 15F so idk what’s up
4627,It really depends on the angle I’m looking at myself in the mirror
4628,Sometimes
4629,"That’s not bad, confidence is nice. There’s a big difference between being happy with your appearance and being self centered"
4630,Maybe it’s time for you to accept that all genders can have the exact same experiences and feel the exact same emotions. It doesn’t take away anyone’s experiences.
4631,😳 uh news to me
4632,So? What the hell was the point of commenting that apart from wanting to be an asshole?
4633,[removed]
4634,"😳

Bruh I commented cuz generally I find myself attractive but I didn't think other people really did😳"
4635,You seem kind of strange...
4636,I'm kinda cute ngl
4637,Who’s laughing at you?!
4638,Yeass I love doing that! Except when the hair goes in my face cause then I can't see
4639,Oh it’s the greatest feeling in the world
4640,"Be me, I always look like a mess so it doesn't change much"
4641,How can that happen I have no idea
4642,"Yeah and I'm light, I've literally fallen over before"
4643,I reckon she might have longer hair than you...
4644,"I mean, by the time I get to where I'm going I'm a huge mess, so I don't really like it."
4645,"It’s spectacular, you really do feel like a movie star. Or elemental warrior who can conquer the world. 
Bonus points if you have a flowing cloak, scarf or imposing weapon"

4647,"I can make two jokes outta it


Somebody's hearing them tomorrow morning then"
4648,aww 😂
4649,"When you have long hair and the wind comes from the back it sweeps it off the sides and into/in front of your face, so you have to face the wind for the premium hair being brushed back feeling"
4650,nah bro my hairs like 2 ft long
4651,I love doing it. Especially during this quarantine since I didnt cut my hair yet.
4652,Nothing feels more liberating to me than this
4653,I love  snow and thunderstorms for their atmosphere
4654,"i WISH that sounds fun

strong winds literally make me fall over so ): not my favorite"
4655,YES YES YES I LOVE STORMS AND WIND AND IT MAKES ME FEEL EPIC
4656,Amen
4657,I feel like a lone wolf among the lambs. I feel like this whole world is just looking at me and this being my moment I live into it like there is no tomorrow
4658,Yeah
4659,Never done that
4660,"I like leaning on the wind, if that makes sense.  Seeing how much of my body weight the wind can hold up.

Storms, or at least wind storms, seem pretty uncommon here so I don't get to do this much. Last time was about two years ago."
4661,Wish it was like that everyday
4662,it’s cool but horrible while wearing gloss lmao
4663,No but it's fun when you're on a wall and you can just lean back without falling over because of the wind
4664,"Being a weather nerd, I love thunderstorms!"
4665,It is incredibly satisfying/fun when this happens. It doesn’t happen much in Florida but when I lived in NYC I remember it happening often.
4666,no cause my hair get everywhere
4667,"I know someone who hates it because it gives them trouble to breathe. I love it though, I once went out in warm-ish rain and wind and it felt so great running through that."
4668,"> I wanna be fucking moms

your welcome fixed it for you"
4669,*maternal
4670,I wanna be a fucking mom
4671,I see a lotta girls here wanna adopt. Same here. Dont wanna go thru the trouble of pregnancy tho making ur own human sounds cool. Also dont wanna put the baby thru the trouble of having to live in a pretty shitty world. Better to take care of a child that's already here and in need.
4672,"Make-a-human **™**

&#x200B;

Players: 2, Age limit: 12-45, made in *your uterus*, made by *life* ***©***"
4673,"Oh not now of course, but when I'm older and am financially stable I'd definitely want to adopt"
4674,Yeah that confused me
4675,like... now?
4676,Yeah lesbian
4677,"I don't think so, even if I personally want to adopt some day most of my friends wish to remain child free. I just think I depends on the person."
4678,I wonder what material instinct would look like...maybe it’s the human instinct some people have of hoarding..idk just a thought
4679,"Clap bombs, fuck moms, wheel snipe and celly."
4680,Lesbian?? Or other cause for adoption?
4681,"The irony is how many girls want a baby that resembles a possession. If at any point you're talking about having a child and it sounds as if you're planning to acquire a pet, you should probably wait to have kids."
4682,"not op, but sounds expensive."
4683,also they probs don't wanna give birth.
4684,Not for everyone but I guess yeah
4685,"yes, since that's the only way our species can continue."
4686,What's an antinatalist?
4687,This is the first time I'm hearing about anti-natalism
4688,"I have absolutely no desire to get pregnant and go through childbirth, but I think I have some maternal instincts that causes me to have a sort of motherly love for my cat."
4689,Also populations pretty high anyway so i know alot of people that are driven away by having to raise someone into a world that will someday fall.
4690,r/blursedcomments
4691,"Same, like id love a kid, but you know atleast one in a tube or smthn, pregnancy sounds like a pain"
4692,Imagine where you'd be if your mom was an anti-natalist. Geez.
4693,"If you're planning on making a mini you, you probably should wait a bit more as well"
4694,Hoarding children?
4695,Why not get a sperm donor though? At least that way it's half yours
4696,Yeah they're like $500 per vial of sperm or something but I feel like that would be worth it for me since then the babies still actually mine
4697,I applaud your reasoning and effort
4698,"*me, obviously sitting on the couch watching tv*

4725,When i ask for some headache medicin and she asks why
4726,"me: *gets out of shower with wet hair and clean clothes after telling my mum I was going to shower*

her: did you shower?"
4727,"No ,I don't get this hella annoyed so easily lmao."
4728,Haha hell yeah. I don’t really think about them anymore but literally if they gave me an ounce of attention i would jump into their arms
4729,"Im punk/emo and short :3 



but im 17 and a dude :|"
4730,'I'm not homo'
4731,Omg yes. I kinda got over her for a bit but i started liking her again.
4732,I'm heree🤭
4733,"No. Honestly once I lose feelings, I lose feelings."
4734,that sounds like a really weird way to put it
4735,Uh no. I don't have a crush rn besides celebrity crushes and if either of my exs asked me out again I'd say no
4736,no there’s honestly no one i’d date in a heartbeat
4737,Imma need some of that attention thank you very much. I’m so easy lmao
4738,Yeah
4739,Maybe 👀
4740,Yes but don’t give me that hope she is 100% not into me
4741,Ugh yeah.. I keep going back to crushing on them. I usually stop liking others when they do smth I find bad but he's been consistent
4742,"As long as I keep the right mindset I'm trying to avoid saying yes to anybody, not that I'm likely to be asked at any point but still. Better off single"
4743,"I guess so, but that could be literally any girl"
4744,"I did but then I found out she was dating my close friend that I have drifted apart from so nah not anymore.







I have a crush on a different girl now"
4745,Yup too old plus I’m not homo
4746,"I did, she was great and I started to develop feelings for her one night on a call, after the call I tried to convince myself that it wouldn’t work and such and we moved on, a few weeks ago we were on a call and she wanted to tell me something and after a bit it she finally made it clear what she wanted to tell me, she had feelings for me, so we started dating and it has been really fun although both happily and sadly she is leaving for college so our relationship most likely won’t go past that, I’m happy for her and I’m not gonna try stop her, part of me knew it was bound to happen but I was still sad when it did, idk if we broke up or not tbh but a phone call made it very clear that she knew we weren’t gonna last because of this fact, we are planning on staying friends after which I’m very happy about"
4747,"Well, no, I don’t think so. I try and remain friends with people, especially if I used to like them because that often means that, at least to me, they’re a pretty cool person. But that’s it."
4748,Yeah even if I was married w 8 kids
4749,"Nope, cause I'm not over her yet"
4750,Totally
4751,Edit: no😂
4752,I wish I was someone crush in That way XD
4753,"yeah, it still stings sometimes"
4754,"i don’t have crushes, but i feel like almost everyone has at least one, of the type of crush"
4755,"Honestly, maybe. Perhaps, I'd date him just to see what it feels like. *Perhaps*."
4756,"Yeah. There’s this absolutely gorgeous girl. She’s blonde, probably about 5’ 5/6” (I’m 5’7”), and her eye colour fluctuates on the basis of the seasons (green in Winter and blue in Summer), with a sensational figure. It still surprises me that no one’s vying for her attention. 

Anyways, she was really nice about rejecting me, but I was a little pushy, so it didn’t end too well. 

I’m cool about it now, but she’s gorgeous. 

Yeah, I wouldn’t be able to say no."
4757,"I was gonna say no can't relate,, but I remember I was telling myself I was totally over the crush on my current bf and then he said he liked me and I immediately was like um I like u too,,, so I guess the answer is yes that's exactly what happened me"
4758,Should I wait for her to tell me when she’s ready or should I ask?
4759,"Maybe say, ""I like you, so if you like me too, when you're ready, do you think we can go out?"" Or something less cheesy but similar :)"
4760,"Yeah ok, thanks for the advice :)"
4761,"I have the same dilemma, I just met her less than a month ago and now since school started she keeps talking to me and poking me when sitting behind me (I don’t have a problem with it) and always calling me a legend. Is she just being friendly?"
4762,Not a girl am i allowed to answer?
4763,"So i think she's into you and it sounds like you can talk with her about everything you want right?
If that's the case then talk with her about a relationship maybe she said she doesn't want a relationship without overthinking it. Or just ask her out there's not much which could go wrong in this case i think"
4764,Sure
4765,Yeah that's cool
4766,I’m just not too sure about asking her out right now since she told me she’s not ready for a relationship. I’m not interested why she’s not ready since that’s up to her but I assume it is because she wants to spend as much time with her little sister as possible before she goes away.
4767,"Not a girl so my answer has less merit.

I think she's into you but she's either got some family thing that's keeping her from dating you, or she has some personal stuff and she really isn't sure if shes ready for a relationship. It sounds like she really wants you, but she's being held back. My advice is before you make a move is to talk to her about her personal life and try to be supportive and help her out."
4768,Then wait 'till you think it's the right moment
4769,"I think I will, thanks for the advice my dude"
4770,Thx for the advice
4771,Bruh she’s Asian as well
4772,Rockhardscrotum69
4773,"Has she ever been in a relationship before? If not, the prospect of one might make her nervous. From what i can tell she clearly likes you, so she's probably telling the truth about not being ready to be in a relationship. Just be clear about your feelings but make sure she understands there's no rush or pressure. Good luck!"
4774,"I've experienced this once. Most likely it's a personal reason, like it was in my case. But it could be because she doesn't know herself. Idk I'm not a girl."
4775,"Seems to me she likes you but just isn't ready. I'd tell her you like her but are happy to wait until she's ready or something along those lines. It seems like you've got a good comfortable friendship where you can talk freely, so just tell her how you feel but emphasise that you're happy to wait for her to decide what she wants"
4776,No problem
4777,"What anime is this from?



/s"
4778,"This was really helpful, neither of us have been in a relationship so I think/hope you’ve hit the nail on the head. Thankyou!"
4779,"She most likely does, like it would be really weird of she didn't. She probably just doesn't want to be in a relationship and as someone who has gone through this (I was the one not ready, honestly still am) I can tell you that just because she doesn't want to be in a relationship does not mean she doesn't like you.
 I hope this helps."
4780,Ok coincidences lmao. The real question is do you have the body of a normal 17 year old or one like from an anime?(reference giorno)
4781,nice.
4782,Uhhh Pokemon is the only anime I’ve watched if that counts
4783,"Google ""shirtless giorno""."
4784,Don’t want to sound vain but I do look similar to him
4785,This is happening with me too..but I guess girls do this when they want some more time before starting with a relationship
4786,Wtf is your username
4787,This is exactly what I’m going to do when I see her next
4788,lmao now I have this picture in my head of me saying supportive things while my friend is shoving a tampon in her uterus
4789,We do fart
4790,Sometimes we just need a hug when we’re going through a hard time
4791,That a lot of us are willing to give hugs without question. Feeling down? Ask for a hug.
4792,We really do pee out of our butts.
4793,"some of us do get horny, just not as obviously. 
also some of us watch porn lol"
4794,That's not really a girl-only secret. We feel the same often as well
4795,My titties are small enough for me to not wear a bra 99% of the time.
4796,you've revealed too much. *we must flee*
4797,"(This is of course depending on the girl) When a girl cries/mentions feminine issues, you’re done, man. We can get almost ANYTHING if we act upset and start crying to a teacher or something. This doesn’t always work of course, especially in situations where the girl tears are being used on another female. But bring up feminine issues to a boy and you can stop any conversation in an instant. Want to skip class? Issues. Need a break from an idiotic lesson? Issues. Actually hate gym class because the teachers make you run for 15 minutes and then do 50 push-ups and curl ups each when your in 5TH GRADE FUCK YOU COACH BRANDES YOU’VE RUINED GYM FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE BECAUSE OF THIS? Issues."
4798,"Lies.....pee is stored in the balls, therefore girls cannot pee as they do not have balls"
4799,"wait, you guys get ^horny? *gasp* no way, get outta here you wierdo."
4800,*takes notes*
4801,"When we are home alone we are 99.9% of the time in an oversized hoodie, sweatpants, messy bun, and eating Doritos while binging our childhood shows and texting our friends. Also we lie a lot and say we can’t go out because we don’t wanna shave."
4802,The wording of that made it so much better
4803,literally I just want to be loved and not used for sex or to look pretty. It’s so hard to find that tho :(
4804,Queefing
4805,sorry bro when shrek hentai exists i can't just not be horny
4806,what
4807,you have been nominated for a Nobel prize in biology
4808,"Wish I had that ""problem"""
4809,most of the time when we wear jeans or leggings it's because we didn't shave
4810,"Yes, but would you hug the guy who’s introverted nature combines with his Indian-pedophile face to make him appear to be the creepy guy who’s gonna rape someone? Cause that’s what everyone thinks of me, I’ve never been hugged, and I assume those two facts are linked."
4811,Very funny.
4812,"Haha, lie #2... periods really ain't that dramatic unless we ruin our pants or something. Its helpful to play it up though because basically no human male will wanna pry further if you say anything about ""feminine issues""."
4813,Why would they tell us and ruin em
4814,This honestly sounds sexy af i dont know why my gf doesnt do this
4815,It’s a blessing and a curse.
4816,Uterus? I don't think it's supposed to go that deep.
4817,"Heh, as if I’d fall for that!"
4818,DONT GO REVEALING OUR SECRETS
4819,My curly hair has a mind of its own ok? I dont control it
4820,Omg sorry what was I thinking!! Too late now
4821,Sorry if I do that. I feel like I’m gonna faint every time I stand up
4822,And why do you drape your hair over the back of the chair so it falls on my papers?
4823,"I apologize... 90% of the time it's an accident, I just forget the distance my hair can cover."
4824,Lol my hair’s always been just a bit too short for my taste (a bit shorter than shoulder length) so I’ve been growing it out for the past 3 years. There’s no way I’m cutting it now so everyone has to deal with whiplash coz it’s my reward
4825,"ohhhh shieeet, where my SHamPoO at?!"
4826,we hid the shampoo too.
4827,I'm sorry 🥺🥺
4828,What about the remaining 10 percent?
4829,*laughs in short hair*
4830,u/CatMewfia_ used special attack: hair whiplash! It was super effective
4831,"Even guys turn their heads very fast, it's just that they don't have long hair to hit us"
4832,"That's probably a problem, but same, every so often I'll stand up and my vision blacks out for a second."
4833,You monster ....
4834,Anwser for your sins
4835,"I’m part of long hair gang and let me tell ya

No you cannot, that hair’s going wherever it damn pleases and not a single force on God’s green earth can stop it"
4836,This is the funniest shit ever
4837,A flaw in this: If you're transferring lice in whipping me then why are you at school and whipping me
4838,U feel? I actually do
4839,"Oh shit sorry, I didn't realize it gets on people's papers when I do that! If you ask nicely she'll probably be a decent person and move her hair"
4840,"Hey, some people would pay to be whipped, you're lucky."
4841,Eat them bugs mate
4842,I hit myself in the face too sometimes lol (it do be hurtin when I get my ponytail in my eye)
4843,"I can add that it isn't just girls in the too-long-hair gang. I have, on multiple occasions, been told to stand a little further away because of the amount of times I've smacked people in the face with my hair."

4845,Jesus...
4846,Literally same! I fainted once and cracked my skull open. Nothing since then. No complaints missed a few shitty lessons

4849,"let her vent, dont focus on advice too much. spend a lot of time together, chocolate is always a good idea"
4850,"Several people have said that you should offer her snacks, particularly chocolate. Definitely do that. If you can, though, do it silently: break off a piece for yourself, eat it, then hold one out to her without saying anything. She's less likely to feel like a burden that way than if you directly ask ""hey, would you like some chocolate?"", in my experience.

If nothing else, *hug her,* that's very important. And don't be afraid to hug longer than a couple seconds if you think she needs it."
4851,"Like my people said, no poem, let her know you’re ready to listen and that you are not going anywhere, let her know she’s not alone"
4852,Hang out with her every once in a while. Maybe see a movie or go roller skating or just something that will let her know that you are there.
4853,"Yeah I agree no poem, she'll fall for you then (unless that's the goal lol) but just make sure you're there for her as you are and just be positive overall tbh"
4854,"I may get downvoted for this, but don't do what others say. 

Going through something hard isn't easy, but talking to her like you pity her is worse.

People don't like talking about hardships. Don't tell her that you're there for her, don't tell her that he was an asshole. Don't mention it unless she does.

Just be a good friend. Be yourself. The thing that has helped me the most through hardships—and others as well—is friendship. You don't have to go to giant lengths either, being your usual self is better."
4855,"Watch out though, no joke. She'll notice something. So, *space* ....okay?"
4856,I like this 🌸
4857,"Yeah. Low-pressure, she never has to act ""cheered-up"" for you, you know maybe a quick text with something ""this made me think of you, doing ok today?"" And let that be all or let her decide how much to talk :)"
4858,[removed]

4860,"So like you have to get her to talk about how she's feeling, although I think the majority of women tend to just brush off the fact that they're not okay and insist that everything's fine, so you might have to try a little harder.

Maybe get her to come to a more private area (maybe your or her house or somewhere outside of school that isn't completely packed) and just acknowledge the fact that you noticed she changed since all that happened, that you're worried about her and maybe ask if she wants to talk or needs help or anything.

Don't script it out, obviously, but I guess kinda something like that. I also would avoid asking ""Is everything alright?"" because obviously it's not and that might make you seem ignorant. Plus it gives her a chance to say everything IS fine when it most likely isn't.

Note: I am not a damn therapist and I don't talk about problems with my friends so if any of this is off please do correct me.

Good luck to you and your friend, and I hope she gets better!"

- Stares at you while you aren't looking directly at her, but can clearly still see her.
- You look at her, smile and she starts looking at the ground.
- You look away again, she starts looking again and smiling.
- Repeat till one of you has to go somewhere."

4898,"I think guys are trying to figure a girl out, so a glance takes longer for him. Now, if he's leering, staring and gross - making no attempt to hide his meaning: nah, bad signal, unless she likes it that way or from that kind of guy. 

Girls know how to gather every nuance at a glance."
4899,"Less than guys look at girls? If so, no. I’d imagine it’s fairly equal."
4900,"Firstly, I'm sure you're beautiful. 

Secondly, I don't personally look at someone for a long time because I don't want to seem creepy. Also, I don't want to get caught staring at them. 

I'm positive girls look at you too, though. You probably don't notice it because they're being sneaky, lol"
4901,"If i catched a girl staring, and looking away when I caught her, that would honestly make my day!"
4902,"Yeah, I don’t stare, that makes even me uncomfortable, but I frequently glance tho."
4903,girls just have the common sense to be subtle about it. guys stare straight on.
4904,Happened on the train a few times... it gets to a point where you feel very awkward after a while cause you know they're checking ya out but they're also looking away from you overtime you notice they are.

We never ended up together, but he became one of my closest friends."

a few months later he ended up telling a few of his friends that he was interested in me and i overheard. someone else told me that they heard it too. 

it’s been almost two weeks and i still don’t know what to do with this information lmao"
4961,"My current gf was dropping so many hints left and right. She told me I had pretty eyes, asked what I was attracted to, complained about not having a gf all the time, etc... we were also really touchy with eachother.

4985,Hang on who else has periods
4986,its referring to trans people
4987,Hormone blockers doesn't affect them?
4988,not all trans guys are on blockers/ testosterone
4989,honestly idc like it does not define who i am and if it helps trans people then who am i to judge lol
4990,"Gender dysphoria isn't a delusion. Also, even if you don't believe it's a thing, people being trans doesn't hurt you at all, so there's no reason for you to care."
4991,I don't care at all.
4992,"I don't care, as long as someone feels good about it, it's great!"
4993,"The whole thing is that a lot of FTM trans people (female to male) may be on hormones, but still get their periods because they haven't had a sex change operation. It can potentially cause dysphoria to buy pads marketed to women. By acknowledging that men can get periods too, trans men will feel validated and are more likely to buy those period products. It's good marketing."
4994,fair
4995,"Yes, they do if they are not on testosterone or on hormone blockers. But, in some cases even taking testosterone doesn’t completely stop periods from happening. Also please don’t call trans people trannys as it’s a slur."
4996,"I appreciate the branding thinx, for example, has done. Truthfully, inclusion is quite important and saying ""people with periods"" as opposed to ""women"" helps to not exclude trans men who have periods as well as women who don't have periods. Period doesn't really define womanhood, and I feel the idea that it does is quite toxic and can negatively affect trans or cis women who don't experience them. I like the neutral language. It's straightforward.

Edit: clarity"
4997,"Huh

And I’m sorry I didn’t know"
4998,"Fair enough. For those I lay my case, and all the support to them. :)"
4999,"Well the symbol doesnt benefit us and it might make trans people uncomfortable, so I'd get rid of it.  Not a huge deal tho."
5000,"That's true, but there are a lot of FTM guys who are still living with their families, often still underage, who's families do not support their transitions. Generally, in the US you can't get hormones till after 18 years old, so ftm teens will still have periods."
5001,I do not know
5002,wdym?
5003,"some trans men don't have access to hormone blockers due to transphobic parents/environment, money, etc. and some do! the ones with no access will still get their period and need pads/tampons."
5004,My friend who's trans does
5005,"I know gender dysphoria isn’t a delusion and I’m not in the least bit transphobic, but “not just women get their period” is the delusion I’m talking about. Trans people are smart enough to know biology."
5006,i thought people on testosterone don't get periods
5007,They do sometimes
5008,It’s okay! You didn’t know. At least you do know now.
5009,"It depends on their own body’s biology, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t."
5010,"honestly I don't care about it, if it makes people feel more comfortable then so be it and it's true not everyone who gets periods is a woman"
5011,idc about it
5012,exactly!
5013,My trans friend who was taking T still had his period for 18 months before getting surgery

I hope your mental health is okay, and that you don't take whatever any of those drama-inducing assholes said to heart. You were loved by the majority of people here, and rightly so.

He wore it to school a week later."

5222,I actually say that to my bf
5223,my ex and i broke up almost a year ago and it was just a few weeks ago when i gave him back his hoodie. none of us had brought it up and i hadn’t worn it since we broke up. i found it when i was cleaning so i asked him if he wanted me to clean it and give it back to him or throw it away. so i cleaned it and then put it in a bag and sat it on the porch and let him pick it up (because social distancing)

5226,"I would think approaching her in person or if you're really shy you can write a short note to her and pass to her after class with like some way to contact you for a response. it's a lot more genuine and shows that you're a guy with confidence and that you aren't just some nerd than if you choose to employ a wingman. and yea maybe keep it short and direct by telling her your name + how you know her, which traits of hers stand out to you (but not in a creepy way like going down to very specific details or being overly desperate) and invite her to hang out as like a study date or actual date outside of school. if she needs some time to think about it, just leave her with your number or smth and dont think too much of it or if you dont want to stay around to see her reaction just say what you need and give her you number and walk (not run) off with a non-abrupt ending like hope to hear from you soon. also wouldn't suggest giving her gifts when asking her out the first time because if she rejects its gonna he hella awkward. 


style yourself up a little by going online or getting friends' opinions on your outfits if you think that your appearance isnt the best because truthfully the first impression does matter and it comes in the from of how the person looks because people see you first before they even hear you (yea its shallow but looks do play a small part) 

and just to protect yourself, try not to expect the best response in case she rejects. good luck!"
5227,"That's weird that you still have groups like that. In my school, I hang out with a mixed group of people, some academically successful, some likes gaming, some likes anime, some likes sports etc. none of which I have any interest in, and we still get along really well. And by some I mean each one, there's only one person of each type."

And no, I'm sat nowhere near her"
5237,[deleted]
5238,"Most girls don't really care if you're a nerd anymore. What they do care about is you're personality. Be nice to her, and be willing to accept her as just a friend. Judging by the fact that you call the perfectly valid reason of ""I only like you as a friend"" an ""excuse"", I have a feeling you're not the best at accepting rejection. If you can't accept girls you like as just friends, you're not going to have much luck with getting girlfriends. 

Also, while looks aren't everything, you do need to at least try. It's one thing not being naturally handsome, it's another thing looking like you put no effort into your appearance again whatsoever. It's not much, just wash your face, shower regularly, wash your hair, wear clean clothes, the basics. There's a lot of boys who neglect even the basics. 

Also, while most girls don't mind nerds, a lot even prefer them, there are things that take it overboard. If she's not interested in the thing you're nerdy about, don't constantly talk about it. If she is interested in it but doesn't know as much about it as you, don't berate her for it. And if she does know as much or even more about the it than you, acknowledge that instead of pretending you know more about it than her because she's a girl. These are all traits that are common in nerds that girls (and most guys too) hate."
5239,This is true but theres still some division
5240,"> Haha no I know I'm not entitled to anything but it does annoy me when the friend clause is used when they dont like me because of my looks or my persona

Don't want to be that guy but this is a very weird way to look at it.

Attraction is very individual, ""friend clause"" isn't really a thing, because they might just not be into you romantically. Attraction isn't something you decide, it's something you just feel.

If they don't want to be your 'partner' because of looks or persona then that's not really a choice from them. They just don't like you *like that*.

I may have misinterpreted how you think but ""friend clause"" isn't an excuse. If you have feelings for someone and they don't have feelings back you can't really help that. If you aren't comfortable being friends with them anymore because of it that's on you. Not on them.

I don't write this to be rude. I just think your way of thinking here might be incorrect."

5244,What's up with all these incels. No you can't put a fixed value on the attractiveness of a person the perception of other people changes with interaction and time and preferences. Yeah a movie star can perhaps pe called objectively attractive and a disfigured burn victim may be objectively unattractive but as long as you're not at the ends of the spectrum you can't be classified in a fixed attractivenes category

5247,"It was a requirement for the team that we sit at the same table at lunch (both field hockey and softball coaches said that to us.) and we were just always around each other. Something about bonding, idk. I left that highschool for community college about a year ago. Outside of school I was never around classmates ever because I am usually at work or with my travel teammates. The teammates from outside of school don't give a single shit about grades, ""social status"", etc. However, because we are all trying to get into college we have some players who are really concerned with grades and have crazy GPAs that are around 4.6 or something. I didn't really want to hang out with those highschool idiots, but I didn't feel like arguing with them or the coaches either. Figured path of least resistance would be fine enough."

5250,"I mean obviously if you've got a good personality and are good looking, they'll still date you. It's just people wouldn't talk much or even be bothered actually trying to pursue them at all so you would never even be able to tell if they're even a cool person or not."
5251,"Haha no I know I'm not entitled to anything but it does annoy me when the friend clause is used when they dont like me because of my looks or my persona

Yeah,I mean itll be quite difficult because while we are in the same class, we are covering different topics, because they are a year ahead"
5252,"Yeah I know that'll make them interested in them. My point is that they wouldn't even care much about what they say or listen much if they've got a bad social status. Kinda the same way rich people wouldn't really listen to a poor person, even if they've got good reasons to speak to them. Same thing for guys as well, they wouldn't really talk to a girl if they're super unpopular because of all the negative stereotypes of being unpopular."
5253,"just try and talk to her? maybe make conversation in class. ask her a question like oh whats your major? she might seem perfect to listen to in class but who knows maybe if you get to talking she will turn out different. Maybe youll still like her. it takes time to get into a relationship, but the answer will always be no if you never try. Just start a conversation. I know small talk can be annoying but if you find you have similar interests switch to those topics instead of small talk. :) Good luck!
Also, It really depends on the girl about looks. Some girls dont really care and some do. From my experience I dont think I would want to date someone who cares so much about looks that they would refuse to date someone. I hope this helps! 
Youll meet lots of girls and people in college. Learning how to start conversations is good practice so just think of it as a trial run :p"
5254,"GO FOR IT. You never know if a girl is going to end up liking you or not, and there are a lot of girls out there, including myself, who love nerds! Just don’t try to impress her, because any time anyone attempts to do that, it always ends up flat on its face. I wish you the best of luck!"
5255,"I think it's funny, especially when I play an online game with strange lobbys. Boys some times act like a fool when they hear my voice lol."
5256,"Yeah I've never called anyone that unironically, I always just do it for the joke, even the girl only plays like puzzle games on her phone"
5257,It’s kind of pathetic. 100% brain computational power goes to the penis when they hear a girl online smh.
5258,"Yes exactly how I feel, i’m just trying to have fun and most of the time when im called that they are referring to Belle Delphine type of gamer girl"

5261,"I wouldn't consider myself a gamer girl allthough I do play some games, but no it doesn't bother me. 

But also when I hear gamer girl I think girl who wears no clothes and streams games but only gets views bc she's hot"
5262,"I guess it’s true but I really hate it due to the stigma around it. 
Whenever the term gamergirl comes up, dudes get super pissy about it like 

„OH YEA? UR A GAMERGIRL? WHAT GAMES DO YOU PLAY?!“

Then I tell them Overwatch and they interrupt me with:

„OVERWATCH SUCKS! YOURE NOT A GAMER IF YOU DONT OKAY THIS, THIS AND THIS“

Bro. I play everyday and I play a lot. That qualifies me enough, fuck off."
5263,Well there isn't exactly a stigma of guys only pretending to like cars to seem quirky to the girls who actually like cars
5264,~~hey man nothin wrong with belle delphine~~
5265,Yeah. No one calls them a “gamer boy” so why should attention be drawn to the fact that I’m a girl?

5268,"Oh I'm aware that it's a thing, but I'm saying it hasn't been the butt of so many jokes that the term car guy is first associated with a dumb hot jock pretending to know about cars."

5283,"cause there's really no stigma attached to car guys lol

gamer girl has a bunch of different implications now"
5284,No but I don't feel like I game enough to be called that
5285,"Me. I live close to school, but I'm a pretty quiet person, and people hence rarely ever ask me to hang out with them. Plus my parents are strict, and they don't let me hang out, or go to someone else's house.

So school is mostly my only source of social interaction. That's why I love school most of the time. Even if people don't really talk to me a lot, there are a select few I talk to, and I just love to people watch, and observe how happy the other kids are at the moment. It's nice."
5286,45 minutes is fucking a lot coming from someone who takes 30 to get to school and it’s still an anomaly here
5287,"45 minutes is nothing though and that's coming from someone who lives in a smol country. I travel 45 minutes to get to school every day. I can't drive until I'm 18 though, it's like 20 minutes by car."
5288,"Me! I never go out, I have real friends but I can’t see them in real life because even though we don’t live that far away from each other, the way to each other’s houses it’s saturated with traffic so we can’t walk and our parents work full time so they can’t take us either."
5289,A virtual hug
5290,"Me :(. I travel like 1 hr 30 mins to get to my school, and  my friends travel like the same amount but from the other direction so we barely ever hang out :("
5291,"Yeah, I'm getting to that point again, cause I want to hang out with the friends I don't have contacts with."
5292,relatability
5293,Yeah I live like an hour from my school. I've managed to find a new friend group that lives near me though through work so that good. Just kinda awkward when they have parties and stuff and litterally everyone there goes to the same school apart from me haha
5294,*Laughs at one hour and a half*
5295,....I believe you missed the point
5296,i’m not that isolated bc i know lots of people and my friend groups got about 8 people in it BUT we all live scattered about the town/suburbs but not close enough to walk and our buses is shite except 1 so it’s hard to see them outside of school yk :(
5297,"i don’t go to football games, i’m not in any sports, and i have one irl friend. i’m almost completely isolated :("
5298,Relatable
5299,Aww
5300,Ya I'm at 50 to 70 minutes depending on who's driving
5301,"I bike like 3.5 k and it takes 5 or 10 mintues haha, I would hate long trips to and from school"
5302,I'm socially isolated everywhere
5303,"I go to online school so I'm practically always socially isolated. The only time I talk to people other than my family is when I call 2 of my friends to play Minecraft on most weekends, but besides that I don't see or talk to anyone."
5304,"my parents are really strict and it's so annoying to make plans so i don't really hang out with people. i only go out like once a week.

most people have figured out i'm a really bad texter haha"
5305,"I usually talk and interact with people at school yeah, it’s become my happy place in that sense. I’ve got two good friends, one is my classmate that I hang out with after school, going to the mall or sumn but other than that we don’t meet up or anything. The other friend is my former classmate from my old school that I meet up with once or twice a month and go to the cinema/mall with but other than that I’ve got nobody. 
When I was little(6-11?) I had a best friend that lived two floors above me in our apartment building and we’d hang out daily. Since I never really “needed” to find any other friends other than her, once I moved from that place I didn’t have anyone and no social skills to make any.
I dread summer holidays and get really depressed/sad during them since I have no social interaction with anyone :(
This is even more amplified now that this spring I’ll be graduating mandatory/primary school(grades 1-9/ages 7-16) and people I’ve spent the past 4 years(since I moved schools) with almost every day are all going away to different schools and I have nobody and it’s just so damn dreadful.
I get too attached to people who don’t give a second thought to me."
5306,"i am a 10nminute walk from my school, and my parents are very very strict and if i didnt have social media that they dont know about on the side, i would have no friends"
5307,"Lol same

I switched schools from the one I graduated from in my town to get a better one which is far away.

It'd be a 45minutes drive with the car but via bus and train it takes 2 - 2 1/2 hours to get there.
I wake up at 4:45 am and come home at 5:15pm everyeay just to get my degree. 
One of my classmates is actually 120km away from me because she also has to travel 1 1/2 hour but in the other direction.

So yes, I've met new friends and my class is wonderful but I can't meet any of them because I can't drive and the nearest person is 23km away."

5313,"well I do talk to my in real life friends outside but it is not a lot compared to how much I talk to my online friends, I don't really see the point as I see my in real life friends 5 days a week for like 7 hours anyways"
5314,No not really but I know people who are like that.
5315,this is to smart sounding for me but greatly appreciated
5316,yeah it just happens sometimes
5317,"I sometimes hear it.

It usually gets a little loud."
5318,i feel like it’s louder the closer to walls you get
5319,"ohh yes, that happens to me as well"
5320,occasionally and it's so annoying
5321,"the only reason i’d believe it’d be tinnitus is if you were listening to things really loudly often. aka having incredibly loud speakers play all the time, playing music with earbuds at max volume, etc. 

scientifically, our ears can develop damage at around 85db and higher. a loud metal concert is gonna be between 110 and 120 db. generally speaking, about 10db is “double the volume” with our perceived loudness. this also all depends on how long you’re listening to audio at that level. generally speaking, every 10db increase after 85db is halving the amount of time you can listen without having to take a break. i cant remember the specifics but basically if you’re wearing any ear protection over those levels you’re gonna be fine. also it’s quite rare we actually hear anything going into our ears at 85+ db so don’t worry too much about it. people our age don’t have to worry too much about tinnitus (*although it can still happen*), you just have to not be too stupid with how you’re listening to your music pretty much. headphones/earbuds at high volumes can impact your ears health a lot more than speakers as they’re a lot closer to your ears

tldr don’t play things at max volume and wear ear protection at loud concerts and you won’t need to worry about tinnitus

edit: also some poorly wired electronics can make high pitched noise sometimes. i know cus i have an shitty charger that makes a relatively quiet high pitched tone whenever my phone isn’t plugged in."
5322,No I dont think so
5323,it’s the earth’s hum
5324,yeah but i hear it when i’m outside too. even though it’s never completely silent outdoors
5325,Yeah I hate it. It also happens when I stand up
5326,it really is
5327,"if so, that might be why it's loud for me. i'm always next to a wall"
5328,"It might be an appliance in your house, my fridge sometimes makes that noise."
5329,"Yeah, happens sometimes"
5330,Yeah same but sometimes the tone can be different pitches
5331,You might wanna get that checked out then.
5332,"“The symptoms of tinnitus include a noise in the ears, such as ringing, roaring, buzzing, hissing, or whistling; the noise may be intermittent or continuous. Most of the time, only the person who has tinnitus can hear it (subjective tinnitus).”

sounds about right.

5338,i won’t be seeing a doc for a while but i’ll try my best lol
5339,it’s not a constant thing because i’m always listening to music and my family and school are pretty loud. it’s not really annoying it’s just *there*
5340,"Yeah me too. 

I think it's tinnitus. I never experienced true silence in my entire life ;-;"
5341,Yeah if there’s little noise in the background I can hear it
5342,yeah i got that recently and realised i hadn't experienced it for like 2 years so thats annoying

5385,"Every single time I've ever got remotely close with a girl, it's always failed at the worst possible time for my emotions. This has happened 3 times now.

First girl? I accidentally left do not disturb on the day after the closest conversation we'd had, the resulting conservation didn't go so well on my end and killed the giant crush she had on me entirely.

Second girl? We actually became a thing but she got really clingy and absolutely flipped out when I left her on read once. Didn't know how to respond and messed things up.

Aaand girl number 3. After a day where we'd talked for like 6 damn hours, enough that I was sure she liked me, she disappeared from discord for 2 weeks and it turned out the reason why was because she was doing a musicals marathon. That killed any hope I had of her liking me with that order of prioritisation.

I think it's a good thing that I realised I don't want commitment anyway, because I wouldn't be able to deal with much more of this."
5386,Bruh. Same. My mum was also an elite track runner and my dad almost went pro in football.
5387,Tbh STDs can be transmitted in a fuck load of ways other than just sex. You can get aids from someone's blood for example so I don't see why we call them STDs instead of simply desieses.

5397,"Are you talking about mono?

EDIT: not sure how I missed that part of the description.

Also, the reason I was confused is because this doesn’t sound like mono due to the fact that you keep referring to it as an STD. 

Mono is not usually referred to as an STD. Sometimes it’s called the kissing disease, but you can get mono from drinking out of a public water fountain. Mono can pass through bodily fluids (including saliva) which includes a lot more things than just sexual Intercourse, (BUT STDs do have transmissions besides sex). The common cold could be spread through sexual activity, that doesn’t make it an STD."

Darth Plageuis was a dark lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise that he could use the Force to influence the midichlorisns to create...life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, but eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, and then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death but not himself."

5463,How did you find out?
5464,There’s no bedtime if you don’t sleep. Big brain time.
5465,99% of the memes were made in people’s head not from there experiences
5466,"I don’t know why I hate them but I do. Just like 

“Girls locker room: Omg Jenny look at my bra” (who the fuck does that)

“Boys locker room: *Random thing*”"
5467,"What if I told you that I walked into the wrong locker room and the girls were just casually chatting, I ran out and into the right one, and there were two dudes in boxers imitating gay sex while getting whipped with towels? Cause that was actually happening"
5468,"I do sometimes find good ones tho:

“Girls locker room: Omg Jenny Brian was so hot today and omg like gym sucks and lol omg

Girls: Why is the locker room talking?”"
5469,"It'll be something like:

Girls wearing the same clothes: Hey what the fuck Stephanie, we're not friends anymore

Boys wearing the same clothes: *picture of two movie/videogame/etc. characters wearing similar clothes*"
5470,I hate those memes
5471,"Absolutely. Its like the I'm not like other girls thing,, to feel superior over other people..."
5472,"oh those. I usually just see the locker room ones. but I don't think those memes are for girls ""to be put in their place"" or to say that boys are better than girls."
5473,"I know right, its so stupid"
5474,It’s just that most of the people who make those memes are frustratingly oblivious to why girls don’t like them and will tell us to take a joke if we object to being called boring.
5475,"That’s why I said 99% of the time, it’s times like that which are the exceptions"
5476,I absolutely hate them
5477,"I think it's a bit overkill when girls act like they're being oppressed by these memes, because comedy is subjective, and these memes aren't being made just to be sexist, but I will say that as a girl, it's really disheartening to see those memes all of the time. I'm pretty rowdy and tomboyish, so I relate to a lot of the things on the guys side, and I feel really unincluded. I'm not saying everyone needs to be included all of the time, but there's a reason why r/teenagers has so few girls and r/feemagers is so popular with girls...

TL;DR I dislike them, but I'm not offended by them."
5478,You a 40 year old woman on a teen girl subreddit. I'm not surprised your tried of it and it's kinda weird your here
5479,Hah that is funny
5480,can you give me an example of one of these? I've never seen them so I don't really know what you're all talking about.
5481,Eh I don't mind them. They're just jokes based on stereotypes and sometimes they're pretty accurate
5482,"Yeah, and there's definitely some truth to the locker room ones, but I'd much rather having a 'boring' locker room tbh"
5483,They’re annoying and unfunny yes
5484,It is a real sub you just linked it
5485,But did they have the secks?
5486,"Very fucking tired. especially if a female made the same joke a male would, people would comment, “that’s not funny” but laugh at it when the male makes it."
5487,the only funny thing about them is that the Redditors who make them wonder why they don't have girlfriends
5488,"They are not funny anymore. They were funny but now they are just ""boys cool girls boring and don't do anything"""
5489,This is why most of my good friends are girls.
5490,That is most definitely not an exception. Shit like that happens like every day
5491,"they're only popular because most of the people on reddit are boys that don't know how to talk to girls, especially on r/teenagers"
5492,"Yes, I dislike them quite a bit. I have started seeing them come back on r/dankmemes and r/memes and have decided to leave. I go to those subreddits to laugh, not feel excluded. I don't usually want to say anything about it because I don't want to look like a butthurt feminist. I have seen other people in the comments get a bit irritated at these memes and get downvoted a good bit, so definitely not a place that I feel welcome anymore."
5493,"Like I said, frustratingly oblivious."
5494,"Thanks, I didn't get the notification"
5495,Ok that’s a bit reassuring :)
5496,"Not even gonna lie. If they’re cute, I feel flattered for the first three seconds and then worry that *THERES SOMETHING ON MY FACE OTHERWISE WHY WOULD HE LOOK AT ME* and if it’s an ugly dude... sorry guys... it’s kinda creepy.

Ok so edit: I’m really just talking about personal experience, the ugly guys tend to also look at you with a more serial killer type look. Not saying that people who are less attractive in general do this, but just out of my own experience, it’s a tad more creepy. P.S: it’s always adorable when you blush/awkwardly look away if we see you"
5497,I think I'm creepy then. I can nearly only look angry when I'm not.
5498,The truth sucks sometimes 🤧🤧 but you're right
5499,What about that guys stare leaves you uncomfortable? I’m asking because I wanna make sure I don’t make anyone uncomfortable
5500,[removed]
5501,Depends on the look on you face and where you're staring. Do you have a vacant/spaced out look or are you looking at her like a piece of meat while licking your lips? Are you looking at her eyes/most of her face? Or her chest or lips or something else that's way too sexualized? It also kinda just depends on who the person is tbh.
5502,Name checks out
5503,I care too little about a relationship to be an incel but ngl the basis of their ideology is somewhat factual. They go way too far with it tho.
5504,Yeah I understand that. Let’s say you’re “average” is that creepy or alright?
5505,Probably because he's ugly tbh
5506,How about contemplating? I feel sometimes I think about something and I for some reason space out while looking at them.
5507,but how do we know we're ugly
5508,Honestly depends on the guy but I'd probably brush it off and think you were just staring into space unless you've given me reasons to feel uncomfortable by it.
5509,if I think he's cute I'd stare back.
5510,You don’t. No one does. Including girls. If you know and brag that you’re pretty/cute you’re most likely a slut or a fuckboy.
5511,"I think it depends on what the girls preferences are. Just because you're not one girls type/unattractive to them, doesn't mean that all girls think that. I personally just wouldn't stare at anyone I haven't talked to/don't know, cause staring at people you don't know will most likely come off as creepy"
5512,"Your comment currently has 50 karma, certainly a popular belief.

At the risk of getting heavily downvoted, I think this goes to show that girls should be more careful when making accusations of any sort of sexual misconduct. 

If a guy did something to you that made you feel uncomfortable, ask yourself if you would still feel uncomfortable if a guy you liked did that to you. If so, then yeah what he did may have been wrong. If not, then it goes to show that your true grievance is not with the action itself, but the person doing it. It's ok to be attracted or not attracted to anyone, but no one deserves to be punished on the basis of that."
5513,"If hes glaring, I glare back. If hes giving me a weird look, I just kinda give him a confused look. If hes zoning out or just kinda looking at me I brush it off."
5514,Not really
5515,[removed]
5516,Sounds like you like her. Most girls get different feelings as we get different vibes from people. It totally depends on her to think about what it means. Some might think you're a weirdo and some may find it flattering. Try and make friends with this girl and see how she reacts to your presence. If she's noticed her behaviour will show you of she likes it or not. Hope this helps.
5517,"I do kinda like her, and I know she doesn’t hate my presence so idk. Also she’s just kinda in a spot where it’s easy to space out in her direction lmao. Thanks for answering though!!"
5518,It really doesnt matter if you are handsome or not. If you glance too much its creepy. Just once or twice is fine.
5519,As much as I want to defend my motherland here- I fail to do so.
5520,Honestly she probably doesn’t even notice. I definitely wouldn’t
5521,I don't think you understand what incel means...

The point was that she groped you without your consent, if I were you I would’ve slapped the hell out of her.

It could just be me or you have some serious restraint."
5541,Pics or didn't happen
5542,what 👁👄👁
5543,not the first time i’ve heard that
5544,"Yea, but usually they hide looking a little better"
5545,I looked back she was hot but still I just wanted to get some food
5546,Nope. Though my ass is kinda juicy
5547,[deleted]
5548,"Is it an attraction thing, or just for the hell of it?"
5549,You speak the true true
5550,Fucks sake kwortzz calm down mate
5551,Both I think
5552,Oh damn. Cos I think I’ve got mad cake.
5553,i mean personally i would flip out of someone groped me but you do you i guess
5554,Most fun the old man ever had in years
5555,"That doesn't help for me, it only increases the pain."
5556,"Yes! When i dont eat for too long the pain stops me from eating, it sucks when it happens"
5557,"Yessir all the time

Especially now that i sleep til 15:00"
5558,Yeah it sucks
5559,People who haven't experienced it don't understand the struggle. I usually start by eating a small snack or something light
5560,Yeah
5561,"Me too, but after some time the pain goes away and I'm also not hungry anymore."
5562,"aight ""yes m'lady"" it is full nice-guy mode

but today i pulled an all nighter so i didn't even have a chance to wake up"
5563,"But like Yessir rolls off the tongue better than yes'm

I could keep using yuh or yup but yessir is much better"
5564,"Yup. Water sure helps, though. Most of the time, I just eat despite the pain."
5565,"Nah, I just eat"
5566,"only till 3? pfffft, amateur 

also female equivalent of yessir = yes’m i think"
5567,"I don't remember happening that to me. 

I keep stuffing after regular intervals. 

Lol"
5568,Guess i’ll die
5569,"Sometimes, but that doesn’t happen a lot"
5570,Drink water. Eat a Cyclopam if required
5571,"omg i literally have this all the time, for me eating fruit or something refreshing helps!!"
5572,Yes. I'm known to Not eat for days in end and that is why.
5573,yes :(
5574,Too often
5575,Usually if I’ve got bad period cramps I can’t tell the difference between cramps and hunger so I can’t eat because it could make the cramps worse but I need to eat otherwise the hunger could get worse
5576,No just eat. The pain is from lack of eating
5577,Yes
5578,Yea and if you eat something it will get 10x worse
5579,Me all the time
5580,Yes I have pms
5581,Sip it slowly

5585,I had to call my bank recently and holy shit the pressure.
5586,"Days? Not really, probably like an hour or so"
5587,Ik my mom made me make a doctors and hair appointment and my anxiety was through the roof

5589,LMAOO I have never done this but niceeee trick
5590,See I got the big brain solution of just not getting takeout and making some shitty ass thing at home instead
5591,"no i just order what i do every time

or just order what a friends ordering if i havent been there before"
5592,Lol yeah i order what my friends get when I’m put on the spot
5593,not DAYS but certainly repeat the order in my head only to fuck it up anyways
5594,I’m 100% gonna fuck this up today
5595,idk if I’m confident enough for that 🥴
5596,I know what I like and don’t like. I can usually eliminate a good bit of options at any given restaurant
5597,"Yes, same with every other human interaction I have to do

That's a big mood"
5598,"Lol, i messed up for the first 2 weeks"
5599,"no, i sadly dont order food"
5600,"Um, no. I don't have any sort of anxiety, and talking to people is easy peezy to me, and ordering from a menu is no different"
5601,imagine going to restaurants
5602,Yeah and that’s why I go to buffet restaurants
5603,I get anxious even when the waiters asks if I want soda or water
5604,"Yes, but not days before. Maybe a few hours before or on the car ride there. I pick 3 meals in case something isn’t available. I also make a script if I have to talk to someone on the phone❤️"

5606,social anxiety + ed tingz ✨❤️

5612,Uhhhh no but you do you
5613,"i do that everytime

its just called being efficient"
5614,Nah that’s too much work
5615,"Damn bro, can’t you just use your oreo powers to outrun it? 🙄"
5616,Only if they continue to follow me
5617,One time a car was following me and I stopped and he stopped and I kinda stared at the driver for a lil bit and it worked so I would recommend
5618,I'm only scared when there aren't other people around
5619,"I’ll keep that in mind, thanks"
5620,"If I don’t know them or why they’re following me, I’ll feel threatened"
5621,"If it's at night and I'm alone, yes."
5622,"No, I don't really go walking since I can drive and if I do have to walk somewhere it's usually during the day on a busy street or in my own little circle of a neighborhood

Edit: I'm still constantly prepared to unleash hell and run if I need to"
5623,I ripped someones mirror off for doing that to me. I hate creeps.
5624,"""Oh no, why's this dude walking faster?!"""
5625,"If I see someone else out at night, I get spooked"
5626,What if they are just headed in the same direction?
5627,It could just be me. I’m very paranoid
5628,Lmao when I see there is a girl infront of me at night I try walking past her so it's not creepy
5629,Who said anything about following? More often than not they're just going the same direction as you.
5630,That was unexpected
5631,"Yo dude, you’ve been angrily replying to many  of the answers that girls are giving. You seem to be angry that they feel anxious when there’s a dude walking behind them, which is a perfectly reasonable feeling to have in this day and age. There are waaay too many kidnappings and/or rapings of women and girls and it’s very common and smart for girls to be taught to be a bit on edge if there’s anyone walking behind you or near you, especially when you don’t have a consistent view of the person."
5632,yea
5633,"Who? Guys?? They've done some shit to me. Maybe not the ones that are directly behind me, but it still makes me anxious."
5634,"Are you conflating someone being scared of all black people to me, a teen girl, getting a *little* anxious when I'm alone outside at night and a grown man is behind me? No, I am not scared of all men, but in certain circumstances, I'm allowed to be a little anxious."
5635,"1. The same applies to when there are boys walking behind them.

2. Any number of kidnappings is too many kidnappings. 
-“nearly 800,000 children are reported missing each year. That's more than 2,000 a day.“ from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

Yes it’s very common for rape to occur with both genders. That’s true. But that’s not what the point is. The point is that girls are societally taught to be careful because of rape, muggings, and kidnappings. This is why they feel anxious. So there’s no reason to be angry about it."
5636,"It’s definitely not just you. Also, it’s good to be paranoid, it’s a scary world out there."
5637,I was mainly referring to grown men or older teenager boys. I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear.
5638,only if i get that feeling that somethings wrong
5639,"I don't walk alone at night lol but sometimes if I'm alone running in a more wooded area I get a little freaked out. It's never been a real problem and I do rationalize it in my head but I always have that little voice in the back of my head going what if, what if, so I try to minimize the time I spend there"
5640,Then don't say it. I simply answered the question with how I feel. I apologize that I offended you.
5641,Yes
5642,Omg ikr! I had short hair for a couple years before puberty and I played with a group of boys. It was kinda fun correcting people.
5643,you ripped someone's mirror off for staring at you while you were following them in your car?
5644,"I dont really trust anyone when I'm walking outside at night. I always keep a pocket knife with me, regardless if its male or female"
5645,"Okay so here’s my guide:

Slim build:
Skinny jeans, slim cut shirts, grey sweatpants athletic cut, button up shirts, layering, oversized sweaters
   
Bulky (like wrestler athletic):
Looser jeans, any shirts if you have nice arms go for ones tight on the arms, sweatpants same style, sweaters
  
Chubby:
Jeans, looser shirts, sweaters with cute patterns, khakis, more put together looks
     
That’s just from my experience seeing what looks good on people I know."
5646,Uhhhh
5647,18+: naked. Police will be all over you in minutes 😎 Pinning you on their car and everything
5648,"Well, a good dressing sense is personally always more attractive to me. But thats your choice."
5649,"Look at her flair man, I think you'd better listen"
5650,I mean who wouldn't?
5651,"Alternate between jeans, khakis and no pants, like me. Cuz you no I got game"
5652,i don’t care what is around the ass i just care about the ass so to me it doesn’t matter
5653,ברוך אתה ה' אלוהינו מלך העולם אשר קדשנו במצוותיו וציוונו ללכת עם ג'ינס לבית הספר
5654,Ok minecraft enchanter
5655,"Well it's a matter of taste, but I would steer clear of sweatpants. Basketball shorts are only acceptable if you are actually going to be playing basketball imo. But to be fair that's just me really"
5656,username checks out.
5657,Bruh if you keep dissing me imma give you smite
5658,Depending on the weather sweat pants or basketball shorts.

5661,"Most girls dont care about that, but i personally like to see when guys dress up"
5662,Get a hotdog costume
5663,"Nah dude, I can tell you as long as you're clean and don't smell, personally I don't really care what your wearing, as long as it's not weird/inappropriate. I think sweatpants are fine, my boyfriend wears then often and personally I think it's pretty cute"
5664,"they'll even handcuff you, kinky"
5665,I might
5666,"Depends on where you live, you can probably get away with it in many european countries"
5667,"Well I guess they just seem almost, I wanna say slobbish, but it depends on the individual case. Some people can look pretty smexy in sweatpants, but it's not so easy. (This does kinda goes for all clothes, but especially for sweatpants.) Since they're mostly worn at home it kinda seems like you didn't bother to tidy up your appearance. Also they aren't flattering unless you're already hot af. Did I miss anything?

But I like the song."
5668,I don’t understand what’s bad about sweat pants tho
5669,Actually it's Jeans jeans khakis Jean's khakis khakis followed by three days of fasting and reciting ancient Germananic war cries followed up with a recession of the entire book of genesis in Hebrew afterwards (wearing the ceremonial headgear of course) ask out your crush she will promptly fall into your arms
5670,"Its cause the mods(nothing personal) remove unflaired comments instead of warning or helping the unflaired person, probably"
5671,"Does this work? I’m a slim/athletic build. Skinny jeans. Basketball hoodie, sneakers"
5672,There are some warm jeans out there you just gotta check them inside. If there is this sort of dark blue material in there then it is made for winter and is warm. If it looks the kinds the same on the inside as outside its more made for warmer weather
5673,Why reciting in Hebrew is important?
5674,"Yeah absolutely! Consider branching out and getting some more statement hoodies. Like a thrasher or a Teddy Fresh. Just to spice things up. Also when getting sneakers remember to consider what type, don’t ever get sketchers, and stay away from chunky styles. Air Force 1s are really in style rn, and look nice."

5766,"""So, are you dating anyone right now?""
""Do you have a boyfriend?"" You could also ask one of her friends if she's single"
5767,Also keep in mind as a girl i ask because i love hearing about people's relationships. Asking if you're dating is not equal to interest. Don't assume it always is either.
5768,[deleted]
5769,Do you have a boyfriend?
5770,Just ask “do you have a boyfriend” or “are you dating anyone?” Keep it simple and low key. If she does have one then she will just tell you and that will be that. Simple
5771,It's different if it's a guy or girl asking though.
5772,"I don't know, do I?"
5773,Oh god are you a teacher
5774,? None of the contexts given here are creepy though?
5775,"Now always lmao. I've thought I've been like actually talking to this girl for the past like 2 weeks n I though it was goin good n she told me she was single, then yesterday she posted on snap happy 1 month with this dude that she told me was her online bestfriend lol"
5776,"Rather than ask her straight out, maybe make a comment that assumes she has one? Maybe if she was talking about a movie she saw, or going to the mall you could say ""oh, were you there with your boyfriend?"" If she's single, she'll think it was an honest mistake and correct you. Easy way to get your answer without making her uncomfortable or suspicious."
5777,Do we have a boyfriend?
5778,Straight up asking a girl if she's single out of the blue sends a somewhat clear message
5779,We do have a boyfriend

5786,"Certainly not as clear as asking her out, but I wouldn't go asking a girl if she's single and expect her to not realize I fancy her"
5787,"Then looking / being a dick then. Used the wrong example, sorry."
5788,Just try to ask her put if you're too nervous to do it irl txt her or slide in her dms start a convo and just do it don't beat around the bush too much
5789,Big oof
5790,"Exactly. I tried that business twice and it ended up pretty shitty both times. Leave out the not looking for a relationship part, and that tends to work pretty good."
5791,"How do you mean? Sorry, I don't understand where the person is being a dick, imo asking out of pure interest in a relationship (without caring to hear more about their current relationship) is fine. But I may have just misunderstood what you were  saying."
5792,Removed. Rule 5
5793,"No worries, as far as I can tell, we basically agree."
5794,just ask. i'd be really flattered.
5795,"It was just a dark pic of light the wall or some shit, she sent it at 1 AM, so it was night time"
5796,Maybe she meant to send it as a streaks pic.
5797,"Thats the thing, we were talking, and she kind of just interrupted the flow of things. I don't know if this is a sign to tell me to stop texting her or if she wants me to keep talking, I'm just not sure."
5798,Just ask her why she sent that
5799,Bruh she’s a human being treat her like one and if you always try to please her she’ll never really know who you are
5800,That’s a streak lol
5801,I don’t see why she’d be annoyed by that
5802,Ding ding ding
5803,Do you think she will be annoyed by that?
5804,isnt that a streak picture? idk when people normally send atreaks to me its judt a picture wih no words
5805,"I guess so. Im a dumbass, so can you help me with my phrasing of this text?"
5806,## bruh 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
5807,Just talk to her the way you talk to your friends dude. You’re putting her on a throne. Don’t do that. You’re overthinking
5808,"Im just trying to not piss her off. Im not good at talking to girls, so I was just looking for advice on how to phrase things"
5809,"That’s just snapping lol. Most of the time it’s just snapping pictures of your face or wall or whatever you want back and forth. It’s a good spot to be, just make sure you still talk.

Try to not leave her on open, it’s likely that she’ll notice and wonder why"
5810,"Oh ok I see now. I'm kinda confused as to why she would send a random picture, but as long as your conversation was ok I wouldn't think anything of it."
5811,"Thered this thing on snapchat where if you and a friend send atleast one snap a piece everyday you will start a streaks of snaps

Maybe people will either do just blank picture, the letter S drawn out, the letter s in text, or ""Streaks"" in text."
5812,Texts don’t count as streaks on sc
5813,What's a streak pic?
5814,"Just be like “lmao what’s that?” It shows that you’re interested, but very confused as to why there’s a blank image there."
5815,"uuuhh, send one back"
5816,"Probably a dry texter. Sometimes people (especially us teens) do this stuff when they have no idea what to say and suck at expressing that in a normal and understandable way. Really, if she does this repeatedly, says stuff like ""ok"" ""yeah"" ""mhm"" and ""lol"" alot, as one message, as well as contributing little to nothing to conversation, i would consider dropping her as your crush. You probably don't want to be the only one having something to say. 

Also, keep in mind if all she wants to talk about is herself. Even if you don't mind, if she doesn't show any real interest in your hobbies its usually a self centered tendency that most teens have :)"
5817,I'd just send back a question mark tbh
5818,Yes! I’ve never dated someone who I thought I couldn’t talk to genuinely. We want to know you like us and view us as close. We’re humans just like you dude
5819,"Maybe it was an accidental snap, but good conversation material."
5820,"It's a sign that she has nothing to say to you and should be interpreted as a sign of war. Prepare your armies.


#**/s**"
5821,"

Nah, he said a streak wouldn’t be necessary if they were already in a conversation. The problem is that it *would* be necessary because texts don’t count towards your streak"
5822,Also to add to this. If you feel like you have to hold the conversation bring it up to them first then make your decision. Communication is important for both sides.
5823,If shes really annoyed by that then gtfo and stop persuing them
5824,"he’s not talking about texts, he’s talking about a picture with the caption streaks. thats how most people do streaks"
5825,"- Cutesy Good morning & Good night texts, shows you're thinking about them.

- I know you said she isn't materialistic, but sometimes surprising someone with flowers or a card or surprise date can be sweet.

- Listen to her. Seems obvious, but really listen to her. Remember the small things to bring up later if it's appropriate, it shows you care enough to actually remember and listen to what they have to say.

- Be supportive and encouraging overall. 

- Talk. Again, I know it seems obvious but those late night deep conversations can bring you so much closer to somebody.

- If you've said I love you already, tell her that daily as well. 

I have little dating experience so take what I say with a grain of salt, but these things would personally make me feel loved and cared about."
5826,Hmmm have I or have I not turned 18 yet?
5827,lol that'd be funny if it was!
5828,I appreciate it dude. Dudette. Whatever you are.
5829,"Dudette, and no problem."
5830,"All of the above comments are great, but I’d also like to add that you could ask her what her main love language(s) are. [This](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/teens/)  is a good start if you two aren’t sure exactly what that is. 

Best of luck!"
5831,"Sometimes I do, but I can’t really just go ahead and say that all the time in the halls at school."
5832,Just tell her you love her
5833,"Wait, are you joking or being snarky?"
5834,"I honestly agree with you 100% I've been with my gf for 8 months now and of these are such good ways of making it stronger. Especially the daily I love you and the late night chats, they seriously strengthen your rations hip sm more because people get more emotional at night so they're willing to open up alot more to you"
5835,Dudette.
5836,"She doesn't have to be materialistic to absolutely adore small thoughtful gifts, for example little teddy bear or something cute"
5837,'d be cute too
5838,"thanks very much. I have heard about this, but I’ve never actually taken this, and I don’t think she has either."
5839,"yeah that’s mostly where I do say it, because we can’t find time to go out a lot and the aforementioned in-school problem."
5840,"I don’t know, maybe I’m just too embarrassed or afraid I’ll embarrass her or come across as annoying idk dude. Maybe I should."
5841,"Find out her love language! For some people, touching just isn’t it. I heard there was a website where you could take a test and figure it out. I would communicate to her and ask what she prefers to start though


Edit: just checked the comments and someone beat me to it hahaha"
5842,You can always text her
5843,"Tell her you love her, give her compliments, write her cute notes (i know you said she wasn’t materialistic but making sure she knows you care and think about her is very important)."
5844,"It’s really just a good tool to see what she would appreciate. To be honest, it’s not too different from asking her yourself - the only reason I recommend it is because this usually isn’t something one has figured out without prior exposure."
5845,Yep. The late night chats are basically why we got together.
5846,[deleted]
5847,"I mean if she allows you to give her hugs, maybe give her a kiss on the head or on the cheek to make her lest uncomfortable. But maybe ask first?"
5848,Yeah someone else actually linked it earlier. It’s a good suggestion.
5849,"Telling her she’s cute/pretty, going out of your way for her, showing her you pay attention (f.e. bringing her her favourite candy once), sending her cat pictures (if she loves cats ofcourse, otherwise send her pics of her favourite animal), do sweet thinks like make her tea when she’s not feeling well"
5850,I’ve considered it. Maybe I will.
5851,Long conversations and just tell her you love her as often as you can
5852,Bake her her favourite baked good
5853,Compliments
5854,Love languages. Look it up  and figure out hers.
5855,"I doubt she’ll break up but 7th grade and sophomore is too much, i don’t understand why he would even want to date her"
5856,"i agree, you cant blame op for being uncomfortable with it but there is also little she can do"
5857,I was 13 when i first started dating my ex who was 15... we were together for 3 years before we broke up because we grew apart. The age gap was never a problem. I say you should leave them alone and if it doesnt work out then it doesnt work out. I think the only reason you should interfere is if clearly the relationship is toxic.
5858,[deleted]
5859,"I don’t remember what I got it from but I follow a rule when it comes to age gaps. Take the age you are, divide in half and add 7. That’s the youngest you should date. It’s always worked for me and in this case it’s with the 15 yo and the 13 yo it’s wrong. At least in my opinion"
5860,"I know that a two year age gap isn't too bad, but just remember to teach her to be careful in that relationship and everything."
5861,[deleted]
5862,"Never thought that much of the parks and rec thing, but damn it makes a lot of sense now that I do think about it."
5863,"Yeah like I can see a 13 yo girl who looks her age dating a 15 yo boy who looks his age.

But in this case OP said that she looks prepubescent while the dude looks almost 18. That's not okay."
5864,"It’s not the age gap, it’s more than grade level difference and the maturity. I’d talk to your sister about how you’re worried, but she may get defensive."
5865,The 2 age difference wasn't weird until you said a sophomore was dating an 8th grader. Over here that's looked down upon
5866,why are we judging ages by how they look though?
5867,Well just means a 57 year old is mature enough to make the decision to date a 100 year old
5868,"I feel like that's not applicable for people under 16-17 though. Because using that rule, the youngest a 15 year old can date is 14.5. Idk for sure about others, but I think most would agree with me that a 15 year old dating a 14 year old isn't a problem. They could literally be in the same grade."
5869,thats different with adults its more about the percentage
5870,"Sounds like op is concerned, which is justified. 2 years isn't too weird, as long as they aren't trying to be horny. But it's still quite abnormal"
5871,I didn’t know it was from park and rec. thanks
5872,[deleted]
5873,"There isn’t much you can do, but talk to her about why the relationship is bad, and try to make sure she isn’t horny or really wanting sex. Another suggestion might be to see if you can take them somewhere that might still be open through COVID and see what exactly they do that is relationship type. Other than that 2 years isn’t much difference, and don’t worry about grade difference, because if I were the guy dating your sister I would be 1 year older and still a sophomore."
5874,No I have big fingers and my squad told me to hurry the fuck up
5875,Sophomore dating a 7th grader isn't weird? lol
5876,i was a freshmen at 13
5877,"Mind your own damn buisiness. If your sister wants to date a 15 year old she can, she doesnt need nosy sister in her relationship. Besides, relationships like these will last like a couple of months."
5878,"ah, so a 100 yr old can date a 57 yr old. thats good to know tyvm"
5879,"
I was like ""no but actually yes""

In a year they'll be 16 and 14 and I actually hope they mature at that point. I agree with the age part. Idk why, but even though 14 year olds are still stupid, at least they're mature *enough*"
5880,"They’re 2 years apart in age. No, I don’t think that’s that weird."
5881,mfw i grow up and look older than i am and get told i cant date someone within my age range just cause i look older
5882,3 year actually
5883,"Not sure why you're being downvoted. All you said was:   
You're not sure if it's legal or not  
Even if it is, you think it's borderline pedophilia, especially if one is developed and one isn't."
5884,yeah the 13yo has an early birthday shes a 7th grader and he's a sophomore
5885,Can u vibe with me?
5886,Tbh irl probably you seem interesting. Online is harder to tell
5887,Okay maybe I take it back
5888,Well loving someone goes along with trusting them and being vulnerable to them. Once you do something to hurt them and break that trust it cuts deep so it’s understandable that doing something so bad would end up with that person hating you. It’s easier to hate than love.
5889,Dw bout it

5896,"It's harder to earn trust than it is to break it. That is because you need to see that, time and time again, that person is deserving of your trust.

Also, sometimes you can trust people within the moment you see them. If they have a naturally welcoming smile and a soothing voice, you are definitely going to trust them."
5897,"I just use this simple method: If they dislike tacos then they can go to hell, if they like tacos then they're alright"

5900,Yea

5903,i love your flair😌
5904,"It’s like the end goal of an easy job vs a hard job, it’s hard to become a heart surgeon but easy to get money then,

For an easy job like McDonald’s, it’s easy to get but hard to make money.

Now it’s harder to fall in love but once you’re there (marriage, sex, secrets and company ) are all there.

It’s easy to hate but to murder someone is pretty hard...

Am I okay?"
5905,Damn
5906,Thank you 😌
5907,Pop some chicken on a foreman and heat up some mac and cheese and that's a good meal in like 10 minutes

Like sorry you only pretend to care for clout."
6006,This is the bear minimum people want to do. It’s all for show so that they can feel less guilty. They can show social media that they did something. That they actual “care” about the issue. It hurting more than it is helping
6007,It’s solidarity. Yeah it doesn’t do much but it makes people feel like they’re doing something instead of just lying on their couches watching YouTube. It takes no effort and it’s kind of nice to scroll through your feed and see all this support from people.
6008,"same, a lot of the kids at my expensive private school are putting a lot of stuff on social media which isn’t bad per se, but i wonder how many of them have done concrete action versus what they’ve been posting on their stories and posts"
6009,people don’t like you insulting their clout magnets smh
6010,i think some people are doing it because they don’t have money to donate or they aren’t able to go to the protest so they probably just want to show support
6011,the blackout was originally created to pause the music industry for a second. it was never created to have teens post black squares and get showered in likes. the bare minimum would be to spread information instead of tryna fish for clout.
6012,"i love in an area with a bunch of rich kids that easily shill out cash for nice clothes and eating out all the time with friends. i haven’t seen anybody donate. i don’t have money to donate and the pressure of everybody else doing it got to me. i really was discussion with my peers about what happened and what we can do to try to make changes but really, they see as any opinion different from their own means the person with that opinion is trash. i know some people that can have respectful conversation but i know a lot more that would just block me and label me as “low key racist” or something along those lines"
6013,"My fellow Americans, due to the overwhelming amount of Black squares teenage girls are posting on Instagram, the supreme court has decided end racism completely. We did not think you would go to such extreme measures but you have very much proved your point. The Military will be told to stand down just please stop. Thank you"
6014,"A lot of the rich kids that you’re talking about definitely wouldn’t donate or support the cause beyond blackout Tuesday, but I would like to point out that some people have likely donated but not chosen to post that on social media or brag about it. I’ve personally donated to my local bail fund but I didn’t want to post it on social media because my growth and anti-racist work doesn’t all need to be on display for everyone else. Just thought I’d put that out there :)"
6015,Because the Instagram thots think they’re ending racism.
6016,"Because it solves racism, don’t you know?"
6017,"Then gotta post white, brown, and yellow squares amirite?"
6018,"I'm honestly not sure how to help, my parents won't let me go to protests in my town, I dont have much money to donate, and other than posting things on social media, I'm genuinely unsure what to do. I want to help, I posted the black screen to stand in solidarity with the situation because I am unsure how else to contribute. I saw people posting this and saw it as an opportunity to show solidarity I thought the purpose was for everybody to unite on social media under a common post. I had zero intentions of attention seeking. Please tell me how else I can help! I'm not sure what to do!"
6019,they could show support by forwarding messages or posts with useful information. just posting a black square does nothing.
6020,there it is. this copypasta is gold.
6021,"As a black female, I’m all for the blackout. It helped me to know who actually cares. Sure it’s the bare minimum, but at least it’s something. I can’t donate money, or go marching in the streets, so the least I can do is repost insta posts, sign petitions, and stand in solidarity with other black people and allies. We can’t all go out and do stuff, so don’t hate on people for doing what they can, even if you don’t think it’s enough."
6022,"I think it’s pointless if that’s all you’re doing. If you haven’t been actively donating, signing petitions, protesting, etc. and simply post one picture on social media and think your job is done, then I have an issue. But I don’t mind those who are advocating religiously and do this as an extra step. 

Posting on social media about social/political movements only does so much at the end of the day and it’s painstakingly clear who actually cares and who does it just to jump on the bandwagon."
6023,i don’t mind the informational posts but these black squares do nothing besides take up space and wash out the information.
6024,"I completely understand, and I've been trying to talk to my African American friends on how I can help. I don't wanna just be another white dude who just reposts things on social media. One of my really close African American friends told me I was doing good, and the general attitude at least among my peers, both black and white seemed to be of approval for the black screens. There's just such contrasting opinions I feel trapped. I understand both sides completely though."
6025,"this is the type of support that should be happening, not posting flowery quotes and calling it a day. if people want to spread awareness on social media they should focus on re-directing attention to posts by the black community. they are finally getting a chance to be heard but they are being silenced by black squares."
6026,Blackout tuesday posts radiate the same energy as reddit thinking they're helping with something by simply upvoting a post related to said thing.
6027,"I kind of like it? Like yes, putting forth an actual effort is more important but my feed is flooded with the black bars, I can’t ignore them, which is part of the point."
6028,"I did it to show my support. I didnt include any tags so it wont bury important posts. I feel like i should be doing everything that i can to support the protests because i cant go to one. I've also been sharing posts with important information, streaming donation videos, and i made an actual post about celebrating pride month by supporting the black community. I feel as though i should participate in everything i can because i cant go to protests."
6029,an easy way for them to feel like they’ve done something and let themselves off the hook for not saying anything else
6030,"same energy, but upvoting posts isn’t counterproductive to the purpose they are tryna promote"
6031,"It‘s sooo true, I said the same thing in a dark meme group and they fucking defended it saying „the black square is the least I can do“. No it isn‘t, and they‘re only doing it because everybody is.

Also I want to see stuff on insta, why even open it when I already know it‘s all black squares? Fill it with something meaningful"
6032,"i see it as people saying that they know about the movement and care but i get where youre coming from. i didnt do it for clout, not a single one of my post has over 30 likes. im been doing my best to spread information too but i saw it as another way to show my support. i get where youre coming from though. do you think i should delete my post?"

6098,"Bro, it’s for yourself. People ask me all the time „why do you do a full face of makeup when you’re stuck home anyways“, „why do you do a full face every time you go out?“, etc..

It’s for me. Imagine sitting down multiple days a week and just doing your makeup. Looking at your face close up in the mirror for like an hour, putting effort into yourself and doing sth for yourself.
It feels good putting effort and care into your looks bc it makes you feel happy and confident like „oof you really ARE that bitch, DAMN“.

People around you notice too and give you compliments (most of the time) bc who doesn’t like someone who puts effort into themselves and smells great all the time. (That’s not the main reason tho, I mainly do it for myself and all the compliments are just a fun bonus).

Also it’s a way to express your personality.
Bring some of your inside to your outside. I feel way more like myself with dark eyeshadow and my signature red lipstick, bc I’m dark and twisted on the inside too ^. (Jk)

Lastly, it’s just fucking nice. Leaving the house, seeing your reflection in some stores window and just thinking to yourself „oof who is SHE“. It’s a whole ass vibe and it makes me happy. Like yea a day could be going horrible but at least I look nice and put together. It lifts my mood a lot and it helped me a lot, gaining confidence and being more open."
6099,"Ok, you found the limit to boob worship"
6100,"very cool, bras suck"
6101,Man boobs tho?
6102,I'd suggest you dont say *loli*
6103,I look in the mirror and wonder why girls put so much effort into it
6104,"thankfully I'm a small size so they don't get in the way, but i like cute bras n stuff so i'm glad i have them. cute bras are a huge confidence boost for me idk why lol"
6105,"I like having them because they make me feel attractive. I don’t like bras, but it’s worth to feel attractive."
6106,Damn :( I guess my tiddies aint good enough for y'all :(
6107,Im gonna be honest it was just a joke but this was lowkey inspiring woah
6108,"Honestly that's a great question, here's my answer from my experience.

I remember in like 4th grade my mom got me a training bra which was really a mini tank top. Bras didn't suck until I accually had boobs, and by then I was so used to wearing bras I didn't even think of the option of not wearing them.

I also play hockey, and during the hockey season we have practice nearly everyday, so I would just wear sports bras and a baggy t shirt. Personality I find sports bras very comfortable, especially because I can run up the stairs without having to give it thought that my boobs will hurt. But also I wore only sports bras for most of middle school and the beginning of highschool Wich also added to a lot of bullying because all the boys called me flat chested.(I wear my sports bras kind of small so they *compact* my boobs) Frankly I didn't give any thought to what boys think about my boobs but obviously no one likes being bullied. 

Anyway, now I still wear mainly sports bras and I just dgaf what people think. I do have one bra that my mom bought for herself, but it didn't fit her, so she gave it to me. She said it was accually around $150USD but it's pretty comfortable. It doesn't hold my boobs in like a sports bra obviously but I can wear it all day and be comfortable. I guess my main reasoning for wearing a bra now is that most of my bras are comfortable. But if I am wearing something nice (aka not a sweatshirt) I'll have to be uncomfortable. If I go braless then you can see my nipples. And I'm so used to wearing bras that being without one feels *exposed*"
6109,">bras suck

I heard that so many times. I know some girls find them comfortable, but many don't. My question then is, why is it a universal thing for girls to wear bras starting some age? There are pieces of clothing that kinda look like a bra but don't support the boobs at all, just cover them, so if girls feel uncomfortable not wearing one at all, that could be an alternative. But girls and women almost universally wear them. Why? No one forces you?"
6110,Then are my boobs to big? Cuz I think it's a negative thing
6111,">bras suck

Don't wear em"
6112,Sry for being a pedophile 😪😔
6113,"they're wonderful, sometimes I just end hold holding them, especially when I sleep. fuck trying to find fitting bras though"
6114,Idk how big they are so?
6115,"Ah. Those are bigger than I’d want but I don’t think they’re bad by any means. No boobs are bad, it’s all just personal preference"
6116,"Who the fuck is B0b and why does everyone like them?

The best reason I heard was ""World hard and cold, tiddy soft and warm"""
6117,"C cup D cup in some brands

They hurted a lot :/ 
But also my hormones are wack"
6118,simp and pedo
6119,">eat me.

\*eats you*"
6120,Bras do suck! But I don't mind having boobs.
6121,"Ahaha, sorry, I get asked a lot and maybe it can help someone, idk.

Also yea, looking at my Reddit bio, this is exactly what I do :‘D"
6122,I’d say B-C is average. D is big. You’re probably on the edge of big
6123,"> like yea, I’m a full course meal, eat me

your dms must be absolutely wrecked rn"
6124,"That's pretty interesting. I guess it's different from girl to girl. I'm sorry you got bullied. Those kids will grow up and be more mature. I'm glad you feel more comfortable now. For when you can't wear a sports bra or your mom's, maybe ask and look for alternatives that cover your nipples but aren't uncomfortable to wear. Alternatively, if you're brave, you could carefully try not wearing a bra sometimes. Do it just in your house, then go for a walk, then go shopping, etc and slowly get comfortable with being ""exposed"". Either way being comfortable is a really nice thing, and everyone should be able to. 

Anyways, thanks for the insight and Happy Easter ;)"

6138,"i think you being there for her is probably enough to make her happy!! :D but if you really wanna get her something, i suggest you bring her some of the stuff she’ll like to do but she can’t cus she’s stuck there, maybe one of her favourite pastimes or something :)"

6142,Oh in the post you said she will be stuck for one more day and then a few more making it sound like 3-4 days. My tip is to just go there and maybe watch a movie or something and order your guys favorite food.
6143,Bring her chocolate and her favorite snack and spend time with her. She’ll be grateful to have someone with her while she’s recovering.

6184,How much for a spicy tuna on crispy rice ma'am?
6185," some girls do that to get more compliments and attention .

honestly , i do the thing where i’m like “nooo i’m nootttt that’s all you” or i just say “thank u but no”

mostly cause i’m really insecure and i hate myself , not cause i need more compliments.
but it’s nice getting complimented you know . 

especially when a guy compliments one of my features like “show me your cute little dimples” or “you have the most adorable smile ever”
stuff like that really makes me feel better about myself , also , Never use “sexy” or “hot” as a compliment. be creative, call her breathtaking , gorgeous, beautiful, adorable , cute, etc."
6186,"When I was younger, I'd deny it. Now to avoid annoying the other person, I accept and say thank you, even though I don't really believe them."
6187,"Yeah, I feel like “sexy” and “hot” are only good compliments if you’re in a relationship. If not, it could come off as objectifying them, whether it’s for men or women. Definitely stick to those “stunning” or “beautiful” ones."
6188,"Well said,he's the truly magnificent.."
6189,Tbh I always deny em cos I’m hella insecure and I feel like the persons only saying it to be nice.
6190,Both at the same time while blushing and thanking them
6191,ahaha your so sexy
6192,Facts u/DildoMachineFFS
6193,"I always accept them. Some years ago I denied all of them because I truly didn’t believe it, I hated myself and for me it was impossible to believe that someone thought I was pretty or looked good. Now I like myself and I trust people more"
6194,I accept them even if I might not believe it
6195,"I have a really hard time accepting compliments because I have really low self esteem, so I normally respond with a nod or very quiet thank you because in my mind I’m just like “I DON’T DESERVE COMPLIMENTS!”"
6196,"I accept, I love love LOOOOVVVEE praise and compliments so literally just one is enough to make me see you as a romantic interest."
6197,"welp fuck, you beat me to it"
6198,"A lot of girls aren't very confident, but also you're kind of taught to not accept compliments so don't blame them too much. 

I never know how to respond to compliments but I try my best to accept them. I feel like I usually accept them in some awkward way but it's hard to judge from inside my own head."
6199,"Okay, you kinda sound like a dick. Excuse them if those girls have so little self-confidence that they can't imagine someone complimenting them. Those insecure girls should apologize for making butterlord209 annoyed. I mean, can you imagine the hard work the guy put into making the compliment. SHUT UP, AND ACCEPT IT.

Based on you other comments, it seems you think that compliments are some form of currency. Compliments are from the bottom of someone's heart when they genuinely appreciate something. If I complimented someone and they said what you stated, it would definitely not make me annoyed. It would make me a bit upset that the other party has so little faith in themselves to think that they don't deserve it.

You're really unaware of the numerous guys who don't accept compliments or have a hard time accepting them because of how little they believe in themselves. No one is getting annoyed at them. Everyone feels low or unworthy or insecure. If it makes you so annoyed because it's oh so difficult to give a compliment, then maybe those people deserve better people to compliment them"
6200,I kinda feel like they pity me ya know but I get ur point and all
6201,accept and then not believe it
6202,10/10 would reccomend
6203,"Ofcourse you say this now. Like I said, what I wrote was based on what you had commented and it was perceived as such. Sarcasm is not an insult. And sorry on behalf of the guys and girls who annoy you because they have such a low self-esteem that they can't accept compliments. The point that you mentioned about social media is people expressing themselves and learning to be comfortable with themselves. And this just makes your point worse. You kinda come across as an r/niceguy acting like ""Accept my compliment, you imposter. You post yourself on social media, you must be attention-hungry who seeks validation from online strangers""

You're only 15, you have a lot to learn and experience. You can't just group people into one category because of your incorrect perception. You gave the compliment sincerely, good. No one owes you to explain or make excuses as to why they don't out-right accept it."
6204,"You're coming off as stuck-up by the second. Bruh, it'd be easier for you to just move on when someone doesn't accept it for whatever reason."
6205,[removed]
6206,"Would you find it normal if you told a girl she was pretty and she just said 'thanks'? If so, that's awesome! But I know I feel like I have to half-deny it at least to avoid looking full of myself or something"
6207,"Well, well, well, people. Obviously if you haven't heard of something, it totally, absolutely has no point of ever existing, in any part of the globe."
6208,Do people actually get taught to accept compliments?
6209,"I reiterate my last point, there is a lot you don't understand. You can't just group everyone into one category because you perceive it that way. Saying the opposite of what I said does not stand. 

You misunderstood my point, I said they want to be comfortable with themselves. Assumptions most of the time lead to error. Again, (seems I am repeating this point) those people don't owe you anything to accept anything, really, if you think about it. Why are you getting mad because you didn't receive a ""thank you"" in return? You gave them the compliment, good on you. If it annoys you so damn much, don't bother next time. It's quite simple. You might find this easier to understand than the point about self-esteem

I called you a dick because (as I said) you sounded like a dick."
6210,"> i think this is why you're single

So people can still be sexist stalkers in 2019. Shocker, boomer

> and you completely ignored the point that you call op a dick

I did. In my other comment

>also headass insulting people to make their self-esteem lower

Again, said it in my other comment that I called him a dick because he sounded like a dick. 

What is this, an alt-account?"
6211,"even if they are doing it just to he nice, that means they’re trying to be nice to you which should be taken as a compliment itself because they wanted to be nice to you"
6212,Yea I’d say like thanks haha but that’s not at all true or smtg like that
6213,Don’t worry it’s not French
6214,"Well it might but if I genuinely don’t believe it I can’t rly bring myself to say anything other than that.

I might not say that exactly tho I might just make an awkward face and look away cuz I’d get embarrassed if it was someone I didn’t know"
6215,"Yes, but it doesn't mean that guys won't know anything about a question. If it's not helpful just ignore it rather than stopping every guy from saying something."
6216,All girl oriented subs are always filled with boys I don’t mind the changes
6217,[deleted]
6218,This is too true. Even girl's subreddits are male dominated.
6219,A shame it's that this is askteenagegirls
6220,"Tbh I think that the default for this sub should be girls only - if they want only male answers, they’d go on ask teen boys, and if they want both specifically, asking boys should be specified. Why would you assume that you’re asking for male and female answers on a subreddit named ask teen girls?"
6221,"Male subreddits attract: Male

Girl subreddits attract: Male

Non-gendered subreddits attract: Male

Uhmmmm"
6222,Of course they do
6223,I think girl subreddits specifically attract a lot of males so it’s pretty disproportional
6224,"This is not something the mods are ruining, but what's ruined because of the unbalance between boys and girls. Like the title says: ask TEEN GIRLS. This means this should be mostly a subreddit towards girls. Not subreddit nr 1000 where girls are completely overshadowed."
6225,"Guys can still comment, it’s just under the stickied comment. If the OP wants help from anyone they can use the everyone tag. Personally I’m sick of boys commenting useless things on posts directed at girls."
6226,The boys have ATB and girls do get upset at the amount of boys there are
6227,"That’s missing the point, though. They come here for advice from girls specifically - it’s the subreddit name. If they want advice from boys, they can ask on askteenboys, the subreddit created for that purpose specifically. 

Better yet, ask on both! Or, and this is my favorite one (although it’s more work for the mods), just make it a new subreddit with boys only flairs or girls only flairs. 

Tbh, this is the least likely. Reddit has always been male dominated (see r/teenagers and r/feemagers if you need more proof), and it’s nice to have a space in which you can get girl opinions."
6228,"obviously guys do, but this isn’t a sub for guys"
6229,If thats the case put the everyone flair when you want everyone to reply on a girl sub.
6230,"I think what they’ve done is fine and necessary. This is a sub meant to ask for the female perspective. It completely defeats the purpose if there’s a bunch of guys commenting. Guys don’t have the female perspective, so they shouldn’t comment like they know what they’re taking about. If OP wanted the opinions of everyone, they would use the [everyone] tag, simple. The fact that there was a [girls only] tag to begin with shows how out of control the commenting got. 

If guys want to comment, they can go lurk r/askteenboys. I’m subbed to there but i  generally don’t comment out of respect for the sub. Mods are just asking that you do the same

Also, i love the no relationship posts on weekends rule. It’s nice to have a break from them, since they make up 80% of the posts here it feels like. And timing wouldn’t be a problem. It starts and ends at the same time for everyone, saturday 00:00 GMT to sunday 23:59 GMT. Everyone still goes a full 48 hrs without relationship posts, but everyone’s “weekend” would just be different relative to their time zone. My “weekend” would last from 7 pm friday to 7 pm sunday. That’s fine, idc. Same as r/teenagers"
6231,"For real, OP wants to just butt into another sub. Like damn"
6232,"You can just ignore the male comments. If your post only get male replies then removing all males will give it no replies. 

If its so important just use the designated tag."
6233,Then take it up on r/askteenboys. It's simple. Doesn't break any rules
6234,some female dominated subs i really like are r/NotHowGirlsWork and r/BadWomensAnatomy
6235,"If that has to be the case, in a **girls'** subreddit, then move to r/askteenboys"
6236,yes
6237,I absolutely agree with the steps mods have taken. I think you guys are doing a good job making this sub a safe place for girls :)
6238,"There is no limit on how many replies a post can get. I think. And if there is we'll probably never hit it. 

We don't really have a lack of space here is what im trying to say."
6239,"Holy shit I saw that person too. Sorry OP but I prefer the mods doing this. 

You’re in r/askteenagegirls and you scroll through the answers and you see

>18M

>16M

>13F

>15M

Like come on. You wanna hear from *girls*. Make it so guys can’t start comment threads or something. I’d love to hear their input too but right now they’re overwhelming.

OP the problem is that reddit is predominantly male. And if you don’t do anything to counteract that then all the answers and opinions you’ll get will be predominantly based on male experiences. So rules which spotlight girls’ experiences make infinitely more sense on a subreddit that’s supposed to be for answers from girls, and frankly I think it’s necessary

u/random_british_nerd"
6240,"The subs name implies it is only asking teen girls. Newcomers might make a post, not bother with a flair, and then be confused when tons of teen guys start answering their questions. Guys can still respond through the sticky auto moderator comment, but only girls are allowed to actually answer in their own comment thread. I think it’s reasonable because as someone mentioned below, a younger teen guy answering a question about periods (or other general girl stuff) can look really weird and isn’t always the right answer. Hence why the main top level comments should be left to girls, as the sub name implies. If someone wants answers from guys, they can use the ‘everyone’ flair on their post now."
6241,"I don't feel the mods are ruining this at all. In fact, I'm glad the mods are taking a more active position in this sub. If I, or anyone else, asks a question on r/askteenGIRLS, I'm asking for a girl's perspective. Having the comments being overrun by boys is honestly irritating, hence why this is the first and probably only time I'm commenting on an r/AskTeenGirls post. It's about respect. Respect the fact that this is a place for teenage women to answer questions, and if you really want to get a guy's perspective on something, just ask them on r/askteenboys."
6242,"Nope.Not at all. As a girl, I don't think that the mods are ruining a sub that is meant to focused towards asking ""girls"". This sub has a lot of boys hijacking threads where girls are having discussions or when girls are asked questions.

This sub is meant for girls to be asked questions, not the other way around"
6243,"Obviously. I cared because at first I somewhat agreed then I read the stickied comment. Reddit is male dominated and seeing the post made by a dude shows that even here it’s a shit ton of dudes leaving comments about shit in a sub for a girl’s opinion. Don’t want to see that, not here for dudes"
6244,"no, i think instagram, pinterest and tumblr are mostly girls, right?"
6245,"I hope this isn’t too morbid, but if your daughter ever comes to you for bullying or anything like that, please take her seriously. I wish my mother had done better when I spoke out about my abuse, so please support her if she ever comes to you about anything as such (Heaven forbid). Also, have the puberty talk about periods, boys and things like that with her :) 
P.S, You seem to be doing a great job as a dad. Keep up the work :)"
6246,"I'm sorry that happened to you. I have experience dealing with the little everyday things that comes with not having mom at home that can make things super hard. I don't think teachers etc intend to be insensitive but they do seem to default to saying stuff like ""tell your mom"" instead of ""parents"" which causes more hurt than they understand.

Thanks for the advice. I've been working on that second part. No idea how to avoid the awkwardness though..."
6247,"Lol I can def understand that. Just do what my dad did. Sit her down and tell it her in the most casual way possible. 

Also don't get pissed when she loses her virginity. My dad took it really well."
6248,"So glad to see an adult who genuinely cares about their kid. Listen to her, don’t invalidate anything she’s feeling by saying “it’s teenage stuff”. Don’t tell her she’s being dramatic, or overreacting. If you get in an argument, don’t lose your temper. When she is upset, treat her like an adult. Expect her to lay out why she is upset in a reasonable way, even when she feels like blowing up. Listen to what she says about her emotions, what she feels and thinks. If she says something is wrong with her, listen.  Tell her nothing is wrong with her having periods, nothing is wrong with her starting to be attracted to others.

My parents liked extra punishments. I cut a blanket and my mom spanked me till I was on the ground crying and didn’t stop. I never hit the ground normally. Don’t ground her for a month because she stayed up past her bedtime, and try not to punish her while angry. Have a level head so you can think of something fair. Remember she is a person too, and as frustrated as you may get, she is new to all this and trying to figure out what to do. She has emotions just as complex as yours. Good luck!"
6249,Thanks. I'm trying.
6250,Not a girls answer but Honestly I don’t think there’s any getting around the awkward part. My best advice would just be easygoing about it. I don’t know the dynamic between you and your daughter but some jokes or just an overall light mood could make it easier
6251,"Even if you don't agree with something she says, please try to see things from her perspective and be as open-minded as possible. Also, if you're ever having a bad day, don't take your anger out on her. Honestly, just being supportive and kind can go a long way. My parents act like my best friends and only get serious when they need to lecture me, and I think that's why we are super close"
6252,"the comments you make when you are upset or angry with her hurt. be sure to think twice before saying anything that sounds really harsh, she can carry that memory for the rest of her life. be patient and understanding, and be ready to listen and help!"
6253,"My mother committed suicide when I was 12 and my father is a single parent. There’s a reason why a mom and dad together generally make the best team. It’s a yin and yang situation. It’s not in a dad’s nature to behave like a mother, that’s just how it is. For a lot of situations, you’re going to feel comfortable with your response because it won’t be what just YOU would say. 

If she’s going through a rough patch and she opens up about it, for the love of god just sit down and listen. If she’s comfortable opening up, DO NOT RUIN the moment by pushing it off indefinitely or shutting her down entirely. Believe me, a teenage girl can hold a grudge for a very long time. She will feel better that her dad cares enough to take time out of his (busy?) day to let her ramble. After that, if she wants your input, give her your thoughts on the situation and possible solutions. Don’t immediately jump to solutions. 

You’ll probably want to be in a relationship at some point. It might be good for you, but not your daughter. It’s a relationship between the three of you so you need to consider your daughter when making that kind of decision. 

If you have any female relatives, please involved them if possible. I don’t really have any older female role models in my family and it sucks because the moment I try something feminine like makeup, I don’t have anyone to turn to or just talk girl stuff with. I’m not saying that they have to fill in as her mother, just a little something like a girl’s outing every now and then.

Regarding “the talk,” it will be awkward. That’s just a fact. Maybe see if a trusted female family member can show her the ropes about her period. Just be understanding about it. There shouldn’t be a need to get graphic, but if she’s taking Advil, using a heating pad, and not feeling great, consider getting her her favorite food/candy. In general, a kind gesture goes a long way.

If you remarry and she has a good relationship with her step-mother, that’s fantastic. If you don’t (at least when she’s a teenager), she probably won’t have a mother figure EVER. It’s a hard bullet to bite and I’m still struggling with that realization."
6254,"Listen to her, try to understand her perspective, and don’t invalidate her feelings if she’s on her period. 

Making her feel like she has a safe space to talk to you and be heard is ultimately one of the best things you can do for your relationship. (And probably her mental health as well)

Thank you for caring enough to ask."
6255,please let her know you love her and that you’re proud of her
6256,"My mom and I were just talking about parenting the other day. I agree with all of these comments, but my mom said that when she was pregnant her boss gave her a piece of advice that she has forever been grateful for: be consistent.

I have multiple friends who aren't even in my same friend group (I have several different groups), and their parents aren't consistent in parenting them, and it leaves them unstable and frankly afraid. Afraid of being kicked out, afraid of being cut off, afraid of going home. If you do anything, PLEASE remain consistent in parenting. I have been fortunate enough for my parents to have remained consistent and I have never truly been more thankful for anything ever. I know where our relationship stands, and even if I disappoint them I am not afraid of them and I truly cannot express how much it has caused me so much emotional healing. I am a very open person and I tell my parents everything, and I truly believe it is because their parenting has remained consistent through all my teen years and my whole life.

Just by posting this it means you care, and at the end of the day that is the most important. These years are full of moodiness and I can tell you I have been short with my parents for no reason, but please stick it out, you are and especially in these upcoming years will be the reason she becomes who she will become. 

Also I love to share new music with my parents, maybe encourage her to do that too (unless it'll change your current music ritual/thing if you have one). :) Good luck and Godspeed."
6257,My dad taught me early on to enjoy my teenage years and make the best out of it
6258,"give space. yes, parents have a right to look into things when there is trouble, but when your kid is upset with you or something like that, give them space and give it a little time. my dad tries to fix everything before anyone is calm and he doesn’t leave me alone when i ask. this is important. also, spend time with her. sometimes, people act like they don’t want to hang out with their dad but in reality it’s just hard for them to admit they miss the old times. bonding is important, i miss that with my parents. also, school isn’t everything. the world doesn’t depend on school and good grades, remind your child that being happy is important too. 

have a great day!"
6259,"I'm gonna tell you kinda what I told my daughter about her mom. 

Some people screw up. There are people in the world who are selfish and mean and don't care about anything but themselves. Your dad doesn't do that to you bc you deserve it. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with him. Every day bad stuff happens to innocent and good people and not because they ever deserved it. You just happened to have the bad luck of having to deal with someone else's screw up. But it's not your job to carry their burden and deal with the pain they caused. It's your job to move on and try your best to be the person you know that you can be. Not to prove you're better than them because that just allows them to live in your head rent free forever. It's your turn to be selfish. But sometimes when you're selfish and you seek happiness and you dont do any harm to others, not only does your life improve but the lives of people around you improve too. Just remember when you feel like crap or are depressed, diamonds are formed under pressure and you cant drive if you only look in the rearview. I know this is probably all cliche to you. But I just want you to know that whether you know it or not, somebody loves you very very much and not all families are bonded by blood. I hope things get better for you and you make it through this situation. It breaks my heart to hear about a father not loving his daughter the way she deserves. If there is one thing I've learned through this (because I wasn't ready to be a dad when it happened) it is that a daughter is the greatest gift a man can ever have. I've never felt the love that I have for my daughter in relation to anything else in my entire life. He's really missing out on one of the greatest experiences in the world. And its not your fault. Stay strong. Dont let him make you into something that you know you arent. I said that lots of bad stuff happens to good and innocent people and thats true but there is also a lot of magic in the world and never let anyone take that away from you. Rise up girl and dont let anyone bring you down."
6260,"Theres going to come a time when she starts to think about dating and sex. The WORST thing you can do is try to prevent those things from happening. Kids are smart, they find their way around things all the time. She just won’t tell you anything. That’s honestly the worst thing that my parents have done, is not encourage healthy conversations around dating and sex. Thankfully I learned and I haven’t run into any major issues but God I hated having to go at it alone. If she wants to have sex then the best thing you can do is educate her on how to do it safely, contraceptives, etc. I know it’s awkward and I know it’s uncomfortable but it’s going to happen (unless she’s ace) and so make sure that she isn’t afraid of getting hit or kicked out if you ever found out that she was sexually active.

Also: you have to see her grow up. My parents rarely interacted with me from the ages of 10-16, it was only this year with COVID when they actually started talking to me. They still think I’m 12 and defenseless, that my friends are going to take advantage of me because I’m young and naive, and that I don’t know anything about the world. I know I’m young and I know there is a lot that I don’t know but the worst thing is being treated like a kid when they also expect me to act like an adult with schoolwork and sibling responsibilities. Know that she will grow into a young woman and she has to learn how to pick herself up from the ground when she’s down, but she also has to learn that her dad will be there when she needs him. One of the worst things you can do to your child is to keep them sheltered from the world. I know you want to protect her but she also has to learn how to survive outside of the nest. You don’t have to let her go now, but you’ll do it slowly."
6261,"I would say listening is the most important part. Also a bit of private space is crucial. 



Also this is really sweet"
6262,"Something I’ve started doing that’s helped me A LOT in the past few years is actively reflecting on why I’m feeling the way I do in any situation. Say, I’m irritated and my dad tries to talk to me. My first reaction is to be snippy and irritated with him even though quite a lot of the time it’s NOT HIS FAULT that I’m snippy or irritated. Taking a moment to reflect and go, “Why am I angry at this person who has done nothing but show me love and compassion (in this situation)?” This manner of thinking has really improved how I’ve handled a lot of my interactions with my family. But it was a conscious effort. I had to physically stop, take a moment, and evaluate. 

 Being a teenage girl is fucking difficult. The entire world hates you for being you and liking the things you do. Being able to connect with your emotions and really UNDERSTAND them is NOT something that’s encouraged for teenage girls to do nowadays. This is a conversation that does need to be happening, though, and can go a long way to avoiding unnecessary friction between parent and child, in either direction. 

Also: periods. Buying tampons and pads specifically is, or at least for me was, SUPER embarrassing. My dad didn’t know anything about it wanted to know as little as possible. He still would get me the stuff I needed, but has always been awkward around that kind of stuff. That rubs off. Periods aren’t shameful, they’re a part of life. A pretty consistent and painful one, too. Mine give me back aches, mood swings, and just awful cramping. Be aware. Help educate your daughter on what she’s going through, especially the emotional stuff if she has mood swings like I do. Seriously I get AWFUL when I’m PMSing but at least I’m aware of what the cause is and know that I shouldn’t lash out at others because it isn’t their fault. NOT ENGAGING IS OKAY! (Full shut downs are not, however. Communication is vital to most everything, this is no different) I can sometimes fall into, I can’t say anything nice so I’m not going to say anything at all during some of my lows. Though, this is all just me and everyone’s experience is different. The important thing is communication and education. Be informed on both the emotional and physical things that are happening. People seriously undervalue emotional intelligence when it’s so important to leading a happier life. I wish you both the best of luck!"
6263,"understand her boundaries, let her be independent, let her be open about her mental health, don't go crazy about grades, and try to be understanding when she wants space."
6264,"One thing my parents have made pretty clear to me that has really made me trust them is that if I ever need help, I can go to them and not be afraid of really ""getting on trouble"" as long as I can acknowledge my mistake. This more goes for when I'm older, but like my mom has said that if I ever get drunk or mess up bad and need help or a ride home I can get a hold of her and she'll help me. 

Also,  I know it must be really hard for you to be away from her, but it will definitely benefit both of you of you let her have some space when she needs it."
6265,"If my parents told me to open up, i wouldn't be depressed for 16 months and wouldn't want to kill myself. If you tell her to just talk and let it all out whats bothering her, I'm sure she's gonna be very happy."
6266,"My dad beat me up so maybe don’t do that. Also understand that she’s trying her best and she will want to do regular teen activities. Just let her do what she wants (within reason ofc) and listen to her. If she confides in you about something, don’t get mad at her for it"
6267,Let her know she can talk to you anytime without judgment and  don't threatin therapy as a punishment for bad behavior
6268,One day my parents just gave me an educational book for children about sex and sexuality and we then never spoke about it again. But here in Germany  pupils get educated about it  by the school in grade 3 so it isn't really neccesarry to have  the talk at home.
6269,Awwww thank u so much :) that helped
6270,"Try your best to get her to feel very comfortable around you. Talk to her about fun things in your life, do things she’d like and surprise her everyone once in a while, restrict her when necessary but let her be her.  My mom has done a good job of all of this and I think it would be good for you to do too. Best of luck!"
6271,"Let her talk to you, my dad would flip out at any little detail I mentioned that he didn’t like (such as...talking to a boy)

Be there for her and take her seriously. It feels like a lot of people don’t take us seriously because we’re teens but we were still people with thoughts and feelings. Trust me, she’ll appreciate it when she’s older.

Respect her privacy. Dont go through her texts or diary.

Please dont lash out at her if you’re having a bad day. It always felt like I was walking  around eggshells with my father when he was upset.

Dont act like her period is gross or unnatural. Talk to her, and try to do research. Yes, she’s gonna be embarrassed probably, but she’ll appreciate it in the future. Also, set up a period kit for her to take that has her preferred choice of feminine products and an extra pair of underwear.

Try and see stuff from her perspective.

If you have any female relatives, try and involve them if you can.

Talk to her about signs someone is abusive in any way so she knows and won’t be in a bad relationship in the future.

Try and show you love her and you care about her. I questioned wether my dad loved me on a daily basis. Hell it doenst have to be bug things, even little things like “I heard you have a test today so I cooked you up your favorite breakfast.” could mean a lot and show you have her in mind (I mean, I know cooking takes up some time but what I’m saying is just show you love her in little ways)

If she’s emotional, try and ask her what you can do to help, wether it be to let her vent, give advice, or even just look at funny pictures together.

Understand boundaries and respect them.

Also, with the period thing, I highly recommend heating pads.

You seem like a very good dad and I’m sure she’ll appreciate you :)"
6272,"I think my comment will get buried, but understand her space and privacy.

Above all else though, what I love about my parents is they inspire me and excite me about learning and adventuring the world im in. Make her feel like she can do anything, like she's capable of any goal she sets her mind to.

Come to her with ideas about college and future, ask her about hers, talk to her and encourage them. When somethings far fetched, tell her it sounds awesome and exciting, it will make her confidence go up and she'll feel on top of the world."
6273,"Two very big things in a young girls life is first period and first breakup. My mom did bad when I first got my period. She was basically like ""yea go look in the closet theres some pads there"" and left me to figure everything out on my own. When I went through my first breakup, however, my mom was a saint. She comforted me while I was crying, told me about shitty boyfriends she had when she was my age, and made me feel like at least my mom still loves me lol."
6274,"Talk to her. I have both my father and mother in my life but I have never and might never be close to my father because he never really built a bond with me. He is nice and all that but I am simply just closer to my mother. Don't neglect your daughter. Listen to her stories, ask her about things she likes and does. Don't be sarcastic or seem disinterested when she's talking. Just, be nice."
6275,The appendix. It was used to digest uncooked food but now is useless
6276,The little pocket in jeans was for pocket watches
6277,Yeah it's pretty cute 🥺
6278,"The fly on men’s jeans was originally meant for use during cold seasons (which is likely why men’s underwear are designed with a similar flap), but are now simply used for easier access."
6279,The bow is the ultimate weapon against my dysphoria lol
6280,"The little horizontal band thing at the back of dress shirts. Used to be for hanging them iirc, but no one does that anymore."
6281,EASIER ACCESS
6282,Perfect example. And it's for lip balm right?
6283,but does it still digest uncooked food?
6284,They never left if you have lace panties
6285,We don’t eat uncooked food anymore
6286,Brb I’m gonna go eat raw chicken 🥰✨🧚🏻‍♀️
6287,"Nope, it’s all shriveled up at the end of your intestines"
6288,The ottoman
6289,"Wait, which notches?"
6290,But like if someone did would it still work
6291,Don’t let the facts ruin your dream u/itsnotana
6292,"It came from the Ottoman Empire, but it was originally meant as a seating area and didn’t go with a chair or anything"
6293,"how about those tiny pockets in jeans? they used to be for pocket watches, I heard"
6294,What was the original purpose and why isn't it needed? I think it's a decent foot rest unless we are talking about the empire then idk
6295,"The buttons on shirts and such are the way they are to make it easier for servants or assistants to do them up because in the olden days, if you could afford a button up shirt, you could afford a servant"

6297,"they're for airpods cases, of course."
6298,Coin pouches I think?
6299,I can’t tell if you’re serious but she means the mini pockets in the big pockets
6300,"Oh, like the little knobs that stick out?"
6301,So that’s what EA Play means
6302,Is that why women's mean pockets are tiny?
6303,gotta cop then
6304,"The little stud things, idk what they are called"
6305,No. Dating preferences exist and I don't want my chick to have a dick.
6306,"Y-you.... *heavy breathing* YOU DON'T LIKE NEO VAGINAS?!?!?!?!?! *furiously slams table* DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW... *SPITS* TRANSPHOBIC THAT IS?! I will be in touch with the mods and you will be BANNED! *malicious laugh*

Okay but in all seriousness it ain't transphobic at all. Transphobia is to just not like people who are trans just because they're trans. Everyone's got their sexual preferences and they should be respected, as long as they're not illegal of course."
6307,Not in the slightest. That doesn’t make you transphobic at all.
6308,Still no. Neovaginas are disgusting.
6309,"i think that when it comes to genitals we all can decide. if you turn him down bc of his genitals since you're not comfortable and its your choice and you respect him, its not tranphobic. if you turn him down bc you separate trans men from men, you are"
6310,but what if she fully transitioned meaning she changed that too?
6311,would me not dating one because a trans woman isn’t a biological woman make me transphobic? I’ll call you whatever pronouns you want but it’s stupid to say there are no differences between a trans woman and biological woman
6312,That's just blatantly wrong. There's nothing transphobic about not wanting to date a trans person. The only problem is when that trans person won't take no for an answer and cries transphobia when it doesn't exist.
6313,"What would make you 100% a woman would be being biologically born as a female. It’s natural to not have periods as a child or when you’re old. You can have a vagina but it’s not the same as a biological one. Biological women who can’t give birth is because of problems with their ovaries, trans women just don’t have ovaries at all."
6314,"As a Trans Woman, I think it’s really scenario specific. If you won’t date them solely because they’re trans, but you actually have some sort of attraction to them that you want to act on, then it may be transphobic? But like honestly it goes person to person. I personally might be offended, but I can’t speak for anyone but me. You could go to r/asktransgender and ask this question for a better answer maybe? A lot of people I saw on here weren’t speaking from a trans perspective.

Edit: Woman not women."
6315,"No, I don’t think so"
6316,I’m confused about your username. Does it check out or not?
6317,I can and will exercise the right to choose who I date and reject anyone for any reason I see fit just like everyone else.
6318,Of course not.
6319,He thinks trans people are a plot by the Jews to destroy society..
6320,"ofc there are, but we all end up in the same group: women, and thats the important part. there's nothing that makes you a 100% woman - periods? kids & grandmas don't bleed. vagina? trans women can go through surgery. making babies? infertile biological women exist. you can have your preferences and as long as you respect that person it's okay. i think that you should ask a trans person since this is only my opinion as a cis woman"
6321,"I disagree. Being trans is a big deal and a big part of who someone is, and can mean a lot of work and issues down the line. What if you want to have kids for example? What if your family isn’t accepting as you?

Besides, attraction isn’t logical and you can’t control it, so you don’t need a reason to not want to be with someone."
6322,Nope. Someone biologically being not the sex you’re attracted to is a very valid reason to not date someone.
6323,"Um def not. I support everyone and I believe you love you what you love, it's not someone's choice to tell you what to love. I think he's being sort of hypocritical when he tells you that. We each have our own preferences and as long as you respect others, it's fine."
6324,"not dating a trans person isn’t transphobic, but this comment is"
6325,Being violent to trans people because they’re trans is transphobic and I’d never say anything else lol. That wasn’t my point.
6326,"No, I wouldn't date a trans female."
6327,">Everyone's got their sexual preferences and they should be respected, as long as they're not illegal of course.

I think I agree with what you're going for (pedophilia, incest, zoophilia, etc. are wrong), but remember homosexuality is still illegal in many places. Illegal ≠ immoral"
6328,"Have you actually seen neovaginas and do you really think that the neovaginas are just like normal vaginas?

You'd clearly know the difference if you ever visited r/NeoVaginaDisasters (now banned, rip NVD)."
6329,No. I’m not afraid of trans people but I’m also not attracted to them.
6330,"Nope, it's a preference unless we aren't allowed to have those anymore as well"
6331,"There really isn't. Nobody can ever *expect* someone to want to date them and then be angry if they don't. You don't earn the right to date someone just because you identify as the gender they're attracted to.

""If you don't want to date me you're not accepting me as a real man."" NO. You're being treated exactly like every other man because, like with every other man, *I* am the one who gets to decide whether I'm attracted to you."
6332,I can see this happening tbh.
6333,What?
6334,"For me, personally, it's the way they're made. It's scary. It's disturbing. I cannot eat that out as a bi girl."
6335,she exploded into tiny pieces
6336,"Twice, in fact.

Time one: Had to stop at a service station in France. The toilets were not toilets. It was more like a grid on the floor. I was eight, and when you gotta go, you gotta go. Wtf, France.

Time two: No particular reason, I just stood up over the toilet. 7/10, nothing special."
6337,May I ask how you expected it and how it went? Curious
6338,"I expected more of a stream forward if I pushed harder, but it just went down my legs and spread out more. All I did was make a mess"
6339,Over someone's grave
6340,Where the fuck else is a good place to pee standing up?
6341,"Yes, my legs got wet and it went everywhere,"
6342,I need a video of that for research purposes
6343,"Mhm, *research*"
6344,People really like their pee
6345,*Hmm the research here is made out of research*
6346,"Nothing. You’re in the fucking shower, you’re gonna be washing yourself anyway if her concern was cleanliness."
6347,Those toilets are nice you just need to squat
6348,What’s wrong with that?
6349,What's wrong with peeing in the shower
6350,"When I was around 6-7 I did that and when my grandma came in there with me making a mess she said ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING??"" And I responded, ""I'm being a boy dog!"""
6351,i see a failed NNN in the near future
6352,Think about what you just wrote out of context
6353,The shower is actually a great place to pee
6354,"Plus, urine is sterile, if you're out on the field you can clean a wound by whizzing in it, that's why it makes no sense as to why I can't pee in the sink

Edit: Stop telling me it's not sterile, I know, I was just saying a joke from The Office."
6355,"Your feet will get wey. Careful everyone, your feet will get wey"
6356,Me too
6357,Why are you so downvoted?
6358,God i hate france for their public toilets :D
6359,You ever peed backwards?
6360,Why?
6361,Literally nothing
6362,"Why are you being downvoted? Made me laugh, at least."
6363,I didnt know that. thanks
6364,More like recent past
6365,Just wondering why is girlfriend in quotation marks
6366,"Yeah I'd second this comment. I made my high school gf a rose when we first started dating and it went over well. There's something special about a handmade present

https://youtu.be/wSesWQ-51ZM"
6367,What does that mean.Does she know she is your SO.
6368,Yes. I guess it's easier to say we're dating but there isn't a title.
6369,"I'd literally cry of happiness if I were given origami roses, like dude def go with those"
6370,To address your first point. I don't understand how that's a pathetic thing to say.
6371,"do the roses!! if you guys aren't completely ""girlfriend-ish"", you could have an assortment of colours (like pink and yellow and stuff) because red is kinda serious. ack sorry for taking over your life"
6372,"a scrapbook, one of those exploding picture box thingies, origami as you said, and homemade baked stuff (cookies or the cake you mentioned) are always a good choice - I'm sure whatever you do she'd appreciate it since it's the thought that matters!!"
6373,You don't know the context though eh? So you can't really say that's pathetic. Maybe one of them is asexual so their relationship is semi-platonic. You don't know.
6374,That’s the plan there. He was going to the burger place but that was an idea for a gift
6375,"Some ideas I plan on doing for my future girl. Feel free to borrow. 

1. Make her a short video compilation of her and you. Or of just pretty shit that makes you think of her and so on. Voice over is your best friend if you don't wanna show your face. 

2. Write her something. (Imma writer so it comes easy but even something you deem as bad can be so sweet if you are genuine) Maybe a poem or even just describe things/moments of her. 

3. Serenade. Doesn't matter if youre a shitty singer if you enjoy yourself. 

4. Make her a good homemade meal. Allrecipes is your best friend.

Good luck fam, hoped this helps"
6376,"I’d love the roses

Edit: The origami roses"
6377,I agree that'd be sweet
6378,"Origami is an awesome idea! My crush really enjoyed it when we did it together, and because it takes a lot of time and effort to make your GF will really appreciate it :)"
6379,"Wow is this really the majority consensus?

I’m ready for the downvotes but unless this guy is like 13 I think that’s a terrible idea. Take her out on a fun date. The roses should be in addition to that, if they’re gonna be the main thing then just no imo, lol"
6380,Food is a good idea if you know how to cook well
6381,The way we act around each other and feel towards each other you would think we're dating. We both love each other and are committed to each other titles just scare her. I'm fine with the way things are because I'm loyal to her and she's loyal to me and if she's happier without the title of girlfriend so be it.
6382,I get it. Pretty much she is your gf but just doesn’t like titles. By the way you put it it sounded like you guys didn’t like commitment and wanted an open relationship
6383,[removed]
6384,[removed]
6385,Oh dear! Make the origami roses and the cake! She will be so happy❤
6386,definitely origami
6387,"I have this exact same thing right now. the both of us just got out of serious relationships so we're taking things very slow. For a while we'd ironically refer to ourselves as ""100% platonic very affectionate best friends"", and now Ive formally asked him to be my partner (not boyfriend and girlfriend) 


There's something stripping about labels like that. Strips your identity from you. It's much better to just have fun than to stress over the labels and r sponsibilities tied to them. Props to OP!!"
6388,ok zoomer
6389,Oh no I'm sorry about that. I'm not mentally stable enough for an open relationship.. And I tend to get a bit jealous sometimes

It’s only a problem when they blame it on women being sexist or whatever. It’s not cause of that, it’s cause of stereotypes and general social outlook on men"

And this isn’t even what I fucking said. I said saying “all girls are sluts” is just as bad as saying “all guys are assholes”

>The easy possibility of writing letters-from a purely theoretical point of view-must have brought wrack and ruin to the souls of the world.

Writing letters ... means exposing oneself to the ghosts, who are greedily waiting precisely for that…

6456,"my best friend is really cheerful all the time. she’s constantly checking up on everyone, giving out hugs, generally being awesome. however, she used to struggle a lot with depression, and still sort of does (it’s better now though). if you pay attention, you can still see how vacant she gets when she’s not talking or interacting with people. i make sure to always ask if she’s okay."
6457,Usually not but if they’re my friends then sometimes.
6458,"Yeah, I attempted suicide about a year ago and all my of friends were shocked. According to them I seemed like the happiest person alive"
6459,"Not really, I do have friends who pretend depressed though

Btw a little side note if you’re not depressed then don’t say you are some people really are depressed I got real pissed at this person one time for acting like she was depressed"
6460,"I wasn't the one who noticed, my friend noticed that I was really sad and talked with me"
6461,:((( I really hope you’re better now...
6462,"You can’t validate that. Depression is a spectrum. Just because somebody isn’t diagnosed with depression does not mean they do not have depression. Everybody is different, everybody handles it differently. What you see as “normalization” is them giving out a cry for help only to have people like you tear them down and invalidate their feelings. You know WHY you think they’re not depressed? Because people like you constantly tell them that they aren’t depressed just because they deal with it differently and they begin to believe it."
6463,"I'm sure she appreciates it when you show you care about her. I like that you put it's better now, because I'm not sure depression ever completely goes away."
6464,Agreed
6465,"You know depression isn’t anti-short-term-happiness, right? And also that just because somebody is depressed doesn’t mean they can’t be happy."
6466,Yes this guy I know is always happy around me but recently I found out he gets depressed a lot.
6467,"Being depressed isn’t always about the condition. Depression is an emotion most of us have felt, and if someone says they’re depressed, it doesn’t mean they think they have depression. It’s the same with anxiety. We’ve all felt anxiety but there’s a difference of having an anxious response to stressful situations as opposed to the anxiety manifesting as an illness."
6468,"Thanks, I’m really glad I failed. It kind of scared me out of my depressive state and I’ve been a whole lot better since."
6469,Have you considered that people act that way because nobody else will give them attention otherwise? It’s a cry for help.
6470,"I had a group of friends with an almost hyperactive always social friend, there was no boring time with her, years after the group was dissolved a friend showed me photos proving she was cutting herself"
6471,Yes
6472,"Yes, I know depression != being sad.  
  
Edit: I specified in my title because someone depressed may actively try to avoid ""looking depressed"" because they feel like they would burden people and such."
6473,"uh yeah me 
when i’m around my friends i’m always really happy and stuff but when i’m at home i feel like complete garbage"
6474,"bruh they’re seeking attention for help lmao. stop invalidating them for seeking help, even if it isn’t depression."
6475,"Yes.
I knew a girl that always looked happy-go-lucky and was always laughing with her friend.

She was always there to cheer anyone who would've showed even the slightest sign of sadness.
We didn't talk much since our social group were totally different, but from a 5 minute talk with her I realized she is hiding a lot of things behind her smile.

Later I heard that she was on anti-depression meds and didn't told anyone except from some very close ""friends"" (one of them just told everyone about her meds the moment they fought, I would certainly not call her a friend)"
6476,"i don’t think that’s necessarily what op means. i get what you mean, and telling people that they’re not depressed bc it’s not how exactly how you feel, is never ok. but i’ve known quite a few people to post on their stories about how depressed they are nearly every day, post pictures crying, put “depressed” in their bio and tell everyone they’re deactivating bc it’s too much and make huge deals out of it-and come back the next day. people faking depression is a big problem bc it invalidates the people who really struggle with it. i generally believe that if you feel the need to tell the entire internet/school that you’re depressed to the point everyone gets tired of it, then it’s just attention-seeking."

6484,My crush/best friend was bullied and hospitalised multiple times then she moved to here and while she looks fairly happy the slightest thing can make her have a sort of ptsd despresion flashback. I’m always on high alert because she previously hurt herself and is at risk of doing it again

6508,"Mostly the girl, but her friends as well obviously"
6509,Who are you mad at
6510,"When I was about 3 or 4 I spent DAYS writing a letter to my local mp and she never replied. I know it doesn’t sound like a big deal but to a small child who spent so long on it it sucked.

Also when I was about 10 my class all wrote letters to this politician about an environmental issue. So I put a passive aggressive comment at the end of mine referring to how long I spent to write to her before and she never replied. At least that time she did write a reply to our class"
6511,The bully I remember in kindergarten told me I was dumb because I had a dot on my hand
6512,What happened though
6513,"I remember hating this lunch supervisor in second grade, because the class was being rowdy during lunch and she said we had to listen to her and calm down. I asked why, and she said she was in charge of us. And i pulled what my friend described as ‘some romeo and Juliette type shit’, and said. ‘Well, you’re not in charge of our hearts!’ And I thought I was so cool.

Then the teacher pulled me out of class the next day to make me apologize to the lunch supervisor, because apparently I’d hurt her feelings.

Like yeah I was an asshole, but I still hate her. It’s been almost 7 years"
6514,"eh, cannot remember honestly"
6515,"Do you mean tights or leggings, because tights are a fucking nightmare and always need to be adjusted and leggings usually roll down when you sit."
6516,Tights are the spawn of Satan and often just tend to fall down and it feels like it’s baggy which isn’t a good feeling.
6517,Cause it’s true?
6518,"Tights are usually worn under dresses/ skirts and are sheer, leggings are worn whenever and are opaque."
6519,I just googled it idek the difference
6520,"They are CLEARLY signaling that they want sex with you

6528,"Not a girl but I tend to do that with my jeans a lot.

6529,"I wear biking shorts or leggings, (when it’s cold I wear fleece lined leggings) tights can burn in hell for all I care"
6530,except it's the same person lmao
6531,Makes you wonder why they call them tights when they're not really tight!
6532,[deleted]
6533,I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
6534,Agreed. But I don’t wear leggings with skirts/dresses because I hate that my shoes don’t cover the gap between leggings and socks. I do wear them under clothes tho when I’m cold.
6535,Me too :(
6536,"pants move down and if you don't pull it up, they say and it looks gross. and most girls like high waisted stuff so it helps with that as well.

Tights are sheer and are basically stockings. Whereas leggings are opaque and worn for sports and casual wear."

6538,Later virgins
6539,"In a way they kinda are, but I think that because they’re being stretched while worn they want to retract back to their smaller form"

6580,if i’m feeling sad and alone i cry myself to sleep with really sad music or i cry in the shower. if i feel like a bad bitch i play hyped up music while usually being productive(like chores or homework)
6581,Yeah reddit is pretty negative and I don’t really have online friends either
6582,I feel like we all relate
6583,"That sounds cool as fuck, I'd love to try that"
6584,"The level of success with this depends on weather tho, where I live it’s coo in the nights so your fine with a light jacket, be weary if you live in cold or neutral places"
6585,"im gettin close to that time of night, i just sit and think about whats gonna happen after corona, its hard to keep myself distracted"
6586,"Me too, I just want a hug and a back scratch."
6587,"those 3 AM nights where you can’t sleep and spend your time overthinking more than you should are THE WORST, I swear. I feel you, I always try to distract myself from those feelings thru Netflix lol"
6588,How do you cope?
6589,Yeah I don’t talk to my friends much anymore
6590,"Its not fun, especially when my irl friends have normal sleeping patterns :("
6591,yep almost every night
6592,I live in northern england so the nights are very cold
6593,Damn my awful insomnia doesn't let me do that
6594,Yeah pretty much me every night.
6595,"used to all the time but ever since i hit 18 i got used to it and have accepted loneliness, besides the only person who really gets me is me."
6596,Same lmao
6597,"Ye lockdown is making me even lonelier than usual. I miss having a social life honestly, like making online friends is hard"
6598,The only films and series I enjoy just manage to make it worse lmao
6599,cry and sleep
6600,[deleted]
6601,i do. sometimes all i want is someone to talk with during the late night and never get tired of talking with them
6602,How do you cope?
6603,"Either cry and lay there or cry and go on my phone. Probably not the best coping methods, wouldn't recommend."
6604,Thank you :)
6605,Binoculars and a tree like the good old days
6606,"That's awesome! Honestly, being obsessed with social media and posting hundreds and hundreds of selfies is a huge turn off for me"
6607,If you want you'll find a way
6608,I would have said that if I could answer lol
6609,Talk to them
6610,"it really is!! and like me and him always talk about how we wanna just not use our phones for like a while and like be ‘old school’ like actually going out and stuff and stuff like that lol without technology, but like we can’t bc i’d like our parents need to get in touch with us it’s just complicated y’know, but yeah it’s really dope"
6611,Talk to them. You don’t need to stalk someone on social media to know about them. I would find it kind of weird if I found out someone I don’t talk to or barely know looked through everything I posted and was stalking me online.
6612,But that's social interaction
6613,But that's social interaction
6614,"And what's the one rule of reddit?
 Avoid social interaction at all costs."
6615,and the key to their ~~back door~~ um i mean heart. the key to their heart.
6616,I was gonna say this lol
6617,You can reply to automod :)
6618,Op are you wanting the normal route or the creepy route? Cause I can give ya both boi
6619,why not both
6620,And I do not approve of it
6621,"If you know them then it means you see them pretty often, just focus on them and then try to get close to their friends if you know any of them, this is only for if you're too shy to straight up talk to them though"
6622,..Fucking talk to them?
6623,Follow him/her everywhere. Works until the po po catches ya
6624,"I'm almost the same way except I am definitely into online shit, but will rarely share any pictures of myself at all and try to keep info that can be tied to me to a minimum. Don't even have a Facebook and while I did register for snap I never used it lol. And no, it's not because I'm old or something, I would have a Facebook if it was..."
6625,"Ask me, I'm that kind of guy."
6626,You two sound like people I'd love to be friends with. Stay awesome ✌
6627,"ahh thanks man, you too🤟🤟"
6628,"ask for their number. i deleted all my socials, so the people i want to talk to and are important to me all have my number yeet"
6629,"Our school has a school catalogue with class photos. So it shows every high school class photo in my city and underneath each photo there are names on every student. By this I can easily stalk my crush, it would be harder if he wasn’t present in the photo and I don’t know his last name."
6630,"Talk to them and do stuff together. I don't really use social media either (except reddit, of course) so I'd be fine with it."
6631,"Im in this situation. It actually made me talk to him in person and I even asked for his phone number. It has its limitations, but I feel like I actually know him better because of it"
6632,"I'm like this I don't use Snapchat or Instagram so it's a bit harder but I would just talk, or text if you have their number"
6633,now you're getting it
6634,Or you can act all innocent and tell his parents you’re his girlfriend/friend he invited over
6635,"Pretending to be someone you arent to fit a stereotype of what girls like won't help you long term dude. I know its corny as hell, but if you genuinely embrace yourself and your characteristics, decent girls will embrace you too"
6636,"More emotional guy, easier to talk to!"
6637,"a guy who is about as emotional as i am. i’m not a super emotional person so if he was more sensitive than me it would be gross. i just want to date someone who is reasonable and doesn’t try to impress anyone with his manliness, but also doesn’t start crying when he sees a cute dog"
6638,"To be honest, I dont get why everyone keeps commenting to be yourself. The questions just asking if you like a dude thats more masculine or someone who isn't much. It's just asking which one you would prefer out of the two."
6639,"I have no plans to change who I am, I don't really have any plans to get into a relationship anytime soon so I was more just curious."
6640,"neither, i want someone who's normal and doesn't feel pressured by gender roles to act in a certain way"
6641,17M fucking wreck gang!
6642,Yay😃
6643,[deleted]
6644,"Depends. If you try really hard to be someone you are obviously not, it's gonna show. I personally like it right down the middle. If you are super emotional and cry because things don't go your way (like small petty things) that's kinda weird (like it would be for girls) but if you are super 'tough' and act like this bad boy it's kinda obnoxious."
6645,"I like this response, brutally honest :D ty for the info"
6646,"I literally go through guilt thinking, “I just ended this creature’s life, and for what? So I can eat Hot Cheetos and watch YouTube ‘safer’?” My girlfriend’s the same tho haha"
6647,Thanks goodness. I’m not up for pretending to be tough or “hard”
6648,Because  someone asking girls what type of man they like hints towards OP trying to change himself which no one wants
6649,"That's kinda what OP meant about being ""not manly"""
6650,"he was asking who YOU prefer, not who everyone else prefers"
6651,Holy shit are you me but with a girlfriend
6652,"Perhaps! Just two years older, though.

So that could mean *someone* will be getting a girlfriend sometime soon... :D"
6653,Guys who can be emotional are attractive asf. I think guys who try to be tough and act manly are dry conversationalists. I need substance and someone I can relate to because I can be a bit emotional myself.
6654,like literally embrace? cause i need a hug
6655,"Huh, that's a good system to sort out the problem. Well done!"
6656,"True but I guess it kinda gets a bit annoying when everyone says to ""Be yourself"" or ""That they only care about personality"" when the question wasn't asking that, it was literally just asking what of the two options do girls prefer. It's kinda similar on ATB where a girl would ask, ""Do girls prefer girls that are fat or skinny"" and all the comments would be ""I don't mind fat girls"" or ""Don't change yourself, I only care about personality"" etc when they're really only saying that so OP isn't hurt. I know they're trying to do a good thing but it just gives them fake opinions and ruins the whole point in asking."
6657,"Please flair yourself

6658,"1) trying to be someone else doesn't work
2) it depends, different girls have different preferences"
6659,i once killed an ant and thought what would his family think
6660,This..... btw flair urself
6661,[deleted]
6662,you’re welcome lol
6663,"im reading these comments and ill just be frank. i see that many people are commenting things like ""just be yourself!"" or other things quite clearly encouraging those guys who are more emotional and less manly, but i dont think it should be considered a negative thing for girls to like manly men. to be honest, i personally like emotional guys better, but it should be totally fine for girls to like ""manly"" guys too. sorry for the ted talk"
6664,"That's wack lol "" do you like someone who's a person or who only thinks about lumber"""
6665,"You got a few choices here, either keep things as they are or confront her. Smart move is to confront her, ask her why she does these things with you if she doesn't want to pursue a romantic relationship with you. Ask her any unresolved questions, then at this point one of two things will happen. You'll either start dating, or you won't. Be honest and truthful, but she can't keep playing these games with you and needs to make up her mind. If she decides to pursue a romantic relationship with you, all the better. If not, accept the loss and learn from it. Move on, hopefully y'all can still be friends after all. Either way, it's not the end of the world and in a year or two it won't even matter anymore."
6666,Thanks for the advice. I’m going to bring it up the next time I see her. I think this is a in person conversation rather than a text one
6667,Please post an update
6668,"Yeah cause that’s the only reason someone may not like you...

grow up buddy"
6669,"When there’s something to update I certainly will!!! If only for that sweet sweet karma, lol."
6670,You slept together. They obviously like you
6671,"Yeah, i always recommend serious talks in person that way they can't avoid you and the message is more clear."
6672,Kiss her yo
6673,"I agree, but she doesn’t seem to want to be in a relationship. I’ve asked her and she doesn’t want to"
6674,Update us on how it goes! I wish you luck!
6675,"I agree. Even more so with this girl, she’s so quiet and reserved over the phone but is so much fun in person"
6676,"I’d agree if not for the fact that we’ve been on dates together. Also, people that have known her longer than I have say this is the first time she’s done this with anyone"
6677,ok also...straight girls cuddle all the time so it might not be out of the question to say she just wants to be friends
6678,Dont
6679,What did he say?
6680,Thanks!!! When there’s something to update I’ll make an update post. I didn’t expect so many people so be interested in this 😅
6681,If you read my posts on r/teenagers I have seen something like this before but I wasn't involved
6682,[deleted]
6683,"No problem at all! We go to different schools but I was invited to a senior event at hers. It ran late and the two of us along with two other mutual friends slept over at one of their houses. We had been kinda teasing with stuff all day. We moved into the living room and she invited me to sit on the couch next to her, and then bleh. It evolved or whatever. 

We just held each other idk. The shirt I wore that night still smelled like her and it was sweet. I remember listening to her heartbeat as I fell asleep in her arms"
6684,"Pansexual. Looks at the person, not their gender. At least that’s my understanding. 

I live in a big city so rose fields are the most common here XD. But I know what you mean, I’m planning on trying something soon. She lives a good distance away, which makes things complicated, but she’s around during the week"
6685,ahh ok
6686,"I thought you meant to shoot myself with a flare, I was like that’s disrespectful wtf did I do"
6687,"Well, I wouldn’t date someone I didn’t find attraction, that’s just my opinion, thx for the downvotes, I’ll just not answer when you guys ask -_-"
6688,"Definitely. It’s been a few weeks now and I’m already over her. She turned out to be mean and possibly racist, so I don’t think I’m missing out on much"
6689,"Pan?

Also, kiss her after a romantic outing, set up a picnic in a field of roses, then let it go to where it's supposed to."
6690,"Maybe she just doesnt feel comfortable being in a you know gay relationship,i dont mean anything bad perhaps shes just a bit scared about that and is afraid of what people are gonna think,if thats the case because i dont know if she is openly pan or not !"

6696,Made a my little pony instagram fan account with a friend of mine. Let’s just say thank GOD it was private
6697,"Even things from only a year ago, I cringe at"
6698,Same! And I forgot the password so it’s there forever
6699,When I was 9 I went through a 6-month weaboo phase and I vomit in my mouth everytime I think about it.
6700,An old YouTube channel. There's a video of 9 year old me barking like a dog (among other weird things) somewhere on that site and I can't find the password to delete it.
6701,"Lol no I don't look at that stuff, just my insta posts were cringe but they are deleted"
6702,"My facebook account from 4 years ago...damn the ""memes"" that I shared"
6703,"Well, now it's TikTok..."
6704,Weebs are fine AYAYA Clap
6705,I'm looking at you old roblox account.
6706,Im surprised every sentence you wrote didn't end in f***
6707,Same 🤣
6708,"I had a YouTube account when I was 12. I uploaded about 30-40 videos and then stopped lol. I'm still using the same account. 



Looking at the videos, it's easy to see that my voice has become infinitely deeper and that THE VIDEOS ARE FUCKING CRIGE. LIKE, WHY ARE YOU SINGING THERE, DO SOME ENTERTAINING COMMENTARY."
6709,"Hell, I do this with things I post from yesterday"
6710,i’m so glad my parents forced me to private my account there
6711,I still have my YouTube account from back in the day and I still use it. It's kinda cool to see how much I've changed over the years on one account.
6712,"I was on Facebook for the longest time. Yeah, I deleted my Facebook account. I one time made a comment saying: ""I f*cking hate the police."" Yeah, imagine how embarrassing it was to explain that to my parents. I was 11 at the time. Lucky for me, I don't have my social media platforms monitored anymore. Once I was 13 I was no longer monitored on social media because they believed I was responsible enough to start doing things on my own."
6713,"Yep, I had an old YouTube channel when I was 9. It was so horrible that I took nearly every video down...

One video on that channel was a video showing a popular YouTuber stuttering and mispronounced the word “sit” and I titled it “(youtuber) SWEARS! NOT CLICKBAIT”

It got 1.4k views, but it also got a 6% like:dislike ratio (2 likes, 30 ish dislikes.) I made a new channel in 2018 and my videos are a whole lot better now."

6718,My vine account from when I was 11
6719,Nope. Didn’t have social media until twitch in September 2018 which I tried to make look professional rather than funny or anything like that
6720,"My parents kept me away from technology, and i was certainly not able to make any accounts, so luckily i was spared"
6721,"This is why I refuse to scroll down in what I’ve posted on Instagram, 5th grade me was very cringy and I would love to delete all the cringe, but then I would have no more posts :|"
6722,I still have my old instagram account from when I was 12 and I forgot my password and email so I can't delete it
6723,"Nope the complete opposite, I laugh at how crazy and silly I was. I actually miss my old self she was amazing."
6724,I mean thank god I never made a musically but I do regret a lot of older posts I posted 💀
6725,Yea I'm a sophomore and I've been asked out a few times but that doesn't mean it's the same for everyone.
6726,I’ve been hit on a couple times but I always shut it down before they ask me out so... sort of but not really. I think it’d actually a smaller percentage than you’d think that have actually been asked out on a date
6727,Ouch.
6728,Idk you but there’s probably a guy who’s too shy to talk to you somewhere in your school
6729,"Dunno, haven't been asked out and probably never will"
6730,Haha I wish #homeschooledgang
6731,Why do you shut it down before they ask you out?
6732,"lol not true. I’m the one that did the asking out instead lol. It might be common, but it certainly doesn’t happen to everyone."
6733,*sweet home Alabama intensifies*
6734,"Not who you responded too but sometimes I'm not actually hitting on a girl and she thinks I am, where I'm just trying to make a friend. Happened twice now"
6735,Not really in the mindset to have a boyfriend and I doubt I ever will be tbh. It’s just not something I see for myself
6736,"Like maybe. I have never been the one asked out, and I'm too afraid to ask my crush out, so it's just me rambling to my friends about how cute my crush is but none of them are picking up on my ""hey can you help a bro out here and ask if they like anyone!?""  ;w; so yeah, maybe, but not for me. Most of my peers go through boyfriends like galaxys in a selection box :/"
6737,Same id say the majority have been asked out
6738,[removed]
6739,Well as a boy I like to say that someone asking you out is nice
6740,why
6741,"Wait, that’s illegal"
6742,"Actually, it’s not depending on your state. Most states have laws on how many years apart you can be (and your parent a have to play it). In mine, you can be one or two years apart (so a 14 & 16 yo could)."
6743,I’m a junior and have never had a boyfriend who wasn’t online *finger guns*
6744,Im in the last year of highschool and no girls have asked me out so far
6745,"They’ve all made it quite obvious (flirting, confession of feelings, stuff like that) never asked me out though because I’m always open about the fact that I don’t want anything so they know I’ll say no. I hate people that assume tbh. You don’t know what people intentions are until they tell you."
6746,"I mean, I never have been either but trust me, the right guy will come along. Just wait 😁"
6747,I’m sure the right girl will come along soon!
6748,I’ve been asked out twice during my time in secondary school. so guess it’s true?
6749,"Yeah but for me it’s always creeps. Like in freshman year, a junior who I had spoken to twice got a hold of my phone number and asked me to prom. I said no."
6750,No. I’m a sophomore and I’ve never even gotten a compliment before.
6751,Fair enough.
6752,"I think it depends what school you go to. Ive never been asked out by anyone in school and dont know anyone who has. If it happened I think we would all think its strange. However ive been asked out outside of school several times. Dont worry too much about not having anyone interested in you at your school, the world is so much bigger ❤️"
6753,Not necessarily true. I have never been asked out in school and I’m about halfway through my second quarter of junior year. If you mean at all I was asked out online when I was in 8th grade. Depending on what you mean I either do or don’t fit.
6754,Fuck
6755,"Because they are written by adults. I guess they are trying to remember what it was like when they were kids, but, their memory is a bit hazy."
6756,I guess that's one way 2 look at it!! Sometimes it's so unrealistic that it's just funny tho imo
6757,Riverdale is a great example. Wow those are some pretty old looking highschoolers. I guess I went to the boring schools were students aren't having sex with their band teacher or trying to solve a murder for some reason.
6758,"RIVERDALE.

WHO THE HELL GOES TO SCHOOL IN DRESSES & HEELS & WHAT 16-17 LOOKS LIKE THAT

it makes me so mad lmaooo"
6759,They only remember the good
6760,XD
6761,hello my fellow teens (says with his rock hard abs and five o'clock shadow)
6762,honestly when I lived in Mexico I thought American high school was like this. When I actually got to high school over here in America I was like “damn this shit is nothing like the movies ;((“
6763,"To add to this, I guess it’s because generations change so much that what life was like for them as a teenager isn’t what life is like now as a teenager?"
6764,"i mean like casual dresses? they’re cute i have no problem with that. but when veronica freaking lodge comes out wearing a $300 bodycon dress with 4 inch stilettos, that’s where i draw the line lmao

& what’s with none of the girls having backpacks? you’re telling me u can fit all ur books in that tiny little purse"
6765,"I disagree. A teens life can be as escing as an adult's it depends on who and how they tell the story. Raven the most boring things can be made interesting if you give the job to the right person.

An example of a movie that talks about teens life's and all that is Seventh Grade by Bo Burnham. Bo is a old school youtuber and is seriously amazing. Cheek it out"
6766,"I wear dresses to school. Not the most fancy ones through, just normal dresses because they look cute. I don't wear heels through."
6767,"Yep, and even if the writers are kinda young, the older producers have to approve the script. Do you think THEY have any clue what is going on?"
6768,"I mean a lot of is is based on truth. My dad said all those movies of mean girls and high school jock bullies were realistic when he was a teenager. But times changed and it’s not as much like that anymore in most cases (I think, I’m not from America). But then when it comes to river dale, that’s just for entertainment. For euphoria and skins, the reason a lot of us love those shows is because we know it’s far fetched and over exaggerated but that’s what makes it fun for us."
6769,Sex education is one of the one's that I think portrays teenage life really well
6770,"Yes, true."
6771,Cuz it has to be interesting
6772,I would love to try to see someone make watching someone do calculus interesting. Yeah I know of Bo Burnham. Haven't seen Eighth Grade but I know it was a lot of award
6773,"idk, lol. the only movie I've seen that somewhat accuratly portrays teenage life is ""a silent voice"", but even that is slightly exaggerated in a few aspects"
6774,Tru!! but sometimes films are wayy too unrealistic to take seriously imo
6775,"Some things are more challenging than other, calculus is definitely up there. If you got an hour to spend, I really suggest seeing eighth grade, it's really good."
6776,meanwhile I consider it a good day when I wear jeans to class instead of whatever I wore to bed
6777,Literally any show/movie where the teens are played by adults
6778,"@ teen wolf

I mean seriously we didn’t look like that in hs"
6779,"Even that is a bit over the top sometimes. In my opinion, sometimes it tries *too* hard to be accurate"
6780,"Not all of them are bad, personally even though I’m not a girl I thought Diary of a Teenage Girl portrays certain aspects teenage life pretty well (more in a figure way then literal)"
6781,[removed]
6782,I go to school in dresses and heels
6783,bro true. like how are they supposed to be 17? i’m 17 & look 10 years younger lmaooo
6784,Unrealistically written by people who have their teenage years way behind them. Portraying normal life would be boring
6785,I would melt lol
6786,"I've been doing this with a boy for a few weeks now. Definitely try and talk to her, whether IRL or on Snap/Insta/Etc! If she's smiling back at you when she notices you looking, there's a good chance she likes you back. If I see a guy staring at me and I'm not interested, I either just simply look away or give him a dirty look if it's getting creepy lol."
6787,"Depends on the smile you give, but it should be fine"
6788,"yeah, i'd be pretty flattered"
6789,..What if you're the girl that he's talking about?
6790,"are you and your friends doing parties? maybe invite her to one and have some fun!

dance, talk and drink together(of course only if you are allowed to drink where you live)"
6791,That would be a slightly embarrassing yet time-saving coincidence.
6792,I think its okay :)
6793,I think it's fine as long as you're friendly and aren't staring.
6794,It would be hilarious
6795,LOL
6796,Isnt that the most causal way of flirting
6797,No it’s totally not weird. I do this with a guy I like. You definitely should talk to her!!
6798,"Honestly, if a guy is making you uncomfortable, you should go talk to him and tell him that he’s making you uncomfortable."
6799,Ughh 😫
6800,No it wouldn’t... it’d be sad...
6801,yeah wtf
6802,"But, he’s actually right."
6803,[deleted]
6804,🗿
6805,"No dude.

Thats the 1st test,if she smiles back its the green flag!"
6806,"Man, I hate being homeschooled."
6807,(Or if you don't be stupid about it)
6808,"hmmm, sounds like

r/oddlyspecific"
6809,h m m m
6810,F
6811,"I should try this then, I kinda ignore my crush as she's with her friends"
6812,I know it's just unnecessary to say
6813,That’s literally one guy. That doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen anytime soon lol.
6814,Bruh I’ll be honest just start saying like “hey what’s up?” And dapping eachother up and then you’ll start conversing and then you’ll be IN
6815,yeah same I'm awkward af
6816,Yeah but im awk asf so its better to just not
6817,Awkward gang gang
6818,Ya! .... ^(just don't check my search history cia)  👀
6819,gang gang 💫
6820,Same but I'm also dry
6821,"Oh really 👀

~~you should have seen some of my history, there are some quite disgustang and disturbing stuff lmfao~~"
6822,"See, the thing about me is that I really like talking to and hanging out with people, but my brain and it's stupid awkwardness always gets in the way and it annoys me. You see what I mean?"
6823,I might be the hottest bitch around here but I am by no means outgoing
6824,"Yes marthamay-who is super nice ☺️

did you expect a sarcastic comment? this time there's none. I like you martha, that's it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
6825,Yes. Always. Social anxiety fucks me all the time.
6826,Ngl you are one of the girls I am kinda scared to approach because you look so pretty
6827,"W H A T?

I'm scary? 😭"
6828,Girls girls... Nothing can compare to a lot of dudes search history. There's some revolting shit on there
6829,"Yeah, especially this one girl... I have a chance every day but I always blow it.."
6830,"N-n-no, you are not scary at all! *Panic alarms*

I don't want to make myself look like a fool around people, that is all :)"
6831,"Yeah I got some weird shit on there, I have like 300 hentai links, of the most disturbing shit you could imagine, I don't even watch anime I did it just because."
6832,"I want to talk with a lot of people, just vent my feelings and everything. I want this so much. But I don't know how. I don't know if it's awkard to just text my friend and say all this because we don't text much. I don't want to talk about it with my best friend 'cause I know that wouldn't help me. So I basically just don't talk much and keep everything locked inside and wait untill it either destroy me or just blows up and I'll go completely mad. That's my daily torture."
6833,">These people are really accepting and nice

Isn't someone downvoting your comments/posts from the morning?"
6834,">none of us are outgoing..

I am"
6835,Yes.... not just this morning for a few days now:/ but that's just one person with his alt
6836,"And that's why I have no female friends except online, I never step out of my comfort zone."
6837,This is literally my mindset most of the time lmao
6838,lube up then /s
6839,You pissed someone😶
6840,"One of my friends is literally a hentai critic. He sends me hentai and he wants my opinion on it and then he gives his own opinion. ""Hentai is an art"""
6841,👁👄👁
6842,We’re all awkward so at least here you dont have to worry about us being out going n shit
6843,Nothing...
6844,Wait you thought I was fr all this time? 😣
6845,That ain't being a pussy. That's straight up being smart about it.
6846,👑 you dropped this
6847,Guys can be really oblivious so it's usually better to be obvious about it
6848,It's not that we're oblivious. We can read hints perfectly well. It's just acting on said hints which is hard.
6849,"Well it'd probably be smarter just to be honest and open with your emotions, but that would be too easy yk"
6850,"For some of us it is hard to read hints. Especially if those hints are coming from your crush, then you end up just assuming that you’re just looking to much into it because of how much you want to be with her."
6851,"I'm usually very overanalysing and good at picking up even subtle hints myself, so i just try to be around the guy as much as possible and try to guess if he likes me as well, and then maybe dropping hints to him too.
The bad thing is that nobody never liked me back, so i don't really know how to drop hints."
6852,You are amazing. Take your crown king.
6853,"*Queen?

no... Goddess."
6854,I have bad social anxiety so dropping hints is the only thing I can do. Unless I’m drunk.
6855,"Fair enough, socialising is hard"
6856,"that was a reference to their username,  not cringe, and happy cake day!"
6857,IT'S STUPID JUST TELL HIM WHAT YOU WANT
6858,"Bruh we don’t do it because it’s “fun.” We do it because we don’t want our feelings to be too obvious just in case they aren’t returned. 

As for the creep thing, no sane person is going to call you a creep for asking a girl out and getting rejected. You’ll get called a creep if you come on in an overly sexual manner, try to convince her after she turns you down, get mad/butthurt if she says no, or disrespect her boundaries."
6859,"Yeah dude, you're right. That's the fucking definition of pussy. Because that's exactly what the guy will think: ""naah, she wasn't flirting with me""."
6860,"Actually tho, unless you lowkey tell me, dont care how you do it, im 8.5/10 not gonna figure it out"
6861,"Same lol


I'm too insecure to think that anybody likes me so if there is a chance (a rather slim one) and then he notices the hints and that's great!But if I read them wrong at least I won't embarrass myself."
6862,Sometimes. Hints are fine but it's a huge risk in taking them and the reward sometimes isn't worth it hence why some of us don't take the risk.
6863,that's actially a coincidence. I didn't know that!
6864,Exactly! Don’t want to assume she’s into you if she’s just a genuinely nice person.
6865,A mistake I have made all too often.
6866,"Tell me watchu want, watchu really really want,"
6867,I wish everyone (including me) did this. It’d make everything so much more easy
6868,"lmao, a good coincidence :p"
6869,"physical contact, start conversations, u know the usual"
6870,"I don't think guys should be expected to do anything that the girl can do as well. A girl can ask the guy out, the girl can pay for dinner, the girl can take the guy out on a date. Some people expect the guy to do everything. Both people in the relationship need to put in equal effort."
6871,hello you are our savior
6872,it is a pretty good coincidence. its crazy how stuff like this can happen
6873,yeah i’m surprised that not many people do this. when i decided i like someone i’m just like “hey i like u wanna go on a date sometime” and if they say no (which they usually don’t) ur just like “alright that’s fine” and if they say yes then good for u

6876,Too have a shlong must feel awkward to just... I don't know pee while standing. But the best pros is you don't have boobs. Without boob sweat my life would be ten times better.

6884,"I definitely think about what it's like to have a penis too lol. I'm curious what it feels like, what it would look like, and what it's like to always pee standing!"
6885,External plumbing might be interesting. Idk I'd like people to look at me and not judge me for being a girl and think that I need help. And I'd be interested to know what a boner feels like. And I think I'll regret replying when am less high
6886,A solid portion of men still pee sitting down because of occasional forks in the road that can catch you off guard
6887,Yeah and I just wanna be hugged
6888,having a flat chest..... that would be bliss
6889,"Yeah I wanna try pissing standing up it sounds soooo fun like a minigame 

also then I could get a bassy mic and beatbox and not sound stupid"
6890,Not when you get swampdick. Shits bad
6891,[removed]
6892,But then you get ball sweet
6893,How do you know what it tastes like?

6900,How can you assure me? You've never had a dick
6901,How do you know that?
6902,Same except I wanna be a girl instead of a dude with a vagina.
6903,I don't know why it ever became the default to pee while standing because it's objectively a worse way to do it.

6905,online friend moment
6906,"I mean, I was 14 in middle school. That’s 8th grade for me"
6907,Most 14 years aren't in middle school
6908,"tbh 14 is prolly the peak in bitchiness from what I've seen, and 14-year-olds love to act older than they are. Just try and not be the typical ""iM nOt lIkE tHe oThEr gIrLs"" bullshit. Everyone grows out of it eventually. 

High school isn't all that great tbh, so just embrace being a kid because you'll get to a point where you're months away from applying to college and crying yourself to sleep because you wasted your early teens by being edgy and acting like you were better than everyone else because you didn't dress up or look for boys or anything when in reality you were just too afraid to put yourself out there and now  you regret not enjoying your youth before rona hit and you're basically playing catch up to the stupid teen stuff you never did because you were just too scared (not speaking from personal experience or anything :D). 

Just be the best version of yourself and people will gravitate towards you. Trust me on this. If someone doesn't like you, move on to the next person. No point in wasting time on someone who doesn't want to get to know you. I've heard someone say that making friends is not that far from dating in that you have to put yourself out there and make an effort to meet people, and that you're gonna deal with some rejection but you're also going to meet great people. Don't be afraid of rejection. 

If you don't have that many friends, focus on the ones you do and make sure they are quality friendships. Quality > quantity. And just enjoy being a kid. Please. Do stupid kid stuff. Please. Your second semester junior self is going to thank you. Trust me. (sorry for the long answer)"
6909,"Just be nice, start conversations, and don’t expect to be friend right away. Maybe join a club or something to find a girl that has common interests y’all can talk about."
6910,Heh all the female friends I have are online friends and I even have plans to meet one of them when I am 18
6911,"fuck no, free speech boiii"
6912,Im still 14 and just finished my freshman year
6913,"I’ve noticed that quite a lot of girls are bitches (this is from my experience, I know that there are a lot of very awesome girls out there). This was in Junior High, so I’m hoping it changes in high school. I would say, approach the nice ones, be nice, strike up a conversation, and stay consistent by keeping in touch."
6914,I was 14 and a sophomore for a bit
6915,"don’t see them as girls? just think of them as other people. most girls don’t want to be seen as a “girl” friend, they want to be seen as just a friend. i think if you change the way you look at them, you’ll feel more confident talking to them. you have to recognize that not all girls feel the same, just as not all boys feel the same."
6916,"In general people who you think are mean you probably shouldn't be friends with anyway, not just girls. If someone seems nice then just be nice back, nobody is friends with everyone."
6917,"The second part spoke to me on a personal level. I don't wanna be the kind of person that says ""enjoy yourself while you can"" but... I sure as hell wish I did that. Two years ago I only had 2 friends, now only one. Since the lockdown started I barely talked to people outside my family."
6918,I'm gonna be a 13 year old freshman
6919,"The girls I was friends with in middle school were funny but didn’t make sexist or racist jokes. Don’t be a jerk. 
They also tried to look nice! Girls gravitate to others that have some sense of style, and generally care about their appearance. It really decided the hierarchy of popularity in high school too. Not saying that’s the most fair thing, it’s just how it was. 
Be nice! Talk to them! Make them laugh. Don’t think too hard about it. If they’re cool, they’ll see that you’re cool too."
6920,"From my experience there is drama with guys as well. It just depends on the people, not the gender."
6921,I was this year
6922,that's not really a bad thing I was one too till late October
6923,"I felt like that when I was your age. I think whats different now is that I have a lot more confidence that lets me speak up and try to engage in conversation. I also let go of a couple childhood ""friends"" whose toxicity was holding me back socially. For a really long time, I thought that ""the other girls just don't like me"", but recently I started thinking, ""Maybe they think *I* don't like *them*?"". That made me try talking to them more, and being nice to them. Gradually over time, it actually started working! I get along with my female classmates much better now than I used to.  
There are a couple things to keep in mind though about being nice and getting along with the other girls:  
1. Your enviroment has everything to do with wether you're able to get along with the other girls or not. If you notice that theres a toxic girl (or several toxic girls) who is ""in charge"" and everyone else is just following her/them, you might have a problem. If the ""boss"" has decided she doesn't like you for whatever reason (could be shes jealous or envious of you, shes salty about a thing you said one time that you don't even remember, or maybe she just likes singling you out for being different) you're going to have a hard time. And sometimes you're in an environment where there isn't even a ""boss"", it's just that all the girls are united under a common interest that you don't have, so they're not interested in talking to you. You might be nice, but unfortunately, the other girls might not always be nice enough to talk to you.  
2. Even when you're being nice to the other girls, you have to make sure not to become a doormat. You might end up becoming that one ""friend"" they only talk to when they want your help with something. That isn't what you want, you want their respect and to be their equal. Being nice while also standing up for yourself can be hard to balance, but I figured it out, so I believe you can too!"
6924,"Mean people can change, same with nice people."
6925,it is very bad.
6926,If u wanna talk hmu. Tbh I don’t do well in that department either.
6927,"Easiest way for me is by goofing around with people sitting near me. It's really hard for me to go up and start conversations with random people so if you want to make friends, start with the people around you. Also, joining clubs will help you meet more people with similar interests"
6928,bruh i'm a girl too tho
6929,collegeboard has me fucked up man
6930,"Luckily in my country is easier to get into college, but with med school it is hard anyway. I just bought a book to prepare for the entrance test and b o y is it _huge_"
6931,[deleted]
6932,">quite a lot of girls are bitches 

sounds kinda “pick-me” but ok"
6933,"your tone is a bit ""not like other girls"" tbh"
6934,Freedom of speech is probably the only good ng other than the right to bear arms
6935,I try to make friends on here but fail :')
6936,"If you want we can definitely start chatting. I'm just saying because that's what we both want. If you do, hit me up on private message first. If you dont want to, just ignore this comment. It wont hurt my feelings."
6937,How do you make friends?
6938,How do you make friends on Reddit?
6939,lol he living his life getting girls left and right
6940,Same
6941,"You slap someone's fuel carborator really hard, and then you eat a glass of ketchup. That's how I have made all of my imaginary friends at least..."
6942,"I’m totally here for that but currently most people who dm me are all over 21. So another teen sure, a lurker no thanks."
6943,I’m here to help teens make sense of this crazy messed up world we live in. Meeting new people and seeing how other teens think is a bonus
6944,That's actually really sweet and well put
6945,The only pm I’ve ever gotten from this sub was from one of those pedos on r/askteenboys  trying to explain themselves.
6946,He's living the dream lmao
6947,"I'm actually curious, what did they say?"
6948,"I don't really like the romance stuff, I usually just read the questions"
6949,I thought I had it saved in my messages but apparently not. I remember how it started out. “ Dude that was a huge misunderstanding 😐. I’m sick of guys on (some site I don’t know) so I was trying to find someone to sext with and I understand that teen boys weren’t the best for that” there were more words but I couldn’t remember them.
6950,"I've had people PM me after seeing a post or me commenting on theirs. With a couple of these people, we ended up hitting it off and exchanging snapchats and Instagrams. Someone on here 2 years ago PMed me randomly and we still talk to this day.

So it kinda just randomly happens."
6951,"Pfft, excuses. As if that validates their actions on the sub lmao. I've seen those posts, and they don't seem like any ""misunderstanding""

> I was trying to find someone to sext with and I understand that teen boys weren't the best for that

Considering the sub is called ""AskTeenBoys"" I don't think that reasoning is valid either. But anyway, thanks for sharing!"
6952,Oh my god... of course they are only imaginary if you forget to slam your head against the walls of your room...
6953,Ur not lone for ever... You met someone...
6954,I’m down to make friends. If anyone wants to chat message me 🐬!
6955,"This speaks right to me, witchcraft!"
6956,"Hey, i introduce you to me! i exist!"
6957,Let me introduce myself.. 😂
6958,"Can we just make a chain of replies for people who’d be open to chatting?

If you like memeing, nihilistic, depressed assholes who have literally forgotten how to genuinely be nice and second guess everything they do, slide on into this guy’s DMs."
6959,Haha you‘re dumb as fuck. You have to kick a person right into the stomach to become friends with them!
6960,I really just come on to voice different opinions and see others views on different topics. But all honesty is be perfectly happy with making some friends from here
6961,"I'd like some advice

How does one do this thing that you call ""dating?"""
6962,this ^
6963,"It’s still a top level comment, meaning it broke rule 5."
6964,"I don’t care how you tell the OP about the issue, you could do it by carrier pidgeon for all I care. But rules are rules and it’s been like this for months."
6965,"Yeah, I wanna be friends with Cynical but I honestly don't think he does :/ every convo we have now is barely a convo"
6966,"Yeah, that's definitely on me, my apologies

It's not that I don't want to be friends, it's moreso that in my current predicament, i.e. not having the means to consistently access reddit, I just ended up prioritizing interaction with the sub as a whole over interaction with specific people

Ideally, when I get my phone back, if I get it, that'll change :)"
6967,Too many times. Every once in a while I try it out but most of the time it doesn't work
6968,"idk why you got downvoted lol, people expect you to know everyone on this sub and it’s dumb"
6969,Whose cynical?
6970,"yeah, has happened a couple of times"
6971,What's gay 😡
6972,"Exsactly 

It's kinda gay ngl😤"
6973,"You.


Lmfao, get rekt"
6974,Aye it is sad
6975,"This happened to me legit couple months ago. Had a girl I never really knew before but then really started talking and texting a lot, and then realized we had a thing for each other but then it fell our cuz I miscommunicated. We had a period of couple weeks where we didn’t really talk, but now we’re texting a lot more and it seems we’ve resolved it. I guess my message is, idk what your situation is, but if its anything like mine I’d honestly tell you to try and restart the friendship if the other person wasn’t a jackass. Likely they too feel sad they lost you, but don’t know how to restart the relationship, so taking initiative might help a lot idk"
6976,Aww Ruby ): that sucks
6977,Yeah he is :/
6978,am not smh
6979,"Dude, he is a guy and the other one was a girl."
6980,"Not really, no"
6981,These girls I met from drivers ed. I have their email addresses but idk how to reach out 😔
6982,He's a cool dude

6985,And you dk how to initiate being more than acquaintances :-(
6986,"dw the cunt has made 50 posts about how im perfect and is the same with me, he still loves us really :)"
6987,But recently I have been talking to someone who is actually interested in being friends
6988,Still gay ngl
6989,Yes
6990,"too many times, it's almost like they just don't like me when they got to know me more."
6991,Once met this really nice girl. She gave me her number and we talked a little on WhatsApp. After I got my new phone (old one broke) I waited for her to text me. I think she just doesn't like me anymore. I miss her. We didn't have much conversations and couldn't really call each other friends. And if she reads this : Selina please text me I'll send you more pictures of my cat. Bitte komm zurück 😔
6992,"Saaaaame, girl of my dreams. Debatably one of the cutest girls in the state, now dating some skater fuck boy with like 5k followers on Instagram and I can’t help but compare myself to him constantly."
6993,Just be yourself no matter what :) there are lot of ppl that just look to have fun only without caring
6994,"That’s great! I’m glad :)

I honestly don’t know much about you other than you’re Caitlin’s bf but you seem cool <3 hope things work out"
6995,"I cannot stress this enough: that ass. 

But tbh if a guy has a sense of humor I die. And if he's respectful of all people that's all I need."
6996,"There's nothing in particular I go looking for, I just know when I know, sometimes you'll be surprised"
6997,Oh shit so smooth
6998,"Try to talk about interests. Start with things that y’all have in common, and branch or from that. Soon, hopefully, you’ll find an activity you both enjoy and you can invite her to do said activity. This has never actually happened to me, but this is probably the best way for it to play out, and I hope it happens to me someday :/"
6999,"This. I think in general as kids and young adults we think there’s a set way to fall in love with someone. Truth is it just happens. You could share nothing in common, they could not be “your type.” It’s being at the right place in your life, and same for them. You two cross paths and you love each other, and sometimes you guys aren’t compatible, you fight and break up, and that’s okay. You’ll find someone else to love. It’s random and doesn’t make sense. Love is love, be open to it, and don’t get tunnel vision on the process, a single person, semantics, etc.

Sorry I’m on my soapbox but it’s something I feel really passionate about."
7000,Oh my god how the fuck do you do that
7001,"saying good morning/ good night is a great way to keep in touch. 
saying hi when you pass by her is also great too"
7002,"Good sense of humor, common sense, and willing to just sit back and play video games w/ me. Also, I really like it when they tend not to care too much about being touchy. I mean, hugs please. Friendly elbows are a dream, and don’t even get me started on head pats. God. Head pats,"
7003,"sense of humor is huge in my opinion, usually what starts my attraction towards someone in the first place"
7004,Thank you for this.
7005,"That's a very relevant answer, dear automod"
7006,I love a guy who's very respectful towards your beliefs and you in general and also has common interests.
7007,"So I‘m more of a funny guy I‘ve been told. Thats prolly due to my really really dark humor. So everytime I make a joke that one girl I have a crush on is smiling and looking at me. The problem is most of the people do that. Does this have anything to say? I‘m really insecure about myself so asking her out would be *way* out of my comfort zone. Yea. (We barely speak, I wish thoug haha)"
7008,"Why would anyone pat someone else's head?
Ok now I am confused,but intrigued..
*perhaps*"
7009,"Someone who isn't perfect, very respectful and basically takes nothing for granted (i.e. is it okay if I play music? Of course but still ask, can I walk with you, yeah duh, but still ask). just some things I appreciate."
7010,"Nope it's actually more common to be funny to a wider range of people. There is also a little thing called ""sense of humour"" that helps you tell funny jokes depending on the person you're talking to. Common sense helps too."
7011,I love it when he makes me laugh and smile!

7017,"It can be multiple things, like how you ruffle somebody’s hair to show friendship, to a simple pat, it just kinda. Feels right, I guess. 

It can also just be a matter of “I was bored and you were nearby, so pay attention to me”"

7019,"I do too, its just that I find something to say to amuse the person I'm talking to most of the time. Like you said, with my friends I can make dark and edgy jokes and with other people I make lighter jokes, for example with my family. I cant use what I find funniest with everyone, which is what you said but I crack a joke for everyone to loght up the mood."
7020,"That’s okay! It just means touching isn’t one of you preferences. It’s not like anybody would pressure you to do it, or receive it! But, you might not want to say that to someone you’re trying to court. It can come off as violent and scary. Especially if the person just flat-out forgot and you just socked them for something they didn’t remember."

7027,My dick bleeds every month... does that count?
7028,Why is this post girls only you sexist. Smh my head
7029,Yeah yesterday i cried when my mom asked me to take the trash out and today I was like yeah ok that’s why
7030,My anxiety spikes really badly like the 2 days before and is normally high during it too 🙄 let's not even mention all the crying
7031,I’m always sad and anxious so I can’t use that to predict
7032,"I can understand why it would be like this (simply numbers and most FtM don't want to talk about these things, which makes sense haha. Idk why I got downvoted 🤷"
7033,I get sad and want to kill everyone around me
7034,Yeah but I get really angry as well
7035,"Same, I hate getting my period"
7036,Nope.
7037,"one week I'm crazy horny;
then emotional af;
period. 
every month dude"
7038,Nah. I just get really fucking sad and anxious.
7039,That's a whole ass mood

Makes sense now lmao"
7048,Damn. Sounds like me too tbh
7049,How come?
7050,"Bruh only thing i feel after crying is an empty void, so basically i feel like someone is prying my chest open 24/7"
7051,What
7052,yeah but I also get really calm and I don't get cramps and the only day I hate about my period is day 3 where I need to crack my back all day

7054,yea :((
7055,"I agree, that's absolutely not ok especially if he paid for the phone himself."
7056,"My dad destroyed my dollhouse when I was younger, smashed my phone and iPod, destroyed my room looking for a knife that I didn’t have, and my moms taken my diaries and tore out “all the depressing stuff cause it makes us look like bad parents” :))"
7057,Yea and his parents have done other bad things
7058,[removed]
7059,"I know I'll get downvoted to hell for this but idc, none of those people you said to contact will do anything, school can only do something when it's against the law as far as I know, they dont have the jurisdiction to tell parents how to raise their children. Relatives will most likely take the parents side because ""you're just a kid who doesnt know anything"" or something along those lines. Anything like CPS will see you as a joke, they see terrible shit like meth head parents killing their kids every day. Hell, when my dad was beating me for no other reason then he was drunk and pissed, CPS basically said that I was being a brat. When my friend got hit in the face with a huge metal shovel by his drunken stepdad, CPS didn't think that it was worth their time. OP is kind of on his own here, which is sad because the situation they're in is kinda fucked up"
7060,Yes when I was little he destroyed my favorite toy because I broke a vase in the living room while playing around with it... Back then I was mad but I honestly understand him now. He also told me he just did it so I would realize that breaking other peoples things on purpose isn't a way to behave...
7061,"Since you're 15, you probably can't afford anything yet. Just go round the house and break things accidentally but occasionally. Try to spill some juice on phone or something. Make him suffah!"
7062,"If you paid for it. It is yours. Meaning they broke the law and stole your property to give to your sister. They may be able to make an argument to taking it away as punishment but smashing it and taking the SIM card as a gift for someone else is against the law. If you want, you could contact authorities to try and get the SIM card and your money back. 

Even if you don’t want that, maybe try to explain to your parents why that’s unfair and you should get your money/property back. Or try to talk to your sister about getting the SIM card back (after-all she does have stolen property with knowledge of the fact that it’s stolen). Tell a trusted adult, even just to talk to them or to take action. Either way, someone needs to know about this. And gather evidence that this happened and your parents are the reason for it."
7063,My mum accidentally broke my laptop and said she’d get me a new one lol.. it’s been 4 years :(
7064,r/insaneparents
7065,Wow that's awful. I'm glad they took away all the depressing stuff though. That must mean you're happy now! ^^(/s)
7066,"He paid $800 for his phone, and his parents broke it.

That is property destruction and I am pretty sure he can get them in trouble for that."
7067,I understand this was horrible and I’m pissed and it’s not my phone. But this doesn’t warrant calling CPS or whatever agency protecting children.
7068,"His parents (I assume) are his legal guardians, which means that basically anything that belongs to him also belongs to his parents, you are allowed to destroy your own property."
7069,Revenge me would’ve so agreed but it’s not even worth the karma
7070,"Unfortunately that’s not how it works, parents have custodial control over your belongings. depending on where you live they might have to give it back at some point though.
And this is mismanagement of property, so might be able to take some legal action but would not advise it if you still have to live there for a few years."
7071,"Lmao

A. I'm not the type the person who goes for revenge, even though it sounds pretty tempting. I try to sympathise with the man, and I can to some level. He's my father, I don't want to hurt him. But if it's not mutual, then what's the fucking point of it.

B. He yells at me with that extremely loud voice of his for ten minutes when I spill juice on the floor. 'hey, ya spilled juice. I raised a bitch who can't do anything right!' (whose fault is that, huh?). He isn't even sarcastic with his insults, unlike me. Just gets straight to the point. I kinda have an upper hand on the verbal stuff tho, he doesn't get the sarcasm sometimes and I'm all for it. Makes me feel at least a tad bit better.

I can imagine what he would do if I spilt juice on my or his or anyone's phone for that matter, and I don't want to elaborate on that."
7072,"My parents thankfully never destroyed any of my property, just got threatened that they are gonna smash it if I don't get off it but that happens rarely, when they get really mad after I do some stupid shit. But I doubt that they would ever destroy anything. What your dad did is absolutely insane, especially because it's your property. This is not how a parent should behave, sounds like anger issues to me. I f I were in your place, I'd tell one of my relatives and report it to the school. Try to talk to your dad, tell him that what he did was wrong and suggest him to seek help from a psychologist. I am really sorry for what happened to you."
7073,"Never! the most my mom has destroyed was notes I wrote that said Tai <3’s “blank”. And my dad I only destroys my food. That is so freaking messed up, I’m pissed and it’s not my phone. I’m sorry this happened to you. May I propose a solution, once you save up for your next phone never have it out around him. Don’t even let him know you have a phone. I’m even mad for all the memories you have on there; I hope you have them stored somewhere or can get a replacement. Hugs"
7074,"Yes, but not as a punishment"
7075,Maybe /r/raisedbynarcissists too? Depending on how they argued it could be that too
7076,/r/RaisedByNarcissists
7077,"I really dont want this to sound like bragging, just something that was reminded while i was reading all of these ""dad did xyz"" things.

My dad used to be that way.. swearing and throwing things and was an all around jerk. but in recent years, he really has cleaned up his act. I am so proud of him!"
7078,"hey you guys all do realize your parents destroying your property or belongings of yours that are important or precious to you is extremely controlling if not abusive behavior right? your parents going through your private things, valuables, rooms, etc. and destroying, stealing or selling your things is 110% wrong. please, if your parent is doing this, do not see it as normal behavior or something you deserve. i don’t care if your parent bought your phone or whatever, they have no right to destroy anything of yours and as a parent they should be responsible for providing you those important things without manipulating you, guilting you or holding it over your head. it isn’t a life lesson, it isn’t justified just because thy bought it, it isn’t anything except immature and overtly harsh behavior that is inexcusable for a child to experience. 

when we experience these things at a young age repeatedly, we often enter in friendships or relationships where this occurs again, if not at a worse degree, and we see it as normal behavior because our parents did it. i’m so sorry everyone is experiencing this and i hope you can set better boundaries with your parents and communicate with them how you feel. you deserve to be respected in your own home. if you sadly can’t reach that point with them right now i hope you can find someone who understands your boundaries and i hope you can find a way to protect your belongings, because you do not deserve this treatment under any circumstances."
7079,<3
7080,"That's harsh, unless it was a repeat occurrence."
7081,"Your reply should be ""Maybe I was raised by a retarded moron."""
7082,Hey you too huh. My parents think that I have “bad habits” that will “destroy my life” I’m a gamer in the gifted program getting As and Bs and they think because I like to play Minecraft on the weekends that I’ll turn into a failure or something. In reality I have one of the best plans for my life. I’m 14 and I already know where I’m going to college. And I have a plan to get there.
7083,They don’t want to look at the evidence of their terrible personalities. They can’t cope with the truth
7084,That's not right
7085,Nope. Best to stay away from that stuff.
7086,no. i’d never do that either way but then i got cheated on and experiencing how badly it hurt to have someone do that to me i’d never ever want to do that to someone else.
7087,"Yep. It was emotional cheating. My boyfriend at the time was very manipulative and threatened me with suicide when I couldn't come see him. There's a while lot more to the story, but I got sick of not being listened to, but was too insecure to outright leave him. I got really close to a couple guys I knew before, and felt more affection for one of them than I had him."
7088,I cant even date more than 0 people at a time so u win
7089,"some years ago i was in a relationship, and somebody who frequently harassed me sexually at school put my hand on his penis. i froze up and didn't know what to do. i always feel incredibly guilty about not slapping him in the face then and there. i know it wasn't cheating since i didn't consent, but i always feel guilty for not doing more to make it stop."
7090,"never, and if someone is cheating or thinking about cheating then they need to leave the relationship."
7091,"I definetly don't think it was the appropriate thing to do, but I don't regret what I did in the long run, as it helped me realize how fucked everything in my relationship was. I'm definetly not condoning cheating though."
7092,"nope. a friend of mine did, though. she was a in a really toxic relationship- that doesn’t make it okay, but it was why she did it. every time she tried to break up with him he would find a way to coerce her into staying. she cheated on him, told him, and he broke up with her. he still harassed her for a few months after their relationship ended."
7093,Do you regret your decisions? Or do you still stand by them?
7094,I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope you are okay now. You shouldn't feel guilty for that.
7095,Never have. However my ex bf cheated on me!
7096,I've never dated anyone but I would 1000% never even think about it
7097,oh hell no
7098,I have not. But I have had thoughts about having sex with a taken guy which I feel guilty about.
7099,I am pretty firm so I can't even catch feelings for people. There's only one person I do kinda like but only because she is one hell of a uniquely nice person. She's really sweet and we're pretty good friends. I help her with Calculus when she doesn't understand something (we're in the same Calc class).

7173,Yeah obviously
7174,that sounds so cool I wish I went to a school that. there’s a school ik of where the kids work every Friday and get work experience and earn money to pay their tuition
7175,"Yeah, some girls can be trashy, in the same way too many guys are trashy and toxic. They’re the type of person that you’d find in hide and seek when you were younger, and they’d run away and say ‘YOU DIDNT FIND ME YET!’"
7176,"Having manners is not something either gender is born with racism sexism homophobia are all passed down from the generation before

curious to know why this is being down voted. I was only pointing out that being a jerk isn't an attribute of boys or girls

Edit nvm looks like down vote bots are out"
7177,They probably can't acquire or maintain a relationship and then hate on men because it makes them feel better and that they're better off that way. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Some probably had very bad experiences but i think many just had normal rejection or breakups and don't take it well.
7178,"I hate when a woman says all men are trash and stuff like that, and the worst part is that there are a lot of ppl who praise this like it was something to be proud of. If a man said something like ""all women are whores"" he'd be only getting hate"
7179,"thats why i hit the ""speed bumps"" by the playground at full speed"
7180,[removed]
7181,"What op is referring to isn't a retaliation against sexism such as calling a woman 'dishwasher'. OP is referring to the people that believe all men are disgusting pigs and such, which is just as bad as generalizing women. Neither of these are good things."
7182,Thats not fighting back lol thats fighting fire with fire
7183,Wtf I haven't done anything to a woman. Unless dumping one of my girlfriends is that horrible. I can be offended by your statement whether you approve of it or not. And your perception of men seems to be warped by the internet and media because those emphasize the bad things about everyone. Go and ask other men and women what they think.
7184,"No it's not. There are certainly men who think so, but it's nowhere near a majority and certainly not a 'super prevalent' sentiment.  

Whenever i see other girls say 'men are trash' idk it usually just means they hate men lol.  

The problems men and women face are different, i dont think it is outright better or worse to be a man on an avg daily basis. Yes we can be called whores for just having sex, we're physically weaker so it's easier to assault/steal from/etc us, and menstruation sucks, but guys have pretty serious problems too like being socially conditioned to not display emotions and be honest about how they feel, or the fact that any time men do anything considered feminine they get blasted. I think that degree of emotional constriction is probably why men kill themselves way more than women in most countries.  

There are way more ways that both men and women suffer for ppl stereotyping them but those are just some examples."
7185,"I don’t all guys should be called trash just like how men shouldn’t generalize women, you see if your stuck here on Reddit a lot of the guys are pretty genuine unless they are r/NiceGuys but other than that it’s ok, on platforms like Insta and TikTok you can’t even make a video as a female without some guy commenting “dishwasher” or “women aren’t funny” so with all my experiences... about 70% of the guys I’ve met (not in a romantic way) online and irl (not just in one area I’ve lived in at least 6 different places) are in fact pretty trash human beings, there’s a lot of controversy around the whole feminism thing too, real feminists should support equality and treating each other equally regardless of your gender. So the women that say EVERY single guy is trash are probably very miserable human beings. I often come across many slightly sexist views on TikTok and insta made by guys and all the dudes agreeing on the comment sections kinda freaks me out bc so many people think like that. So no not all men are trash, there are a lot of trash women and men, I’ve met way more trash men though... but I know there are decent ones ofc it just takes a while for me to find them"
7186,[deleted]
7187,Yeah I feel that way too
7188,"I get your point but the thing is, they say ALL men are trash or inherently worse. Yes there are real assholes out there that really objectify women but that's the minority. Sometimes even decent guys joke with the dishwasher thing because of how obnoxious those women are."
7189,Or say ‘PAUSE!’ Right before IT tags them while playing tag and make up some terrible excuse
7190,"everything that makes you is a conglomerate of what you've seen in the past. From day one we take in what others around us do, we copy traits from others and especially form parents because they are the ones who you see the most and usually trust the most. For example, it's natural for someone's political views to be aligned with their parents simply because that's what they've been exposed to. Similar things can be said for discriminatory viewpoints. If your parents grew up cursing the Frenchman who lived next door saying he planted weeds in your garden and broke your window you will grow up with the assumption that the French are bad. 
This isn't to say you aren't to blame at all, but hopefully when you're exposed to the world you realize the fault behind these viewpoints and change your ways."
7191,They're stupid cunts
7192,"Being upset is fine, venting is fine, but people need to understand that one person doesn't represent the whole sex. And saying shit like ""Kill all men"" doesn't help anyone. This shit is mainstream too. If you were a young girl and you were browsing the internet and your favorite celebrities and influencers were chanting ""kill all women"" and ""all women are pigs"" and then also got hella support for that, and all the criticism was washed away by calling them ""fragile female egos"", how the fuck would you feel? Day in and day out, not on the dark crevices of the internet, right fucking there.

This shit is like fighting fire with gasoline."
7193,You realize that the boys of today aren't 350 years old right? Blaming someone for what their relatives did is just complete bs
7194,"They're sexist. I hate when women say things like ""kill all men"" and when a girl tells them it's wrong they all call her a ""pick me"". It's just wrong on so many levels"
7195,The funny thing is I would 100% pick a girl who pointed out double standards to one who says kill all men. If it works it works
7196,"Well yeah but you could also say ""To all those stuck in the eighteenth century, fuck you"". See how much better that is? Now that isn't generalizing all men."
7197,"obviously, times have changed. but modern sexism is very real. Im not saying its worse for women than it is for men, im saying its still hurting people. Do you really think people would still be upset if this wasn’t a current issue?"
7198,"I hate them and I call them out on TikTok like many other girls, but they just get called ""pick me girls"", it's sad."
7199,"Yeah I already know about the dishwasher thing and ""no women are funny"". We even have plenty of guys like that on r/memes and r/teenagers who try to joke like that. But in tje end they either really think that or are just immature boys who think it's funny to be really offensive"
7200,"As a girl, I find this comment quite horrible. What you're insinuating is that women should make men suffer for no other reason than to be petty. Maybe one day when you see the real world you'll realize the world isn't so black and white. I hope you think about your words in the future."
7201,"Yeah but the fact is that maybe there are millions of trash men in the world but the most important is not the number itself but the percentage of trash among all the men. Spoiler, this is a very small number. Your experience =/= Reality. AND you're 14 so you still have things to learn; as I do

btw Before suggesting that op is a rapist. Keep calm. And yes. Saying Kill all men is a threat."
7202,I don't like people who massively generalize
7203,"Its only because most of them are sick of being abused by men for generations. Giving them a taste of their own medicine. Of course, not ALL men are trash, but that goes without saying."
7204,those kind of people seem to be the type to call themselves feminists but completely miss the point of feminism and what it is about

7217,"y ep, i just want to know what people think of me bc it’s probably not as bad as i think it is y’know"
7218,"All the time. I juts think I’m like, not. So I think everyone else thinks I’m not haha."
7219,"Dont be so hard on yourself, you probably look better than you think you do."

7224,"these are my feelings put into a comment... thank you.

like i think i have some good features, but what if it’s all in my head? also my voice probably ruins it all, it’s kind of low and i’m kind of loud...."
7225,"Opposite for me, the mirror brings out the random eczema/facial stuff that car windows don’t :("
7226,Poor wording ruined me
7227,YES like if there’s hidden motivation for it but it makes it so hard to trust anything people say :/
7228,nah i just see myself as ugly no matter what mirror :(
7229,"Haha foony downvote

Edit: I upvoted dw"
7230,"probably, I mean, I hope so, mainly because I look like the standard European girl: blonde hair, blue eyes, stick figure"
7231,"It’s weird I’ve been told I’m attractive but I feel like they’re lying straight to my face, like literally when people compliment me I don’t believe it."
7232,"This is me 1/1. Like, why would anyone think i’m attractive, and then those questions pop up in my head..."
7233,"I always assume they don't, but I still can't help but wonder."
7234,Yes because I have low self esteem 😎
7235,"i want to, but i don't want to make them uncomfortable"
7236,Wish I could hug girls again :(
7237,please hug us
7238,I see a common interest
7239, *hug*
7240,"Like just I go up randomly and say, “hug?” 

Idk when I’d do it bc they’re always a friends and idk how you’d sneak that into a convo"
7241,Oh hey *hugs*
7242,"Ahh, the old reddit switch-a-roo."
7243,Depends on who but every time I see them.
7244,"I don't because nobody's ever wanted it, except one time a guy friend gave me a hug and it was awesome"
7245,just if there's ever a time it feels appropriate don't hold off out of fear it could make us uncomfortable. we love hugs
7246,*puts on wizard costume*
7247,Let’s just get rid of the “girls” part and instead just give everyone a big hug!
7248,Things are heating up
7249,All my male friends are gay lmao. My closest guy friend i only hugged a few times when I’m for example crying or something like that
7250,"Totally! Everyone that wants to be hugged, at least."
7251,Hmm we hug each other but that’s about it
7252,All the time unless they tell me not to. I like hugs. Hugs r fun and guy are cozy.
7253,"someone explain what this is, i've seen this so many times now"
7254,I’m always open for hugs
7255,"Me too. I just don’t want to invade on personal boundaries... then again, people say you can just ask like: “hug?” But idk..."
7256,I often hug my closest guy friend whenever I see him and I’ll give my other guy friends hugs every once in a while if I’m congratulating them or smtg
7257,Yeah. Like how do you even start hugging your friends. I had girls that used to hug me before but idk how to start something like that if I ever make female friends again.
7258,"Pfft. No. Since I like guys and girls that would mean anyone I hug during a relationship is cheating lol. To answer in general, no it ain't cheating."
7259,consent is important 😳
7260,What about regarding crushes? I’m friends w my crush but find it awkward and invasive if they’re not constantly touchy.
7261,Do it. Or just ask. A lot of us would appreciate it.
7262,I’m too scared to
7263,yea me too :/
7264,"no, it’s not cheating or close to it. if girls hug their female friends, it shouldn’t be any different with male friends"
7265,Probably just someone that knows a lot general knowledge or useless facts. I like someone that holds a conversation well and can make me laugh with dumb facts during a conversation.
7266,"When my boyfriend is tired, it's so adorable because he gets really affectionate and loving, like he usually is but when he's tired, he's like a baby, barely stringing together sentences while telling me how much he loves me and how beautiful he thinks I am. Also, he has this little quirk where he can just fall asleep instantly, like one minute he's taking and the next hes asleep. I just really think it's adorable when he's tired and vunerable"
7267,I understand what you're talking about but if someone messed up my hair I'd just look like a mango seed someone's been sucking for two hours straight.
7268,when a guy uses my name while talking to me i’m immediately endeared to them
7269,"ikr, I saw a post the other day where a guy was being technical about golf stuff and I was like whoa, idk what you just said but I can see you’re passionate about it and *I am so into that*"
7270,"hey there u/ksj-4, how you been today u/ksj-4? I'd hope you've been good u/ksj-4, because it's always good to feel good u/ksj-4! Ain't that right u/ksj-4?"
7271,"Uhh, putting your hands in your pockets? Idk I can't think of anything else right now."
7272,"*puts hands into pockets*

7273,The first bomb that fell on Berlin in ww2 killed the one and only elephant in the Berlin zoo
7274,"If they look goofy, I'm into them. Curly hair is honestly amazing too
Edit: as in if they have a goofy personality I'm immediately attracted to them regardless of their appearance"
7275,The general consensus on this thread is that if you mess up your hair you will have unlimited girlfriends
7276,"Lmao you perfectly described it, that’s exactly what it looks like."
7277,"Oh god dude, careful or you'll create a tsunami there"
7278,"i really like tall guys w pretty eyes cute smile cool hair and good fashion sense

that’s literally what every girl likes right lmao nothing special

okay but i swear the weirdest thing so far is probably when they wear jeans/long pants. okay but this might be a shared opinion also so.... and if he’s cute glasses make him cuter"
7279,not to be a boomer but i like it when someone has no social media presence. i think it makes them more... yours because they share so little of their life with most
7280,I wish I could sleep

7291,"Well, I'm probably not your type"
7292,He knows exactly what he's doing.
7293,Oversized hoodies look good on girls too
7294,"Being protective is hot, also like being able to make me laugh a lot is really attractive and probably one of the most important things for me in a relationship"
7295,I really like the visible veins on the hands
7296,"Deep voice, fluffy hair, and eyes that I can stare into forever (ik cheesy right) I’ve also always liked the look of braces and glasses idk why but braces and glasses are cute on a guy to me."
7297,"A deep voice, glasses, fluffy hair."
7298,"i seem to always go for guys with dark hair and brown eyes, i have no idea why. it's also really attractive to me when a guy's hands are quite a bit bigger than mine, though it doesnt have to be by much. plus, fluffy hair!!"
7299,Reeling them in I see
7300,What about dark brown eyes that appear to be black a lot of the time?
7301,"Why are brown eyes so loved? I have brown eyes and I don't see much that makes them so attractive, and yet all my friends with blue and green eyes are so much more attractive than me imo. 

I guess it has something to do with the fact that I'm a little t h i c c, but I lost a lot of weight over the summer so that doesn't really show as badly anymore."
7302,"I've got that, and on my arms and neck when working out"
7303,"Guys with well-kept hair are wonderful! Especially if it's shiny (but not greasy) and it bounces or shifts when they move their heads. If you've got nice hair, then all you need is a good personality and I'm all for you!"
7304,I have blue eyes tho😂
7305,Blue eyes are still hot dont worry
7306,Cute! Most eyes are cute to be fair.
7307,mans gotta eat
7308,"ngl the part about eyes that you can stare into forever is actually so cute! I swear, every time I look at someone like that, my heart rate hits 500 BPM or something.

7344,"The first thing I did after my boyfriend broke up with me was cry, then I played minecraft with a bunch of friends., and then I painted my nails and put on makeup and dressed up and just took care of myself. 

Friends, family and self-care - those were the most important to me during my breakup. It’s a slow process and it’s completely fine for it to take time, just take care of yourself and realise that the breakup was not your fault. You can’t do anything different now and that’s fine. A relationship is between two people and it is never completely one person’s fault for it ending. Maybe you two just weren’t made for each other, maybe you grew apart, maybe he didn’t like one part of your personality. Even if the last thing was the reason, that is not your fault. You’re just you and if he couldn’t accept that, it’s him and not you.

It’s been a few months for me and I’m still not completely over him, and that’s fine. I’m still regretting doing that and not doing that, but I know that I will come to accept that this is just how things are. I know that you will too :)"

7356,"I would be too awkward to do anything about it. If someone straight up told me they like me I'd probably say ""oh okay"" because I have no social skills. As for what it says, I think a simple ""I like you"" would probably work. Also I probably wouldnt worry about relationships rn because 13 is kinda young to be in a relationship. If it didnt work out before, maybe wait a bit? Idk, I'm not against casual dating in middle school, but if it hasn't worked out and you want to be more serious maybe wait."
7357,You should just try to convince him/her into admitting their feelings to one another. Encourage them! Good luck bro

7363,I would prefer someone to just say it to me directly.
7364,Honestly this stuff sounds so kindergarten...
7365,Damn I felt that. Only been living for 13 years and still feeling lonely and want to be loved :'(
7366,Agree completely. Much better to do any of this in person. It may be more nerve racking but it’s important
7367,that’s so cute!!!!! i would die if i got a note like that. just honestly confess and compliment her a bit.

7373,The last time a guy did that we were in a situation similar to yours and I ripped the note up thinking it was a cruel joke. Apparently he thought that's what I thought of him so he excused himself from the room and apparently started crying and wouldn't talk to me for a year.
7374,big facts
7375,But...

Idkskcneoaoxn im trying to imagine that it would be soo cute. I don’t care what it says but I would like it if it wasn’t super cliche like ‘hey you want to hang out’ like I wouldn’t get the hint. Just be direct and I’ll scream"
7382,"Gotta say, the age difference is real here. 14 and under saying it’s cute, 15 and older just want a straight up confession. I’m not offering my two cents, since I really don’t have any to spare, but I just found that interesting. Crazy how quick people grow up"
7383,"This subreddit is making me want to cry at how much of a 100% loser I was in my teens. Like 1000% loser material. So shut in that I didn't even realize myself that I was shut in. No self reflection, just basically did nothing until I was maybe 20.

Career wise im not a hobo but damn is my social life absolute garbage. Back then I had absolute zero bearings on what happened around me, didn't even remotely check out girls either.

7500,When I’m about to fall asleep while it’s cold and raining outside. It feels soo refreshing
7501,10/10
7502,After exercising for a while in a rink (figure skating) and being warm enough to wear a tank top and no jacket and being all sweaty but being in a cold rink (honestly such a good feeling)

7505,No not at all lol.
7506,"A one year age difference isn’t bad! And as long as she seems comfortable and interested in talking to you then it’s all good. If it’s really bothering you, then ask her if she’s cool with the age gap. But otherwise she’d probably tell you if she felt creeped out."
7507,Alright cool
7508,The brother just wants some advice
7509,"I know you dont want to rely on this comment since I'm 13, but if your concerned about age, a year apart isnt bad.  If you wont to develop your relationship maybe try to invite here somewhere? To avoid the creepiness have one or both of you  bring a friend. Movies are great for a first date so that way you dont need to talk very much. Heres an ex. on how to ask her ""Hey [blank] I was thinking about going to a movie with [mutual friend] on saturday and was wondering if wanted to come?"" Hope this helped!"
7510,"Basic rule is that if you think that something is creepy, just don't say it."
7511,">I know you dont want to rely on this comment since I'm 13

Good self-awareness"
7512,"For me depends on age. 3 years for someone 12 and 15 is not good, but 16 and 19 to me really isn’t that bad imo"
7513,"Thanks, I worked hard on it"
7514,I talk to this girl and I say all kinds of stupid sheet.. but the good thing is that she finds it funny.
7515,no 15 and 16 ain’t considered creepy. just make sure she’s ok with it cuz ur legal and she’s not
7516,"How old do you think is too old? Like I don't think 1 year/grade is a problem at all, 3 is kinda bad (especially if it's a freshman girl and a senior guy) but what about 2? I'm not sure"
7517,"Yeah that makes sense, thanks!"
7518,"that’s what i meant with legal. as in, sexual legal lol"
7519,"Guess I won't talk now, damn"
7520,"In the US (atleast in my state) I'm not a legal adult, but I am of the age of consent while shes not. Don't wanna really think about that, because I don't really have any ""sexual"" intentions."
7521,Thank you LostAbortion!
7522,She could be too because op didnt mentiok which grade and tbh i dont think it really matters to people cause if its like 1year difference and they really want to do it why would they care? Its not like the whole world will know and now hunt them down bcuz of it
7523,"Yeah, I don't want sex... not until atleast college lmao. I'm probably an outstanding number in a statistic because of that I guess."
7524,Maybe ask her on a date? Might make things less awkward
7525,[removed]
7526,Depends on a girl. You won't know until you try
7527,"A one year age gap is perfectly normal, nothing to be worried about! Maybe set up an arrangement or some place for you to meet up. Ask her icebreaker questions such as her interests and whatnot. (if you can't think of conversation starters, I'm here to help.)"
7528,"Maybe, since I posted this (I only met her two days ago), she seems more interested in me."
7529,Oh that’s good. For now just text her or like send memes or something idk. You need to show her ur personality too :)
7530,"I've tried to show her my personality and hobbies, music taste, ect...
Funny thing is, I asked about what music she likes, and it turns out she also loves this really small alt rock artist that I listen to. We literally have the EXACT same music taste lmao"
7531,Woaaah! That’s great. Maybe if you have enough you could ask her to go to a concert with you for a date? Also just put of curiosity which band is this?
7532,"Ah, ok, because there are two ages, 16, and 18, and I know in a lot of countries it's just 16 for everything, so I wasn't sure."
7533,"A small artist named Grandson, and a few others like IDKHow, Missio, Twenty One Pilots, and basically a bunch of other small alt rock artists and bands. Unfortunately my parents won't even let me go to a concert by myself or with guy friends, doubt we would be allowed to do that."
7534,"I'm 16 and driving which is pretty epic, but yeah otherwise its same in the US"

7709,For what do you cry?
7710,no no personal shit and life
7711,Yea I have no idea what to do like should I comfort them or should I let them be by themselves

7775,"You disgusting bigot.

Kidding aside, this. A thousand percent."
7776,Yes. I get shamed all of the time for my body and it really sucks
7777,"Yeah definitely. I’ve been made fun of for being underweight a lot, and it can get pretty hurtful. Ironically, it’s often from people who would get really upset if they were made fun of for being overweight"
7778,Don’t worry he was just jokin
7779,"Yes. 

But body positivity has been hijacked by this whole ""healthy at any size"" load of horseshit, whereas the core message was just supposed to be about feeling secure with your body and so on. I do always get a kick out of girls who are 100 lbs overweight describing themselves as ""curvy"", and claiming they're healthy. 

I can say that, I'm about 40 lbs overweight myself. Difference is, I know it's bad."
7780,It's fucking retarded to make fun of someones body. You shouldn't have to work out so that others don't longer make fun of you.
7781,"Yes. Throughout the last decade in particular there was such an emphasis on women needing to be ‘curvy’, and you would always see people getting torn down (especially on the internet and social media) for their lack of curves. Some of us just aren’t built that way, but that’s okay and we shouldn’t be shamed for it."
7782,Hell yeah I'm skinny and I'd definitely appreciate someone telling me some positive things
7783,"Well, I dont want to say thats a good way, but eventually you started working out.

Like its better than not working out, but worse than being supported."
7784,"Hes referring to Body 'Positive' Movements where unhealthy overweight people believe that their weight isn't a problem and that you can ""be healthy at any size"" which we all know is false."
7785,A lot of fat women would call this comment fatphobic
7786,hOw DaRe YoU sAy ThAt I sHoUlD bE hEaLtHy
7787,"Literally got grabbed at my stomach and told to eat more by family. Ugh, I hate it. I ate a lot of junk food to get fatter.."
7788,"yes absolutely, now that ""thicc"" is the new standard, I feel like I'm not good enough cause I'm flat."
7789,"yes actually! so many think theyre spreading body ""positivity"" but they just put others down to bring themselves up"
7790,"I’m a very short and small skinny girl and man we get shit on by everyone. 
- Men for being too skinny or cause they want a “skinny thicc” girl
-Other girls cause we “skinny bitches” 
-the body positivity movement cause “bones are for dogs, real men like curves” 
- Or “real women have curves” wow I guess I’m just not a woman anymore guys ok 

You get shit on for being too skinny but everyone freaks the hell out of someone dare make fun of a fat person. 

Some other lovely things we get told:
-skin and bones
-skeleton
-anorexic 
-stick/twig
-pile of bones 
-“you should eat more”
-“are you going to eat all of THAT?!”
-“is that all you’re going to eat?!”
-“Eat a burger!!”
-“ are you sure you’re ok? I’m just worried about you being too skinny” 
-“Shopping must be so easy you get all the cute shit” 

spoiler: it’s not. Walk into a store and look for a size 0,00,XS,XXS, or if that’s too hard then a 2. There is almost nothing for us if we short and below a size S. A women’s S is too big on me an XS fits ok but XXS is just right. I was looking for work pants in the petite section and even the waist on a size 00P was too big. Shopping is damn near impossible sometimes. 

People will bash skinny girls all the time because they think we are perfect or because we aren’t perfect. Like no Sarah I am not hot shit shut the fuck up. We are the continual punching bag. People think you got it soooo good and can’t have real problems. There needs to be more positivity because no we DON’T have all the body positivity that people think we do."
7791,Yeah i wish people didn't call my friends anorexic but she calls me chubby and blob when im a normal weight. So i dont feel bad for her. But we should respect all other skinny people!
7792,He was joking
7793,Idk if it helps you but there are lots of people who like flat more than thicc
7794,"i did the same, then when i actually put on weight i started to hate myself. even though i hated people pointing out that i was skinny, in my head it still built me up to be ""the skinny one"". i recently realised that i'm subconsciously sucking my stomach in 24/7 and i have to consciously stop myself from doing it. shit sucks"
7795,"I'm slightly curvier now—or, at least, I'm assuming I am considering I haven't been told this in a long time—but I used to be skinny skinny and lots of people would tell me about how I don't have an ass or boobs and it made me feel very self-conscious, so I think we should have more body positivity for skinnier people.

(I say this assuming that it isn't glorifying EDs, just taking away from the bullying that people with a more natural skinny body experience.)"
7796,I was underweight for a while. I've always been small. It just sucks when people ignore how you feel about comments to your body because they think you're confident or something because you're more skinny.
7797,"Same babe, i just try not to think about it"
7798,There should always be body positivity in general. As long as it’s not an excuse to be satisfied with living an unhealthy lifestyle. Nobody should enable people to become morbidly obese or anorexic levels of skinny. It sad to see when people use it as an excuse to live an unhealthy and dangerous life.
7799,"Yes 

That was kinda mean tbh."
7800,"Yes, its not your fault.

But its an opportunity. 

Like, the others have the big opportunity not to make fun of you to not be mean.

And you, after that, have the opportunity to work out to prevent from getting bullied.

Also, you shouldnt have to pay for insulin e.g.. Unfortunately this world is a big fucking mess."
7801,Fat people scare me shitless yes. Once I saw a fat person in the wild... I still nightmares to this day.
7802,"I wish my parents werent okay with me being skinny as a child. I didnt eat enough and my body hasnt recovered from that.

Its never good to tell people to be unhealthy is good. No matter if too skinny or too fat.

People shouldnt be bullied tho, they should be educated and supported on their way."
7803,"Yeah, people tend to just bully instead of help and many parents dont care or if they do, again they bully."
7804,"Eh, I just find it really annoying when the same girls who constantly call me a stick, anorexic, a little boy, under developed, flat chested, just bones, etc. have a complete meltdown when someone calls them fat. None of those comments were meant to help me become healthy, they were just to tear me down because they felt insecure about their own weight"

7806,It is a fantasy. My best friend walks in (been crushing on her for year) and just grabs me. Goes from there.

7848,"Being real, I'd be so surprised at first that I probably wouldn't have any words to say, so if he walked away right after saying that, maybe nothing would happen.

If the cocky little shit decided to stand there and gloat, however, he'd end up with a broken nose. You can bet your life on it"

7865,"My dad doesn't let me do shit cause of his bullshit ""Women do what the men say "" religous bullshit. If I do anything that he seems unwomanly he gets upset. Playing Vidya games, playing the guitar, drawing, and basically another other than cooking reading and cleaning
 It's fucking cancer."
7866,He’s said worse stuff
7867,jeez. i hope one day you’re able to dispatch from his comments without any conflict
7868,"The bra thing is kinda weird, ngl."
7869,Well at least I don’t really see him anymore. I only really see him at Christmas and my brothers or my birthdays
7870,"I know it is, I honestly don't understand it. Like what, I have boobs? Omg I can't believe it! It's almost like I went through puberty when I was 12, and know I got boobs! So crazy."
7871,"that’s a relief, i understand he’s your father but i’d honestly hate to hear if you endeavour that daily"
7872,That’s pretty fuckin stupid. How are those even unwomanly??
7873,"Omg bruh honestly, my brother's getting married and we were all sitting in the living room, and he was like 'well, we've shown you tho most important room'. My new sister in law was confused and was like 'the living room' and then he was like 'no' and pointed to the kitchen (our kitchen and living room are attached). She just laughed nervously but like what?"
7874,When I was younger and saw him every weekend he used to talk shit about one of my older brothers (who hated my dad since childhood) just to make himself sound like less of an asshole
7875,No but why tf is your dad saying that shit like wut??
7876,"My dad thinks that every single thing I do is to either lose weight or look prettier, he doesn’t have this attitude towards my brothers. One time I was cold and asked if my parents had seen my sweatpants, and he says “I bet you only want them to look skinnier” I was so confused on what he meant and he had to explain to me that sweating causes weight loss or something

There’s no way of knowing that he does this only because I’m female though so I can’t be completely sure"
7877,"And you still have them with a bra on too!

Feels creepy to have someone else dictate what underwear I am allowed (or required) to wear."
7878,Cause he is super fucking religous. Like it's fucking stupid. He hates my best friend is a guy and that I even have guy friends to begin with. He gets pissed when I leave the house he's just around around shit.
7879,"When I was around the same age, maybe younger (around 9?), I used to have swimming lessons at the local pool. After the lesson I'd play in the water for an hour or two before we would go home. While playing I'd love to do underwater handstands. At that age I was growing taller so although I was in the kids pool, my butt would be above the water. My dad yelled at me in front of everyone saying that I was only doing handstands because I ""wanted to show my butt off to all the boys"". He forbade me from doing underwater handstands after that. Wtf, I was 11."
7880,"wait, you guys have dads?"
7881,"Oof. Sorry. 

Glad you don't have to see him much. Hopefully as you get older you'll be comfortable telling him how his misogynistic views were wrong and always stuck with you."
7882,"   Nothing quite as bad as your dad, but yeah he is. He always talks about how women should be “at home having babies” and stuff like that, which isn’t great since I don’t plan on ever having kids at the moment. He also says that the wife should always take the husband’s name, which is interesting because his first wife didn’t take his name, sooo...
   
   Tbh what gets to me more is the homophobia, since I’m gay. He once said that being gay isn’t normal and that he didn’t like gay people so thats fun. And that lesbians are all just grumpy old women (idk he’s weird)
   
   But he loves me and my brother a lot and he tries his best to be a good parent, he just... has some interesting views and parenting tactics. Idk, I get confused about it because he’s my dad and I should enjoy spending time with him, but he’s also said some shitty things to me, so like ???

(Sorry for leaving this long ass wall of text, this turned into more of a rant than I wanted)"
7883,"ewewew, that's gross. i'm so sorry :("
7884,"Yeah, but that's my dad. He likes to be in control, and to be right. It's impossible to explain things to him, and the only thing that will change his mind if it's his idea."
7885,Nope he's not at all
7886,"Well, it does, by about half a microgram."
7887,I have 25 parents (23 adopted) there's gotta be at least one
7888,"My da's a prick, but he's not sexist. So at least one thing. He works as a barrister and actually tries to hire an equal amount of women and men at his office."
7889,Reading a lot of these replies is making me thankful for what I have.
7890,"That’s not really sexist, that’s just a dad thing. He doesn’t want guys looking at his daughters butt"
7891,"My mom isn't even in the picture and if I do or say anything he doesn't like he gives me a lecture about ""The responsibilities of a woman"" and he can kiss my ass with his bull shit."
7892,"I haven't heard any sexist jokes, or really paid attention to any sexist jokes he's made, BUT I do hear him make a lot of slightly racist jokes. It doesn't bother me as much because I have more of a crude sense of humor but sometimes he goes too far.

&#x200B;

Examples, you say?

We were watching 72 Dangerous Animals: Asia and the title of the video was Wrong Place, Wrong Time. He turns to me and says, "" It's ironic how they named the video Wong Place, Wong time..""

&#x200B;

So yeah. Love him though!"
7893,"my dad’s sexism gets amplified when he’s around other middle aged men. for example, he was talking to my uncle and said that when you go to a bar and meet a woman, she’s either fucking material or wife material and you can tell instantly, basically he was saying that women are defined by their purpose for men and the fact he said this in front of 17 year old me is disgusting"
7894,"When my dad has a bit too much to drink, he’ll get kinda angry with my mom for not wearing skirts more often but that’s pretty much the extent of it. Once or twice he’s seen me cooking and says I’ll make a great wife which I really don’t like him saying, but I think he does it to take the piss out of me

All of that aside, he’s 57 and came from a pretty old fashioned Scottish home, so it makes sense"
7895,"Most probably give them away to people I can trust for a few years, but still be present in their life. I don't really want to stop life from entering the world through an abortion. It isn't the baby's fault her mum got knocked up young, you know. 

It's probably not gonna happen. At all. But this is what I would do."
7896,"Most wholesome answer here, congrats but remember to bag it before you shag it"

7910,Wrap it before you tap it
7911,I’d probably be wondering how since i literally cant have kids
7912,Keep the baby bc I love kids and I've always wanted my own
7913,Can you give me an American rhyme since we sadly dont use the verb shag to mean fuck.
7914,because he has smol pp
7915,Neither he nor I have the emotional health and responsibility to take care of a child. Fetus deletus.
7916,"Well if that were to ever happen to me (still a virgin soooo) I would keep it. I'm not religious, but I am a Christian so I believe that it's a baby at the moment of conception Therefore, I'd keep it. I've actually had this conversation with my parents and they said that they would support me in whatever I decided whether that be keeping it or putting it up for adoption and I could still live with them. If the baby's father wanted to be present I'd let him if not, I have a strong support system to raise the baby myself. I've always wanted a lot of kids and wanted to be a mom so I guess I just get an early start. I'm also the type of person who wouldn't sleep with someone unless I really loved him so I would possibly get married if the dad wanted to."

7968,I had a girl at my school come up and tell me I wrote Star Wars books in her dream and got famous and I’ve literally spoken to her twice
7969,Wet dreams are a thing if you don’t wank for a while. I recommend it.
7970,Its gonna be hard but i'll give it a shot

7983,yeah hopefully it’s more than 1
7984,Ik some ppl dream abt me cuz they literally tell me
7985,"In most cases it'll only be painful if you skimp on the foreplay. Some girls are naturally drier, so having water-based lube and condoms would be a good idea. The hymen isn't really supposed to break, just stretch."
7986,"My first time was extremely pleasurable and not uncomfortable at all, with the exception of some burning on the outside from friction, though I didn’t notice that until afterwards. 

One point of note is that my boyfriend and I had been in a sexual relationship for about a year before we actually had full piv intercourse, and I think that was instrumental in making the first time very comfortable and natural. (We were waiting until I was on birth control, specifically the nexplanon implant, because I wasn’t comfortable enough with the failure rate of condoms and DO NOT want to get pregnant.)"
7987,[deleted]
7988,"Lube, condoms, foreplay, and one that people will often overlook is MOOD. It’s waaay less likely to hurt if she’s not tense or stressed over it."
7989,And? People start having sex at a lot of ages
7990,"""Shes not a dried up old women shes good to go""-superbad"
7991,"I agree with just about everything that’s already been commented. Foreplay and maybe lube, those are the best options. Though it is important that if it hurts, you let your partner know and ask them to stop or slow down until you are more comfortable. Pain really ruins the mood. Your enjoyment is just as important."
7992,"Or no condom? I really wouldn't recommend that. STDs are such big health problems these days.

For lube, choose a water based one. Other types will perforate the condom"
7993,"It depends but a lot of the time it hurts.

Use lube, condoms, and foreplay 

Make sure you’re comfortable and if you’re not speak up.

After the first time or two it’ll be less painful"
7994,"Make sure you’re comfortable, make sure you guys do foreplay, and make sure you have the right condom (or no condom) lube, etc. most of it boils down to your being comfortable/ turned on. If you’re tense it’ll hurt.

Edit: I’m not telling people not to use a condom, just most people enjoy sex more without one and choose not to use one if they have birth control. I’m not discounting that yes, it puts you at high risk of contracting an STD."
7995,gg
7996,"Most people?

I mean, I'm sure people would rather do it like that, but most people would still opt for safety, no?"
7997,I think it depends on where you live and the culture around sex. It honestly differs per country imo. In Australia it’s normal to have sex at a young age (13-14) even though most don’t until later in life. Whereas in more conservative counties (such as countries in Asia) you are looked down upon (especially if you’re a girl) if you have sex before the age of 18.
7998,I lost my virginity at 6. Let's just say we went to church a *lot*...
7999,it hurt real bad for me because I actually tore a bit and bled. if it starts to hurt you should take a break and definitely try foreplay (esp fingering) instead of trying to force it all in and thinking you'll get used to it after a while because the whole experience was just not a good one for me after doing that
8000,Well aren't you a ball of sunshine.
8001,this. Foreplay is literally crucial and it’s crazy how many people don’t realize that
8002,My first time was super painful. It really shouldn’t be though. Foreplay and lube are two very great things that will make things a bit easier
8003,"In my case it did actually hurt. I wasn’t sure at the time if it will stop hurting so I let it continue for a while but then I told him to stop and we found out I was bleeding. The bleeding itself didn’t hurt me, but I felt similarly to when you have your period. He was really worried because of the blood but I just assured him that it wasn’t really a big deal when you deal with it every month. We just cuddled for the rest of the night and when we had sex like a week later or so it didn’t hurt at all.

If it hurts stop and try again next time :))"
8004,"I mean, I'm only myself, but I've heard a *lot* about STIs and would no way consider doing it raw my first time.

Then again, I guess it's fine if you're both tested. I've never even been close to being in a relationship so I'm certainly no expert on this, but I've just had this drilled into my mind so much that it seems so obvious. Maybe it's a cultural thing."
8005,"It’s nothing to beat yourself over dude, people lose their virginity’s/ have experiences as a lot of different ages. Don’t stress about it, it’ll happen eventually."
8006,"...would a 15 year old boy be different then?

Either way, please kindly fuck off with your judgement bs"
8007,Keep your shit to yourself then. Just because you don't agree with him doesn't mean he can't express his opinion.
8008,Yeah no that’s a bad idea and bad advice. I’m on birth control and I wouldn’t even consider having sex without a condom.
8009,"What’s your favorite condiment to use during sex? i prefer ranch but my girlfriend says she likes ketchup, so we usually make a compromise and slather my dick with a disgusting concoction of the two."
8010,"FOREPLAY (like 30-45 min, don’t be impatient) and lube. Still hurt for me but it also felt good and that distracted me."
8011,"Japan’s age of consent:13
Age of consent in China:14
Philippines age of consent:12
Afghanistan has no age of consent
Pakistan has no age of consent 
Nigeria’s age of consent:11

Yes, some people go out and have sex at 15. But at least in our country it’s illegal to have sex with an eleven year old"
8012,Yeah can we not virgin shame this dude k thx.
8013,honestly it as painful for me cuz the guy i did it with was shit. there should be A LOT of foreplay so your body feels comfortable with everything
8014,"What the fuck, it’s considered normal to have sex in Australia at 13-14?? I only know like 2 people in my grade who’ve lost their virginity, obviously there are more that I don’t know about but still. Accepted maybe, but normal is an overstatement"
8015,"Maybe some, but I am covered in scars, so I don't give a rat's bass. It is a neat/normal story anyway, its not like you were doing something shady to get the scar."
8016,Hot.
8017,"Wanna see em?

(/s if you couldnt tell lmao)"
8018,Wouldn’t be creepy. Not really a turn off but could get more attention and care from it.
8019,"Some girls think scars are badass, some just don't mind them, but I doubt most girls would be turned *off* by a scar. I definitely don't care, it'd be hypocritical for me to do so anyways because I have scars."
8020,The nuts or the scars?
8021,How did you get your scars? If i may ask oc
8022,"Probably not, but they might want to make sure you're completely ok first. Some of these chicks might even like it, you never know."
8023,"I mean you could see both or just one, its really your choice"
8024,Good to hear
8025,Scars hella hot
8026,"No I don’t. Also I have a tip, this obviously won’t get rid of the scar completely but to help fade it you can put bio oil on it every night. I had a bad accident and got a huge cut on my hand (the whole palm) which left a big scar. I had it for years but then I started putting bio oil on it and after 3 months it was gone!"
8027,Scars are very hot.
8028,As in you’d feel pity?
8029,"I was a bit of a crazy kid that was always getting into things, I am a diabetic so I have a lot of site markings, someone cut me with the sharp edge of a metal pole while we were in a fight, I tripped in the woods and landed on a random rusty piece of metal sticking straight up, got scratched really badly by some giant thorns, burns from cooking, got a terrible sunburn that left my chest/shoulders/back white speckled/dotted, random sports injuries, I jumped off a cliff into water but got cut by a rock I was not expecting, I had a bad time with self harm, jumping a couple fences, and then a ton of other random things that I have forgotten now. I am sort of accident prone, but I have never broken a bone somehow."
8030,nope..not a turnoff
8031,If you were comfortable with it I’d be reenacting an edgy book scene every time i saw one “What happened to you...? Did you...get these scars fighting that oh so nasty biker for me?”
8032,Scars add to the monkey brain vibe of “man is stronk protecc the herd make stronk babbies”
8033,*selfharm addiction intensifies*
8034,"the wilder the backstory, the more badass the scar"
8035,"> a bit of a crazy kid

A bit?"
8036,Yea possibly. Basically it’s either neutral or positive.
8037,I don’t get why you’d want to get rid of one. I have a huge scar across my back and I’m 80% sure I’m Kylo Ren now
8038,*mental scars are scars too*
8039,😳
8040,How in the ever loving crap did you get cut by a chair?
8041,I don’t think it’s a turn off

8044,I have calmed down since for the most part
8045,"I wouldn’t be super concerned about it. If he’s my boyfriend, it means that he sees something in my that he doesn’t see in anyone else—including her. I would trust him to not cheat on me with his friend! Trust has to go both ways!"
8046,concerned
8047,Very very uncomfortable
8048,This actually happened to me once I had to tell the guy I was dating it made me uncomfortable and his girl best friend ended up blocking my number and just unblocked my number after a year of not being with him.

8053,"This, it's all up to him if her feelings actually mean something or not."
8054,"Exactly! And if they end up meaning more than mine, I’d like to know that. I would be crushed, but ultimately they are his feelings!"
8055,It depends on how much you trust him. If he is loyal and he is only into you then there’s nothing to worry about. I would talk to him about it and make sure there’s nothing to worry about just in cass

8072,I might keep a closer watch to make sure he's not reciprocating but clearly he enjoys spending time with her so it doesn't really matter.

8245,"I would argue that the head figures of institutionalised religions act like this. Lots of people follow a religion but don’t agree with the ways of the head figures for various reasons like corruption or conflicting interpretations of sacred texts.

I don’t think any religion can be referred to as a whole, I think it’s a case by case situation for each adherent individually.

Of course there are horrible situations where people will use their religion or religious beliefs as a justification for being an asshole, but on the other hand there are people who will treat people with kindness despite how their religion tells them to live."

8255,Such a perfect answer!
8256,"I would want my parents to put me in a better mood, and just do something fun to take my mind off that topic, like maybe going to an amusement park."
8257,The first thing I would suggest is to avoid asking reddit and going to a therapist
8258,"I agree with you. Op would be much better off seeking help from a mental health/rape survivor subreddit or better yet, from a professional.

Most of us here are also teenagers, not people who are trained in mental health care and trained to deal with situations like this. 

This topic could also be very triggering for some people on this sub. I’m sure op didn’t mean to do any harm but trigger warnings never hurt."
8259,"This is awful fucking advice and no rape victim or teen mother would ever fucking give it. You have no idea wtf you’re talking about. Let her get an abortion, she was raped. End of story.

Therapy is good tho"
8260,"Take her to Therapy and have her have an Abortion. Find the nearest planned parenthood. If she wants to have the Abortion go for it, she can also give up the baby. But I think an Abortion would be best for her. She will also need a Therapist after this."
8261,"Why? Reddit is a good place for this, especially this sub. He can hear opinions from actual teenagers and possibly even other victims, as opposed to out-of-touch professionals who tend to bombard you with uncomfortable questions or use useless methods to try and interrogate you about what happened so they can write it down, as opposed to actually try and help you bet better mentally. (I know this as I'm friends with a survivor). Obviously not every therapy experience is the same but at the end of the day they have instructions to follow to get a paycheck - it's not the same as hearing it from people who actually have been through it or know someone who has, or just hearing it from other teenagers in general who may better know what their interests and opinions are than a therapist who hasn't been a teenager in decades."
8262,this^
8263,"yea thanks for agreeing. While, yes, some are giving good advice, it would be better long term for OP to seek a professional."
8264,"Be more affectionate (don't fake it), she'll realise the toll suicide can take on a loved one."
8265,"I'd like to add a point to this thread. Everyone here has amazing answers and have covered it all, but all I'd like to add is, she might speak about stuff that seems unimportant to you as an adult but try to understand her and sympathize. Very often all we want is someone who understands what we're going through instead of giving us a logical solution to the problem. It sounds weird to not be logical, but we must remember humans are emotional beings, not logical droids."
8266,"Two things


> First of all,are you sure that she was raped and she isn't afraid to tell you the truth?

Girl is a rape victim. Got pregnant from it. Is 99.99% experiencing tons of emotional distress. It’s probably fucking up her mental health, and your first thought is “she could’ve fucked without a condom and lied tho”

> Maybe try therapy and see how she feels about the baby.

She got fucking RAPED. She wants to get rid of the baby. She doesn’t fucking want it. Don’t tell him to make sure she *really* doesn’t want that. Let het get rid of the fetus inside her that was forced there by some guy she never wanted to interact with. She doesn’t want the baby, end of story. Don’t tell him to second guess her own fucking decisions"
8267,"I am of core going to seek help from a professional, I wanted to ask here because of the similarity in age to her."
8268,"Man, we’re just kids, not mental health professionals. I suggest going to therapy."
8269,I absolutely would NOT recommend this unless op's daughter decides she genuinely wants to have the baby
8270,That's  up  to her. I will support any choice she makes.
8271,She went through a traumatic experience and she’s too young to be a mother. I don’t think she should continue the pregnancy. I also think she should get therapy as soon as possible.
8272,"Well. I'm no professional, nor have I dealt with something similar to this, but I think that first off you should definitely ask professionals and others who have been in that kind of situation. I'm not sure your view on it, or if you already do, but you could medicate for her bipolar disorder. As for what to do to help her, I would get over-involved, but giving her a shoulder to cry on can be the best thing sometimes.



Sorry, my advice was really bad, but I hope both of you are doing okay."
8273,"this sub is targeting towards teens, specifically teen girls, who are much more likely to be the victims of sexual harassment and/or assault. OP’s daughter is around our age, making a teen sun much more relatable to them both than an average sub. don’t be insensitive."
8274,Thats why i think op is asking us tho. Op's daughter is likely around our age and a lot of us are victims of at least some kind of abuse so our answers are probably valuable to op and op's daughter. Ofc we arent experts in medical and mental health but a lot of us can relate to the daughter and give genuinely helpful advice and im sure asking on reddit isnt the only thing op has done to help so there's rly nothing wrong w it imo
8275,"That's exactly why I came here, you guys aren't psychiatrists. So you aren't  going to think like a psychiatrist would. I'm trying to get the understanding of multiple  perspectives."
8276,"Like I said, I know a sexual assault survivor who went to multiple different therapists who all did the same thing; either provide cheesy coping tactics that everyone knows doesn't work, or try and interrogate her about what happened to write it down instead of actually *helping* her.  

They have guidelines and methods to follow, they can't always (and usually don't) provide as much as they can due to these. And it does make them pretty out of touch as a results.  

I can also say from personal experience and going to over four different therapists (both private and provided by my country's public healthcare, albeit for different reasons than sexual assault thankfully), they are *very* out of touch with understanding our generation. The most common method they use is to simply downplay your trauma hoping that you just say 'hey, maybe it's not that bad after all', or just move on from it as opposed to coming to terms or fighting it out of your memory."
8277,You did the right thing doing that. Teenagers are going to have a very different thinking process to paid professionals who are (no offense) quite out of touch with how we actually think and work. It's good of you to try and understand how emotions work at this age directly from people similar to your daughters age range.
8278,"Get her help, and for the child, there are plenty of organizations willing to help with children of these circumstances. Both are in a terrible circumstance and require immense aid from professionals and regular folk who are kind."

8281,"If you’re careful about it, you could turn the idea of having a baby into a positive thing.  Look at baby clothes, watch shows about babies, look up baby names, etc."
8282,That's good support her if she doesn't want an abortion but if she doesn't want a baby then make sure to have an abortion the earliest before the fetus starts yo grow into a baby I'm very sorry to what happened to your daughter
8283,"But in your og comment, u said to avoid reddit when op could just do both, asking serious stuff on reddit has actually helped me before so op can just obvs seek a therapist, but asking on reddit as well is completely ok"
8284,"yeah thats a much better way to phrase it, reddit isnt the best source for information but it can be very helpful"
8285,No lol that’d be horrible
8286,Ty for sharing my family isn't that crazy

8288,"Not exactly, but I started my first the night of my 9th birthday so I guess I had cake right before? All my mom said was ""I'm sorry, kid"" and then went to work lol"

8299,"No, but something like that happened to my classmate"
8300,There is actually a whole ceremony organized in many South Indian families when their daughters have their first period. The ceremony praises the transformation of a young girl into a woman who is ready for marriage and ultimately childbearing. She is dressed in a sari and gold jewellery and is the center of attention among the whole family. I cannot even imagine how girls sit through that
8301,"I have an older sister, so I just stole her tampons and she somehow didn't notice, and I wrapped the applicator in toilet paper before putting it in the trash. If I got blood on anything I would wash it out myself. Also, my mother doesn't really care about much regarding me as long as I'm not dead, so it wasn't too difficult"

8315,"Just be there for her. Sometimes, survivors just want you to listen. Sometimes they just want you to bring in some normalcy in their life. Don't pressure her to get her to talk about it, just assure her you'll be there when she does want to talk about it. Don't force the whole ""rape survivor"" thing on her again and again, sometimes she can get a bit overwhelmed. 

Make sure she eats and stays away from harming herself. Make sure she knows that she is loved.

Survivors want to know that the world didn't end for them, they want to know that they can still be happy and overcome it. Sometimes the only thing they want is to know that things can go back to normal even after this happened to them. Try and support her with the positive things she does, not the negative things. But most of all, be patient.

Send her all the love in the world. She deserves it more than anything else"

If she has this type of problems remind her is a delicate way that her body is only hers, she may do what she whant's to it and that she isn't any dirty stuff etc. but in the same time treate her normally, don't make her feel too much like a victim because that's the thing you try to overcome, being powerless."
8320,Rape the rapist
8321,Thank you for making me reflexively cringe and flex my groin. I appreciate it
8322,"Contact the Police if you haven't already

EDIT: Only if she is comfortable doing so"
8323,Oh you’re one of those people. Imagine being such a shit person you take advantage of someone who was rape by trying to force them into your religion. I really hope I missed a joke here
8324,"bro shut the fuck up, a girl got raped and you’re here telling ppl to get a bible? that’s fucked up."
8325,Any time
8326,"If it’s not logical why say it? This poor girl has just been **fucking raped** and your very first instinct is to say she should forgive him. People with your mindset are the reason why sexual slavery and paedophilic sex rings are still around. ‘Forgive and move on’ ‘forgive and forget’ ‘not my problem’ ‘it’s not like we have the whole story anyway’ ‘she’ll get over it’ 

What if it was your mum, your sister or your daughter? If you’d still expect them just to just ‘*forgive and forget and move on*’ you truly are an evil son of a bitch."
8327,Why did your god let her get raped in the first place then? And she doesn’t need to be forgiven for shit. Get out of here with your bible toting bollocks.
8328,So to show strength she should forgive that bastard for literally no reason after he potentially ruined her life?? What type of mental gymnastics did it take to work that one out
8329,What the heck? Have you guys contacted law enforcement or something? That's awful
8330,"Get the fuck out of here with that fucking bullshit. She doesn't need forgiveness. She didn't do anything wrong. I don't even care if this was meant as a joke, this ain't the fucking time and place to make a joke."
8331,Then scoop his kneecaps
8332,"Just stop dude, rapists don't deserve forgiveness, period."
8333,please please please don't help her without an adult you trust. when something like this happens it is never a good idea to step in without any help whatsoever. please have someone who you bith trust help you out. don't seek help from random teens on the internet.
8334,"No I don't think that all religions are bs I just get really pissed off when followers of a religion think that one sin is worse than other (only exception is when it breaks a law set up by the prophet or god one worships like the 10 commandments) or when they try cherry picking certain beliefs. For example, why do some Christians think that LGBTQ+ people are going to hell? Is no one remembering that the bible says you can go to hell for wearing mixed cloth clothing? Relating back to the crime of rape it is extremely rude and tbh psychotic to push your religion onto someone as they are experiencing trauma. 


I think your comments supporting whatever OP said were completely insensitive and completely unethical. Feel free to keep your opinion though."
8335,"Mistake?


You must be joking, no one in the world mistakenly or accidentally rapes someone even under the influence of alcohol"
8336,"Hugs, love, and more love."
8337,His religion is bullshit in this case. He should stick it up his lord and savior's ass where it came from
8338,"She probably isn’t ready to speak about the event due to its traumatic effect on her, so don’t push her to talk about it. Just let her know that you’re there for her."
8339,"it is awful, but sometimes it's difficult. you never know what the rapist could have on her/what everyone else is telling her or if it's too traumatic for her to report, its so heartbreaking."
8340,Call the fucking cops
8341,Not necessarily. Only do so if she is comfortable doing so. Don't force her into an extremely stressful experience of testifying against the rapist.
8342,Geez why is this thread so toxic
8343,"Well tell her to keep the clothes and not wash them, if it the rape did indeed happen, then the evidence will be on the clothes and on her"
8344,theres no way a sane human being would forgive someone who ruined her life
8345,it’s so annoying fr😭
8346,EXACTLY BRUH like i really just stressed myself out so i could be ready in the next 5 mins just for *you* to not be ready🙄
8347,Dude my parents do that all the time. My parents scream at me like 3 or 4 times and then say “Oh let me go to the bathroom rq” like ??????
8348,"Not usually rush, but like if we're leaving a party or something they'll say its time to go then talk to someone for 20 min"
8349,yessss that too😭
8350,the story of my life. my dad will literally yell and say i take forever to get ready and then when im ready he's barely getting in the shower. it's annoying asf
8351,"yes, this is my mom all the damn time. she blames it on women having to look nicer and makeup and all that, but if you know you're going to take longer then why rush me?"
8352,"YES OMG MY DAD DID THE SAME THING, like ur seriously gonna say we need to leave RiGht NoW but then go take a shower?? makes no sense"

8356,all the fucking time

8361,no because i’m normally the last one ready.

8363,"Y E S. It absolutley sucks, and when I ask them to hurry, they act as if I'm rushing them WHEN THEY WERE JUST RUSHING ME!"
8364,Yes they're like GET IN THE CAR WE'RE GONNA BE LATE and then not proceed to leave for another 30 mins
8365,Yo all the damn time and on the one occasion I do take a little too long they freak the shit out lmao
8366,YES

8388,"If she spends a lot of time playing volleyball a good pair of knee pads go a long way. Good ones can get a little pricey depending on your budget and wouldn't be too helpful if she already has a decent pair!

You could get her some sports or KT tape instead. This will be a lot cheaper than knee pads and a volleyball player can never have enough tape LOL"

8490,"I personally have some experience with girls who felt this way and my only real word of advice would be to understand that he should NOT be required for you to be happy. If you are sad when he's not there, there's quite a bit of dependence in the relationship whether you know (or want to believe) it or not.

As someone who's been on the opposite side of these emotions, I'll warn you that my first reaction was endearment. My ex ""missed"" me a lot when I wasn't there to text her, and she cried when I went on vacations out of state, and I (not knowing any better) just thought it was cute and a testament to how close we were. I'm not saying I can tell exactly what you're like based on this post, but at some point that kind of behavior gets to be suffocating. If it's consistent enough your boyfriend will feel the weight on his shoulders. He will feel as though he is responsible for keeping you happy when that was never, nor ever should be, his job.

I suggest you figure out what else in your life is making you unhappy, and deal with it in a healthy way. I understand that not everyone has access to a therapist, but if you can make an effort, I strongly encourage you to seek one out. There's more fun in life than your cute boyfriend, I'm absolutely sure of it, and spending time with him and giving him space is essential.

Best of luck"
8491,Damn you are really living the life now aren't you I think anyone would kill for that feeling.
8492,"Booooooo, it was funny"
8493,[removed]
8494,Cause girls have privileges ya know lol
8495,"Extremely

It’s heartbreaking"
8496,"No because it’s something that cannot be destroyed. It’s like murder, people are always going to murder you have to accept that, same thing with racism people are always going to be racist it will never go away. It can be remedied, but you can’t dwell on the fact that it exists because it always will exist"
8497,And the sad thing is even if that happens we’ll just find new ways to hate each other
8498,"It will always exist yes, but that doesn’t mean we should just accept the extent to which it affects people in this country"
8499,"Yes I agree, I’m just saying that it’s not a crazy thing that racism exists. You have to recognize that it DOES exist but it shouldn’t be a shock, when it comes down to it the world is a pretty shitty place. I am not saying you should accept racism"
8500,It's awful
8501,"100%. Racial biases have existed for hundreds of years and we’ve made incredible strides in overcoming it, but it’s still an incredible injustice for so many people. Not just in the U.S either. I don’t even know what arguments people are using to support racism anymore other than “I was told PoC were bad”. In history it was things like social Darwinism and the economic advantages of having African slaves as opposed to European workers, but now I don’t even know what people’s reasoning is for hating PoC. It’s mind boggling"
8502,This
8503,✊
8504,it’s one of the saddest realities of life itself
8505,Like come on it's 2020 and were seriously still not past this?
8506,Same comrade
8507,"Yea it is, I believe that racism, homophobia, and sexism are going to be around forever it may still get better, but to me the damage has already been done."
8508,"It breaks my heart. You would've thought that after decades of racism to POC's, we would've solved it and have grown to accept one another as one whole.

Yet, we still face these troubles in modern day society and it is absolutely crushing. There was the COVID-19 thing that still goes around, then George Floyd and a whole bunch of other stuff. It makes me so sad that people are still treating others as if they are of lesser value. 

&#x200B;

In the current situation we are in... **yes**. **Black Lives** **DO matter.** The whole ""all lives matter"" thing is flat out stupid. The incident with George Floyd (along with other black people being treated like garbage by cops) has sparked this outrage world wide. Black people have been and still seem to be targeted by cops. All lives matter, yes, but at the moment, black lives matter more. Think of it as a burning house.

&#x200B;

Me: ""We're going to call the fire department because my house is on fire!""

Neighbour: ""Why aren't you calling the fire department for my house too?"" 

Me: ""Because my house is on fire, yours is not. Mine is at stake here while yours is fine."" 

Neighbour: ""That's not fair. How come your house matters more? All houses matter.""

Me: ""Yeah, all houses matter for sure, except mine is on fire right now and **must** be attended to!""

&#x200B;

Yes, all lives matter but for POC, we need to stand up and speak out. 

&#x200B;

My little rant is over. If anything I said was offensive please comment and I'll see what I can do."
8509,"We are not similars to animals in those regards as we have cognitive abilities that animals don’t. We have morals, we have feelings, not just a single crucial instinct to survive like animals. So that shouldn’t be any retort to just being fucked in the head"
8510,Do I really need to put /s...
8511,No. I have come to except it.
8512,"Yeah it hurts my heart. But I believe that racism will lower a lot in the near future, because the new generation will hopefully have good role models and better education on the topic."
8513,"It’s sad, yes, but racism is natural.
What makes you think Homo sapiens killed the rest of our “cousin species”?
Try looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint.
Imagine people are Darwin’s Finches.
I’m not justifying racism tho, it’s definitely bad.
What I’m saying is that it’s natural and that all animals are naturally racist.
That’s why so many similar species exist and don’t cross-breed, despite being able to.
Some do tho."

8517,"disheartening yes but surprising no. the sooner people realize how this will be a very prominent issue the whole world faces, the less it will start to hurt"
8518,I honestly can't stand it and I really want to do something about it
8519,yup but i’m not surprised tbh most ppl say they aren’t racist and stuff but then their casually racist without realizing it
8520,"Racism has existed since... well ever, and will exist for many years to come."
8521,humans like to find stupid excuses to be horrible to each other. it really makes me sad
8522," No sadly it’s always gonna be here whether we want it or not people are going to kill, or get killed, and just have other bad shit that’s gonna happen"
8523,"Yes I'm honestly so shocked over the racism in USA. I'm but a simple naïve scandinavian whose thought too many times ""it can't be that bad, right?"". Well it is that bad. WORSE, actually. I'm not gonna claim that my own country is perfect but it is NOWHERE NEAR the shit going down in USA."
8524,"That's the entire problem.... we're way past the medival times, racism shouldn't be a thing at all...there is no fucking rhyme or reason in believing that people of one skin tone are subordinate to another, we should all be one family... hanging out with the people that matter the most... hanging in there fucking peacefully...not using protests as a means to commit crimes...I saw an Insta live of a girl whose sister was killed by rioters..not the cops mind you...we as humans have to remind ourselves every time that we have our own actions to be accountable for. We have all come a long way and watching a family fall apart is disconcerting..one man's death caused global protests but no...a bunch of flipping rascals came out to commit arsons and felony, the flames of one of the most powerful movements of today have come in the hands of rioters. Mind you had racism not being a thing there wouldn't have been any need for a #BLM...each one of us must pull ourselves up and mobilize"
8525,This ones my favorite:
8526,"I got back to him as soon as I saw it. Afterwards it went pretty well: we ended up sending over 500 emails worth of conversations to each other until *eventually* we exchanged numbers. Since then we talk almost every day, and yesterday we ended up talking/gaming until 4 in the morning."
8527,"I've been asked out once, and the guy was like ""hey, you wanna know who my crush is?"" And I was like ""sure?"",and then he turned his phone around, and it was on front-camera, so it showed me."
8528,That’s hilarious. Fells bad though.
8529,"Bold of you to assume I’ve been asked out

Edit: I forgot I was asked out in freshman year. This guy was just really desperate to get a date to homecoming."
8530,*elevator music plays*
8531,"Hey, not cool, you didn’t tell us what you said?"
8532,"idk i’ve only been asked out twice and it was for this class assignment for all juniors where you have to ask someone out on a date

they were both my friends so it wasn’t awkward or special

one of them said she couldn’t go because something came up, but i went with the other one and it was fun

other than that i’ve never been asked out on a real date"
8533,"“Lowkey, we should date”"
8534,how'd it go?
8535,"My boyfriend squatted in front of me in the cafeteria and just was like “hi- wanna be my girlfriend?”

Kind of insulting (I’m much shorter than him) but it was very funny. We proceeded to gtfo of the cafeteria as our friends chased us screaming about us now being together"
8536,"Damn, guess I’m failing that class."
8537,*you've got mail: gen z edition*
8538,so like do y’all come here often?
8539,"ah I have been preparing for this moment but as a answer to you question no.

Pickup line:

Hey girl are you a wifi hotspot? Because I feel a connection.

&#x200B;

I shall show myself the door."
8540,"Well...I was 12. ^yea, ^I ^said ^I'd ^date ^him."
8541,Awww I’m happy for y’all!
8542,"yep

all juniors at my school are required to take Ethics, and one of the assignments for everyone taking it is to go on a date with someone"
8543,Class assignment???
8544,"Me too, me too"
8545,"“Are you a Minecraft fence because I can’t get over you” 

It’s also the only way I have been asked out but even so I love it so much I feel like I will be disappointed if I ever get asked out without a Minecraft pickup line."
8546,Imagine being loved
8547,"someone liked me and literally everyone knew, including me. he was gonna just ask me out and get rejected and move on from it, but never actually asked me out. i found out a few months later that he was going to ask me out on my birthday by saying something like “looks like you got more cake than intended.” not the actual quote, it was much more cringey. not sure how he thought that would even work. im glad he didn’t because i would’ve slapped him. also something like that probably would’ve made my birthday worse than it was"
8548,"That seems like a weird assignment, but wouldn’t whoever you ask out just assume it’s just for the assignment?"
8549,"He approached me at the end of math class and said point blank that he'd had a crush on me for a long time. I'm still shocked to this day because I had gone to a different school for two of those years and I just couldn't believe someone would feel that strongly. Sadly I turned him down (already had a bf), I'll always remember how well he took it, he didn't try to push me or make me feel bad or anything, just all around a really sweet dude. Haven't heard from him at all since quarantine started, hope he's doing alright."
8550,"""wanna go out?""

but no, I haven't been seriously asked out."
8551,"Probably shouldn’t do that

The only reason that was the best is because all the other times were either “I like you. Wanna date?” Or “So Will told me that if I don’t do this than he’ll kick me in the nuts soo... wanna go out?”"
8552,"you could fake it but it’s more fun to do it

plus you can do a friend date if you really want"
8553,Damn I made the same comment lmao
8554,Nah not much
8555,"Yes! I mostly just stick to telling them about the pop and rock, but usually skip the really old 40s-50s country, 90s hip hop, and the swing/jazz"
8556,No I give zero shits I just show them the music I enjoy
8557,"Yes cuz then they think I’m suicidal


Edit here’s the playlist if your interested and if you want listen to it in order you can see my tastes change https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ZX7zcgRezIl780xFvsuaw?si=7fAEXt-dTvyepf2b6VT-UA"
8558,Same that's why I always ask if they're sure they want me to put a song on and then right before playing the song I tell them they're free to change it any time
8559,"depends on what music tbh, not at all if it's Kanye or Kid Cudi and yeah kinda if it's someone like MF DOOM, Danny Brown, Earl Sweatshirt or some death grips lmao"
8560,If I send someone a song I'll listen to the song as well bc I wanna make sure they're listening for long enough
8561,"Honestly same
Like I say I like mcr and then I get >!omg do you cut yourself??!<"
8562,"Rule number one, never tell anyone you listen o death grips"
8563,"NWA, DJ Quick, kurupt, lady of rage, etc"
8564,LMAOO THIS IS ME 💀💀💀 I HATE SHOWING MY MUSIC TASTES
8565,Don't skip the swing stuff. It's wayy to underrated and it's one of the coolest genres out there imo.
8566,"Haha same kinda, they just make fun of me for liking mcr"
8567,"NWA is really cool, nice"
8568,"yeah, i like kpop and i get scared that they will think im one of the crazy ones :/"
8569,YES
8570,"nah coz i rock that shit

bitch if you gonna roast me for my elite taste lemme see how incredible your trash ass playlist is"
8571,what 90s hiphop do you like?
8572,"Does anyone else get anxious when showing ~~the type of music~~ anything you enjoy to someone?

Yes"
8573,YUPPPP even though there's literally nothing to be ashamed of idk I just feel like I'll be judged >.<
8574,MF DOOM isn’t “mainstream” nowadays or whatever but I wouldn’t get anxious about telling someone I like him... Earl is hella obscure and I get why that would make you anxious tho aha
8575,"not really my dad and I both listen to mainly stuff like Green Day, Foo Fighters and The Offspring. but if he found out how religiously I listen to JJBA openings..."
8576,Why
8577,I just don't show people what music I like. Everyone I know knows I like star wars music so I send them specific clone wars themes sometimes but they will never know about the other music I like.
8578,Yeah
8579,"definitely, i have a different taste than some of my friends so when they ask me to queue music they aren't very fond of it :("
8580,I played the bunnygirl senpai op once on a vc and someone asked if there was a way to kick the music bot like damn didn't need to do me like that 😔
8581,I don't tell anyone I like old kanye.
8582,I mean kpops kinda wack imo but it’s not like everyone who listens to it is a huge fangirl(/boy?)
8583,What's your taste in music?
8584,I listen to 100 gecs so same
8585,I work at a nursing home that just got hit by Covid so... yeah...
8586,"Some dude who irons the creases out of his Jordan 1s every day, like bruh tf you doin"
8587,My brothers poop was so big he clogged the toilet for 3 days
8588,Walking through school is always pretty sad. I walk past all these people talking happily with their friends and then I go home and sit down alone and contemplate my existence. Yeah...
8589,The saddest thing I last seen would have when my dog died in my arms 2 weeks ago. :(
8590,I can relate I looked at mine and there it was you (don't ask how that is possible)
8591,What did that man eat
8592,Br*tain
8593,I have a feeling that the answer has something to do with Mexican food

8609,my friend showed me a video of a horse stepping on a bird
8610,Makes me miss my dogs so much:((
8611,My grades. No seriously. I'm almost done with high school  and it's freaking me out. I had 3 As last quarter and now I have 2 Bs and a C. I'm freaking out. I wouldn't be able to get into college. And to think that my grades are dropping because I have a job I don't want but can't refuse. Before I was in a limbo of a small balance of doing my work at the last minute now I can't do it cause I'm too tired. I hate this.
8612,damn that's smooth as hell
8613,Sorry to hear that :( Ours managed to be completely Covid free until a week or two ago unfortunately
8614,"Yeah but I don't live with my mom, I live with my dad.

8616,can i third wheel in this or nah
8617,My crush accidentally threw something at me and he felt bad so he gave me a minute long hug.
8618,When we went on a school trip. We had so much fun together. It was memorable 😊
8619,"We were talking and opening our feelings, and after that conversation we hugged. When I wanted to separate she didn't. She even held me stronger and longer than before. It was... wow"
8620,"the first time he came over to my house! we were getting ready to go to the pool, and i hear him bump against smthn in my bathroom. i asked him ""heey you okay?"" and he starts making fake war noises (kinda like that episode of spongebob with imagination and the cardboard box) 😅 or the time we saw Endgame together and we couldn't stop hugging/holding hands with each other"
8621,You can be my first wheel.
8622,my ex crush drew on my hand and it was really sweet
8623,It sounds like your crush might like you back.
8624,"She gave me her ig and I told her that she looks rly pretty (cuz my friend set me up wit/told me abt her) and she responded wit, ""no cap ur RLY handsome"" - my girl"
8625,Now i wanna fifth wheel just to play minecraft with some homies 😃

8627,"That's not normal behaviour, he probably likes you. Take your shot, or plan ahead."
8628,"On my birthday we had dressed up like we were going to my senior prom since irl it was cancelled and we took a bunch of prom pictures, had a big fancy dinner, it was great"
8629,"That's not normal behaviour, she probably likes you. Take your shot, or plan ahead."
8630,"“Remember that morning on the bus?” He says all the time. 

Literally can’t reveal more than that because Matthew The Hoe From Class stalks my reddit :)"
8631,"Had a crush, now doesn’t."
8632,"Walked into school with a new hoodie one day (I've known her since freshman year, this was last year for context, my sophomore year) and I walked in wearing a Tyler, The Creator hoodie and she was talking to me about it and I went back to my table, and my other friend told me that said crush thought that I looked cute and slimmer wearing that hoodie. Felt pretty sick."
8633,"My current crush rejected me INDIRECTLY! I didn’t say anything, even. I was just talking about my love life and how crappy it is and the way she talked made it clear that she didn’t like me at all. She was nice about it tho. It is better than getting directly rejected... right?

Edit: I guess I no longer have a chance, it seems... if anyone could help, dm me. I am an introvert in need, so don’t expect me to continue talking too long. Sorry 😅"
8634,"we were dating for a bit, but things kinda fell apart. we're working on getting back together tho! so hopefully it'll work out 😅.."
8635,It’s the time when we’re just hanging out and talking. Just a great person to talk to
8636,she talked to me.
8637,"sounds like your ready to make the next move, maybe your crush can become your boyfriend?"
8638,Lmfao
8639,"All moments since this monday had been great. Right, u/PlasBoltz ?"

8643,"Excuse me, who are you?"
8644,Seven. I'm in
8645,"For me personally girls with make up on are attractive but I just think that girls look better without makeup because for one it shows their natural beauty and for two there is nothing more attractive than being comfortable. Like sweatpants, a hoodie, and a messy bun just hits so much different, ya know what I mean?"
8646,"Yes, because it's something that took time and effort to do"
8647,"yes because it’s not like i’m doing it for them, i’m doing it for me and it took me time and effort to do what i did so lol yea it’s hard to explain but it is annoying"
8648,I would argue taking care of yourself and laying a layer of color onto yourself is two different things. There are always people who truly find a face without makeup (but obviously taken care of) is more beautiful
8649,[deleted]
8650,"Idk if this is too much info, but when I was little people would tell me I looked prettier with my glasses off. It was always little kids who didn't understand what they were saying, but it really hurt me a lot considering I had to wear them the whole day. Later on in life some people tell me I look better with my glasses on. No matter what I looked like I wish people didn't say that stuff to me."
8651,Totally agree
8652,[deleted]
8653,r/thanksdoctorimcured
8654,"Yeah I get what you mean, I think it's just the wording that sounds insulting. Like if you see a girl without makeup, just say she looks pretty and leave it at that."
8655,"Yes because it makes it sound like I do not look good with makeup etc, and I LIKE doing those things because it’s fun and makes me feel good. I would like to be told that I look good without makeup IN ADDITION to looking good with it, rather than looking better with one or the other."
8656,[deleted]
8657,Sometimes taking care of yourself = putting on some make up so I don't feel self concious about my acne.
8658,Why don’t you just... not have acne?
8659,"Sometimes because I put effort into doing my nails or styling my hair and it kind of makes it seem pointless or like it doesn't change my appearance from how I usually look. But sometimes, at the right time it can be a cute compliment"
8660,🙋🏻‍♂️
8661,"My best friend is really good at makeup, but sometimes she calls herself ugly without it, which is not true. So I told her that I actually think she looks better without the makeup, and she got upset. Now I am not a makeup person at all, I really dont get the appeal of it. But I *do* care a lot what my hair looks like, and I've spent years experimenting and trying different lengths, different accesories and different shampoos and contitioner, and putting a lot of effort giving it a shape I like. 

I realized that the commitment I have to my hair is kinda similar to the commitment a lot of other girls have to their makeup, and telling my friend she looks better without makeup would be like someone telling me that I'd be prettier if I was bald.  
So yeah, I'd find it annoying if someone told me I'd be prettier bald, the same way my friend finds it annoying if someone tells her shes prettier without makeup. It's not fun when you spend effort on something and then someone tells you that you've just wasted your time and you'd be better off without it."
8662,"Excuse you. I don’t wear any makeup, don’t do much to my nails besides cleaning them, and haven’t touched a hairbrush since I don’t even remember (short hair, never gets knotty). Sweatpants, leggings and sweaters or just comfy cardigans are the bomb, super comfortable. And I look pretty neat if I do say so myself."
8663,"no sir, it isn’t."
8664,"""You looked better with long hair"" cool, I like it short. Plus I donated it so you can fuck off

""You look so weird with glasses on"" oh well excuse me for not caring enough to put my contacts in today, would my glasses look better shoved up your ass?

""You look weird with no makeup"" No shit Sherlock the only makeup I wear is filling in my eyebrows cause they don't exist otherwise. Want an award for your amazing discovery? I can see the headlines already, ""Man discovers woman looks weird with no eyebrows"""
8665,[deleted]
8666,Natural looking or light makeup is a thing. She may not be wearing a full face of makeup but even just slapping on some mascara can bring some real definition and beauty to a person. Its almost impossible to notice on its own but a side by side can be quite stark.
8667,"Idk. I never wore makeup or got my nails done. But I have had my hair done and they say I looks better with that hair. 
But I don't like the way my hair looked when they said it."
8668,*inhale* BRO LET ME FEEL PRETTY IN MY OWN WAY GOSH DARN IT
8669,"Well, can't relate most of us have imperfect skin"
8670,This is the type of self confidence I wish I had
8671,"Acne medicine/topical treatments don’t work in a day lol, you can’t just use them once and bam you’re cured. In the meantime, there’s no issue with wearing makeup to cover it up. Plus, some people have hormonal acne which constantly pops up"
8672,"Yes, because I look good either way 💁🏼‍♀️ plus most guys i know have never seen me without some sort of hairstyle or makeup."
8673,That’s not what I said but aight... good to know I guess
8674,It’s really annoying because we do put effort into it and they’re just saying “but you didn’t have to put that effort in” and there is no parallel. Boys don’t have something that is the same as this issue
8675,"She’s 3 years older than me and in college, she’s the nicest person ever, she’s been through a lot but still looks out for other people, I love her to death"
8676,"So i have 4 best friends, 2 girls and 2 boiiss, I'm gonna describe them all haha. She is a very good singer, pretty, short, cute and beautiful. The other girl is also very beautiful, cute, but she is tall and a great dancer. He is the best ""brother from another mother"" I could've asked for, funny, smart, weird, and lovely(they're all lovely btw). The other boii is super sweet, weird, funny, super bad ass and also a great friend(I'm kinda in love with him oops). They are all the best friends I could've asked for and I love them with my whole heart<3"
8677,that wasa quirky read lol
8678,She’s actually the best person ever. We’ve been through almost everything together. She’s so nice and super creative. Also one of the only people I’ve ever showed my true personality to lol
8679,tall
8680,I would upvote but there are 69 upvotes
8681,he’s my favorite person on this planet!! i love him soooooo much he’s so smart and funny and good at everything! i love being around him more than any other person and he’s so cute! he’s my homecoming date too
8682,I feel stupid to ask but is this a good or a bad thing? XD
8683,Damn that's deep
8684,good though
8685,Nice
8686,she is pretty tall
8687,"Sounds like you got a really nice friend circle, have fun!"
8688,Nice
8689,"She’s the best best friend I could ever ask for, she’s supported me through my toughest times and now we’re just really close. We’re really similar and have the most interesting conversations. All I really can ask about her is that I’d be dead if she didn’t exist"
8690,Sounds like you might drop an F from his BFF status
8691,"she's the best thing that's ever happened to me 🥺 
no matter how much i fuck up she never like, leaves me or gets properly angry and it means the world that she understands bc i've had like 4 people just cut me out of their lives this year. we get annoyed w eachother but understand that thats just how it be lol. 
i remember she slept over for a week when it was only supposed to be like one day, she came into my room n showed me she packed extra clothes djsndnddn 
like, i swear on god we're soulmates bc sometimes one of us will just be feeling,,, bad? and not even tell the other. like we wont even see eachother physically and then one of us texts whoever's feeling bad that they feel bad too and its just so insane lol. we share like one braincell."
8692,"I like how everyone here is like ""omg best person ever"" but my best friend is just an asshole"
8693,He’s short and cute... wears glasses. He’s apathetic about a lot of things but he does show that he cares about his friends when they need him. He’s very charismatic and funny while still being an introvert and he’s very analytical. He also has a very uncensored sense of humor but knows when certain things are appropriate to say.
8694,A backstabber who uses me for money and food
8695,"We're complete opposites. She's short, girly, cute and everyone loved her and I'm very tall, edgy and usually people avoid me. Despite being complete opposites when it comes to basically everything, I've never been as close to someone as I am with her. Never fought before and still going strong after many years. I love her so much"
8696,update: just did :)
8697,"1.) hes like  6'7"" and hes super gay and good at drawing, plays guitar, goes to concerts with me and is a low level weeb.

2.) shes a stringbean, is constantly hurt, very stressed out by my chaotic actions, emo and is currently trying to steal my cat

3.) hes a boomer in a polish 16 yr olds body and he just sent me a video of him watching Willow while drinking apple sauce so if that says anything i dont know what does

4.) shes short, chaotic, and we basically just spend all of our time drinking tea, singing Broadway musical soundtracks, watching anime and horror movies

5.) hes my dm in dnd and a is a probably a demon and he owns a suit of armor and speaks latin and owns a very cute cat who hate me"
8698,reading these comments are making me sad I don’t have a best friend rip
8699,"No he's not bad, just an asshole sometimes"

8701,Nice
8702,Sounds like my crush... same age too...
8703,she’s my best friend not my gf yet
8704,This sounds like a TV show
8705,Due to my mother I used to think going outside with wet hair made you ill. She still believes it.
8706,Deadass I just realized it by reading ur comment lmfaoo
8707,I thought that n was before m until freshman year of high school
8708,I used to say it like wo-ah instead of woah
8709,It doesn't???
8710,No heh. Germs aren't more attracted to wet hair. People associate going outside with wet hair and getting sick because exposure to germs is more likely when you go outside but it has no impact on your chances of getting sick.
8711,💀💀 Lmfaoo bruh that's funny af ngl
8712,I didn’t learn the difference between left and right until 7th grade
8713,"Really? I thought it went more like:   


A horse is sitting in a barn watching a small color T.V when all of a sudden,the news changes to advertisement for a new rock band in town and the horse is absolutely captivated!! He says to himself “I can do that,I should play the electric guitar”,so he calls up the local music store and asks the worker about lessons, he says “sure thing!! I know a guy that could teach you!when would you like your first lesson?” The horse says “as soon as possible! OH! And one more thing,I’m a horse,will that matter?” “Nope not a problem man” says the store owner.

A few weeks go by and the horse is a natural and he’s absolutely strumming the sweet life out out of the guitar like a pro and all the while,the other animals in the barn hear him and asked why he started playing,so the horse shows them the ad and the cow sees the drummer banging out a sweet beat and he thinks to himself “if that guy can do it,why couldn’t I?”. So he calls up the music shop and asked the owner for lessons,the owner says “I know a guy that can teach you,when would you like to start?” And the cow says “as soon as possible!, OH! And one thing I’m a cow will that matter?” The store owner says “Nope! Not a problem”. A few weeks go by and the cow is drumming out a beat while the horse is strumming away,and the two sound phenomenal! All the other animals gathered around and asked why they decided to learn an instrument, so the horse puts on the ad for the animals, meanwhile the chicken is absolutely mesmerized by the bass guitar, the chicken says to him self “if the horse and cow can play why can’t I?”. So the chicken calls the music store and asks the owner about lessons,the owner says “I know someone that will be able to help,when would you like your first lesson?” And the chicken says “ ASAP! OH! And I’m a chicken would that be a problem?” The store owner says “absolutely not!”. A couple of weeks go by and the chicken is laying down a bass,the cow is drumming a sweet beat and the horse is strumming the life out of the guitar, they 3 sounded so good that someone overheard them playing and told them “I’m holding a talent show in the next state over and will fly you there” all three of the animals agreed.

Day of the plane trip comes and the horse is late to the airport and missed his flight,so he sitting in the waiting area for a couple of hours waiting for a later flight when suddenly the news brakes in! The plane that the cow and the chicken where on crashed and every one on that flight perished, the horse is absolutely devastated,he can’t take it anymore he’s a mess! And he decided he needs to drown his sorrows. So a horse walks into a bar and the bar tender says “why the long face?”"
8714,Until I learned about sex I thought a fetus just randomly appeared in a woman’s belly😓

8725,"im sorry, what? when you found out girls did not have a vagina????"
8726,Wait wo-ah is wrong?
8727,i thought ily meant i love you in french
8728,It's something like being cold and wet can lower your immune system or something but there's no science linking having wet hair and getting sick. There are other protections your body has before your internal immune system anyway.
8729,I thought that organic was organtic for the LONGEST time
8730,Congratulations! We are both stupid
8731,I didn’t know how to read until first grade. But I played video games before first grade and somehow knew where to go.
8732,"When I first found out girls did not have a vagina, I believed that girls peed on their ass 

Later did I find out..."
8733,"The joke usually goes:

A horse walks into a bar. Says the bartender ""Why the long face?""

And he asks that because the horses face is actually long because of the snout thingy"
8734,"I don’t get why parents don’t tell their kids at least part of the real truth, it just makes thing more complicated"
8735,"Damn, wish I even had that ability at least"
8736,"If anyone here is afraid of talking to people, talk to me! I love meeting people and hearing their stories, and I do my best to keep conversations two-sided. I might not be able to instantly make you all public speakers, but I'll be happy if I can make y'all a bit more comfortable around people :)"
8737,yep this one and I hate it
8738,Damn how do you get over it?
8739,Just wiggle through your live. It works best
8740,IS THIS ANOTHER EXTROVERT??!?!? LETS BE FRIENDS.
8741,i always think other people don't like me even if they don't know me so yeah BUT helllllo my people in the comment section lmao I will be your friend I make music and play Minecraft and have anxiety so if anyone can relate pls be my friend...pls
8742,*I just kept crawling and it kept working*
8743,"Yeah I'm kinda the same way. I feel comfortable talking around my people that I already know, but getting to know new people is an issue."
8744,I FIND THIS PROPOSAL AGREEABLE.
8745,"just pretend they’re NPCs, and what i do is try to mirror how they act... they can’t not like you if you act like them ;)"
8746,Yeah I feel that
8747,Omfg I am I just don’t know how to make friends if like I don’t talk to them in school so I thought out of school but where do you go to make friends out of school? And how do you just go up to a stranger and like be friends???
8748,I tell people to fuck off whenever they pm me so that's all on me.
8749,Yeah. Actually quite ironic that yours just happened to be right after mine

8758,Yep unfortunately 😞
8759,"I get this, the initial getting to know them is mostly fine, but after that idk what to say, if there’s a conversation going I can keep it up, but for the life of me I suck at starting a new convo"
8760,"ikr, my friends describe me as having put all my points on charisma and forgot about social skills"
8761,YES BUT ALSO SCHOOL BUT YES
8762,"Yes. Mostly from starting to watch streamers play games with so many people, and have amazing friendships. I wish I could do that, but I’m scared to meet new people and I have so much anxiety that I wouldn’t be able to talk to them, like how I can’t talk to the friends I currently have. I hate it"

8771,Ikr it took soo long to get to 2020. But I'll guess time will slow down now that things are getting normal here (for me) again
8772,It looks like from january to april were 6 months and from September to january is 6 months.
8773,[deleted]
8774,"Damn, really? That's not too much.  I guess it makes sense, though."
8775,Me too...  i was playing modded minecraft at 12 am like any anti social... 😔
8776,Why is everyone saying 'time flies' this has felt like longest most agonising year of my life. I'm at the point where 2019 is starting too feel fucking nostalgic.
8777,School start is tomorrow for me
8778,"nono pal, universe have it own plans. time goes faster as you get older"
8779,"Guaranteed 2020 will end with a bang, maybe a revolution/civil war."
8780,it still feels like it’s march bruhh
8781,"Same, I’m so not prepared"
8782,"oh shit, please no March"
8783, It I’ll be optimistic up until then
8784,crazy innit
8785,Yeah this year has been so crazy
8786,It’s actually still January. 2020 was a dream. You’re in a coma. *”Wake up u/Uniquer_name”*
8787,"Yeah, and it's already Christmas in less than 4 months. Like, it just happened."
8788,Let me believe it does
8789,I just hope this year ends and a better one starts
8790,I dont remember a single thing I even did this year. Like what even happened?
8791,School done already started dragging me by my ear
8792,I wish
8793,"Jesus fuck, no I'm not doing it all over again."
8794,"Same, I remember nothing of what we've done last time I was there"
8795,"Omg I couldn’t agree more, the worst part it’s when you say “..., if so why...”, like the questions requires you to say WHY you think that."
8796,"Be careful, I have the muscle mass of a chihuahua that just had its first dose of heroin ,and the power of God *and* anime on my side."
8797,"Maybe mods won't hurt you, but I will!"
8798,I surrender
8799,"Okay, OP. I guess I will."
8800,Can we also make it so people ask questions that would solicit more than one word answers and actually explain their question 😗✌️
8801,"I think most people would think that canned hot dogs are a good idea, but idk"
8802,"Oh god yeah you're right, I always put that on the end of my question, but it still comes up dry."
8803,Never surrender
8804,K
8805,I think we can all say ok
8806,potassium
8807,Yeah I’ve just learned to accept it.
8808,"Thanks! Do you know how to change the flair? I can't seem to, I'm on mobile."
8809,Yes!!! Sometimes these questions are so simple and they feel so obvious. It's hard not to give one word because explaining why is almost hard because its so simple
8810,She just did silly
8811,"I know that, *silly*"
8812,"Okay Boomer

But legitimately, if this is considered a problem it’s not just commenters faults, people need to ask questions that require more than a yes/no answer"
8813,"Yeah, I guess.

.

Sorry, I'll stop now. But yeah, I completely agree with what you're saying. Detailed answers are far better than single word answers. I think that a way to help get more detailed answers is to ask people why they arrived at their conclusion or how they did so in your question. It would be cool if there was a way to push the detailed answers to the top without everyone having to upvote them or something, but I don't think Reddit does that, unless you could have a small not army that automatically upvotes longer comments a small amount (maybe 1 upvote for 50 characters, 2 for 250, 3 for 1000, 4 for 2000, 5 for 5000). That could go against Reddit's TOS though. Anyway, that could give the longer comments a boost as well as encourage people to give more detailed answers (people strive to attain karma). Since it's not a huge amount of karma, bad answers could just be downvoted again by humans."
8814,"Yeah, I guess."
8815,[deleted]
8816,Cool
8817,What flair do you want?
8818,Banana
8819,Sure
8820,Either everyone or a meta flair
8821,Oh shiet I forgot to put an option of Everyone flair lol.
8822,"Uhhh..... 

Wut?!?"
8823,yes
8824,k
8825,"I don’t think it is disgusting. Buut I shave everyday coz I don’t like how it looks on me or other people. Like when people have those bushes, I don’t get it. But yeah, it’s not disgusting, just not a good look."
8826,I mean I’ve never shaved it before. Should I shave it? Legit curious. I’ve never really considered it.
8827,"EVERY DAY?!  
ＥＶＥＲＹ damn DAY????????????  


what the fuck. I can't even keep up with my stupid beard and shave it every other day, and it's right in my face"
8828,"i think a lot of girls do that, its way easier lol"
8829,"Yeah, I think it’s super gross especially guys with bushy pit hair like how do you put deodorant on that"
8830,I think guys with armpit hair are sexy (I’m not gay but I’m not blind either) however my brother is 25 and you can see his pit hair poking out when he wears a tank top. Literally nasty.
8831,I don’t mind it on anyone.
8832,I hate it on anyone. Especially if you go swimming in the summer and it gets all wet. Ew.
8833,"I think a little trim here and there dosent hurt anyone, but shaving is a different case"
8834,"I did it once and when I sweated it ran down my body instead of evaporating, 4/10 can't recommend"
8835,lolmao nice
8836,Lots of swipes
8837,No don't shave your damn armpit hair wtf are these people talking about.
8838,"I shave while I’m in the shower, so it takes only a few secs. It’s just a habit ig, legs and other stuff takes longer so I don’t do it as often."
8839,yes and it's keeping you warm.. why bother?
8840,"Again, don't think it's nasty. Don't see what's so bad about someone having hair on their pits. It you don't like seeing it, okay I guess, but it's still fine for people to have the pit hair and for it to be visible."
8841,It’s gross especially when you put on deodorant and it makes your sweat smell worse
8842,"I don't really care, but I don't 100% think it's gross because everyone has it :/"
8843,OMG FOR REAL BRO YUCK
8844,I don't care mostly because I know that it's kinda frustrating bc it grows back sooo fast so like idgaf I wouldn't care if my boyfriend/girlfriend had armpit hair it's just natural
8845,"yes, it's unnecessary and looks gross"
8846,Only if you want to
8847,Yeah. It's a breeding ground for bacteria.
8848,"I mean, if you shave every day, it only takes a few seconds! Then again, I can’t grow any facial hair except for sideburns"
8849,I don't care for it honestly. It's there or it's not.
8850,"I’m considering doing it. I’m curious about whether it makes that big of a difference. 

I remember when I first shaved my pubic region, it felt kind of weird for a while."
8851,"Even if you have hairy armpits, if you wash it correctly it shouldn't smell bad. You get smelly (mainly) for two reasons, you either didn't use deodorant, or didn't wash correctly last time.

Maybe I'm a bit lost because I'm not a hairy guy and I get rid of those hairs every once in a while, but it's always been like that for me."
8852,"Yeah, I get called gay and shit by my family (they are joking) for shaving my armpits, but I don't think I can imagine anyone genuinely liking armpit hair."
8853,I'd it's unnecessary why do our bodies still have it
8854,"Understandable, I was rather wondering because OP's 13 and I was far from thinking about shaving at that age"
8855,"Plus ""looking good"" doesnt always mean stereotypical. Healthiness is important anyway."
8856,"Yes, I get made fun of daily. Have since I can remember."
8857,That’s the first impression people get from each other it makes sense it would happen to everyone
8858,"Jeeze my guy, 5 years"
8859,[deleted]
8860,"Children, teenagers, adults, literal complete strangers, doesn’t matter. They’ve all made fun of me."
8861,This is how us boys get a bad rep here
8862,Really? By your friends or bullys in school?
8863,"Wow, I can't even imagine what it's like being in your shoes but I can say this, you shouldn't hate yourself, you should love yourself and every single aspect of your body no matter how many times you'll get called names and made fun of..
Someday i hope you'll meet someone who won't care about how you look, and that he/she will like you for your personality."
8864,Just for your looks? Wow..
8865,"Wow, those were very kind words, u/DildoMachineFFS"
8866,I’m used to it. I hate how I look so it doesn’t bother me when other people say it anymore.
8867,My bad
8868,"Thanks u/PointlessWeeb, I try to make people feel better about themselves so I can fill in the hole in my heart.."
8869,I don't think it was so much your statement at it was the winky face at the end that implied a different meaning and people see your age compared to hers...
8870,"No, you are kinda being narrow minded, you have no idea what’s going on in her life, she could just be smaller by genetics, she could have anorexia or any other disorder similar, it’s ok to misunderstand it’s part of what makes us human and I understand where you are coming from I used to be bad at this too, happens to the best of us"
8871,Not if you meet them online ;)
8872,"yes, but confidence is also really important"
8873,In most of those cases people are insecure and somewhat jealous of your weight.
8874,I'm scared....
8875,I'm gonna call the police
8876,Is this because you got shit ratings on r/teenamiugly ?
8877,"Brother she's five years younger than you. 

By the time she's my age, you'll be 21, and that's not legal."
8878,"Shut up! Don't you dare say that about yourself!
Everyone has a place in this world, everyone deserves one but It's your choice what to do with it. If you're not satisfied with yourself you should try changing things but not too much."
8879,"She didn't say that at all. She said that people makes fun of her because of her body, not that she is unhappy with it."
8880,"i have brown hair, but as soon as i started highlighting it so many more opportunities came up, and people kept complimenting me on how pretty my hair color was even when they have only known me with it highlighted"
8881,Of course
8882,but the point is it shouldn't matter
8883,Awe that's sweet you seem like a really nice person
8884,Some people have medical reasons why they can’t gain weight as well as many other reasons why. Telling someone to eat just because they’re not “thicc” is rude af

8886,"He is just amazing really, he is always making me laugh and just the little things like asking about how my day went. Thought he didn't like me after he rejected me like a month ago but he told me recently that he does like me it just wasn't a great time cause he was still upset about his ex. So now we're actually getting together and he is the nicest guy I've ever spoken to, like he is so respectful and actually cares about me."
8887,Well my crush seems to not have any interest in me anymore for whatever reason.
8888,"She’s my first crush:  I‘m 99% sure she liked me before I liked her and I kinda fell for her cause of that and bc we spent some more time in the last days. Nvm, I‘m too dumb to read the task."
8889,oml this is adorable you should def try to get closer to him lol
8890,my crush is... my girlfriend. ik... i still don’t believe it. the list of things i love about her extends longer than that of a CVS receipt. it’s amazing. everytime i see her i melt. i love her.
8891,sounds kinda nice ngl
8892,[deleted]
8893,Haha it just sucks that nothing could ever happen w him and that he sends mixed signals. Oh and forgot to add that his eyes are HYPNOTIC as fuck.

8897,ok but how do you know for sure that nothing would ever happen?
8898,"Amazing girl and I'm pretty sure I lowkey kind of love her but here's the thing: she has a boyfriend.

Hint: It's not me."
8899,She doesn’t exist yet
8900,One of our mutual friends told me he didn’t go for younger girls.
8901,He’s sans isn’t he
8902,I read this whole thing thinking how adorable it was then I read the last part and I'm like oh....... oof
8903,HES A VIDEO GAME CHARACTER AND DESPITE CLAIMING MULTIPLE TIMES I AM NOT GAY IM NOT IM BI
8904,It’s easy just jump on him like a tick and don’t let go and he will eventually accept that you are a part of him now
8905,"He’s such a nerd but he’s really sweet and SO cute. He’s a gentleman, has an amazing sense of humor, and is really kind to me."
8906,Lucky bugger

8910,Life goes between pain and boredom lmao.
8911,W A L U I G I
8912,I'm so happy for you!
8913,"She’s such a nice girl and I’m too shy to do anything. Last year I had 2 classes with her and it probably was better if I got closer last year. She’s still in lunch with me and in a similar class around period 5 so I have 0.01% hope. I probably should just forget after all it’s probably an impulse crush. My crush on her has wavered so yeah it’s an impulse. Nothing however can distract me from my true love; green apple martinis.

Edit: not the nice girl nice girl, but the genuinely nice."
8914,"Same, no crush gang wya"
8915,Not with that attitude 👹
8916,when my parents always talk about how i’m single but then again don’t want me to date anyone???? 😭😭😭😭
8917,i hate it when girls on tik tok comment on videos witj things like “rail me” or “it looked at me first”. it’s so infuriating bc it’s seen as disgusting when a guy does it but it’s quirky when girls do it. both sides suck
8918,When girls are virgins they are considered pure and goodie goodies but when guys are virgins they are “weak” and made fun of. We just need to rid the concept of virginity as a while and not judge people based off of their sex lives or lack thereof.
8919,"I'm no doctor, but I don't think you can castrate women."
8920,"that's terrible, fuck whoever makes fun of him , they can go to hell"
8921,"You can sterilize, by ligaturing the fallopian tubes(?) I'm not sure if that's the correct term in english."
8922,"When boys are gender non conforming, they have to actively do something(paint their nails, do their hair up). When girls are gender non conforming, they are just existing in their natural body(not shaving legs, not wearing makeup). Women are already expected by society to look like perfect little dolls all the time to the point that it’s weird when they don‘t(and they often get criticized for not being super feminine) while men don’t have to."
8923,"It's not a double standard.  I think people who put mayo on hot dogs are an abomination, but they still have a right to do it 🤷‍♂️"
8924,Showing emotions. Girls are expected to cry and it’s acceptable. But when a guy does it he’s seen as weak and is harassed for it. Also goes for mental health in general.
8925,That's such a shitty situation
8926,We’re having fun and neither of us feel like we owe each other anything— it’s just our ritual.
8927,*Challenge Accepted*
8928,The same is with high amount of sex partners. If a girl does it she is a slut and when a guy does it Oh he is the coolest guy ever
8929,"ikrr, i mean guys have there own set of weird ass comments but still girls dont get criticized at all for commenting that."
8930,"They want you to break the rules and live a more risky teenage life without actually fully endorsing such actions.

Parents have the tendency to want to push the life they never had upon their children"

8933,"if a boy asks a girl out , and she says no , we'll think she's shallow . but if a girl asks a boy out , and he says no , the girl is desperate"
8934,I will 🙂🔪
8935,Or just remove it entirely
8936,"Not the most stupid, but comes from recent questions

Girls don't deserve the right to decide if they get sterilized or an abortion because of their hypothetical husband, but boys need to have the right to decide if they get circumcised because it is their body

Despite there being minor health benefits as a child, no benefits to not being circumcised, and a lot more difficulties if you do it as an adult. For example: better not get a boner otherwise you're going to rip the stitches open"
8937,"The one I hate the most is that if a man has a problem or is sexually assaulted, they are expected to ""man up"" and take it, otherwise they are a wuss. But if a woman has that exact same predicament, they are allowed to speak out and complain?"
8938,"how it’s perfectly fine and quirky and funny for girls to literally abuse their boyfriends in all kinds of ways, but if a guy slightly raises his voice for whatever reason, people say he’s an abusive potential murderer and needs to be dumped or some shit like that"
8939,This. I've never met a boy in my community that has a perfectly balanced set of emotions. All of them are fucked up emotionally in one way or another.
8940,"I'm pretty sure people advocating for the pro choice are also advocating against male child mutilation. I wouldn't call that a double standard, at least these two together are not. But you can fond a double standard issue in both of these separetly."
8941,"When a girl talks about her mental health everyone is supportive but when a boy talks about it he's considered weak and is told to ""man up"" like honestly I hate to hear that everytime I mention how I'm burnt out, stressed and close to a mental breakdown and a jump out of my window"
8942,"my boyfriend and i both have jobs. we normally just go back and forth paying for things. he’s kind of conditioned to the toxic masculinity of “the man must pay for the fancy dinner” so when he would take me to dinner he always paid. but we’re working on it. 

if we were in a situation where he couldn’t pay, i would always pay. that’s very gracious of you!"
8943,aww that's amazing
8944,"constantly pointing out that a skinny person is skinny and saying we should 'eat more' 'fatten up' etc, is totally fine, but you say to an overweight person 'you should lose weight' or 'eat less' for instance, its seen as extremely rude and horrible. No, both are rude, of course, healthy weight should be encouraged, but its still rude to say such things for both underweight and overweight people."
8945,"Lmao it was me, seems like i am a prophet"

If we get a lot of upvoted posts it will be more likely to be seen by users who have joined the subreddit and just uses it sorting by ""hot"" or through their home page. This will catch attention of our several thousands not-so-active users. Catching their attention will result in more people getting involved, more people getting involved will result in sub getting more interesting questions. This all will result in reaching out to newer people who may like to join the subreddit. All in all, an opportunity for a decent growth of this subreddit."

Just a reassure that they're gorgeous is enough when they feel insecure"

8975,"I mean yeah, I think I’m fairly attractive but I’m self conscious as fuck, but like some people just need to shut the fuck up and appreciate their natural beauty"
8976,"Yeah I understand and I still stand by my point. Telling a good looking person to stop being insecure is like telling a depressed person to stop being sad bc they have money and lots of fun things to do. 

Insecurities are weird, the brain makes them 200x worse"

8989,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
8990,I guess you’re right it’s just hard for me to see
8991,"I mean, well I used to be a little mad about that but now I just feel sorry for them. Cause, just like me, they obviously have problems with that and it only really matters what you think of yourself.

Also, bruh. Really? Another question from your older accounts?"
8992,"Omg.... every Discord chat I have with this group....

“I’m so ugly 🤮”

Then we’re like “you spelt hot wrong...”"
8993,hey i think i'm ugly but my friends say i'm the most attractive person they know :( they probably just can't see what you're talking about
8994,Because I speak only the truth of my looks; they are not very good

Then this one time I saw the same girl at the mall and we gave each other these awkward stares. It’s funny how we would talk in school normally, like she would ask me to borrow my pens and stuff and she was pretty nice . But in public it was something else.."
9020,Cross the road real quick.

She brings it up while we're eating the christmas dinner. Every year.

9031,That's just weird. Why would anyone wanna tell people that
9032,When I was 10 months old my twin sister wouldn’t stop crying so I took my pacifier out of my mouth and stuck it in hers to get some peace and quiet
9033,bro how do u have a blood phobia its literally all inside of u smh 🙄🙄🙄 snowflake tenagers!!!😂😂😂😂

9037,That fucker is curvy
9038,[deleted]
9039,Lmao I didn't know you could get high on cough syrup
9040,"Lmao ikr. My guess is because we're technically not supposed to see blood outside of our bodies. If we do, it means we inflicted some sort of wound. So seeing blood = being injured = being hurt and that might be why I'm scared xD"
9041,I swallowed a 10p once... when I was 12 😑

9062,"I used to lift weights more til my chronic pain got bad, can u send me ur circuit workout, I’ve been working out more as I get better but I’ve only done cardio not weight training. 

Anyway I like being stronger than the boys in my grade, it’s fun."
9063,a lot of times i’m like “i lift” and they’re like “WHATS UR SQUAT MAX”
9064,What martial arts do you practice?
9065,Just get testosterone injections lol /s
9066,"I do the same thing! During my crew teams winter conditioning we went to a CrossFit gym and lifted weights a little bit there.

9073,"Probably shouldn’t have marked this as girls only looking at the comments, but anyway some comments may partially be from the fact you’re quite young as well? Not sure since I don’t know the context and I don’t weight lift but thats great for you!"
9074,Well done I hope you keep working at it!

So I try to:

Think about how much it costs

Imagine feeling sick every morning for, possibly, 9 months

Poop up the back

Staying up late at night

S C R E A M I N G

Tearing while having it and needing s t i c h e s

If I have a C-Section, the recovery (my mom said she couldn't even laugh when she had me, and I saw someone who said they were scared to poop because they thought their stitches would pop off."
9101,"Yup, I agree with you completely. People are always telling me, ""Well, you'll want kids in the future"". No. I. Will. Not. Pregnancy sounds like hell reincarnated and kids... just no. I don't want kids and I never will. I wish people would just understand that and leave me be."
9102,They doing even pay taxes! Why aren’t they all in jail for tax evasion?
9103,I still want a horse
9104,"Whenever I talk to a baby they kick me out of the daycare center saying that your not ""allowed to be here"" and ""this is the third time this week we'll call the authorities unless you stop"" smh life is unfair"
9105,also ur article just called me a whore for wanting to have fun before making the biggest commitment of my life
9106,Guy here. Same thing. Sometime I just wish I was like a 45 year old guy in the garage teaching my son how to fix a car or some cool shit like that.
9107,"OK lol you got me there, I can't think of anymore lmao"
9108,I don't want children because I worry about the planet now and it's future I don't think it would be fair to them.  Saying that yes sometimes I get an overwhelming desire to want to have a baby growing inside me and taking care of her and just being a better mom than mine is.  Idk my hormones need to chill.

9112,"Same but can’t blame them, can’t imagine it’s comfy in the trunk of my car"
9113,Someone on Reddit posted that they like to stare at babies until they get uncomfortable. They said it was fun and I was like um- But I tried it and it's actually really funny so that's my experience with children for ya
9114,Good bot
9115,I hope she sees this bro 🙏🏻
9116,That’s good to hear for me cuz I’m in the same boat as OP
9117,i think it’s cute 😊 we can work things out together and try new things!
9118,"I’ve been in a similar boat, and it’s totally fine to feel ‘inexperienced.’ When you do eventually start a relationship, I would be somewhat open about it though to keep from any misunderstandings along the way. In short you’re totally fine, the right person wouldn’t care much anyways :)"
9119,"Wow, me too!"
9120,You’re still young. I’m 16 and I’ve never dated anyone. I’ve had friends be in relationships but the majority stay away from them because there’s too much drama at school for some reason. People for no good reason cheat or pretend to cheat and stir up trouble.
9121,It’d be perfectly okay with it considering I have no experience either
9122,Idk but I feel like it's the same thing that guys think about girls. It's cute how they might seem pure or whatever. Does that make sense?
9123,Not as old as y’all but me too :)
9124,yup. i 100% agree. innocent boys are cute
9125,Yes but i always assumed most people my age were experienced

9127,There's no issue

9129,It's just so adorable! Idk why but I wanna give em a big hug. Same with shy guys! 😣
9130,How would u have any experience
9131,Lonely bois rise up
9132,It is kinda scary tho cause you don't know if you're being too loud or making them uncomfortable or if they'd even be interested... For me at least lol
9133,I’m 17 and I’ve never been in a relationship so I think it’s ok. I just chose to focus on school rather than dating. I’d also say it’s more of a thing to do in college or after college cause what’s the chances you’ll be with that person after high school especially if you don’t go to the same college.
9134,How would u have any experience
9135,"I think that's a fair question. 

Honestly? I think it's just interesting to see what younger people's attitudes are compared to just a handful of years ago for me. I visit AskTeenBoys as well because I find both interesting. 

Maybe another part of me (definitely the relationship and social part of my brain) never really advanced past my teenage years due to my failures, even though everything else about me has definitely evolved. That's probably a large part of why I find it interesting in the first place.

Usually just gets me depressed though like I said. I see tons of these teens asking all kinds of relationship questions, questions on sex, the list goes on. And here I am, wondering where my years went. Maybe my mind is just stuck in the past.."
9136,"Won't be so cute when he's well into his 20's like myself... 

I'm at the point where I would HAVE TO lie otherwise people would think it's really weird. If it ever happens. 

Man, you youngins depress me. :("
9137,"None taken

Thanks, now next step is to be anxious as hell and never ask a girl out:)"
9138,Nooo! Please do. 1. It's so cute when guys are shy but still do it. It shows you like them andd I have a crush on a shy guy and if he never says anything I'll just think he doesn't and won't try ;-;
9139,[deleted]
9140,"Definitely agree.
And I'm the same as you."
9141,What if I'm a shy guy who has never dated anyone?
9142,cute and good
9143,I wouldn't mind and I would tell them if they're nervous or unsure they can just talk to me. Not communicating is such a pet peeve for me.
9144,Thanks these comments are making me feel better
9145,Same but I’m 18 lollll
9146,Aww. Crushes are fun enjoy it while it lasts lolol
9147,Lmaoo i feel that I’ve never asked any of my crushes out I’m a coward
9148,bruh I had a crush on applejack from my little pony and I don't cringe about it
9149,Fear of rejection and subsequent embarrassment is my guess
9150,never really had a crush on someone
9151,"Nah, I generally had decent taste."
9152,It took me a solid 7 months for the first one and a solid 8 months for the last one. It's rough bro
9153,Wait you asked out crushes? Your balls must be huge!
9154,I feel like i have decent taste and then a few months will pass and I’m like 🤢
9155,"I wouldn’t *rly* say so... maybe like one or two that were legit like one week crushes where I thought he was cute then after a week of getting to know what he was like I was like yeah no... 

I had one crush for rly long time that recently rly got over (I think I stopped *rly* liking him before but realized it later) but I don’t rly cringe at it (there were some cringe things I did lol but o don’t cringe at the fact I crushed on him) he’s a genuinely cool guy and I liked him for a while I just don’t like him anymore... I also think he liked me back (i have not idea where he stands on me now but at least in the past)"
9156,"I cringe over most but not all of them.  I legit had a crush on a homophobic guy in middle school, so I cringe a lot about that."
9157,What’s stopping yo I from asking her out?
9158,"I don’t wanna look like a nice guy, but get over the stereotype that only girls themselves and gays care about girls. That makes like no sense. Normal people 1) don’t distinguish gender when caring about people 2) some are caring and some not that much, but it’s definitely not only gays"
9159,Yes I cringe at like everything i did
9160,"hey, me too"
9161,whadafuq
9162,Mmm....no
9163,"My score is 4-0, be glad. Theoretically 4–1, but I don’t think that weird thing counted as asking out"
9164,same
9165,"same. for me, it’s because im aromantic."
9166,"I had one serious one and haven’t had one since, except I’m kinda developing one? Which would be _bad_ because he’s my friend and he’s dating my other friend so I’m just going to go cut my heart out"
9167,"One of them said yes, one of them said no for me"
9168,"some of them yeah, some no"
9169,yes yes yes
9170,"Yeah, but not because they're a bad person, but because I did stupid stuff with them which make me cringe.

Well ig their personality changed immensely after I broke up with them so I kind cringed there"
9171,"i think theres only one crush i ever had that didn’t turn out to be a piece of shit tbh. they’re always one of the following: rude, misogynistic, homophobic, or just general jerks and they somehow hide it for ages

and i crush on a lot of people"
9172,"Yep. Used to ""crush"" on boys but I now realise I am hella gay"
9173,"I mean, I geuss? Back when I was pretending to be straight I made myself believe I like this one guy... Now he's super annoying and calls me a whore. So I crinch really hard at that dude"
9174,"First time I was in a pressured situation, second time was late at night when my brain shut off


Rejection was kinda nice tho"
9175,same
9176,"Tbh, some people deserve it.

Not completely, I'm half Greek and half African, born in Greece tho and still living here."
9177,Ah cool. I recently researched how people laugh from different places and I saw xaxaxa
9178,Yes.
9179,"Yes, but I’m high key weak, so I’d just hurt myself. I’d also feel bad and apologize after"
9180,"xaxa > haha any dayy of the week, but use both for some reason"
9181,I just say lol and lmao
9182,"No, that's a very mean thing to do."
9183,not really
9184,Haha same :)
9185,um.. you ok? 😳
9186,Weird cause I’m pissed and could probably break a wall rn
9187,Frequently.
9188,"I was pissed when I made this and have anger issues so that makes me very easily violent 

Anyway how’s modding ATB? I noticed you haven’t spoken in mod chat yet?"
9189,"No lol just cause it’s fun to know things. 

Japan uses wwwww cause it’s a shortening of the word for laughter “warai”

Russia uses хахахахаха but also хихихихихи and although xaxaxa is hahaha, хихихи is hihihi, but it’s really just a “hehehe”"
9190,Yeah you’re like sugar in that way. Sweet as all fuck <3
9191,Ayyyy Fray I’d never break your spine <3
9192,"yea, so many new people. i’m a bit intimidated by you all ngl."

9196,"For specific people, constantly"
9197,Yeah 😔😔
9198,All the time
9199,Nope. That’s just horrible. There would be so much pain involved in that. I’d just not want to be responsible for that. But ya I do get really angry sometimes.
9200,"Yes, basically when a boy or man unprompted calls me a pet name like hunny or sugar. I will punch their face."
9201,I’m 14 lol nothing to be afraid of. Tbh I was waiting for you to say something so I could greet you and say hi and try to be nice as possible to you
9202,Ty cutie :)
9203,Eh you’ll fit in fine. You seem cool :) <3
9204,no
9205,Yes. Very much so.
9206,That kinda what i cant do
9207,O hi mr unsecure here
9208,Why not? It sounds like you can't talk to her at all. Is that the case?
9209,And i think shes in a realtion but idfk cuz i try not to be a creep/stalker
9210,"Almost always start making convo cos she might b too scared to start w u ,make her laugh , compliment her every now and again, idk what else"
9211,send her memes with hints
9212,"yeah, my friend sent me that 10/10 meme and that made it pretty clear lol"
9213,"I'm Ms insecure but I do these things by just weirding them out. I like this guy and there's a running joke that I say ""Hey, (name!"" A lot and I compliment his hair. It's not a joke but he thinks I'm strange. Idk bout interests but he says I ""don't annoy him"" with the stuff I do somehow. Need a go fund me for our wedding. 

He probably doesn't like me tho :) idk"
9214,[deleted]
9215,This is actually very informative thank you so much
9216,But did u friendzone him
9217,"Well of course, to say her name you have to find her name first. Good luck with your search.

Seriously though, I get being overwhelmed by shyness, especially by fear of being embarrassed. But also in my own experience, things are mostly just embarrassing to oneself. I know this may seem like pointless and unhelpful to say, but it’s kinda like how you are your own worst critic. I’m not saying thinking like that would make anything easier or less embarrassing, but idk, I’ve personally found it helpful before.

Sorry, I don’t have any outstanding advice."
9218,"Add her name when you say hello or goodbye

Ask her icebreaker type questions, and instead of sharing your answer after she shares hers, just make conversation around her answer. It makes you look interested."
9219,That's true tbh (coming from a girl) you have to strike while the irons still hot... In some cases girls just find a way to move on altogether as we think you're the ones leading us on or have no intention with us altogether which really just puts us off having a relationship with you in the first place
9220,This seems like what people just do to friends.
9221,What was it
9222,"Tell her nice things (not always physical it can also be based of her skills) e.g instead of just saying wow you’re pretty (yes that sometimes works) you can say wow I think that you’re an amazing artist!
Make her laugh and make sure to smile when she is around 
Touch her (OKAY OKAY NOT A CREEPY TOUCH BECAUSE THATS SOME STRANGE STUFF - but what I mean by this is just gentle touches like if you go past in the corridor brush shoulders or if your legs or elbows touch whilst sitting next to each other)
I hope this helps :)"
9223,Wait isn’t that just good manners if not is it ok cause I do that to everyone who’s nice to me and others
9224,I personally prefer next to because ten you can lean in beside her to talk to her
9225,I got da name and num
9226,[removed]
9227,"The name part is interesting, why is that?"
9228,It does thanks
9229,[deleted]
9230,What the fuck do you guys do if there is a nonbinary
9231,Done
9232,This gave me a bit of confidence at least. I’m over here constantly second-guessing myself instead of being myself because I feel like myself will annoy people.
9233,"Uh, what does that feel like? I mean, I feel it but I've reached a point where I'm seriously just stupid. I ask weird questions and act like a hyper demon child. If you have any advice uh.. help :) plz and thanks"
9234,I guess its ok since nobody prob likes me but I need to know if its leading people on by accident
9235,I don't want people to think I like them that would ruin there reputation
9236,Living is weird
9237,Yeah that's not what the question is about
9238,"Yea, we're all just conscious chunks of meat"
9239,"I know, but ya girl makes everything about herself"
9240,I think I understood a word or two from this comment
9241,I only feel that about my boobs
9242,I'm more of a chunk of bone myself
9243,"Like, never? Really? I'm honestly kinda laughing at the fact that I'm literally just a sack of flesh and bones and whatever right now. It's pretty absurd when you think about it."
9244,"Meh not rly, although technically it's that I feel more than that if it makes sense"
9245,or a mech suit with your brain as the pilot
9246,"Yeah, it's weird. Like dude there's a meaty thing barely 3cm into my skull that is literally the thing thinking this right now and it's very weird to think about because you can easily google how the brain looks like or brain operations and see how it is and its just weird to imagine you being like that too"
9247,I usually say fat fuck instead of sack of flesh but yeah
9248,"Tears and roses, that you?"
9249,[deleted]
9250,"Same, sometimes I look in the mirror and feel so weirded out like ""wow I look like this?"" It's so weird."
9251,LMAO YESSS WJDW
9252,Nah I’m more of a chunk of fat
9253,"Yeah, all the time, actually. It's like, I look in the mirror and I don't understand who is in front of me, but at the same time realising, that this is in fact, my body, how I look, my clothes. Yet everything is so alien and foreign. weird :/"
9254,i just sometimes think im a giant pile of cells
9255,Indeed we do uwu
9256,Same
9257,we have the same flair lol
9258,"YES





at least my sack of flesh looks hOt"
9259,"Sometimes I just have an existential crisis and question if what I'm doing right now isn't a dream or some simulation. Also it's weird to just think that your life, memories and experiences in all their complexity is just one of 7.5 billion equally or more so complex lives being experienced from all around the world and that your existense is completely meaningless to some Korean dude or Polynesian who is oblivious to your existense. I mean we're all teenagers and we've lived awile but some dude somewhere has lived 8x as long and watched a baby become a ln adult that's lived 4x as long as us and raise a grandchild our age, how does he look back on his life. Existense is weird"
9260,r/dpdr
9261,"No, I'm more than a sack of flesh. I'm Sarah Winchester"
9262,"It's also just a sign of actually thinking about life for what it is. Though, I'm not necessarily saying I don't have anxiety or other mental illnesses that could trigger depersonalization, I probably do have at least one."
9263,Absolutely. Why shouldn't I be?
9264,Yeah then I punch that weird sack of flesh
9265,"And also the only thing that makes murder and cannibalism and rape and all that crimes and evil is that somewhere along the way the little meaty supercomputer in our bone and meat mecha suits just up and said 'nah, kinda dumb' and collectively decided to create a whole system to enforce that. The only thing stopping you from grabbing your thumb and ripping it out of its socket and keep pulling till the skin rips is that your brain created a way to tell itself 'no, we don't like that'"
9266,"That’s not it tho. Someone crying won’t be able to say that they want this, this and this. Or well at least I can’t."
9267,[deleted]
9268,What you gotta do is ask her what she needs
9269,"Try to calm her down first.
     Offer a glass of water, rub her back or if your close ask if she wants a hug.
Once she's calmed down, ask her if she wants to talk about it. Make sure you listen, dont immediately start trying to fix whatever she's upset about

Thats how I'd go about it but everyone is different so keep that in mind"
9270,"Okay fair, but they might be able to get some words out or point at something"
9271,I love head pets they always make me feel better. Unless I have a rly elaborate hairstyle. Don’t mess up my hair lol
9272,"im saying all this as someone who has frequent panic attacks
if she’s having a panic attack or something similar, give her some space and don’t crowd her, especially if you’re not super close with each other, and later come back when she’s calmed down or just to regularly check on her. 
and if she’s just crying because she’s upset, listening to her is perfectly ok!! you’re trying to do what you can and it’s ok. if you’re close friends, you can hug her or rub her back, but personally if someone hugs me and we’re not super close, it makes me uncomfortable. 
But the most important thing is that you’re trying your best and that’s the best thing you can do :)"
9273,I'd like to know the answer to that question too
9274,Oh i didn't see the tag that Girls only 😅
9275,"Honestly, it depends on how close you are to her. If she's really close to you, a long hug could be really really helpful. Just listening and offering your support can also make her feel better, and asking her if she needs anything. But, hugs definitely help"
9276,"if she likes hugs, give her a hug"
9277,Same
9278,"hug her, tell her you’re always there for her, i repeat hug her, and (if you can) offer advice to the situation"
9279,Hug her if you feel comfortable doing so. Ask her if she needs anything and if you can do something for her. Listening and just being there for her is a lot already!
9280,"Just ask what is wrong and allow them to vent or talk about it. If they don’t want to either, that’s okay. Be a shoulder to cry on and tell the girl you’re here for her. Offer to hang out or do something fun, or just change the subject. Make her laugh! Whatever positive thing, there’s a good chance it’ll work."
9281,"Headpats... lol

edit: I'd do that tho🤷‍♂️"
9282,lmao i dont even know what to do when anyone starts crying i just pat their back and say its okay
9283,"this is too vague for a real answer. it depends on the situation and the girl. sometimes one would want to be left alone, while others may feel better talking about it in certain situations. it depends on how close you are"
9284,"Sometimes you don't have to say anything, just your presence is enough."
9285,For me personally just sitting next to me and having your arm around me so I could just cry and explain why I'm crying is really helpful. I cry a lot and it really helps when I can curl up and hug someone or something like that.
9286,Thx will try this
9287,"I had that once too. I let them talk and offer words that seemed appropriate (like for example if they felt like they didn’t deserve help because their problem wasn’t as bad as other’s. I said that while yes some people have it harder, some have it less hard but everyone’s problems are valid). Also nodding, saying little things when a reaction is good but don’t interrupt the story. 

Since my friend had a really big problem and mainly needed distraction, I talked about some things and basically had reaction for two. (Of course first asked if it’s okay and said what I’d do)  What I think is the main thing during FaceTiming is to comfort with words and expressions. Try to up everything. Also since they’re distressed, ask them if they have a place where they feel safe and if they aren’t there (and need guidance, let that be the first obvious thing) ask them to go there. Blankets can also feel a bit like a hug. 

Also. Ask them a day later or so if it’s going better. Ask if they need help or something. Try to be thoughtful."
9288,What it it’s over FaceTime?

9290,When you find out lmk lol
9291,"When im sad I dont want someone to fix my issues oe give me a solution I just want them to emotionally support me, most of the time I can sort them out myself and just want someone to vent to/ hug to feel more stable before fixing it myself."
9292,"Run before you get malded. 

Tbh it depends on the person and why they are crying. Try taking to her. Some people like music and HATE to be touched. Some like hugs. 


For me if you touch me when I'm crying ill have a panic attack, so just be sure to talk to people and be understanding of their needs"
9293,"the best thing is to just listen to her and ask ONCE if there’s anything you can do to help

unless she tells you that she *does* want your help, assume that she doesn’t. don’t press her on it.

just listen to her problems and comfort / support her (""it’s going to be okay"", ""I’m sorry that happened"", ""you can get through this"")"
9294,"I’m very close with her, like a brother sister relationship, and already know the issue, and know I can’t fix it. Anything besides just listening?"
9295,We are very close and I know she doesn’t want to be left alone
9296,valid point but have you tried not dying
9297,That's pretty smart
9298,Well not really. I dont care much for history. Sucks that i wont know how the human race will die out though. I mean unless its going to happen in the next 60 years.
9299,You gotta be dumb to come up with smart ideas
9300,aww heck I didn't think of that one
9301,"nooooo, dont give me existential dread now!"
9302,"Not exactly, the sun isn't big enough a star to end in a supernova. It's gonna turn into a red giant, swallowing Earth in the process, until it collapses into a white dwarf. But it is possible of course that Earth or humanity don't even exist anymore then, or that Earth gets redirected into a completely different orbit and survive, or that humanity has colonized other celestial bodies, or just space. All that we will never know."
9303,"Not really.

We'll keep repeating the same mistakes over and over I guess."
9304,"Look around. We’re living through a historical event RIGHT NOW. A pandemic is a pretty big deal! And we’re most like going to live to see how it ends. No we may not see the things you listed, but we will all live through a handful of events in our lives and will see them finish through."
9305,Would you still watch Infinity War again despite knowing Thanos wins in the end? Of course yes. It's about the story. Not the ending or beginning
9306,Good point there
9307,I would not worry if you can live for another 50-100 years you will probably see the collapse of western culture or China collapsing back into basically what the map looks like after Ming did a boom and died
9308,Sun is going to explode destroying earth
9309,"exactly, every stupid thing governments do has already played out and we are just too dumb to come up with different ways to avoid that"
9310,"So what if we know that?

We won't know the stories of all the people who come after us."
9311,"i don’t live history but i feel the same, i wanna know what happens and how the world ends and what goes on the rest of time, but again, i wouldn’t want to live to experience that"
9312,It never pissed me off until you brought it up lol now I’m really angry that I don’t get to see anything past my life
9313,You underestimate nuclear war.
9314,"Each generation is set to live in a certain timeframe, so they're encountering certain historical experiences, who they will tell to the next generation, just like the previous one did with them. After they'll vanish, the next generation will take action in deciding history, their job will be already done by then. Of course, we are always curious about the past and the future. But we have to realize that's another generation's present time, and we can only get glimpses of the past. About the future, if we'd see the future, we can avoid certain actions, which can mess up that specific future. That's the thing about it. Future is uncertain, until it will become the present. And the present will become the past.

Sorry for this philosophical reply."
9315,Shoutout to my 10000th grandchild.
9316,Spoilers :T
9317,Now you made me think about it 😫
9318,History ends with every passing second. So you do know. What you don’t know is how the future will end. History in the other hand is always known.
9319,Well I am now.

9465,"Thats how you would think their mind works but the x is literally x, æ is ash or something and the a12 is an aircraft that is the predecessor to his favorite aircraft. This may be off a little bit but its late and its what i remember from the joe rogan podcast he was just on"

9475,He’s just making the ultimate Kyle meme
9476,It's shitty if a girl takes advantage of it but 99%of the time I'd give her the benefit of the doubt. You try having a period someday. It can be really shitty and uncomfortable.
9477,"You have a right to be shitty but you can’t treat others like dog shit and then blame it on your period. 
If my female friends are shitty and pissed off im always a bit Lenient if they do something that annoys me and if it’s something major usually they apologise a few days later. That’s how I know they are real friends"
9478,Oh. My. God. People who use zodiac signs as a fucking excuse for being a piece of shit drive me insane
9479,"Really though, the period card is completely valid. I will get mad at a snickers bar for not opening, but I understand it’s because of hormones. 

What’s fucked is saying it’s not their fault, it’s 100% your fault if you say something unkindly towards someone else. It doesn’t matter how much your hormones are affected, it’s no excuse to at least not apologize for something you did, hormones and shit only amplify your current emotions, they don’t create new ones. I get it can be harder to have a handle on your emotions the younger you’re dealing with this, but still. It’s absolutely intolerable to not own up to something you did. 

There are two things periods get an absolute free pass on, though: being left alone; and going to the bathroom(for an extended period of time, if needed)."
9480,From what my female friends tell me it sounds like absolute hell. It’s just when girls take advantage of it that it irritates me
9481,"no one has the ""right"" to be shitty"
9482,"it can vary from person to person, as some people can have hella bad cramps but not much emotional state change, or it could be the opposite and you’re easily aggravated and want to cry at the same time without physical pain. either way though, it’s definitely not an excuse to do things that are plain rude"
9483,"Nah. You can act all pissed at everything, but remember, you still have your brain. You can decide whether to lash out or not. Kudos to those people who try to repress their anger (I don't get irritable during my period), but just because you have your period doesn't mean you have the right to be disrespectful."
9484,"Sorry, can't help use my Zodiac sign i'm a virgo!"
9485,"I mean zodiac signs are vastly different from periods. Periods do make you more irritable and frustrated, it’s to do with hormones and such. Serotonin is decreased which links to negative emotions. Zodiacs are however just a bunch of bs."
9486,"There’s never a good excuse for being rude. While your period does make you have mood swings, you have self control still... I have asked to be excused from gym while being on my period."
9487,Zodiac signs in general drive me insane
9488,"When my ex and I were still dating she said “I’m sorry I’m a bad girlfriend, I’m a Virgo it’s not my fault” on her story."
9489,Lol no. But most girls pull the period card in P.E.
9490,I think anyone would get mad at a snickers bar not opening. It's infuriating knowing that candy greatness is being kept away from you cuz of some dumb plastic that doesn't even function how it's supposed to.
9491,Who the heck uses that excuse? I've never seen that as an excuse for such bad behavior.
9492,"I dunno if we act like that on period but PMS (pre menstrual syndrom) a week before period contains being constantly pissed, eating sweets and being hard for u to move. Maybe that was what u were talking about?"
9493,Pretty much same for me
9494,That’s not excusable. Occasionally being on your period can be bad enough that you need to go home but it’s never an excuse to be a bitch.
9495,"this is not normal, yeah we can be more impulsive and get angrier when we're on our period but that's not an excuse to punch someone or whatever"
9496,"Um no, what kind of school do you go to?"
9497,"Period hurts, it sucks ur energy away and also, u always have to change tampons over and over again."
9498,Some people will use anything as an excuse to not be responsible for their own actions.

9500,"I mean technically anyone has the ""right"" to do anything. Doesn't mean they should but yeah"
9501,"It's still related to periods is what I'm saying, and most girls have PMS at one point in their life so it isnt super serious unless you're talking about something else that has more severe symptoms. 

Either way, it still is not an excuse to not apologise afterwards. Apologising isnt only for saying what you did was a bad thing, its also saying that you've acknowledged that its hurt the other person."
9502,"I understand being in a bad mood because of it, but there are lines that shouldn’t be crossed. There’s so many other people who’re on their cycle and you wouldn’t even know because they’re decent human beings."
9503,"I'd say if they're constantly going at it with their teachers then there definitely needs to be consequences as they should know better, but sometimes it's hard to control what you say when your hormones are fluctuating. Either way I don't think it's right for girls to get away with anything and everything just because they're on their periods."
9504,"my period pains are so bad that i feel like im gonna pass out, i will be sweating and laying down in pain and cant even think straight, when someone talks or touches me i want to scream at them and cry till they leave, but i have NEVER and will NEVER lash out or yell at anyone in the slightest way, I know they cant feel my pain and that isnt their fault- so if you girl friends are lashing out and then blaming theyre periods, theyre fucking stupid"
9505,"We're still (mostly) in control of our actions when we have our periods. Definitely not our emotions, but if I notice that I'm getting really angry over something small, and I know I'm on my period, I will literally say to whoever I'm talking to ""I'm on my period and I'm getting really angry right now so can you please stop doing what you're doing/leave me alone? Thanks"" Then if they don't listen to me, I will completely blow up at them. (but I at least give a warning first, when I blow up it's not out of nowhere)"
9506,Do they always hurt or only when you for example touch them
9507,"Any pressure, so I’ve given up wearing a bra for a bit"
9508,4 a dull ache but it’s allways there then a 6 when pressed
9509,"If it's a dull ache that could be breast cancer, check for any lumps"
9510,On scale 1-10 how much does it hurt?
9511," No lumps or anything , I’m wondering if it’s just growth pains as I haven’t had much growth"
9512,"Are you on your period? If so aching breasts are normal, otherwise I would go ask your doctor"
9513,"Could be that, how long has this been going on?"
9514,Few days
9515,"It could be due to your cycle, birth control, growth spurs etc. You can go to r/askdocs if you aren’t fully sure of what it is."
9516,I had bad periods so the doctor said it would calm them
9517,"That could be the reason
Birth control can fuck your hormones and make pms last all month wich can make your boobs tender

Not to speak from experience or anything"
9518,No just pain under the nipple
9519,That's not true lmao
9520,Birth control isn't for abortion it just prevents getting pregnant from the genetic riches of a male
9521,Are you on birth control?
9522,Yeah
9523,Depending on the pill you still have a period but with lessened or changed bleeding
9524,I'd say if it goes on for over a week talk to your gp
9525,Okayy
9526,"I doubt it’s breast cancer, Imma guy and my nipples hurt for like a week due to puberty and growth (not breast but it felt like there were marbles in my nipples). Could be the same thing for girls."
9527,Wait why did you get downvoted? You just said what you thought. Yikes
9528,Thanks
9529,Enlighten me
9530,"She says it could be normal, but that if it’s happening constantly (specially when you are not in your period), that you should go see a doctor, I had a similar thing and don’t worry it’s not cancer, sometimes if your hormones are a little imbalanced your boobs become more sensitive, when I was 15 I had a small ovarian cyst which caused me to have a lot of acne and my breasts were also sensitive, it’s not something to be worried about since ovarian cysts are normal and disappear naturally (or like in my case, if they don’t disappear and instead grow, then medication it’s needed to get rid of them), I’m not saying you have one I’m just saying that it could be a possibility.

Do you also experience very painful cramps during your period, and do you get cramps when you are not in your period?"
9531,"You take a pill every day for around 28 days i think. When you’re taking it, you won’t get your period. Then you take a break for a few days, get your period, then start taking the pill again. A lot of girls use it if they have really heavy bleeding or irregular periods"
9532,"I think that actually is 'breast tissue', it happens with pubescent guys."
9533,"You’re welcome, you mentioned the pain being under the nipple, when you say “under” do you mean that it is “inside” or be,ow the nipple?"
9534,Below where my boobs should be

9617,"The first time that I saw this question I thought that most of the comments will be ""cheap and creative"" but I'm kinda suprised that I was right. Expensive dates can be creative and some expensive stuff can be better than just watching a movie together. To me it just depends on what it is, but I'd probably choose   the cheaper option because I don't wanna waste money lol"
9618,Definitely overrated.

9626,"I'd say 16/17 at the earliest. Anything earlier is a little questionable, but eyy... No judgement. Lol

And it's definitely okay to wait longer. Your early 20s, late 20s... It doesn't matter. 

Personally, I just wanna lose it around 16-17 to experience what sex feels like, not because of societal pressure... Fuck society. Lose it when you want."
9627,Yeah. Not at 14 for sure.
9628,"Meh, lost mine at 14 and I don't regret it. It's all about the maturity of you and your partner. A lot of people on this thread are saying it and I'll be saying it again, whenever you're ready. I would agree that 14 is young, and younger than that is starting to get weird, but it's all about the maturity of the people. Age doesn't define your education and how well you can deal with it all."
9629,"personally, in college"
9630,At least 16 but preferably 18+
9631,"Yeah well I was gonna add that I don't *want* 14 year olds to have sex, I just wanted to point out that there's no shame to doing it early. Also I will add that if you're having doupts about the age you're at, then you probably are not ready. 

ALSO I'll just say that thinking that others who have lost it before you are lucky is not the best mindset to be in. This is not a race, there's no pressure for you to lose it (and if there is pressure then you're in a situation you should seek to get out of).

Again I agree that 14 is young, but possible and can be quite fun, it's all a question of maturity."
9632,">lost mine at 14  

No fucking way, Sooo lucky. But do u really want 8th graders having sex? 14 is a really small age to do something like that. You really wanna do that shit in college"
9633,"Even though I don’t like it, ig 16.

Personally I’ll be waiting until I’m at least 21, if not later. I want to have sex with somebody I really care about"
9634,Seems realistic.
9635,"i'd say 14 is a bit early, but hey, as long as you fully understood what happened and were conscious it's ok, no judgement"
9636,[removed]
9637,I see the same thing but it just feels odd for me to think of 2 14 year olds having sex.
9638,"Once your body is fully mature, so usually between 15-19"
9639,I personally think 15 is too young. Maybe 16 at the minimum
9640,hell yah
9641,What’s wrong with losing it before 16/17? I wasn’t pressured by society when I lost it at 14 and I still enjoyed it so what’s wrong?
9642,My dad always told me it's 35

9669,"The focal length of your camera distorts your face, what you look in the mirror more closely resembles what you look like.

9718,Same
9719,Yeah that’s a good point actually
9720,"We never talked to eachother, how can they know what I'm like? Exactly, the only way would be basically observing me while we're in the same place or just creating a new me inside their minds"
9721,Yeah it would be confusing
9722,Flattered but I would'nt care much
9723,Hm wdym by that?
9724,Oh yeah I agree with that! It’s not true you they know because they don’t know you

i would definitely be flattered but also kinda confused"
9729,I’d think it was a prank and would be flattered/confused
9730,Wouldn’t*
9731,Yeah that’s true. I would be creeped out and say no because I don’t know what they’re like or how they know me
9732,Ye cos they may have stalked you
9733,uhh i think i'd be a little confused for a moment but then i'll forget about it and go on with my life
9734,EXACTLY! It's scary to stand up to their expectations
9735,Same ^
9736,[deleted]
9737,Extremely flattered but I don't think I would accept them if they confess to me unless we get to know each other first.
9738,"Be surprised.

Then flattered."
9739,"It did actually happen to me once.

I was flattered but the dude wasn't my type."
9740,na bro we just awkward like that
9741,it would be flattering
9742,[deleted]
9743,I'd wake up
9744,Yeah same
9745,Nah he was cute. But he wasn't my type.
9746,I mean some people create drama when they’re bored so maybe they have nothing better to do?
9747,"basically, its like why housewives spread gossip. drama for the sake of entertainment"
9748,"Yeah some of my friends share that and I'm like ""dude wtf"""
9749,"Yeah, you see that word used a lot more now. Really annoying. That’s what the guys always do/use.

The ones I see from women are similar to this example. 

“My man really thought he could leave for work when I’m horny, guess someone else has to do” 

That’s a really lame and tame example, I know. I don’t really wanna put a lot of effort in it.

People are more toxic than Hiroshima it seems."
9750,Boredom creates toxicity I guess
9751,The memes are probably made by ppl who have been cheated on recently or are cheated on a lot and maybe this is how they come to terms with it?
9752,Yeah but it feels kinda wrong tbh
9753,"I don’t know, but it makes me sick to see it. Like, think of all the people that are hurt each day by this. It breaks my heart.

Similarly is all the joking I see about rape. Maybe I’m just unlucky, but I keep seeing memes about it, with the punch line being “uH oH, gUeSs WhAt’S gOiNg To HaPpEn”. It makes me sick. Or how often it’s sexulized too. Like, you’re going to go aheead and get off to the act of hurting someone in one of the most vulnerable ways possible? Taking their dignity, themselves, stripping it away and using them as nothing more than an object for you? Hurting them for your own satisfaction??? It makes me beyond angry and disgusted

Apologies for the rant, I just went off there"
9754,"I don't see those. Are you talking about comedy sketches themed on cheating? Because some people post about how they cheat, but will get some backlash for it unless it's only seen by people who agree with cheating."
9755,No I also see text posts like stuff along the lines of when ur friend covers for u and stuff like that and sometimes I come across videos on tik tok
9756,"Well yeah, cos it is. I haven’t even really been “exclusive” before and even I know that.

idk what’s wrong with these people"
9757,r/rareinsults
9758,"I've seen one rape joke that I found funny, it was that tweet about not making rape jokes and somebody made a rope/rape joke, but I only found that funny because of the context. I agree that rape is disgusting and not something to be joked about or romantised. It must be pretty triggering to survivors to see it. People suck."
9759,"Yes! That’s exactly what I was thinking about, social media makes it seem as if everyone has a side bitch these days"
9760,"Ah. 

Those are the kind of memes you see on things that only have a like system, and comments/replies (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.), and overall bigger platformers that have a larger variety of users. The majority of people still look down on them, but the best they can do is ignore them or leave a negative comment/reply, so you probably only see them getting likes and praised. As for seeing more comments/replies agreeing that disagreeing, that may just have something to do with the social media showing those posts to people who like them instead of to just anybody. The people posting are just people who think it's okay. 

That's my take."
9761,"Well I really don't, but by the masses those videos are considered ""unfunny"" Not because they're offensive but because they lack originality"
9762,"I think you're close. People like attention, and dramas and scandals are the easiest ways to get it. How long did it take Mr beast to go big and how long did it take, say lil' tay. it doesn't take much to create scandals as opposed to doing good deeds"
9763,"I personally havent seen any, but I imagine that they're made by people who have never been cheated on and dont understand how terrible it feels"
9764,People are trying to normalize their mistakes.
9765,"I have no idea why. It’s so fucked, and it shows to young kids that no nothing about relationships to expect this. It’s normalizing mistrust and bad communication and zero respect of privacy. It’s disgusting and influencers need to be more aware of what they’re doing."
9766,I think it's because it makes people feel quirky and special because they're assholes.
9767,"Well I know that's it's wrong and that's why it feels kinda wrong.

What's wrong with me?"
9768,"cheating sucks. if you cheat, you suck."
9769,If you love someone you don't hurt them by cheating. If you just want to have sex then go fuck yourself.
9770,Probably
9771,twitter people
9772,"I think it’s a really horrible thing to do to someone and it really makes me think less of people who glorify it, but hey, that’s just my opinion."
9773,"Maybe they dont want to admit that they're in the wrong so they try to put the whole idea in the right? Also maybe just because its ""edgy"". Seriously though intead of cheating discuss with your partner having an open relationship. If they dont want it, respect their boundies and go buy a toy if they dont wanna fuck you. If you want to cheat because you're unsatisfied with the relationship, break up with them and say exactly why. The situation would vary, but if you dont love them because of sex, they deserve better."
9774,I think they do this to make cheating seem like no big deal of it actually happens. It's like a trend now. If you cheat you're not hated you just jump on the band wagon and everything. It's kind of like how depression and anxiety have become a trend in social media so it's not taken as seriously anymore.
9775,"On my opinion, having a companion is a flattering idea, so why not have many?"
9776,aight skinning u alive rn
9777,"what ive found is that when establishing emotions, hearing tends to be more important than sight. Sight gives information while hearing gives emotions. If you saw a burst of fire and didn't hear it, you would be like ""wow that thing is on fire, better not go there"", but if you heard an explosion you would be like ""FUCK RUN FUCK RUN FUCK RUN"".

Also true in that the visuals in a film (and the dialogues too, I guess but they count as verbal) give us the info, while the music sets the mood."
9778,[deleted]
9779,It’s a bit of a touchy subject.
9780,Touch
9781,Eyesight. Was close between that and hearing; I'd really miss hearing since I couldn't play music anymore but I think I'd rather have sight for everyday life.
9782,oi that’s not a sense of humour tho
9783,well if u wanna talk to dead ppl and lose everything else this is how u do it right?
9784,Hearing because my dream is to make music. Can't follow my dreams if I can't hear it.
9785,Huh interesting.
9786,"Vision, it's the sense humans rely on the most. I'd be able to communicate through writing and gestures, see my loved ones, draw and paint. Too sad I wouldn't be able to hear anything but hey, at least I'd be able to indulge in my favorite hobbies with just my eyes"
9787,It didn’t stop Beethoven
9788,everyone picks this wow
9789,"Yeah. My film production teacher says that a movie can have beautiful editing and cinematography, but with shitty sound effects, dialogue, and music, it will literally kill and ruin the movie. Meanwhile you can have an absolutely shitty film with bad editing and cinematography, but with beautiful music and dialogue and sound effects, you can submit and possibly win at a film festival. The music is the final door that transports you into the world of the film, and if you get that wrong, your sucked out from the experience."
9790,Ba dum tss
9791,yea think so. but on a more serious note i’d keep sight
9792,Insightful.
9793,I'm not Beethoven
9794,sense of skin
9795,"It makes sense if you think about it. Without touch most of the other senses make no sense(pun not intended). Why hear when you walk into stuff all the time? Oh this plate is hot, only I didn't feel that and only saw/heard that when my hand was burning."
9796,skin
9797,Hi not Beethoven I’m dad
9798,Yeah but then you trip over a curb whilst not being able to see and die lol
9799,"Probably smell but I don’t think you can taste food if you don’t have a sense of smell so that sucks.

EDIT: Oops didn’t read the question properly. I’d keep eyesight."
9800,"AhaHAHAH fuck you, take my upvote"
9801,Sight.
9802,I'd probably choose sight. I wouldn't stand not reading

9838,"Yes, like I understand that they aren’t the most important thing but they do matter. I’m not gonna date some ugly perosn just because they have a nice personality, I want a attractive (even if they’re only attractive to me) person With a nice personality not just a attractive or nice perosn"
9839,Perfect explanation
9840,I'm pretty sure that demisexuality requires a pretty strong bond to even consider being attracted to someone
9841,cursed comment
9842,yeah honestly i preach it and i don’t believe it. personality and looks both matter
9843,"Yeah they do matter. It's not cruel to admit it, it's just a biological process in the brain. In today's society, I would be of the view that personality is far more important for relationships to survive, but I wouldn't be with someone if I didn't find them at least somewhat attractive."
9844,"It's like a cake. Each ingredient matters a little bit. If you fuck up one ingredient a bit or substitute it, it'll be okay? But if you really fuck up a few of the ingredients nobody wants that cake. So yeah looks matter, but only so much. If you have bad looks and a bad personality you've fucked up the cake messed too many ingredients up"
9845,....is “ducking” an adjective or a verb in your username? This is very critical info....

9850,"Looks pull u in, and I def wouldnt date someone i find super ugly

But imo personality matters wayyyy more. I have crushed on ugly dudes before cause their personality was amazing"
9851,"Why is that a bad thing? If you look like a mess than you obviously can't take care of yourself, so why would I think you could take care of the job properly?"
9852,"It's not a verb, I hate those ducking ducks so much that I don't want to be anywhere close to them"
9853,there’s an entire sexuality for that i’m pretty sure it’s demisexul but might be wrong

9865,"You are gorgeous but not a study.

I'd study you tho and test that hypothes-ASS 😏"
9866,yeah they were 💀 it was weird ash
9867,"100% because i feel like every disney show I’ve watched always portrays depressed, lonely, and introverted characters who are basically nobodys. I’m tired of that stigmatism around the world of teens. I feel like they should be venturing out and showing different mental states, personalities, all of that. It’s the same thing over and over again

And may I clarify, there’s nothing wrong with being introverted or having depression. But it’s literally a stereotype that all teens are either depressed or have no social skills. Plus the way they even show teens with depression or ones who are introverted are not even accurate"
9868,"I'll never understand the reason why adults think all teenagers are sex-craved and then portray them as such, especially with an adult counterpart. Disgustang!!"
9869,"I don't really care about it, since it's all a business and they're doing it to make money"
9870,"Netflix: Here is a show about teenagers exactly like you! Stating Criss Prat, Angelina Jholey, Dwane the Rock Jhonson, and Nicole Kidmin!!!!"
9871,~~the show sex education on netflix~~ 💀✋
9872,"I hate how shows and movies portray teenagers. They're either absolute selfish assholes, one-dimensional cliches like the bitchy popular girl and dumb jock, or obsessed with popularity or sex. I feel like Zuko, his sister, and her friends from atla are about the only realistic depictions of teenagers in a show."
9873,"ah yes, the two types of teens: HORNY™ and Depression!"
9874,"Yea I do but I mostly stay away form those kind of movies or shows since they aren’t exactly for me, but if you’re looking for something that portrays teenagers a bit more better I would recommend more indie films like 8th grade."
9875,"Honestly though. Like yeah we are horny, but we don't just sit there being horny 24/7."
9876,I haven’t even seen a trailer for it and I know I’ll pop something from now irritated I’d be💀
9877,Definitely! The way they portray boys aswell as girls. It can lead to serious issues for anyone and it shouldn’t be the norm for shows and movies to do.
9878,Fr why does 13 year old Alice have double Ds?
9879,I actually really enjoy that show but yeah...lot of sex and sexualization.
9880,and a jawline n abs like bruhhh
9881,"Yeah it sucks that teenagers are often played by 30 year olds so teenager think they should look like they are 30. I’m movies teenagers are also usually made to either be really dumb and reckless or super smart and overachieving, none like real people"
9882,"yeah, but that's how business works, romanticize it and sell"
9883,"Apparently because I play NFL I b
shove anyone who wears glasses in lockers and can’t count to ten, so yes."
9884,"I really don't like when people that I'm just a stereotypical teenager. Like when I give a short response, an adult might just think that I don't care, *because I'm a teenager*. I do care, I'm just trying to fill in the dead space in the conversation with SOMETHING."
9885,I feel like the movie Eighth Grade is a good example of real teenagers
9886,"[ye i agree it goes for everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/jyr3vn/does_anyone_else_dislike_the_way_shows_and_movies/gd6n5c1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3), i just talked about teen girls cause that’s the one i related to"
9887,"Goes both ways :/

Or maybe I’m just a scrawny fuck who should beef up"
9888,"i agree that it can effect any teen in general! i spoke about teen girls cause that’s what i related to, and for sure all your points are great"
9889,yeah it's kinda weird when teens are played by some grown ups and they fuck everyone
9890,This is the true answer to this question. Capitalism.
9891,"I totally agree, the way they portray teen girls as fully developed at a young age is ridiculous."
9892,">no social skills

And even that is innacurate as well. In real life it's very hard for a socially awkward person to make friends."
9893,"Types of teens in movies: 

Introvert who has approx two friends and has never gone to a party 

Girl who has forty boyfriends and wears a bra and booty shorts to school. If it’s a guy he’s a popular jock and all the girls love him"
9894,frfrr

9924,I fucking hate the Pythagorean theorem!
9925,"Oh, you have like toilet booths? We have small rooms with single toilets."
9926,"No, due to the fact my mom was miraculously an amazing mother to me and my sister"
9927,"oh hell yeah, both my parents are emotionally stunted because of fucked up childhoods, which makes it much harder to communicate with them, but they’ve done a lot for me. so even though i know what they’re doing is wrong sometimes, i can’t help but feel guilty."
9928,i'm jealous
9929,"I’m very grateful as well lol, she’s a young at heart, cool, and very reasonable woman"
9930,You sure about that..
9931,"Yep. Except I don't show the anger, or have to apologise, so it's all internal. No one except me (and anyone reading this) knows about it :)"
9932,No...
9933,"Yep, basically same. I very rarely show anger, I just keep it bottled up and focus on being chilled out."
9934,"I’m in the same boat, my mum is such a kind and loving person and same with my dad, I feel so bad reading all the other replies about how people grow up with parents who didn’t treat them right :("

9943,"Yeah

But they’re just humans witg their own problems too so i can accept that. They’re good parents, just have flaws like everyobe else"
9944,Arre Bhai same. Laude lage pade hai. I despise being stuck home with my mom. The constant never ending stream of insults is just to much
9945,Insult? Bro u have it easy!!! I have it much worse ಥ_ಥ Plus school is being a bitch
9946,"Lmao, I'm Kashmiri. Insults sai to morning start Hoti hai. I'm also a pcm kid and the whole engineering thing is also something which is expected. I hate it all so much"
9947,"Yeah the only exception is my dad. He beat me like a street dog, and is just a real pos. Good to know that he’s in jail now tho"

9968,"Same. But I still try to keep it mostly clean.

I did drop an F bomb when I burnt myself on the baking sheet the other day, but that was like a reflex action."
9969,"Depends. My mum doesn’t care about mild swearing and my parents couldn’t care less about us being exposed to swearing in media but my dad really dislikes us actually swearing in front of him.

Btw your dad sounds a bit sexist."

10047,I’m a little more wild than they were
10048,Hol up
10049,My parents have told me. I think the main difference is that my parents had quite a lot of friends but I instead have the internet 😎
10050,No they've told me
10051,They were living completely different lives from me. My dad tells me about it often.
10052,Idk maybe I'm weird but not really. My parents just told me their childhood
10053,"It’s you again, I swear to god-"
10054,"nope, she was just a dumbass and decided to dig something at a cemetery"
10055,"My mom had a completely nuts mother who verbally, mentally and physically abused her. Oh and she got raped but she had to hide that. And she had to protect her sister from getting beaten to unconsciousness. My mom is quite open to me about her childhood. 

My father tho shares almost nothing. I know he got bullied by his older brother and that he was a bit naughty as a young kid which led to funny things. I imagine he has had his problems during his puberty, if I can take a guess pretty bad. But he’s not open at all to me which I kinda hate but I’m okay with it."
10056,"Oh no I don’t have a problem with it sorry if it came off that way, I just see you all over this sub"
10057,My mom lived at the ocean and was a huge beach girl and my dad was working and loved it
10058,Anything else to the story?.....
10059,Yeah we’ve got a few users like that
10060,Yeah. Sometimes I wonder if I would have liked my parents when they were my age.
10061,😬. I am really sorry about your mom. I am truly sorry.
10062,"Oh wow, same story! Just without the dead body"
10063,would you rather I not be here?  I’m usually on here every day
10064,Lmao did she get in trouble
10065,Same
10066,"Dad was more alpha and slightly better looking than me. Okay he was good looking than me but that was his 20s photo.

Mom was a much better student than I'll ever be. Class topper many times, she's tall. And smart"
10067,Quite a couple tbh
10068,Yeah. She’s had it rough. She’s a great mom (except at some points) tho and I’m so happy for her that she got through it.
10069,nah ion wanna know but i have an idea
10070,yeah because i wonder if i’d be friends without them
10071,My mom said she was doing acid while listening to led zeppelin when she was my age

10100,don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. just because one single person is unhappy doesn’t mean the whole human race should be gone
10101,Its ok though I get you chill
10102,"Without mosquitos, the environment would likely adjust and other insects would take their place as a food source because of less competition. They aren't needed in any environment and never are they any animals only food source. In fact, they harm the environment by spreading diseases to animals that they bite. And although it is true that they are pollinators, they are not the sole pollinator or any plant so other pollinators could take their place."
10103,I hate them with a passion

10130," I guess blue? I mean drugs are illegal and you don't see that stopping  that many people.

10136,Hey 😘👉👉
10137,Wow what a shit teacher. Why would you tell your students blatant misinformation? Teachers like this are why people hate math
10138,“Oh my god I’m so damn gay....”
10139,Lmao no but my brother does. I once told him that he lost his pinky finger when he was a baby and it just grew back and he fully believed me. There are other things I’ve told him but I can’t remember them.
10140,"Yes. I am not good at reading people at all. And unobservant. Classmates will moan about unfair teachers while my dumbass sitting here trying to find out which teacher I like is actually not good because apparently they are assholes. Turns out the majority of my class thought one of my favourite teachers was a judgemental, unfair ass.


On a sadder note: Two years ago one of my friends regularly showed up with several parallel cuts on her arms and always claimed her cat and/or rabbits scratched her. I believed her for months until she told me she was depressed. Like, I thought it was kinda weird but I met her pets and the very idea of self harm was so out of my pink-tainted world that I never considered it. She has a huge support system and multiple close friends she spends her time with, so she was never alone with it and had people to help her, but it still made me sad I couldn't be there for my friend."

10145,"Don’t worry about it. I feel guilty for not seeing the signs of my older sister being

A) Trans

B) Depressed

You shouldn’t blame yourself and you should focus on looking after who you can in the moment.

Apparently I also miss signs that I give off coz one of my friends asked if I was genderfluid. I’m not but apparently I was massively hinting at it and not liking my pronouns. I’m an idiot lol."

10176,[deleted]
10177,"Dude, that's exactly the same for me. Sometimes I have dreams where she tells me how much she loves me and I get so happy and I wake up smiling until I realise none of it was real. It sucks so bad."
10178,This tugged at my heart. My grandad is still alive but I love him so dearly. I want to make the best out of the time we have left together.
10179,"Bro you’re good... you are only 13, try not to stress ab girls you’ll find one"
10180,Thanks man

10184,My grandpa died on 2015 and then my sister died last year but she would have turned a year old on 9-9-2020
10185,Mhm np
10186,Oh yes I have
10187,"Your grandpa was actually talking to you.

Not to force my beliefs down your throat, but I 100% believe that when grand parents and great-grand parents die, they come back to watch/talk/interact with you. Especially ones you had a great affection for. You start even seeing them. Usually it is dreams and sometimes even as 'hallucinations'."
10188,"When I get those dreams, I just go back to sleep and try to continue them. Sometimes it works."
10189,Omg that's so horrible. So sorry for your loss
10190,"Yes, I dreamed that I saw perfectly with no eye surgery. Quite disappointing I gotta say."
10191,"I just woke up five minutes ago from a dream where my ex was pregnant, that was, uncomfortable"
10192,Yoo same XD
10193,Ya I had a dream that my crush texted me and said he liked me and then I woke up realized it was a dream I decided to text him and say that I like him well ig that dream wasn’t so bad after all since he likes me too I  still have dreams and think he’s at my house ends up he’s not (he’s in Montana I’m in Michigan)
10194,"I’ve had good dreams with my grandparents. My grandpa passed away when I was in 6th grade (I’m a senior in high school now) and my grandma passed away this past October. Seeing them is very refreshing for me and makes me smile :) When I wake up and realize it wasn’t real it’s very sad. These were my mom’s parents, and I feel really bad for her because she’s wanted to dream about them but she hasn’t had that experience yet :( I hope and pray she does real soon"
10195,Sorry to hear that
10196,Ask them politely to stop and if it continues just be blunt and call them out
10197,"you prolly shouldn’t take advice from an M on this, but eh whatever. I recommend you to plain walk up to him and tell him straight up that it’s making you uncomfortable and he should quit doing it"
10198,Look at his boobs

10205,"Yeah, guys can be dicks where they're confronted about these sort of things."

10208,[deleted]
10209,Only good response
10210,Did you touch it tho?
10211,Honestly I don't think there really is anything you can do to stop it
10212,Until proven its Schrödingers crouch. It was touched by her and not touched by her at the same time
10213,Are you going to tell us?
10214,rid of the boob
10215,Depends on the boob size the girl has it might still apply

10220,Tell them to stop or like ask them what’re they staring at. Like let them know u don’t like it and it’s not okay so they learn how to not be so comfortable staring at your body.

“What should we doooo? I’m so effing bored!” whines the pyromaniac to the group, but she doesn’t get a response at first. Suddenly, the zoophile claps his hands and licks his lips. “Okay, okay, here’s an idea: Let’s fuck a cat.” he says. 

They all nod except for the sadist, who crosses her arms. “Nah. Let’s fuck a cat, and then torture it.” she suggests.

They all seem satisfied with this idea until the murderer pipes up. “Hey, hey! What if we fuck a cat, torture it, and then *murder* it?!” he says excitedly, barely able to contain his excitement.

“That isn’t bad...” says the necrophile, not-so-subtly rubbing his crotch. “How about we fuck a cat, torture it, murder it, and then fuck it again?” he asks the group, and they all grin.

“I’ll do you one better: Let’s fuck a cat, torture it, murder it, fuck it again, and then BURN IT WITH FIRE!” shouts the pyromaniac, standing up. 

“Hold on, do we even have a cat?” asks the sadist, and the pyromaniac sits down defeatedly. They all sit around for another minute or so, when they hear the masochist say his first word all week:

“Meow?”"

10306,"This is 20 fucking 20. If my Dad ever said anything like that to me, I couldn’t be responsible for the shit that would come out of his mouth.

Maybe talk to your mom about it. But tread lightly"
10307,"I know what you mean, my dad's the same. I was going to say just do whatever the hell you want cuz he shouldn't have control over you( which is true and you shouldn't let others dictate what you do in your own house, if it was at a restaurant I'd understand but at home?)

FUCKKKKLL 💀"
10346,"Idk man, some subs won't let you post without a certain amount of karma, plus it's a pretty cool flex, at least, to the losers who use reddit"
10347,"haha only 5k get fucked


someone gonne come along here with u/gallowboob amounts and be like ""haha only 70k get fucked"""
10348,"Good point haha. I was thinking more special awards tho, like you wouldn’t be able to give platinum with it, but like you could give other special awards. But yeah your point still makes sense haha"
10349,haha only 70k get fucked
10350,"Don’t give them ideas


Karmawhores everywhere"
10351,"Maybe like a sub-karma, if that makes sense? Like “for every X karma earned, you gain 1 currency.” That could be used to buy awards."
10352,How tf do you have 70k
10353,Yeah I’m realizing this now haha
10354,"No, definitely not. We already have too many karmawhores"
10355,"I have 71k and like 99% of it is just from commenting

I haven’t even had this account for a year"
10356,"I guess, but that would increase karma whoring possibly"
10357,"Haha only..

Ah shit, nevermind."
10358,Wtf I only have a thousand from commenting and I’ve had it for nearly two years
10359,Not really because then awards lose their value
10360,No because it'll only make people karma whore more than they already do. It'd be kinda cool to put it to use but the negatives outweigh the positives imo
10361,"Maybe not, there will be more karma whoring than it is now"
10362,No. Just imagine the karma whoring lol.
10363,Wait true
10364,I guess you just don’t comment a lot? Idk

10366,"I mean reddit means a way to get money, idk if ads are enough"
10367,I think it sounds cool!
10368,Yeah
10369,Well whats karma even used for anyways
10370,I think the whole karma system is terrible. I mean can you name one positive outcome of having a user karma count? The karma system just leads to reposts and karma whores. I think the quality of content would be better without having karma. I think posts should just be able to be upvoted and downvoted but they don't give the user karma.
10371,That would be nice since it really doesn’t have any uses at the moment.
10372,"no, ,actually, that's a good idea"
10373,Not exactly like that but they need to find something that karma can be used for
10374,No?
10375,"I think that it wuld be better then spending money cuz this already is ridiculous, but this means more karma farming"
10376,Yea but like the rules are there for a reason
10377,I feel rlly bad 🥺 but lmao the rules are literally right there so there’s really no excuse
10378,"yeah a bit

#thatsroughbuddy"
10379,No because they didn’t read the rules and I have no remorse for them

10392,"i mean yeah but once i got a post removed on aita because you're not supposed to post about breakups, my post included my relationship but there was no breakup, it was about my friendsip. 
it didn't blow up or anything, i genuinely just wanted to know if i was in the wrong. it got taken down for the ""no breakups"" rule, cause i didn't know that on that sub you have to specifically say ""tHiS iS nOt AbOuT mY rElAtIoNsHiP"" for a post not to get removed on there"

10400,"yeah, but they should have read them"
10401,Feelsbadman
10402,nope
10403,Yeah but i guess they shouldve read the rules

10426,Weird last name

10431,I already got two. I’m adding a third to that shit
10432,"Way to do relationships, buddy."
10433,"mine is kinda weird. i'm pretty mixed, i have family from everywhere. my first name is irish (it's riley, pretty common here in america yk) my  last has scottish/irish origins but i'm also irish on my moms side. anyway, my boyfriend is mexican and i'm obsessed with his last name so i'm taking it for sure"
10434,same here
10435,Dickinson
10436,"I agree with both sides. On the one hand, your sources are biased but then again so are theirs. Sadly, your father is right on the crime thing, although it can be said that African Americans have such circumstances forced on them so... Now, i don't know about George Floyd's history or the officers, but unless someone is an immediate threat (George Floyd had no weapons as far as i know), the cops have no right to kill someone. That's up to the legal system, and i doubt Floyd would deserve that. Honestly, nobody in this situation is right. And for the record, you're parents aren't wrong, just extreme and misinterpreted. Don't agree that the cop was right/justified tho, that's not right."
10437,"I feel like I will have to internalize my political views in order to please them. I don’t think I will be as comfortable with sharing things now that this happened, honestly."
10438,"yeah, i think it’s so messed up how ppl can blame the murdering of innocent black people on the fact that their crime rates are higher."
10439,"I'm centre left but have some right wing views. My mum, if i told her, wouldn't really care but my dad would be fuming as he's a massive leftist and thinks all right wingers are Neo-Nazi fascists."
10440,Yeah my mom deeply wants me to be conservative but I don’t agree
10441,"My dad is a centrist and my mom doesn’t know much about politics and just votes republican every year. Personally, I’m a libertarian, so usually me and my dad just talk about how the government isn’t reliable and taxes suck and communism is bad. But there are two sides to every story, and while yes, your parents should watch more than Fox News, you should also read more than Washington post and other left media. I try to watch a balance of Fox News (for the right), CNN (for the left) and BBC (for a foreign view). And then I try to read a balance of stuff too, from Huff post to the Daily Wire. Even if your opinions aren’t changed by the opposite side, it’s always good to read/watch their stuff so you can understand their way of thinking and maybe even find common ground."
10442,"Yeah just keep to yourself, it's what I do."
10443,"I mean, not really. They didn’t talk politics much in front of me when I was young and instead let me develop my own opinions, but I ended up being similar, although I’m definitely further left than them (My dad’s independent and my mom’s a moderate democrat). 

I guess my dad kind of tries to pull me further right, but I try to avoid talking to him about anything (political or not) because any opinion different than his is wrong in his mind. But my mom, even though we generally agree, when we do disagree, she’s not actively trying to change my beliefs, but rather give me a different point of view, and I really appreciate that."
10444,"No not at all but i do agree that you need to read conservative AND liberal media. Its hard to find un-biased sources but i as a woman of colour like to look at things black and brown conservative women have spoken about. I think that’s important for everyone to look at because those are voices silenced the most.

Edit: spelling"
10445,nope not at all my mom let's me have my own opinions
10446,We are all socially progressive but my mom and brother are economically left while my dad and I. are economically right
10447,"Same here mostly, except I do talk with my dad about politics because we have like respectful conversations where we try to understand each other, my mom just tries to “win”"
10448,"I'm pretty sure my mom and dad have different political views, so they're both open to hear mine too (although we don't usually talk about politics)"
10449,"Not really. My dad is conservative and so am i, and my mom isn't really into politics too much. 

My dad knows im conservative too, i just dont like talking about politics to people other than my friends."
10450,"Well from the sound of it, it’s kinda just seems like your being a little dramatic ngl. My parents are liberal and I’m more conservative, but I’m not crying in my room because of it. Having differences in politics is part of politics."
10451,"i agree that reading from both left leaning  and right leaning sources is a good idea, but it sounds like your  parents wouldn’t bring it up if you just had the same views as them.  
 
I’ve personally not experienced this bc my parents want me to engage in politics. and i also share a lot of the same views as them which i bet helps, they have said that they would accept it if i had other opinions tho (except for rascism and homophobia etc.)"
10452,"I havent heard of that Ill check it out thanks :)

So far for conservatives i listen to Candace Owens, Larry Elder and Rob Smith for specifics (all people i recommend you listen to at least once on the Dave Rubin show on YouTube) and Fox News, PragerU on Youtube and the conservative sub reddit for the general news. And for liberals literally anywhere all social media is liberal."
10453,Dont give in to your mother your an independent human being
10454,I never thought of listening for the foreign opinion Im definitely doing this now. Genius
10455,"Yes. I watch Fox News with my parents when it is on and I watch CNN other times. I have always watched Fox News as a child, my earliest memory being around 8 years old and watching Bill O’Reilly. I have always watched FOX News, and have only for like 3 months preferred CNN over it due to where I stand atm with world issues. I have never watched BBC before in my life! I will *so* look into it, thank you for recommending it to me!! :)"
10456,Yes. What they said was true. I am going to start reading both. I have been looking into websites like AllSides for unbiased multi-network media.
10457,"Yeah BBC is the main foreign news I watch, like I said. Even though it does lean more left in most cases, it’s still good to hear what another countries thoughts are on American stuff are (they don’t always talk about American things but they usually have at least a couple segments on it)"
10458,Sure thing. Stay informed and stay open. Not enough people are these days
10459,Their crime rates aren’t even higher. 13/50 is a myth.
10460,Bruh what
10461,"yeah, but in kind of the opposite way. i place a lot more importance on markets than my parents and i'm probably more of a capitalist. on stuff like civil rights we mostly agree though, but I really don't want to say anything because whenever I do they get mad lol"
10462,[deleted]
10463,"My entire family (myself included) is very Republican. However, I don't think Democrats are stupid. My dad does. I tried telling him that they just have different ideas on how to run the country, he responded ""Dumbocrats"". It's like talking to a 5 year old. But all of my family thinks that the George Floyd murder is awful and the cop who did it should be locked up, so at least they're not that insane."
10464,"My step-dad does something similar where if I try to explain my ideas to him or tell him something he’ll just completely talk over me and try to take over our conversation. I have told him multiple times that I am trying to speak and tell him my thoughts and what not, and he just keeps going like I’m inaudible. I have known him for about 8 years and lived with him for a little less than that (6.5-7 years). We do t get to much into politics because I don’t really talk to much about politics with my family, mainly because they don’t see me as a person to have real conversation with I guess, I’m not them so I couldn’t say but that has to be something."
10465,"Same... my mom always pushes her ideas onto me, while my dad's intentions probably are to engage a conversation he has a loud voice when talking bout politics lmao"
10466,"wow u hit the dot, i was just saying all this hoping people knew how to overcome such fears, i just thought it was me being a scared teenage girl. i realize now it probably has something to do with my mental health. thank u!!"
10467,"In all honesty, I don’t know.


I have someone in my life who’ve experienced the same terrible stuff, and it broke my heart to hear that it happened to them. 


The best thing I suppose I can say is, find that one man or boy, that’ll protect you. That’ll do anything to ensure your mental and physical safety. The guy who’ll remind you that we aren’t all disgusting pieces of human shite. 


Honestly this is probs bad advice, but it’s the best I could give."
10468,"thank u for responding <3 i also hate how our society is, i just want to be a kind, happy, carefree person. sucks being made to feel like i can’t be anymore."
10469,Honestly i suggest talking to a professional about your anxiety. I'm really sorry you've had to go through that. It'll take time to heal but you can do it.
10470,"I have seen some of the situations you talked about happen. I just call out the people who do it by saying something like ""Dude, cat calling a minor? You should be so fucking ashamed of yourself"" and I say it loud enough that people in the surrounding area can clearly hear it. (Got one dudes wife so mad that she hit him) You could try doing the same, or just call them out for generally doing anything that isn't respectful"
10471,"any advice is beneficial, ty for taking the time to share! :)"
10472,"I have social anxiety so I’ve always watched ppl because of the fear/anxiety and distrust I have of them. Doing that gives me a gauge of how “good” or “bad” they are. This is something I’ve always done before I interact with people and start to trust them.

I don’t know what being “kind” means to you , but I guess I’m kinda on the opposite side of that I’m nice to people but I never go out of my way to do things for ppl that I don’t deeply trust. I was also taught never to get close with older men so that probably helped like a lot.

Learning how to protect myself also have me a different type of confidence. I’m not so scared of interacting with people but I’m still cautious. I think therapy could also help with your fear of men."
10473,I’ve never thought about doing that and I’m definitely going to start doing it. I don’t think that it happens much where I live but yeah.
10474,"Its always worth shaming people who do these kinds of things. Barely happens where I live too, but oh boi do people regret some things they did after I called them out"
10475,"i do! well i’ve only had like two sessions, i just wanted to hear how other people pushed thru, so i can apply it to myself. tysm for ur encouraging words tho <3"
10476,It is. But other people will know their face for what they did. So they aren't as safe anymore
10477,"Yo, I feel this so you don’t even knowwww. It’s made me kinda afraid of guys which really sucks cuz I like guys lol. It’s made me feel uncomfortable with being called pretty in general but especially when I receive compliments on my appearance from guys. It makes me feel so vulnerable! In the past I’ve been followed, repeatedly beeped at, yelled at, and a few guys have taken it as far as touching my ears and neck. When people compliment me, I say thanks bc I know most people are being nice and giving me a compliment, but I can’t shake the feeling of anxiety around it. I tried to make myself feel more confident and in control of my body by wearing more revealing clothing bc at one point i basically lived in leggings and sweatshirts and wore t shirts when I went swimming bc I was so anxious about my appearance, but I still have my moments around basically any guy. I used to be really afraid of being touched by anyone but I’ve made a lot of progress over the years. The best advice I can give you is trying to reason with yourself, it’s definitely difficult sometimes, but I’ve made progress over the years. Find a friend group that you trust, as you socialize through them more, you’ll unconsciously start to feel more comfortable after seeing their behaviors and seeing that they are safe while being involved with guys"
10478,sexual harassment and assault is traumatizing. its very common to freeze up
10479,The saddest part about that is the only reason they’re ashamed was because they got called out/caught
10480,"I hope your situation gets better. Idk why older men are so horny. Either way, as far as, you concern goes I can't help you and that frustrates me even more... Maybe you can start learning some self defense in order to make yourself more confident?"
10481,I’d definitely consider seeking professional help to help deal with your trauma. How to deal with sexual assault and mental illness is way beyond the scope of this subreddit. What happened to you is terrible but there are resources to help you feel better and try to overcome your anxiety and other issues.
10482,"I don't wanna repeat what people have already saied but I'm also super sorry abut your situation. 

It really hurts me hear those sort of storis cause I hate when women say that all men are rapists or something like that, cause I don't think it's fair. There are men that are kind and loving and wanna live their live and if possible help others, like I would expect everyone to do. But when you hear stories like yours it just gives reasons and it justifies those thoughts. Which I can completely understand, it's messed up, it really is.

I hope I didn't sound too much like an asshole, I really hope you can one day forgive us and see us as equals, cause that's how it really should be. Stay safe, be smart and I hope you can get through it all, I'm with you every step of the way!!"
10483,Like I've never been in that situation my self being a dude and all its not a common thing that happens. But my younger sister had issues getting used to it. So I pointed out you shouldn't get used to it. She now calls them out on it when ever it happens.  And if any of her brothers are around we kinda get overly protective lol
10484,"People around where I live know I am a bit psycho if they piss me off enough so after a while everyone basically just avoids me. To me, for a long time no guys my age had the slightest hint of interest in me while I was being bothered by men way too old, so it hurt my confidence. Before they avoided me, I had a principal and coach sexually harass me, fathers of chicks my age staring and being weird, and random old guys making f-ed up comments to me. The first time I was like 6 or 7 yrs old in an elevator by myself at a hotel and this old man got in with me and kept insisting I was definitely older than 14 and being really rude. I did not understand it at the time, but I got scared and when he tried to grab/hug? me I kicked him and ran. When it is the father of someone I know to be my age that really freaks me out. I know I am not good looking so I always wondered why me. I had a general discomfort, even hate, around every man. Then I realized, it is not about attraction, it is about control. These men are too weak to control their own lives so they want to take control of a kind child. This has allowed me to move on and be able to show I can control my own life better than them and it seems like it has kept it down. For the catcallers, they derive confidence and joy out of the embarrassment, even shame of someone else. They are shallow and unable to produce their own confidence, so in a sense they must steal confidence, if you will. I hope things get better for you!"
10485,"Idk, I'm not a girl, I have never experienced this.

Also, this brings me to tears, Ik that women go through this, yet it always brings me close to tears.

Idk, don't trust older men without someone, like a friend or a family member, being around?  Go out in groups whenever you can? It'll weed out the creeps cuz they'll be more afraid of catcalling you, I guess? I've never been in this situation. Also learning some sort of self-defence would most likely help you, as if they creep you out, you can easily teach them a lesson.

And for your anxiety, I would suggest therapy, but you don't need therapy if the fear is reasonable, Idk, maybe? Cuz it stops you from trusting men in general, not only older male strangers."
10486,":( I would just play it safe and smart. Also, I would find someone to talk to"
10487,"Personally, talking about your experiences with someone can really put some ice on the massive bruise that years of abuse leads to. At least, it helps me as long as the person is a reasonable human being with actual emotions."
10488,"You've got to be strong, that's all.

Don't be afraid in public places. They're public, and everyone can see. If someone tries to sexually harass you, slap them and get away.

If someone catcalls, ignore them. Don't even smile, give a passive look of indifference at most and move on. They're showing their interest in you, and it shouldn't matter if you don't care.

Learn to say no. If anyone makes you uncomfortable, turn them down politely. Be firm if they still bug you.

While not necessary, learn a martial art. I've learnt Karate, and I cannot overstate how much more confident and strong it has made me, both physically and mentally.

Being afraid only makes you more anxious vulnerable."
10489,"haha im new to Reddit, i just like to hear how other people have overcome such things. u’re right abt everything u said tho, i am receiving help it’s just hard to talk to my therapist now since we’ve been forced to phone call :/ hearing other people’s ways of pushing thru helps me apply it to myself tho. ty for ur words <3"
10490,what the fuck you poor girl im so sorry
10491,That is fantastic to hear. Reaching out for help is the hardest part
10492,"welcome to reddit. good luck in therapy, it can be hard sometimes but I really hope it works out well for you and that this thread can help. This may sound cringe but I’m rooting for you."
10493,I'm over here trying to take notes from the other comments... our situations are pretty similar but... I hope we both push through
10494,"I’m not sure what to say, not all men are like this but you know that, I feel like whenever I talk to a woman they feel like I’m trying to flirt with them but I’m not, so I guess I have the opposite of what you have, I’m sorry this has happened to you, hope things get better."
10495,"I'm sorry this happened to you but I honestly don't know what to do,maybe a therapist will help you"
10496,No probably not. I want biological kids some day.
10497,"This! I would totally adopt a child with the love of my life, no questions asked"
10498,"Infertile? Absolutely. I'm the baby here, not trying to get upstaged at any point. Can't ejaculate? Idk man that could be an issue for my cum fetish but if i love the guy it will be ok I'm sure."
10499,"Yeah, but we’d probably need to discuss kids if it got serious. That goes for every serious relationship, but I want to adopt anyway, so it’s not a huge deal to me."
10500,Idk. I guess hormones. I’m really not sure because childbirth sounds awful and pregnancy basically destroys your body.
10501,Exactly or a sperm donor / Foster care placement
10502,Why specifically biologically and not adopted or sumthing?
10503,I didn’t even think girls liked cum lol.
10504,r/childfree gang!
10505,"Yes, your opinion. Different people feel differently about children at different points in their life. I, for one, hate children and everything to do with them but if that somehow changes I’m okay with that."
10506,"If I had the intention to marry, I wouldn't mind it at all. Biological kids aren't a huge priority. In fact, adoption is my first thought when I think of raising kids."
10507,I thing as a general rule that's true but you know trauma can make you like a lot of gross things
10508,[removed]
10509,Oh ok sry English is not my first language and I said imo but idk
10510,"Yep! There’s no need to give up on dreams to become parents because one of you was infertile.

Edit: Spelling."
10511,The way you worded it sounded like you assume everyone else shares your views.
10512,As someone who is infertile I don’t think would be a problem for me
10513,He deadass said “I see your point” and “imo”
10514,everybody is different some people don't care and just want to raise a child and some do it's just how it is
10515,Trauma? I'm sorry this had to happen to you and I hope that you're ok now
10516,A lot of people want to raise their own kids.
10517,You could always get a sperm donor if you wanted bio kids.
10518,You’re forgiven :)
10519,Yeah 100%
10520,[removed]
10521,True
10522,"I actually kinda agree. I just feel a lotta pride when I help a kid suceed and I've always been good with kids. I feel like there's a certain pride of raising your own but I very much could be wrong and I definitely would consider adoption myself. I also kind want to adopt a diverse kid too. Just kinda like the idea of my last name not being exclusive to people colored like a cloud, and statistical odds are that the one I find is also going to be white. Also like the idea bc some minority communities esp in my state are in certain poor population centers with bad foster care,  so it isn't as much abt race as it is giving a child their best shot at living a good life"
10523,Fancy lol
10524,I'd adopt and/or get a donor
10525,why though? im kind of curious on anybody's reasoning on this
10526,no

10557,"I used to. Then I realized that all the people I thought was having fun felt that way too. Then I started doing stuff by myself and having fun in my own way. 

I don't have many friends, but the few people I do consider friends are really good ones. And I might not be having fun the same way everyone else does, but I'm only having fun for my own sake, so it really doesn't matter how."
10558,"I feel you. I delved a lot into online groups/discord servers and hobbies/skills, helps take away that feeling a lil bit."
10559,"Hey Alexa, how many bitches can we fit in the Tesla?"
10560,Yeah but I get my license in a month so that's boutta change
10561,"Something that makes me feel less useless is cooking. I love making a meal from scratch, theres something very fulfilling about seeing your creation go from a bunch of ingredients to an edible, tasty meal. It's especially fun if you can share the food with someone who expresses appreciation for it. It's a very neat and convenient skill to work on during lockdown."
10562,yeah it be like that sometimes
10563,"Reading this comment really made me feel at peace in a way. I’m pretty much in the same situation as you. Used to think this one guy was super lucky to have tons of “ friends” and go to all these parties, went with him a couple times and he’d just sit on a couch on his phone while everyone else was doing something else. So tbh I’m totally fine with my idea of being happy and having fun."
10564,"oh my god, your opinion on some random person saying they're horrible really makes me think you're amazing. I can hardly see you sitting on your high horse 😍"
10565,"Don’t worry, nobody’s life is all happy and bubbly. I used to think like that too, until u realize everyone feels like this too. And don’t let anyone say that you’re wasting your time doing stuff. If that stuff, as insignificant as it may seem to others, if that makes u happy, you don’t need validation from anyone else! If it makes u happy, then that’s all that matters."

10582,"Yea there are people I used to envy because of how much more popluar they were than me. I used to be a lot more shy and had a really hard time connecting with my classmates. There were these two girls who I've known my entire life, so I had an easier time talking to them than classmates I'd only known a few years. Anything I knew about my classmates I heard from these two girls (who were also in my class, btw) because they were popular and friends with everyone in our class (or so I thought). When I started getting out of my bubble and talking more with my classmates myself (and actually went to a couple parties with them, too), I realized they really didn't like these two girls at all, and the two girls didn't actually have any ""real"" friends, either. ~~(but tbh they don't really deserve friends because they've been toxic as shit our entire lives, especially towards me)~~."

10587,"It's just... No feeling. I feel there's something in me, I feel that I move it, but I just don't feel any pleasure. It used to feel super great, but now it's just like touching my arm or something. Not exciting at all."
10588,"I know exactly what you're feeling. It used to take me just 1-4 minutes to feel pleasure, now it takes me over 10 minutes. I feel like it's just my body getting used to masturbation. I don't know how to word it, but it's like I don't feel any pleasure from it. Like I've essentially maxed out my horniness... If that makes sense. I don't think it's anything to worry about, though. I've tried not masturbating for a few weeks, and when I returned, I found I was able to 'get off' quicker. I might try that again, and I'll see how it goes."
10589,Is it a numb-like feeling?
10590,"Maybe your body is getting used to ""being touched like that"", but if you're worried, you can always get it checked out with a qualified medical professional"

10595,He can comment on comments
10596,"Wym being touched like that ? Also I do masturbate with my clitoris, and I usually do both at the same time. I'm not worried, just upset"
10597,"Also, it upsets me too. My parents are usually never home so I have ample time to masturbate, now that it takes so long to climax, I feel like there's no pleasure, and it's more like a chore."
10598,"Take a break from it for a week or two longer than normal. You tend to stop feeling as much if you do it often. 

I think your body just needs some time off to “recharge the pussy”"
10599,"Oh I do feel things ! I just don't have any sexual feeling from it. I can feel being touched and being penetrated, but I just don't have the sexual feeling from it"

10602,I really hope you're joking cause that sounds super unhealthy
10603,Yeah you might wanna see a doctor? I've also heard depression can inhibit pleasure from masturbation. I don't know if you're dealing with that but if you are it's a possibility
10604,"Thz thing is that I do focus on it, but it just feels much less satisfying without pénétration."
10605,[removed]
10606,Maybe hold off for a week or two?
10607,It's been a while since I masturbated because I don't feel anything. I tried again today and nothinf has chznged :/
10608,"Well since I don't feel much, I just do it much less, almost not at all anymore. It's just very frustrating haha"
10609,[deleted]
10610,"my main guess is that your body has become desensitized to masturbating due to you doing it frequently and that can be fixed by not masturbating for 1-2 weeks, the longer you don't masturbate the better it will feel once you go back to doing it. in my experiences this worked"
10611,"actually? i've heard of guys masturbating max 5 times a day, but not 16. that's quite impressive, though."
10612,"Girl only post but sometimes guys can answer the question too. 

Some women can’t obtain a vaginal orgasm ever. Sometimes they can only be stimulated via the clitoris. It could just be puberty deciding that you don’t like vaginal orgasms, or could be something serious. I suggest posting on r/askdocs"
10613,[deleted]
10614,"Maybe I'll do that, and well I know that the pill changes your hormone embalencement, so I felt really down for quite some time and I didn't masturbate at all during this period"
10615,"Usually the toothbrush and the shampoo bottle are really great for just vaginal masturbation and the dildo for anal, but for the few last weeks I don't feel anything with anu of these"
10616,Pretty weird
10617,i had and ig fanpage but it was my friends posting funny pics of me lol
10618,"I do, I don’t even know their names"
10619,I’d imagine it’s a joke but idk hormones are a helluva drug
10620,If they harass you let a teacher or staff know
10621,"That's a yikes from me, chief"
10622,Like as a joke or real thing?
10623,"congratulations, you’re certified hot shit"
10624,yikes
10625,Lmao some of my friends do that for another friend. His name is Remus and he's basically a celebrity at my school
10626,Weird shit happens when you're 14 and might you might do things that will screw up your life and later regret.
10627,"Nice. But be careful around them, don’t let them do anything bad to you or force you to do something. Be careful m8."
10628,"that sounds, stalkerish"
10629,"Definitely weird

Like on a scale of one to 10...98"
10630,"Hey man I'm gonna be honest, that sounds fucking strange and stalker-ish. Do you even know what this club does?I'd try to avoid contact with them and tell your parents about it."
10631,Is he an actor?
10632,A fan club? What? I would just stay away from them honestly that is really weird to have a fan club about some random kid in their classes.
10633,Like the thing you did tomorrow?
10634,You mean like a guy that gets paid in movies? No. But he does like acting in school productions and stuff
10635,"Gang bang time, jk. if they make any advances you don't like a teacher before it gets to far"
10636,I did some stupid shit when I was 14 and I definitely regret it lol.
10637,i did a lot of stupid things at age 13
10638,There's a guy at my school who's named Remus too. He acted in one of my school's shows and I think his popular. I just thought it was a weird coincidence.
10639,Hmm... are you in Australia?
10640,[deleted]
10641,eeeexactly.
10642,You must be hot
10643,I like how 1 is in words and ten is a number.
10644,"Mate, just no"
10645,Allos can be weird
10646,yeah I would think that but I don't have problems with my grades so I never even see the effects of my horrible habits. It's gonna bite me in the ass one day
10647,"I second this. I usually yeet my phone across the room, turn on my desk light, and remind myself that if I get this shit done, I can award myself later with Youtube or Reddit or whatever game I wanna play then after when I have more time"
10648,"I'm often in the same situation. I get distracted by everything and I often don't have a lot of motivation to study/do homeworks and it has been affecting my grades.

I sometimes go to the library. Being in environment like that makes it much more easier to concentrate. 

When I'm at home, I try turning my phone off, and putting it in my room while I work in the dining room.

For procrastination though, I'm pretty bad at it and I don't have a lot of tricks for that."
10649,I have motivation for you. If you will be getting bad grades I will remove you as a mod >:)
10650,When I turn off my phone I always just end up going to get it lol. Also doesn't help that I do work on my iPad which conveniently has reddit installed lmao
10651,"Oh noooooo

*tfw you don't study and still do well 🙃*"
10652,so relatable
10653,“conveniently”
10654,"ah yes, yeeting your phone across the room to do schoolwork is such a liberating experience."
10655,"I’ve heard that maintaining a planner helps. I can’t say it for myself because I’ve just started using one. 

About the Reddit stuff, reducing your internet usage is a gradual process. I have a way for you to get your screen time down. Do you use an iPhone?"
10656,"Me too and I'm really scared! I think that may be causing most of my anxiety, because I was on tiktok for hours instead of studying for my midterms and i got all A's (and one B but that's irrelevant) and I know that I don't deserve these grades at all which is freaking me out bc I have no work ethic for when I get confused, bc I just dont"
10657,Nope I'm on Android
10658,Lol thanks

10660,I am little bitch

10662,Android 10 recently added the feature
10663,säme
10664,"i’m exactly the same. it usually helps me when i distance myself from any distractions, and have some sort of white noise while i work, although i guess that part depends on the person. also the existential dread of knowing i’m going to die by 29 from cold conditions in a raccoon-infested alley behind an apartment complex in everett, WA at 2:39AM sometimes motivates me. if you’re behind and struggling with the work load, note that it’s important to give yourself breaks in between assignments if it’s too mentally exhausting all at once, just don’t get too caught up in whatever you’re doing during them."
10665,"I call it killing the little bitch inside. You have to turn your phone and your brain off and just do without thinking too much about it. Anytime you hear the little bitch crying, you smother it and do what you have to do. Eventually the little bitch won't be so talkative. Really the best thing you can do is just to do until that's your habit"
10666,"I have the same issue tbh

Am procrastinating on work rn actually"
10667,I really don't think I have adhd lol but yeah what u say is true about the hw
10668,"Yeah I think I just lost my motivation, but when I really try I can focus. I also don't like invalidating larger cases by claiming I have a disorder over a little detail y'know."
10669,"It’s important to be determined, whenever I have something to do such as homework i do it as soon as I get home. By doing that I don’t have to worry about it later and I learn important stuff."
10670,"I have the same problem, I'm an innate procrastinator and just **can't** work without pressure. I'd recommend you to look for a friend or someone that helps you do it (or if your friend has the same homework or whatever, you can do it together, which is even better)."
10671,"I have ADHD-PI, this sounds a lot like me. I thought this was a post on r/ADHD actually. Like you’d rather sit there for 3 hours and do nothing over doing 20 minutes worth of homework. I can get really specific if you’d like."
10672,are we the same person?
10673,"Make a schedule, force yourself to follow it or get others to torture you if you don’t follow it. Worked for me lol"
10674,"I am not the best at self-motivation, so what I do is put on a playlist I like and then start with the work that gives me less trouble.
I saw someone comment about keeping a planner. A friend of mine started a planner to help to organize herself and it seems good so far.
Good luck with your school work ☆"
10675,"Reading your post was like reading something I could've posted myself; I'm in the *exact* same boat as you rn. I have *serious* problems with procrastination; last night I was up until 3 am doing *one* big assignment because it absolutely *had* to be done and I'd blown it off the entire afternoon & evening, but I find that I've gotten in the habit of just COMPLETELY blowing off my other stuff. It really sucks and my grades have been on a steady decline because of it. But the unfortunate thing is that, from what I've found: **there's no magic trick that's going to make you focus and magically start doing your work (I know, I'm groaning myself as I'm writing this). You have to discipline yourself and just sit down and do it.**

Which is SUPER hard and it SUPER sucks, but it's the disgusting reality. **Take it from a fellow student.** I keep looking for explanations for why I'm so distracted and alternatives to just simply *doing* it, but there's no escaping the fact that it just has to be done.

As for focus, eliminating distractions is key. But for me personally, even when I have NO phone, NO computer, and NO reason to not be concentrating, I can literally just stare at a wall and disassociate and lose an entire half hour or more of my life. I don't know if I have ADHD, but I don't think so, because I truly believe **my own lack of motivation has EVERYTHING to do with my poor mindset about my assignments.** I'll complain about how hard and tedious my work is, and laze around knowing that I'm digging my own grave but being too numb to actually get up and fix that. I do anything and *everything* to avoid completing my assignments. Heck, I'm doing it *right* now, but that's besides the point...

Basically, if your phone's your distraction, the only thing that's going to work is putting it away or using an app that blocks you from going on the Internet and stuff. No magical solution to that. If it's **lack of focus** that's the problem, my best recommendation (that's pretty much the only thing that's worked for me personally) is to **set little timers.** If even sitting down for 10 minutes and actually working sounds overwhelming, set a timer for 5 minutes and **work.** You're probably going to space out a little if you're anything like me, but we just have to force ourselves to snap out of it and get 'er done. Once that timer's up, set a little break timer before setting the timer again for just a few more minutes of work -- or, better yet, go straight up to 10 minutes and keep increasing your target study time by intervals of 5. **You have to set goals for yourself, force yourself to stay focused, use incentives if that works for you, but most of all: JUST. DO IT!!!!** Think Nike and Shia LaBeouf. Just try your absolute best to put it in your mind that **it has to get done**, or try a fake-it-til-you-make-it thing where you attempt to be optimistic (or just a little less pessimistic!) and convince yourself that the tasks won't be as daunting or difficult as you think. Because often times, that's true! Granted schoolwork does REEEEALLY suck, I *know,* but just try not to dwell on the unfairness of it all and accomplish what you need & want to... for your own sake! For your own success! For the benefit of your future self (she'll be thanking you SOOO much later if you get crap done now, I promise).

This is more a note to myself than anything else, but I hope this SUUUUPER long comment (if you even bothered to read it) helps you at least a little!!!

I might have to make a post of my own about this. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to reflect on my own habits to try to improve myself. And thank you if you read it, Reddit :)"
10676,I'm sure spike collars come in pink
10677,I definitely do need to go through and get rid of old clothes cause half of them don't fit anymore
10678,"All the time!
I see one photo of a different fashion style that I like and immediately I want to change my style and wardrobe as if I have the money or confidence"

10681,Living the dream
10682,You can always wear multiple of styles.
10683,Same with me if I buy one cute outfit all of a sudden I want a whole new wardrobe of clothes that’ll probably just stay with the tag on in my closet lol
10684,"definitely. holy. i have so many old clothes that i am planning to donate because none of them fit, and i’m a bit annoyed that currently my wardrobe is 90% things that have no distinct style or good fits, so i just wear hoodies all the time. hopefully i can get newer clothes with a more refined style(i feel like i want a solid self image to associate myself with in terms of clothing) when i go to boarding school, but i doubt i’ll be able to  :("
10685,Same.
10686,"Yeah I spent 500$ on a new wardrobe. But I sold lots of my old one on an Instagram page for my clothes. So I made some money 
edit: I was drunk when I wrote this, kinda impressed by how good it is lol"
10687,And there's also me who wears whatever I randomly grab from my closet.
10688,"I have pretty cool stuff in my wardrobe, like printed skirts, black socks, trift sweaters, jeans, black yoga pants, beautiful tees, military jackets and jeans shirts without sleewes. And no, I wouldn't change it at all, but I've bought a pair of black Oxford shoes with platforms and a black dress with white collar."
10689,F
10690,I have a built in wardrobe so I can’t really get a new one

10693,Go to a charity shop
10694,ughh yes i’m trying to sell my old clothes so i have room for new ones (look at my depop diyviolets lmao) and also some money bc i can’t get a job

This girl that is like 4'11"" and lies about literally everything. (The height matters bc as a short person ik we're bitches to make up for our height) She always wants attention and cries about everything so people will feel bad for her. She's annoying and makes up stories about ppl bullying her and telling her to kill herself when in reality no one cares enough to say that to her. She moved schools to mine last year and her background story was proven to be completely fake, there's no way to be able to trust anything she says bc she lies so much. Also my friend dated her ex ""boyfriend"" and started crying when she found out they were dating, she and this guy dated for like a week tops, like jeez! she made up stories of my friend trash talking her when all she rlly did was try to figure out why this girl was going around calling her a bitch."

I mean yes I understand that you can’t have the same kinda stuff in movies all the time cause like movies r a lot different than books but like these small things still annoy me so much ahahha
10878,"Tbf, there is a difference with tv and movies. Usually, anyone being filmed needs some kind of makeup to reduce the glare of the lights used while filming, because they are seriously bright and can make your face into a lighthouse lamp."

10884,I fucking feel you though my boyfriend does tell me he prefers me without makeup. It's mostly because anytime I go to kiss him or hug him with makeup on it just gets on his beard so. I've been makeup free with him for 5yrs and I like to think hes grown to accept my natural looking face.

So the world as a whole, has to accept everyone, regardless of religion, and not fight."

10928,Most of the times tbh
10929,"Yeah, but then i remember how photogenic I am doesn't correlate with how attractive I am, so I simply delete the picture."
10930,That is entirely accurate. I'm like damn good lookin one minute and then gagging the next. You know what it is? It's a government plot to kill everyone's self confidence by screwing with the cameras. Or does it go deeper than that... ?
10931,oh yeah. im not photogenic at all
10932,"Actually, there's a reason for this! When taking a photo of yourself it's flipped in a way we're not used to seeing, but when looking in the mirror it's a version we're used to seeing! We usually can't really put our finger on it though because it's so subtle. It also lets you see flaws more because it's not something you're used to do its also good to flip images when doing art!"
10933,Yes
10934,Yeah
10935,Always
10936,"Suspiciously specific and true, I'm so unphotogenic can't even smile properly"
10937,yup I'm so not photogenic ✌
10938,"Everyone thinks they look ugly in pictures because they’re not used to seeing themselves. Also cameras don’t have the same effect as eyes so they distort or highlight different things. That’s why people you find relatively “flawless” probably took a butt ton of pictures and filters until they decided on one.

Side note: I’m pretty sure no one “pretty” posts a picture without a filter or altercation of some kind. Just an opinion."
10939,"Yeah.. but if you think about it that happens for everyone. Look at pictures of the most attractive people u know. Not even all *their* pictures are super flattering. There’s like one person I know who this isn’t the case for but most people don’t look as good in pictures as they do irl (unless those photos are very carefully controlled, like for Instagram)"
10940,Also: A camera usually doesn't flip the picture
10941,Mooood
10942,Just is
10943,I’m literal hell spawn anyway so I don’t feel hurt when I look like one
10944,yes
10945,I read about this some time ago. Basically you’re used to seeing a mirror image of yourself in a mirror but when you take a picture you see what other people see and you think you look bad because you’re used to an inverted image of yourself.

I didn't freak out at all (I have no idea why or how) ; I knew it was time. My mom then took to her room and told me what periods were and all that ""talk."""

11013,Sis you're such a mood
11014,Same

11018,Have you gone to the doctors about that? They can give you birth control which can help.
11019,I didnt really feel anything. My mom showed me how to put a pad on (which i already vaguely knew about) and put it on and that was that. I knew about periods since i was probably a toddler nothing was a surprise except maybe period poops.

11021,"I remember lots and lots of blood, then having to come home due to cramps."
11022,Pain
11023,My friend is 15 and on bc. I think the side effects would be more bearable than day long cramps.
11024,"I thought I had shit my pants, cause the blood was all dried up, but a few hours later, there were red streaks and I was like ""well fuck"""
11025,The first one was just a spot. The second one though... it’s even worse because I didn’t know my period came at night either so I wasn’t wearing a pad lol
11026,"It was three in the morning, we had just gotten a new puppy the day before, and I woke up to sirens, helicopter noises, and lots of yelling outside. Kinda freaked out, but went to the bathroom instead of rushing outside because my pants felt weird. Saw blood, went “okay, I’m 12, this is probably just a period.” Stuffed toilet paper in there and ran outside. Neighbors house is engulfed in huge flames and my family is just watching in one of our fields. All sorts of emergency vehicles were there, news people, firefighters, police officers, the whole shabang. After about an hour of watching, my mom and I ended up back in our living room, and I had almost completely forgotten that I had gotten my period. So I slyly mention it to my mom and she freaks out, of course. Lots of “congratulations!” And such. My firsr period year wasn’t  bad at all, very irregular and no pain. Second year was... just a nightmare. Migraines every two days for a year and ALL I had to spend stuck in my bed with the curtains closed wishing for death."
11027,"I didn't feel any pain at first , but I bled a lot and my stomach started to hurt very bad, and my favourite panties had to be thrown away. I was like ""if that's how my life will be for 50 years, then I don't want it"". I am still alive though, and currently on my period."
11028,"I was like geez alright I guess I’m not messed up

I got it extremely late"
11029,Periods aren’t meant to hurt that much
11030,It sounds pretty needed to me.
11031,I thought I had shat myself. My periods started off as a brown dry color and they only came for a day at night. 10 year old me had just accepted I was just a sleep pooper. It wasn't until when my mom was doing laundry that she said this wasn't poop.
11032,"I was at a pool, teaching adults how to swim, when I then noticed red stuff was falling down my legs and I was completely confused until I noticed it was coming from my vagina... what sucks is that I had to ask my dad to pick me up and grab stuff at the store for me. Good times, good times"
11033,Idk. I don’t need it because the pain does pass after the week so I don’t think my mum would give me medicine unless it was needed.
11034,I wasn't even with my parents when I got my first period. It was during summer break and I was staying with my grandparents. I was in the bathroom and saw some blood in the toilet and a little bit in my underwear and I freaked out. My mom had to explain what it is and calm me down over the phone and it was just a shitstorm...

Also having money can make me automatically famous so I'll go into entertainment and try to either fund some kinda show or be a singer or somethin

edit: also some 10th grader joined our call and started playing somewhat offensive videos"

11068,"oof for the guy. 

or the girl."
11069,"🤣🤣🤣lol that reminds me of my friend who was eating and the teacher scolded her about it. She then turn to someone off camera and said ""you could believe this stupid bitch is telling me not to eat bread  in my own goddamn house"". We couldn't continue class after that we were all laughing too hard🤣🤣"
11070,"This one guy as a joke streamed cuckold porn to ever single class he was in that day, and each one belived him that it was an accident."
11071,Both lol
11072,Not a scandal but someone turned their mic on and yawned really loudly and then just turned it off again whilst one of my professors was speaking.
11073,"This was more of a prank rather than a scandal. I have this one teacher who tries real hard to enforce school rules like “no hoods” or “you can only drink water” while they’re in their own house. So I filled a soft drink can with water and started drinking out of it very conspicuously. She ended up calling me out on it and threatened to kick me out of the class, after which I said it was water and poured the clear liquid in a glass I had to show her. She shut right up for a good 5-10 minutes. The next thing she said after that was “if it’s just water you’re ok, you can drink water” trying to retain an ounce of control."
11074,"My teacher has an anime girl too lmaoo, it was a semi nude girl with big tiddies"
11075,My classmate was joking with his friend through discord but his mic accidently unmuted and the teacher thought he was being disrespectful to him
11076,"Teacher forgot to post the hw

Posted the hw 10 minutes before class

Everyone roasted the shit out of her after she got mad no one did it, threatened to get parents involved"

11078,wow what the fuck?
11079,"similar to that, some guy joined and just played weird some rap song"
11080,"We were in breakout rooms and the teacher joined just as we mentioned the phrase “clear plastic underwear” 


It only made slightly more sense in context"
11081,"to add more context: this student doesn’t have the teacher anymore, he was on facetime with someone whos actually in that class and she had her mic on when he was talking about that."
11082,A girl left her mic on and was having sex while in class.
11083,">hella mommy milkers

Poetic :')"
11084,Wow she sounds like a bitch.
11085,14year old? Wow
11086,thats really funny lmfao
11087,why are y’all sending nudes at such a young age you realize that is illegal right? it’s classified as child pornography. i really hope that guy from your class was at least 18

11091,"Yepp, and I love messing with bad teachers."
11092,"disappointingly, nothing interesting"
11093,"Someone was swearing at his brother when he, unbeknownst to him, was unmuted, luckily for him, he was swearing in Telugu, so the teacher didn't understand what he was saying lol but most of the class had to immediately unmute to hide their laughter lol"

11101,If I had a lily for every thought of you I would spend forever wandering our garden 🥺 it’s definitely my favorite bc its so sweet and i would literally cry if someone said that to me

11106,Ik lol. He was really cute but I had a bf at that time

11126,I shower for 30 minutes and jerk off for like another 10
11127,For mental health: 1 and a half hours
11128,I shower for 10 mins cause my family yells at me for longer than that. A girl needs to shave!
11129,I like the honesty
11130,oh😳 they might be showering and getting clean but also...
11131,"Regular: 5 minutes

If I’m washing my hair: 20 minutes

Curly hair gang can relate"
11132,Do you actually have hot water that lasts that long?
11133,it takes me 30 minutes to walk back and forward and contemplate my existence and then another 5 to wash my hair and stuff :/
11134,what country do you live in? because here in the city i have as much hot water as i want to and i cam easily shower 1.5 h +
11135,"It’s separately, don’t worry"
11136,Yeah. I do it outside the shower which us why it only lasts 10 mins but it's better in it.
11137,Your brother has reasons leave him alone.
11138,And thick hair gang
11139,US. I guess our hot water tank only makes so much at a time idk
11140,Oh ok thanks for the clarification
11141,5 minutes max.
11142,Is it impossible to do it outside of the shower?
11143,Thick and long hair may look nice but it's hell to deal with.
11144,15-30 mins idk
11145,I don't think that's his concern
11146,"I shower for about 25-35 minutes. It takes longer for some girls because we have to wash and condition our hair really good because it’s thick and a lot of girls have it long, plus shaving takes a while."
11147,"Usually 15min, but for when I just need to think or... well you know, maybe 40 min tops"
11148,I wonder if it gets obvious once your in there for like 30-40 mins
11149,they could be doing a lot of things if you know what I mean
11150,~~They are probably masturbating~~
11151,Almost the same here but 20 20
11152,"I can shower for an hour and a half but I never did it in the shower. It's a great space for thinking, not for horniness."
11153,No problem
11154,And I'm surprised by how short y'all can make it. I can't have my hair washed thoroughly before the twenty minute mark.
11155,same.

11173,"8/10

Orgasms are great. Periods suck and breasts can be inconvenient, but you can use them as excuses to get out of stuff. Also we're scientifically the more beautiful sex of our race which is a nice thought. The looming threat of sexual harassment and assault isn't fun, of course, but society is changing.  Although I am scientifically weaker than my male counterparts our society is, mostly, cultured enough to understand that physical strength does not determine our value. And if people think otherwise don't be afraid to choke them. I see a bright future ahead for the next generation of smart, beautiful women. But if anyone tries to get in the way of that bright future I guess I have some bodies to bury."

11187,u ok?
11188,Yeah
11189,Best advise I would have probably given too. Thank you for being a competent person and not making any stupid inappropriate joke.
11190,"go to a doctor and get a new pill or something,,?"
11191,stop taking it
11192,"A hug sounds like a good idea. Let's give op one big, collective hug!"
11193,I’d tell my doctor. Stop taking it. And maybe put more research into the medicine I’m taking to help it. Sorry that this happened to you tho. I hope u get better
11194,This could be the only solution ...
11195,Hey are you ok? :/
11196,"yes it is, if its makiing it worse then stop taking it. Its not gonna help you get better but it damn sure won't make it worse."
11197,Cry.
11198,Group hug!!
11199,"i'm sure that what he thinks is that you can't just stop taking medicine, which you can definitely do. what OP needs to do is talk to the doctor ASAP. if she found out it's making it worse, i hope it's because the doctor told her and they have a solution for her"
11200,"doctors do that to people a lot with painkillers for some reason; idk if it's intentional or they just forget or what but you're not supposed to take painkillers regularly for an extended period of time like that; you start developing a tolerance for it, it fucks with your liver, and other fun stuff. do you know if they cycled the dosage? if you don't know, ask your doctor if that's the case and/or ask your parents. if they haven't been cycling it, I *think* you can actually file for malpractice or something, ask r/legaladvice or something if you're able to sue (assuming your family wants to or even has the funds to afford a lawyer)"
11201,"Taking pills was just like an example....I'm sorry if I made it confusing

The main thing should be what a doctor says cause they obviously know more than me and the OP too"

So I was taking the medicine my doctor prescribed, only to find out three years later it was the causeing worse pain, which meant in turn that I had to go backwards in my physical therapy. It should get better as long as they are checking in regularly to make sure the its not getting any worse. Try to keep your mind off of it, the more you think about it, the worse it feels. Hope it gets better!"

She was prescribed pain killers and some other things so far she says it doesn't hurt at all (she expected it to be hell) so overall it wasn't as bad as she thought it would be but I'm going to assume it feels different for everyone"

11267,I mean what are you supposed to do then
11268,"Even being a guy I have had girls be nice and sweet just so they could ""date"" me or just hook up. And when I can tell thats all they want I will just ghost them, Its quite scummy to manipulate feelings purely for a quick thing."
11269,"yes. girls have done this to me, and i shut that shit down quick. the ones who do this in my experience tend to be crazy, so i try to stick away from that."
11270,Honestly I don't think that's the problem but considering that we live in a society where men can no longer just approach a woman casually without fearing reprocutions so when they manage it they feel like they should get with them if it was this hard in the first place.

What does that have to do with anything? Is this supposed to be evidence that the term ""gamergirl"" isn't annoying?

>it's almost never an insult if used in the context you're giving, but somehow you ""know"" it's an insult

I've heard it myself in games where ""gamergirl"" is an insult towards a girl's ability to play the game. Yeah sometimes people use the word literally to refer to a gamer that is a girl, but not always

OP also brought up the points that in any event, the term doesn't need to repeated over and over, and that there is no reason to point out gender in the first place, but you chose to just ignore both of those points and double down on what your first comment said"

11328,"It annoys me, as I’ve played video games all my life, but I am definitely not an e-girl."
11329,"I wonder if this is a gen z term. I've definitely heard ""gamergirl"" and even used it, but it was never an insult. I think it was more that I was surprised to find out a girl I knew was a hardcore gamer.  I think it's probably because guys are so over-represented in these markets. ""e-girl"" does sound like more of a weird term though and I don't think I've ever actually used it."
11330,"I’ve never been called an e-girl but I associate the term with a substyle of fashion on mostly tiktok or just in general. 

If I was called an e-girl I don’t think I’d be mad, only if it came down to guys gatekeeping games specifically because of my gender I’d be mad lol"
11331,I sometimes cringe lol
11332,"Bruh there is a difference between a girl trying to get guys to pay her or get all their attention and calling all girl gamers a e-girl.

This comment had nothing to do with my post. My post was asking if anyone was annoyed by people calling *all* girl gamers a e-girl"
11333,"its pretty dumb


but i dont experience it cause i don't use vc or play many online games"
11334,"Nah. My twitch chat doesnt call me an egirl, but my guy friend's twitch chat does, but it's all jokes. Kinda like ""WOAH YOU GOT AN E-GIRL IN THE STREAM POGGERS"" and it's like?? Why would it bother me if it's just memeing around?"

11338,"I was going to meet my favorite youtuber at an event in Chicago. The event was a rain or shine event. I even got the meet and greet ticket and all, I just had to wait a few hours so I could finally meet one of my role-models. Guess what, a tornado decided that it was going to threaten Chicago. The event was on hold for two hours, it was a break. As it ended, the tornado didn't end up coming by. All of the youtubers had left, and I didn't have a chance to meet them. This was a 4 day event, nothing like this happened on the days prior to or after this Saturday. It just had to be my day...

I did get four signed posters for free though...so"

11344,Who was it?
11345,"Yeah it happened a lot recently  I was supposed to go ice skating with the school in march but since it was warmer than usual they had to cancel.

And that wasn't even because of coronavirus, I had a lot other things cancelled too."
11346,"Felt that lol, class of 2020 got fucked"
11347,"Can relate ._.
Sucks sooo hard. All the cool things of graduation got canceled here as well :/
No real goodbye from my classmates etc..."
11348,"This entire FRC season. At least my team got to go to one competition but we felt so good about our second event only for the entire season to be canceled because corona. Pits were so small at the first event too, I was so excited for larger pits and reorganization just to have more room in between competitions, but I guess we can't have nice things in this economy."
11349,Oh yeah I used to watch him so often when Pokémon go was big and even after I stopped playing he was just really fun to watch. Hate that you missed out on meeting him.
11350,"Damn there was this two-day music festival that I was looking forward to for a year. I had my tickets and everything. Lots of artists I wanted to see, whole friend group going the first day, plus this year would be the first year I could legally drink at the festival. 

Fucking on top of all this the second day it would have been just me and my crush. 

Then corona happened and one by one the artists dropped out, until finally the event was postponed. Still haven’t been notified of when it will happen, if ever."
11351,Man fucking everything I look forward to ends up being canceled or the people just ghost me or pull out last second
11352,rip graduation :(
11353,Yeah I’m upset about my snowboarding trip being canceled. Two days before leaving we got notified about the place we were going being closed down.

11366,"I mean seeing a guy in a well tailored suit is hot, but seeing a random guy shirtless isn't that hot. Unless I already thought he was attractive, like if I saw Tom Hiddleston shirtless I wouldn't be mad."
11367,I'm straight but I wouldn't be mad either
11368,"i’m bi-curious, but yeah i think so. personally women’s bodies are still more attractive to me, but i still find the broad shoulders and muscles easy on the eyes."

11374,"Im a bisexual but yeah find male bodys relatively attractive ,"
11375,"Chest/shoulders is the best part bro they just uncultured. But yes, I do think the male body attractive. Like I said the best part is going to have to be the chest or shoulders, but the thighs and stomach are also very nice. I prefer chubby guys so that might be why I like those areas so much(it’s where most fat distributes). I also get very surprised when straight girls say that they don’t find guys bodies attractive. I’m bi if you were wondering"
11376,"Thats why there aren't nearly as many gay guys as gay girls, your bodies are just better, We know what our bodies look like, who would want that? Also rarely ever do i find a girl thats a bigger bitch than any of my friends, wow, we fuckin suck, ( but yah shoulders and jaw lines are the only thing we have to offer, in the words of bo Burnham "" you think your dick is a gift, i promise its not"")"
11377,But girls watch porn too. That also has random naked men that turn them on.
11378,"Yes, you are going to facepalm if you read it again ;)"
11379,"Well yeah lol 

I mean I don’t get why ppl like guys butts, that’s just weird (unless ur a gay guy), but other than that yeah the male body is attractive"
11380,No he said he straight smfhead
11381,Their hands and arms yeS like- i am a mosquito idc those veins when they protrude are so fucking hotttttt
11382,"Omg yes!!! I’m honestly surprised by the lack of people saying that they do!! I think the male body is very attractive!! Why do so many male celebrities just get damn near idolized for their bodies? But yeah, a guy’s chest when there’s a bit of muscle is *super* attractive. 

The male body is just as attractive as the female body and that’s that on that."
11383,"Yeah... And now, he's r/suddenlygay"
11384,"Yes. Booty, legs, abs, chest, arms, all beautiful"
11385,"Thanks, that was the.. fifth one."
11386,"I disagree, I like the male body better. It looks sculpted to me if that makes sense."
11387,I’m not really interested in the male body unless I’m dating it. Then I get attracted to it.

11393,#\#JusticeForGhosts
11394,"Was ganna say, not being rude but yeah..

The point of porn is to turn a person on, and help them reach satisfaction. It's not only guys who are aroused by unloving sex, most humans are, because it appeals to one of the two rules of survival.

Men arnt some primal beast, we're same as you, everybody gets aroused if they watch the right type (excluding asexuals for obvious reasons)."
11395,"Lol I know, guy's bodies is something I find incredibly attractive I have hard time understanding anymore who doesn't think that. I also just kind of hate these kind of questions because I wouldn't want to be a boy looking at some of the replies"
11396,Thanks. It’s hard to let go of an idea that’s been engraved into your brain from a young age
11397,I feel like that’s the right mindset to have
11398,Yea for sure but i try not to think of it cause it just makes me feel worse
11399,"I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, THE👏FACT👏THAT👏THERE👏ARE👏WORSE👏PROBLEMS👏THAN👏YOURS👏DOESNT👏MEAN👏YOURS👏DONT👏MATTER👏👏

That’s just something society and parents tell us to keep us quiet! Don’t believe them! you’re a human being, and you’re worth something, so if you’re in any sort of pain, you have the right to say it. If you keep it to yourself it’ll just get worse"
11400,Yeah. That's why I don't tell anyone my problems
11401,"I understand, and of course you will feel bad and yes sometimes understanding that problems aren’t as bad as they could be is a good way of dealing with things, but its also important to recognise your struggles no matter how small are real and valid!"
11402,"couldn't have said it better, queen"
11403,yeah
11404,Exactly.  Pain is relative. Problems in One place won’t be the same as in another. Doesn’t mean one is less important than the other.
11405,Yeah! And it doesn’t even really help anyone like??? The kid with the cancer that everyone are talking about won’t be happier hearing some random person said “well at least I’m not like them” like????
11406,Yupp all the timeee
11407,Yeah I don’t really feel like my problems are bad and I should just deal with it because I could have been dealt a worse hand.
11408,"Yes, and then I feel like I’m overreacting and making it into big deal when it really isnt"
11409,"All the time. Whenever i cry and my mom sees, she doesn’t ask me whats wrong or ask how she can help, she tells me to suck it up and that my problems aren’t that hard and that they’re first world problems. Though she may not be wrong in some aspects, problems are relative, and you have the right to feel how you feel. Society tells us to always be happy, but it’s okay to be sad too :) it’ll be okay."
11410,Same

11418,Yeah especially when I think about suicide over something like my acne when there's people that live off 25¢ a day that have more of a will to live then me
11419,"My friend kept trying to drill into my head that I was 'too privileged"" for being sad about things in my life when people in the same city as us were homeless and starving and whatever. It's one of the only pieces of advice she gave that I adamantly disagree with."
11420,If anything I feel bad for my lack of problems. My moms so fucked up from mental disabilities and shit it makes my problems look like minor inconveniences
11421,no I think that can be classified as gaslighting yourself. start validating your own feelings because there's always someone who has it worse.
11422,"I actually think this way to make myself feel better. Idk if it's a sadistic way of thinking, but it makes me grateful for everything I have, and that I could be in a lot worst place rn."
11423,No
11424,"Yep, right now"
11425,College essays got to me like that. Lol you want to write about your experiences with social anxiety? It’s not good enough because some girl got a brain tumor removed and another had alopecia  and someone wrote a whole essay about Costco and got their essay forwarded to you from your mom and theirs are going to be wayyy better.
11426,I thought girls didn't like boobs
11427,"No, I don’t. But boobs in general are fun to play with, even if it’s not sexual."
11428,"Hell no, being a girl sucks just as much as being a guy"
11429,"nah, i like my long hair and pretty hands"
11430,Not in the middle of things but I would rather be born a male
11431,Since you are bi: you don't get turned on by your own boobs right?
11432,"Not my own boobs lmao. If they were someone else’s, maybe. It kinda depends. If it’s just jiggling them, then it’s definitely more fun/satisfying than sexual for me."
11433,No cuz I’ve heard that periods are hell
11434,"for a day? sure, would be an interesting experience"
11435,overrated
11436,"Each gender has its own issues that it deals with. You literally cannot logically compare the two. Right now though, women are getting support while men aren’t. That’s the underline."
11437,It wouldn’t make much of a difference to me. I’m perfectly happy with my gender but wouldn’t mind being a girl either. I’d probably just still be a male because I do *not* want to have a period.
11438,this is the only correct answer
11439,Hell no. Unless its normal for a guy to put booty shorts on and just stare at himself in the mirror.
11440,So playing with boobs isn't sexual for you? I thought it is a turn on smth smth

No really I'm asking if it's worth it."
11451,No

While either sitting down or standing with one leg raised, insert the big round end, then push the thin tube until the tampon is completely in, you'll be able to feel when it is. Then pull out the applicator and waalaa, you've put in a tampon"

I’m pretty sure a pad wouldn’t stick in the water so I don’t think that works."

11585,"You have to put it in kind of sideways because of the way your organs go. I would look it up so it's easier. Or have a sister/friend/mom help you. Literally ask any girl in the bathroom and they will tell you how, even a stranger. All girls are nice when it comes to periods."
11586,"Gonna be real with you, you have to learn how to put in a tampon. It’s the easiest and most sanitary option; don’t force other people to swim in your menstrual blood. 

It’s a lot easier to put in than you’d think, and pretty comfortable. There’s tons of resources online if you’re unsure. Start with a pearl sized one."
11587,I’m glad you aren’t. Imagine swimming and feeling something against your leg and you look down and you see a bloody and soaked pad 😂😂
11588,There's also swimsuits made for periods you can get from thinx
11589,I’m not suggesting I wear a pad into the water that’s dumb 😂 but I never learned how to wear a tampon
11590,It has to go up far enough as to where it’s comfortable and any size unless it’s super should fit
11591,"do not go in the water, that’s gross. even if you’re not bleeding in the water, if there’s any blood on the your bathing suit bottom it’ll leach into a water. your only options are wear a tampon or don’t swim."
11592,"Maybe you’re not pushing it in far enough? I used to do that and it would feel uncomfortable, but it stopped when I pushed it in to the very base with the flared part."
11593,Youtube
11594,Then just go skinny dipping. Problem solved
11595,do not go swimming and get blood in the water. i have seen blood running down people’s legs as they get out of the pool. you can give someone a disease. this is how HIV gets transmitted come on people
11596,you will bleed in the water if you aren't nude
11597,"yeah. in the water it can’t. but people get out of the water. they get blood on the pool deck, on bleachers, in the locker rooms, and on railings. also even if there isn’t a potential for contracting a disease, it is still DISGUSTING and unhygienic. if you go in a pool without a tampon while on your period you should be ashamed. that is nasty and pool water is already full of pee and poop and sometimes blood and vomit. don’t make it worse. it’s harzardous and gross. also most pools don’t have high enough chlorine levels to totally be safe"
11598,Ask a trusted female— if you have one on the trip with you— for advice. Please don’t risk bleeding in the water as that’s highly unsanitary.
11599,mmm for me my flow slows down majorly when i’m in water so in situations like that i just use a pad with no wings or a thick liner but everybody’s body is different. trust me though you’d rather have one than not have one
11600,They usually have instructions
11601,"Tell you what girl, I've always been opposed to tampons too. I've used them once or twice when I was starting out to see what they were like and I hated them. Still do, honestly. But yesterday, I went swimming in the neighbors pool and I just HAD to wear a tampon, there was really no other option for me. I will agree, it takes some time to get used to both inserting and wearing tampons. It can feel weird or uncomfortable if not inserted right. I think you just need to practice some more, and you should eventually get it. Now isn't the time to practice though since you're already on your way or there. Your best option i think would be for you to tough it out and use a tampon. It will save you a lot of hassle and self consciousness. Best of luck, with whatever you decide to do!"
11602,"i'm not sure what the situation looks like in mexico, but are you seriously going to a water park in the middle of an ongoing pandemic?"
11603,https://www.healthline.com/health/does-your-period-stop-in-water
11604,I don’t know if this applies here but I had my period when I was in my swimming class and obviously it got wet DOWN there. Fortunately no blood was spilled. So I don’t know if this would work here but as long as you get soaked in the water park esp. the lower part... maybe you’re safe?
11605,"Ya it's either a tampon or diva cup, sorry"
11606,"yeah, I totally agree with you, but I don't think things will change very much tbh"
11607,"I jump through hoops when it comes to my sex life. I have birth control and I swear he’d have me get the morning after pill every other time we fuck. It kind of upsets me because number one: ITS FIFTY BUCKS A PILL. Two, it gives me hangovers so bad I can’t function. Plus, my mom can see the charge on my card and then knows “oh, you’re having sex again?” And that’s a fun conversation. 

All this happens because he finds condoms uncomfortable. And I get it. I think they can be uncomfortable, too. But he can do his part by taking a pill. Basically the same pill I take. It would make us both feel a lot better, I know this."
11608,"I definitely agree, it's unfair."
11609,[deleted]
11610,tbh he sounds really shitty
11611,"BC has a 99% (ish) chance of working, so two people on it drastically reduces the risk of an unwanted pregnancy"
11612,"Guys FOR THE MOST PART won't be driven by the same fear of pregnancy as women will.

They should have to be accountable sometimes but in this less than ideal world us ladies need to bring condoms for when guys forget or ""forget"".

I've got an IUD now but still make sure condoms are used every time.

If either person won't agree to sex on the same terms (types of protection etc) then it's not happening"
11613,"the side effects seem really unpleasant. i'm a gay trans man, though, so i'll probably have to use birth control unless i get a hysterectomy because i definitely don't wanna get pregnant and i doubt a cis gay man would be on birth control,"
11614,"Yeah I think that it does seem a bit unfair but you’re forgetting one thing. With women it’s much easier to stop ONE egg. With men it’s harder cause you don’t have to stop just one sperm cell, you would need to stop millions. You do make a good point about reversing vasectomies though but realistically most men probably wouldn’t jump at the thought of making a small cut on their balls and sniping the tube, even if it is a very minor surgery."
11615,"I just look at it as better safe than sorry, especially if you’re young and in no way capable of taking care of a baby."
11616,Yeah me neither :/
11617,"Yeah, for sure. I personally find it stupid that things are the way they are right now, after all, isn’t a relationship supposed to be an equal partnership? 50/50? Why make the woman have to go through all of that shit when there are other solutions? It’s just societal stigma, and as dumb as it is, that’s the world we live in, women are automatically expected to fill certain roles and do certain things simply because they’re women, and the men aren’t expected to inconvenience themselves because they’re too “important” to subject themselves to a minor inconvenience. Bullshit"
11618,one is a man and one is a woman.
11619,It sounds bad but he is a good person. We’re just trying to work that part of the relationship out.
11620,Most women can't get abortions globally and men can give up their parental rights to avoid child support. Also women having to carry a child to full term when they don't want to or can't without severe risks is worse than having to pay money for a child wellbeing. It's not even
11621,"for sure, the consequences of not using birth control are way worse for women so they’re just expected to take on the responsibility, even though female bc has serious side effects and condoms have none"
11622,"Yes, if a pill is created I think more men should take it, why does the woman have to be the one to take the brunt of the side effect whereas the guy just slips a bit of plastic on for a few minutes"
11623,"Yeah and I'm not saying everyone should go out and get one either. Just that no one talks about how they are usually reversable or even consider them an option bc many don't plan on having kids young, or even ever"
11624,"hopefully they develop a short term male BC that works along with condoms, i'm excited for when they do."
11625,[deleted]
11626,"That's terrible and you deserve better. Are there any other methods of birth control you would try that would be more reliable?

People are scared for IUDs but I forget I even have one in all of the time"
11627,I’m use birth control (nuva ring) and I **still** would not fuck a guy without the express and clear understanding that no condom means no way.
11628,"I'm on them bc of serious period problems oof. 

Without them I wouldn't be able to function, huzzah."
11629,"it’s definitely true what women are expected to take more responsibility, which is obviously bad since it’s a mutual relationship that involves both the guy and the girl

a condom is a minor inconvenience compared to girls who have the side effects of birth control pills"
11630,I think it should be an equal responsibility kind of thing
11631,"I have one solid rule that will never be broken.Wrap it before you tap it. (It rhymes so it has to be true.)

 Even though my gf has an IUD I still follow this rule just in case, because I don't want a baby just yet, maybe in like, 10 years, but definitely not now."
11632,What’s the point of two people on birth control?
11633,"Look, personally I agree with the statements made above but last i read, male BC had a chance to make you serile...... I'm sorry I want to have kids eventually... so in its current state no thanks. if someone can show me otherwise, please do!"
11634,[deleted]
11635,Fair enough
11636,"Not as much as a genre as specific artists. Like idc if someone listens to rap, but if they listen to Drake we're not good."
11637,See I get told I’m depressed or looking for attention because I listen to hard rock and metal. Neither being true I just like hard rock and metal.
11638,country. go away cowboy
11639,I hate those people almost as much as I hate people who listen to mumble rap ^/s
11640,"No, but I would prefer it if you're ok with death metal hahaha"
11641,soundcloud mumble rap
11642,Ahh rap probably. I absolutely despise rap
11643,"not types of music, but certain artists. can't name one on the top of my head but like some artists just immediately turn me off of someone. or if a guy says he doesn't like music or says he doesn't have a preference it's just so weird."
11644,"Nope! People can like whatever they want. 

Personally I don’t like Country tho :p"

11646,"Rock amd metal are pretty sweet music choices. If a girl thinks you're weird for liking those then its probably likely you're incompatible in other ways too. There are some asshole guys who like rock or metal.. But it's not one of the Red Flag music choices. If a guy is into current rap, Drake, Chris Brown, still likes any artist proven to beat/ hurt/ be awful to women, or any country music that isn't old like johny cash or something... Big red flags. He's probably not gonna respect you."
11647,"As others have said, rap and country."
11648,[deleted]
11649,"A dedicated Kanye fan I see, wavy."
11650,sooooowe hay boy we got some city slikers here round up the possy
11651,Honestly I agree. Everything that isn't country is fine imho
11652,"Don't change your music tastes just to appeal to more girls, it's just dumb. If you like music that's tasteful (like you said, lyrics that are ACTUALLY good, not disgusting) then a girl shouldn't have a problem with that."
11653,Not all the way to death metal but metalcore is THE shit. Stuff like Motionless in White and Asking Alexandria keep me alive.
11654,Couldnt someone enjoy his music but condemn him as a person?
11655,"Pop-folk, it's just an instant turn off for me, absolutely no question about it"
11656,anything with shallow or stupid lyrics. Or even lyrics that you can't tell what word they're trying to say (ie mumble rap). There has been songs I used to love until I saw that half the lyrics are about how much money they make or how many hoes they can buy. Rarely do the beat and musical vibes of the song make up for the garbage lyrics.
11657,Get out
11658,"Yep. It’s probably an unpopular opinion, but I just can’t see what all the hype is about."
11659,"in romania theres a music genre called ""manele"" which is basically garbage lyrics and annoying instrumental. tbh this type of music is only good when you re drunk or you re having fun with your friends and shit, but if anyone listens to that kind of crap unironically im concerned.  [a little exemple, have fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iUGfURqyhs)"
11660,This is the 2nd comment i've seen in this thread that says Drake is a red flag (although those weren't your specific words) and i don't get why.
11661,[deleted]
11662,Every rap type?
11663,probs rap and country. just so far from my personal music taste. but if you like rap and country you'll find someone who also likes rap and country
11664,Metal
11665,"I love country but I wanted to say I really appreciate how you stated your opinion without being rude to music you don't like, I've seen a ton of people doing that and it sucks. Thanks from all the country fans lol"
11666,"I WILL, u told me already 😭

 just posting my usual goodnight post 😌😴"
11667,Go to sleep or this will be your new bf 🗿
11668,Commitment do be sounding a lil scary negl
11669,"Man I got lonely watching Wall-E, I need help"
11670,"Baby im not even here, I'm a hallucination 💃"
11671,either that or just like 25 cats to cuddle my sorrows in
11672, ik what I gotta do now but I don't know if i have the strength to do it
11673,"And here you are? 🤭

I'm waiting for you in bed BB"
11674,Come to bed baby 🥺
11675,"Username checks out 🤔

But lowkey true lmaoo, i wish i had 25 cats rn 😭"
11676,"Opposite problem. 

Edit: wait you're the same guy as the original commenter. Fuck, you ruined my joke."

11678,"Been 5 hours, how many thirsty dm's you got so far"
11679,yeah tbh 😭 especially after watching romcoms
11680,Lmaoooo I've disabled them a few weeks ago
11681,"u/Lorotin, wanna be my girlfriend?"
11682,I lowkey need the relationship Wall-E and Eve have
11683,Star Wars quotes 🥵
11684,Sure
11685,Hopefully the start to happy relationship :)
11686,^(we've actually been in a relationship for 4 months lol)
11687,"Would love to, but social anxiety goes brrrrrr."
11688,"Now hear me out, this might sound crazy and all

It was a joke 🙂"
11689,If its wrong I don't wanna be right
11690,Why is commitment scary? I never really understood this sentiment.
11691,"I got lonely from the avast antivirus ""we're always looking out for you"" notification"
11692,Ughhh imagine not being lonely haha 😃🔫
11693,"Yeah, but its a lot of effort to get one. Like if I could just have one instantly, it’d be great."
11694,"I just started dating this girl (this week) and no lie, went in a rant to my friend for an hour about how cute and kind she is. Legit one of the sweetest people and has never made me feel uncomfortable despite her being over half a foot taller than me. Legit let me take a nap with her arm as a pillow for an hour today, like shit man, I'm sold.

But bruh, before i met her i was totally in the same boat. You just have to wait until you meet the person at that point in time. Wishing you luck, but remember you are not defined by being or not being in a relationship."
11695,That thing is harder than some ppl get lmao
11696,Because she's most DEFINITELY going to reject me.
11697,"That rhyme was gold! 

But seriously, you:re probably more than you think"
11698,Asking someone out wont ruin your life. The worst they could do is say no and you can still be friends.
11699,Better get rejected and move on than being crushed on someone that you know will reject you
11700,So what? Go for it!
11701,My life is not a movie sadly 😔
11702,"Your not hot because you know everything that's bad ab u, he's hot because you know nothing bad ab him"
11703,"Because she’s out of my league, deserves better than me, and I’m an awkward idiot"
11704,He probably thinks you're really hot
11705,"But what if it does ruin my life, I could be laughing stock for my whole life (paranoia moment x2)"
11706,Idk... I've already been dating him for 3 years... Do you guys think i have a chance?
11707,WHAT IS CRUSH AND WHY IS IT ALL YOU TALK ABOUT
11708,She's straight
11709,And you want her and she doesn't care about you?
11710,Then you deserve a happy ending
11711,Already did
11712,The soda brand. Duh.
11713,How did it go?
11714,Wise words
11715,"Well..  she wants some dude, that doesn't care about her.."
11716,(Spoiler Alert) you wont all of that paranoia is made up. And nobody will laugh at you. Asking out through text is a private convo between you 2 nobody else will know or laugh at you and why woukd you be a laughing stock for something considered brave.
11717,Because my friend was vocal to our friend group about him being her crush but I’ve kept it to myself and I’ll seem like a bitch if I go for him. I can’t talk to her about it either as the last girl that tried to talk to her about it she screamed at publicly
11718,Nah you’re pretty much fucked sorry. It sounds like he doesn’t like u back
11719,"Everyone thinks their crushes are out of their league. What would you lose by asking her out? Sure, she might say no but it wouldn't change anything. It'd still better than nothing, right?"
11720,She is not unrealistic.. she just don't want to date ugly ass me
11721,"I did, but they said they don’t like me in that way. But we’re really good friends so I have to live with the fact that he is aware of this crush but it’s not reciprocated"
11722,You will be laughed at by other people
11723,"Some ~~girls~~ people are just incredibly unrealistic, smh my head"
11724,It doesn't need to
11725,They tell that only you 2 know but lies exist
11726,Imma save this post cause I also want to know.
11727,You gotta be willing to tell them dude. Girls usually don’t make the first move
11728,Just tell her. Most of us are pretty clueless to that stuff.
11729,"If you want to be super obvious without telling her, do things like rest your head on her shoulder or try to hold her hand very casually, for example, let’s say your hands are right next to each other, reach out like a pinkie or smth and try to link it around one of her fingers, unless she is somehow denser than me (which I am certain is an impossibility at this point) she’s probably gonna pick up that you like her, now if she seems to accept your advances, you should have nothing to worry about if you confess (she’s honing to have to be fine with both of these though, personally, for someone I don’t like romantically I would be fine if they rested me head on my shoulder but if they try to hold my hand for anything but dragging me around, fear, a joke, or they are a small child, I’m yoinking my hand away"
11730,"so what i have learned from browsing both of these subs is, nobody has any clue what anyone else is thinking. nice"
11731,">resting head on shoulder

*sexual harassment intensifies*"
11732,"do the same things you usually do, just don’t say “no hetero” and wait for her to catch on"

11741,Hello     :)
11742,"I would advise you to tell her, but do it when you two are alone.. this stuff will problaby be embarassing for both of you if it doesnt go as planned"
11743,Sounds like you've done this before
11744,"I personally have gotten pretty good at picking up the signs so most of the time i can tell when a guy finds me attractive, but here are the things that i notice and tell me:

-How they look at me, when they look longer then what they normally would. If i think think this ill keep an eye on them in my peripheral vision. This isn't a strong tell though 

-When they stand way to close to me. Not just once, but several times. They'll almost always be touching me in some way or very deep in my personal bubble. (PS, if a girl doesn't like you and you do this chances are she doesn't like you back, not a guarantee, she might not realize what your doing. But the better chances are she don't. Depends on other signs.) If i like the person doing this ill let or encourage them. 

-Honestly bro be upfront, a lot of girls are just as clueless as guys when it comes to this sort of thing. Maybe you don't have to confess your feelings in an extremely direct and uncomfortable manner, but still direct enough to where she'll know. 

-When they're being extremely flirty. Like playing with my hair or getting all up in my face (in a playful and friendly tone). Some light teasing, or even really sweet gestures. My current boyfriend really likes my nose so he'll play and mess around with it quite a bit, whether it's just quickly bopping it or pulling on it. Maybe even playing footsie or borrowing something and not returning it right away (girls do this with sunglasses but I'm not sure what a guy version of this would be). 

 -Talking and inviting her places to be alone together. Like maybe inviting her to a place that only you've been to that she hasn't. Or even a mutual place the both of you could've been to before, bonus points if she goes for it and says sure. Or even maybe just taking a different route then you normally would. 

This doesn't directly answer your question, but its just the things i notice when a guy likes me or 'wants to be more then just friends'."
11745,Yeah we aren't psychic

**YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE**"
11759,LOL if I snapped at my mom it won't end well.
11760,u threw a rock at him for that? dang i wouldnt want to be on your bad side
11761,"Like in terms of the fight?

When I heard her say “okay ms retart” after her and my sister who is autistic were having a conversation I didn’t just lunge at her. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and told her “don’t talk too her like that” after you could visibly see how upset my sister (with the autism) was. I told her don’t say it again, too which she started mocking me and continuing to use disgusting slurs at my sister

Her and I bad mouthing off to each other lasted probably 2 minutes because after that I got up in her face and told her to stop otherwise we gonna have some problems. Then the fight started and she just got her ass whooped. I’m no floyd Mayweather, and I’m not the strongest 11yr old when this happened but my mom and dad are certified beasts when it comes to fighting. Probably where I get the badges in that department, but she had a bunch of injuries while I only had i think  a bloody lip and some bruises while my hair was a mess cause she cant fight for sh#! 🤡 

#If she was too tell you the story she’d play the victim card just like how she played it too our mom. 
###That I WAS the one disrespecting my sister
###That I WAS the one who hit first 
(she got her ass beat and couldn’t accept that, while it would make sense that I did hit her first, I didn’t. When i got up in her face she shoved my face away from her then tried to slap me)"
11762,It happened once when a dude was being rude and sexist to a friend and I punched him in the face and broke his glasses in half. It was funny because I was in school and everyone thought of me as “the nice girl”
11763,"no yeah, i get this one. i hold in my anger to prevent hurting someone and than they piss me off even more and i just can’t keep it in anymore and i go full speed on them"
11764,Yeah I was really pissed. Literally the only tine I misbehaved at school ever.
11765,Good for you.
11766,What did you do to be 16 and in jail for whooping your sisters ass... You said in court she always abused y'all?
11767,"No, because I cry easily when I'm angry, so I force myself to control the anger."
11768,"the courts will usually still punish the person defending themselves, and maybe in this case it was aggravated assault. There have been stories where people killed home intruders and their attackers and still had jail sentences"
11769,yeah and my headphones didn't like it
11770,"Good, proud of you.

As I say: fuck around, find out.

Did she learn her lesson tho?"
11771,No because the rest of the class stood by me and said they didn’t see anything so no one could confirm that it was me
11772,"I used to but I don’t anymore. Now when I feel like I need to release my anger I either go in my room or the bathroom and punch the wall until my hand hurts enough to convince me to stop 

When I was a few years younger I would easily snap but I don’t think I ever took it out on someone, I either did some material damage or just released my frustration by punching my pillow or something like that lmao"
11773,No. I go on gory video games and slice people. Then I’m not mad anymore lol
11774,My “rival” was being extra bitchy one day so I snapped and yelled very detailed death threats at her while my friends held me back.
11775,Jesus Christ
11776,Bro facs
11777,"#I like that quote

And no after that until i was 15 we still had issues. Now she lives in a different town but we don’t talk anymore after she disrespected my mom, i still talk to my niece (her daughter) cause i know the feeling of someone doing something wrong and no one still trying to have communication with me. Plus my niece did nothing wrong and has no role in our issues, so why punish her? I still love my sister dearly and would murder anyone for her, but we just can never get along. After that there was so many times I could have went to jail, like literally so close. Our family is the definition of toxic and dysfunctional so no she did not learn her lesson. She thought because I didn’t tell my mom what was happening, that i was some quiet/weak/naive kid. Little did she know I developed that anger issue from our mom and mopped the floor with her multiple times. I feel like she likes to challenge me in that department just so she can say to herself “she wont fight me” when indeed I will. Idk if we will ever be the same but I’m about to graduate, im hitting milestones in my life and i miss her. Let me stop i just caught myself venting LMFAOAOAOS but to make it short no she did not😋


##Also i love your username"
11778,The rest of the class hated this dude anyway so they were all happy to see it
11779,"Yupp, I punched a cinderblock wall for the first time ever, I thought it would make me feel better since I knew people who would take multiple blows at them when angry. It didn’t make me feel better but atleast I didn’t initially feel it  cuz of all the adrenaline. 

It was embarrassing tho cuz I stormed outta class and came back with a limp red hand and STILL pissed off"
11780,"Damn, that’s badass. Did you get in trouble?"
11781,"Hell yeah, good on your class for not snitching."
11782,"Yes, I once made an older woman cry because she thought she was better than everyone thinking that she could day awful things to other people because she couldbecause she was older. I yelled at her calling her awful things band she began to cry and I told her to ""suck it up you fucking hag"""
11783,yh a lot. i have a mad case of anger issue
11784,Same
11785,Yeah. I was trying to describe it in the question but you summed it up well
11786,"I agree. I’m about to go to a new therapist myself and here’s everything you need to know for therapy

First she won’t want to go. Rarely anyone is happy to go to therapy. I would definitely suggest you go with her instead of her parents because she told you first. I don’t know much about the context so that’s the best I can do in that part

The first session sucks and is horrible. They ask you questions about things you don’t want to talk about. If you go make sure if possible you can sit next to her and hold her hand. She will really appreciate it. Also don’t be surprised if they ask you a few questions. 

My first therapist was horrible and didn’t help at all and I am currently going to go to a new one. I can’t tell you much about what happens after the first session but it gets better I promise. Also one more thing, she will cry and be emotional after. 

That’s almost everything you need to know. 

Edit: if possible can you give an update? I want to know if there is anything else I can do."
11787,"Do romantic gestures for her. Give her flowers, spontaneously hold her hand, take her to her favorite restaurant, just show her in little ways that you're there and you care for her. 

Mods please don't remove this it's important for him to know and I'm gender fluid so sometimes I'm close to being a girl so please."
11788,"You really should get her a therapist. even if it’s not that bad now, chances are it’s going to get worse and she’ll be better off getting the help early"
11789,"Sorry i’m not a girl but i was suicidal last year.

My best friend told me to go to a therapist and after a while (I needed a little convincing) , i went to a therapist.

It helped me out alot, after only like 2 sessions, she taught me how to handle everything i was thinking.

I wish you the best of luck"
11790,Therapy. That’s the best way to help her
11791,She’s not strong enough to get through this by herself get her some fucking help.
11792,"Okay, I really do need to push the idea into her head, even if it's just a little bit, I've recommended it to her and I'll see how she reacts as to what I do next, thanks."
11793,"Mate, ask her to talk to her parents, a school counselor or a therapist. Her suicidality is something that can't, and shouldn't, be dealt with alone. Even if it doesn't seem bad enough to take to a professional, it could be worse and she could just be hiding it from you. This can spiral so please, please go talk to someone/encourage her to go to someone.
 (Also, there is no ""you must be this tall to enter"" when it comes to seeking help for your mental health)"
11794,[deleted]
11795,Please tell her parents I know she may not be comfortable with it but her safety matters most and even though these feelings are so strong they will pass soon I promise. In this life has so much to offer and is never worth throwing away. Know that you are a great person for being there for her and I wish you and your girlfriend the best in this life
11796,"I recommend it to her last night so I'll see how she reacts to it. I think she knows how much I care but I'll keep telling her, I do ask how she going way to regularly but I'll keep it going."
11797,"Just by that username, I 100% agree with you"
11798,"Oh good point I should have tagged it as everyone, we don't see eachother much and when we do we will try and make the most of it, we'd probably spend the whole time hugging and cuddling if we could, thanks for the advice and I'll try it."
11799,"I’m sorry but I don’t think this is good advice. I’ve been in this mans shoes before and while yes, it took a toll on me mentally that still exists, I ended up saving her life. When she attempted suicide I was the one that went to her house, and called 911. If I left when she voiced to me that she was suicidal, she would be dead. Although we aren’t together anymore, I would’ve gone through all the pain again, because saving their life, allowing someone to appreciate the life that they have, is the most important thing someone can do for another human being."
11800,"She needs a hold on suicide watch, and then inpatient treatment to help her actually learn coping and to sort out her meds. Save her life by heping her see that going in for treatment is *the* option for her right now. Just try. You love her, right? So, tell her, ""It's time.....time to get better, not worse. I'm not going anywhere. You're not gonna go through this alone. But I also am not gonna try and help you alone. Let's get you some help. Ok? I love you."""
11801,"Listen, always listen. Sometimes we want to be heard on moments like these. Show her how much you love her and don’t say stuff like “isn’t life great?” Or “i love living”. Show her how wonderful this world can be, show her that she’s not alone and that you’re not going anywhere. Try to understand her and her thoughts."
11802,It is beautiful to see how much you care! Definitely encourage her to see a therapist. My bf is always there for me and so supportive but sometimes you need help from an outside perspective. He really pushed me to see somebody and it has helped my mental state and well-being tremendously. All the best to you both and love to see your support for your gf xx
11803,"I'll recomend it to her and update everyone on how she reacts to it and if I need more help, thanks."
11804,I have recommended it to her and I'm waiting for her to see and respond to it.
11805,"Her parents wouldn't help, she was caught crying one and her parents said something like toughen up, the only option is help her myself with a friend or two or recommend her a school counselor, thank you and thank you again."
11806,"We can't see eachother much but we take for over 5 hours everyday just texting, I don't believe she would go ahead and do it but it things get worse you just never know"
11807,"Don't listen to this guy they're a bit of a twat. How could you say that? If you love her, seek therapy for her and listen to all the other positive comments trying to help you guys out."
11808,"No that is not even close to an option, other than family she's the most important person in my life, she means the world to me and is not a constant drag or sadness, she has told me about having these thoughts 2 times and I've known her for close to a year, any negative aspect she has is easily made up for by her positives, there's no way I'm leaving her."
11809,"It's brilliant that you're there for her, that's the most important thing you can do"
11810,Oh that’s awful I wish you the best of luck and if you have any questions just feel free to ask any of us!
11811,How did that go??
11812,"I’m really glad you do, it’s really important that she knows she has someone to go to, I hope she gets better pal, sending love from here"
11813,"I won't trust me, I will reccomend it to her, see how she reacts then if it does need to be taken further I'll try get one of her friends to even get the counselor to book a session with her or something, I am listening to all the good ones and not this one."
11814,"No problem, I’m glad to help someone out. I hope she gets better"
11815,"No problem. It's great what you're doing, but make sure to take care of yourself and your own mental health as well."
11816,I like gaming boys who are not judgmental. Especially like playing video games with them and going on a date that way
11817,Basically tall skinny outgoing guys... so I’m attracted to outgoing beanstalks
11818,"Ayyyy, dark hair dark eye gang"

11825,Haha I have grey eyes but I think brown eyes are so gorgeous
11826,"I tend to like more outgoing and funny, but I've liked guys of all personalities"
11827,Thicc
11828,Grey eyes are honestly one of the best eye colours.
11829,"Either

But not like fat, but like bigger built. Idk how to explain it.

Like some guys are naturaly bigger built but not necessarily fat or muscular"
11830,"no clue why but i like guys who look like they did drugs like 3 years ago but are sober. dark hair is nice, strong looking, very manly, tall is nice but not necessary, and very dominant"
11831,What does stocky mean?
11832,Ahaha nice one.
11833,Like fit THICC or chubby THICC?
11834,"See, I find it kinda difficult to express myself as a more feminine guy when (hey, genetics) gave me god awful facial hair and (KILL ME) a unibrow."

11836,Lmfaooo 💀💀
11837,"there are plenty haha, a lot of us are just scared to be open about it because you get hated on “you’re a girl you’re obviously doing this for attention” yup ok brandon. i sure spent $2,000+ on gaming stuff because i want attention 💀"
11838,THICC MEN
11839,danny devito is my type
11840,"For the unibrow just get a tweezers bro, having more brow to work with let's you do most of the sculpting even if it's more work."
11841,I love boys who game but aren’t assholes. I just want a boy I can watch movies with and cuddle with and game with. That’s all really. Besides my love for skinny boys
11842,Heyyy we’re the same age on the same planet ahaha
11843,"well looks (for boys cuz im bi) : average height or tall, blonde long hair.
personality (boys) : boys that like to fight and stuff and weebs.

im not gonna do girls because im lazy oof."
11844,"I hope you're well versed in ""You just got beaned!!!"" memes"

There is one guy at my table the rest of us are girls"
11847,"I go to a small school where there is no privacy, so we *do* talk about boys and sex.. with girls. Or guys, depending on where I’m sitting and how absolutely, horribly wrong whatever one of them says is. I recently got to educate one of the “popular” kids on where their prostate is and that no, touching it doesn’t instantly make every guy cum.

There’s not a lot of awkward moments at my school. Those only really happen when you’re super close to someone, tbh."
11848,"Uhh, video games, dnd, jokes, general dumb shit, the works. And also whatever is going on in our lives or how our classes are going etc"

11856,Yeah most my friends are lesbians so they  don't talk much about boys tbh

Then a boy in our class was kinda looking over at us and we were like “can you hear us” and he was like “yeah a little” and he ended up having heard the whole conversation about how we would want to know what masturbating feels like as a boy and that’s the kind of stuff girls actually talk about in school."

I don’t even think my best friends know my favorite color, what shows I like, any of it. But I always give them stuff. Handmade woodburnings of their favorite ships, clay figures, and more. I hold their secrets and let them vent to me. Even my own God damn mother does this. But I don’t even get a genuine how was your day. But if someone did, I’m pretty sure I’d break down."

11910,Good for u!
11911,"Probably (As fucking sad as it sounds) gaming and content creating. I love it more than anything else (Besides my lil doggo, I'm not a psychopath) and want my future job to be YouTube or Twitch. I want to make people laugh and make everyone's day even a tad bit better."
11912,I absolutely love music as well! Taught myself piano and guitar by ear. I had completely ignored that tutorials existed on YouTube and such but didnt have a lot of difficulties getting used to them. I'm only a few months into learning them and I would say I'm pretty good. I'm also practicing singing by ear but not great at it by any means lol. Am into any genre!

11923,"i’m an artist (digital illustration mostly) and am planning to go to college for it. it’s been my passion since i was a wee little kid, and for a brief period in my life i was SURE i couldn’t make a living, but that’s not true!! we don’t live in the 1800s, you can do practically anything and earn a living. put your songs on youtube or spotify, i assure you someone will like it (especially with how popular indie music is). my friend is also a musician and a damn good one, she was the one who pulled me out of my really miserable state by telling me that living for your passion is the best thing you can do for yourself. don’t give up bro, you can do it!!"

Maybe not as a career, because that's unlikely, but I (like you said) want to be able to make other people's day maybe just a bit better. I have little interest in other careers tbh. One of the only things I enjoy doing is playing games and talking to people, so youtube fits right into that."

I've never heard it used outside the community, but it's used in the kpop community to describe the types of voices that they sing with. Don't quote me on this, but I'm guessing it's because Korean might describe it as 'vocal colours' and someone translated it directly and it spread."

I take flute and voice lessons, used to take piano and occasionally still play, and I’m slowly teaching myself the dizi and baritone uke. I just started programming seriously about a year ago and I’ve tried several languages like Python, Swift, and JavaScript.

Other than that, I enjoy horse riding, but I see it as more of a casual hobby than a possible career path."

11965,"Good luck! Who knows, he may have a crush on you even if you haven’t talked"

but nah ur not sus"

11969,WHERE IS YOUR AGE AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH IT
11970,Yup
11971,She sold it
11972,"You’re not a teen girl, you’re 42 pigeons in a trench coat. 🤭"
11973,I don't care but I definitely notice it more than the regular flairs. Amplifies suspicion if they act weird.
11974,There is no inbetween
11975,"not really, besides even if they were adults what would they do? read my posts/comments?"
11976,Haha I was thinking about you when I saw the question
11977,True

11979,Want a ride on my van? I got free candy and puppies
11980,slightly
11981,ohno
11982,💀
11983,Depends on how they act
11984,Only slightly
11985,Yes. They're always hiding something.
11986,stop exposing me 👀
11987,"Hold up, there is a non binary flair? I've been living under a mountain. Imma change my flair."

11990,"I see 3 different outcomes:

1- They are actually 13-19, but may have accidentally set their flair to M or F

2- They are 12 or under

3- They're a bloody pedophile"
11991,Oh heck yeah!
11992,Makes sense
11993,*Not revealing my age menacingly*
11994,"Yep. They have other flairs too if you ask. I should probably do that, because the NB flair doesn’t really feel completely right. Better than the M flair tho"
11995,ohfuck
11996,"Nope, I'm lucky enough to have a dad who will not hesitate to go bat shit crazy on adults being inappropriate towards his children"
11997,"Im 16f and from Toronto too! And yes, i hate this. I used to do it around my stepdad, not cause anyone told me to, just cause it made me more comfortable."
11998,"no. i don’t really have the ~assets~ so there’s no need for me to “cover up”. it’s not like i’m completely naked or anything but if i’m wearing something on the more revealing side, like a bikini or v-neck i’ve never been told to cover up unless it’s because it’s cold outside. i never wear a bra when i’m at home unless i’m working out and i’m wearing a sports bra. to be fair, i don’t have any brothers"
11999,yes and i always say no. i tell my mom if i have to cover up for them i’m calling the police on them cause they’re sexually attracted to young teens.
12000,"You have a good dad.

Parents who shrug it off deserve to get hit by a bus."
12001,"I mean I get your point but if you had to see your dad walking around pants-less you'd probably be uncomfortable, I assume that's what it's like for them"
12002,"Yeah lol, usually it’s for a fancy outing or family reunion and I’m not going to show up half naked. My parents always make me wear a dress. Not that I care, it’s just clothing whatever, but I also don’t see family often that’s why it’s special for me.

Its really not that hard to make an effort to look nice, and come on, uncomfortable clothing doesnt exist anymore and a tight dress or blah really doesnt hurt to wear once in a while"
12003,"Yeah, I used to wear shorts all the time until my dad asked me to change into some pants one day outside at our balcony when I was around 10. I didn’t think much of it but since then, I rarely wear shorts outside, but mostly because of the fact that I’m always too lazy to shave lol."
12004,i think i did it?
12005,"Yes, thank you."
12006,"my mum has told me to put on a bra if we r going out some where (not even a fancy occasion) multiple times, so ive kinda grown to be uncomfortable with myself if im not wearing a bra, especially as ive gained a little weight in that department recently. ive never really been told to cover up, but i dont often wear something not long-sleeve"
12007,"Yea this is fucking ridiculous, no girl should have to wear a bra if she doesn’t want to, my step mom always wanted me to wear a bra around the house but I just didn’t do it she couldn’t rly do anything cause she was my step mom but yes no girl should have to put up with that shit, also I’m from van!!"
12008,but i mean i just try to wear normal clothes that i wear everything. if your parents only have a problem with it when you’re around certain people. i feel there’s something wrong with those certain people.
12009,"Oh wait do you mean cover up as in you're not allowed to wear shorts/crop tops around them? Bc yeah that's definitely a problem. I read it as covering up like wearing a bra, which I think is reasonable. But if you're not allowed to wear shorts around someone yeah that person is the problem"
12010,yeah. my mom gets mad if i wear a tank top or shorts even if i’m just going to be laying around all day
12011,"i’m in the same boat! no short shorts, no crop tops, no sitting too close. it terrifies me that they act like what is wearing is the problem rather than their behavior being the problem."
12012,Yes my opinion exactly!
12013,yeah like shorts is a big problem for my family. they’re not really short just normal shorts that they allow me to wear everywhere else
12014,[deleted]
12015,"That's insane. My brother is really annoying about what I wear bc he's 4 years older and I swear he thinks he's my third parent, but I never listen to him and my mom is fine with what I wear, so it's never really been a problem, even during my *really short* shorts phase."
12016,Same here! I never knew there were so many people in this sub from toronto!
12017,"Happy cake day! And I have to wear a bra in front of my family too. I think it's just because it would be really weird to see my brother walking around without pants, so it would be equally weird and uncomfortable for them to see me without a bra or not somewhat covered up (I can still wear crop tops and shorts and all that, they aren't super strict). The guys in my family aren't creepy either, the only one that was is dead. Sometimes I just wear a hoodie instead so I don't need a bra"
12018,"My mum has spoken to me before about it, one time I remember is when my cousin came for a sleepover and we were both in night shirts and shorts, I think we were like 15/16 at the time, she came and said something along the lines of “please cover up you’re making your stepdad ‘uncomfortable’”. Honestly I was so disgusted, why should I cover up because he’s uncomfortable, why is he getting uncomfortable seeing 16ish y/o girls in night shirts and shorts?! Other times have been like I’ll be going out somewhere and there will be a “you think you’re going out dressed like that?” Comment"

12020,How dare you wear something comfortable in the privacy of your own home‽ >:(((
12021,Im sorry but if you need to cover up when your god damn family is over they're in the wrong
12022,"I mean yeah i guess, my cousins wear like booty shorts and a crop top and well they're my cousins so i dont even bat an eye

But yeah if they ran around naked that would be weird"
12023,ive never been pressured by others but sometimes i feel weird showing off in front of them. but ive never been asked to cover up its just my judgement
12024,"That never happened to me actually. I find bras hella uncomfortable, so I usually wear them during sports or when my outfit requires it and all that, but otherwise I just don’t. 
When it’s summer I‘m gonna wear shorts and a tank top/crop top, if I‘m warm I‘m warm no matter who‘s around. And nobody ever told me/any other female family members my age how to dress around older male family members."
12025,"I don’t think you’re overreacting. I always cover up because I’m uncomfortable with my body and I also don’t want to be wearing anything “scandalous” near any of my family members. But I understand the part about feeling pressured to cover up around older men. Obviously it’s not all men but SOME older men, I feel can’t control themselves"
12026,Imagine that boy remembering that that was the first time he saw titties
12027,[deleted]
12028,"When I moved here, I went to the local pool and after I was done swimming I got undressed in front of everyone [cuz I was use to doing it- it wasn't taboo before moving here] and EVERYONE looked at me, like in shock.

They were trying to usher me into the bathroom or like stall and I was basically like ""why"" and just got undressed and dressed in front of kids, moms AND Karens."
12029,Imagine that boy reading this post
12030,[removed]
12031,You did a good deed that day
12032,I was like 11 I think I was so nervous to jump off the diving board that when I did I sorta slipped and my top ended up getting caught on the diving board so I fell into the pool topless and had to get out grab my top and run to the locker rooms.
12033,"when i was 7, i was on vacation and i went to the pool in floaties (i couldn’t swim yet). there was this kid that was 7 too, and he was showing off how he could swim without floaties. my badass, jealous, 7 year old self wanted to show him that i could too so i jumped in without my floaties, downed for about 30 seconds, and then i managed to float by myself. and that’s the story about the time i taught myself how to swim"
12034,"Yeah, most commonly you change in the bathroom."
12035,Bruh you know what I mean.  Girls titties
12036,"Was at a water park with some friends. A few guys kept harrassing us. Pulled down my friends bathing suit, threw stuff at us, went right behind us in the slides so they kept sliding into us, called us names and so on. We told security and the boys were banned from the park for the entire summer! Nothing beats the look on their faces when they were thrown out hahaha"
12037,"So this one isn’t very embarrassing... but we had just move to a new town 4 months before summer. My church group had a pool party because my friend.. let’s call her A, had a pool. Everything  was fine. Until I showed up. I took off my tank top and I was wearing a bikini... while everyone else was wearing a tankini or swimming in a shirt. Then it hit me. These are very very strong baptist. OOPS. I’m not baptist so I didn’t realize it. But I felt uncomfortable the whole time considering there were a bunch of guys."
12038,Could be shock
12039,Yeah my guy who has a female mom?
12040,"Eh still really weird everyone knows, especially adults know that it's not okay to stare at someone's ass especially when it's a kid"
12041,"Lol I similar thing kinda happened to me. Im..more developed as well, and I was swimming around w my cousin and seeing who could hold their breath under the water the longest. While i was holding my breath she swam away for some reason and as soon as i got up im guessing my shirt was kinda in a weird position(plus my mom bought one of those oversized shirts so i cold ""grow into them""), so I remember looking at the lifeguard for some reason and he looked at me, turned red, and looked away. For some reason it didn't register to me so i was like ""well okay they're weird"" until i looked down to hold my breath and saw my thangs chillin in the water like ""what up bitches"" and my shirt straps were on my elbows and i was just like...somebody kill me and revive me in another time and place because i dont want to exist. And then I fixed myself up and left the water, oh and my mom got some cookies from the bakery near the pool center so it wasn't all bad. Also last summer i found a bunch of money in the water so that was gud."
12042,So that means he has no mom...
12043,"Sometimes doing that is the best way to teach... Well, as long as the environment is controlled somewhat"
12044,Countless times involving underwater jets that I probably shouldn't mention here.
12045,how stupid does a dude have to be to pull down a girls bathing suit and not expect consequences
12046,Okinawa
12047,Yeah I agree it’s kinda weird

12050,"Just curious, where did u move from?"
12051,oh cool!
12052,lmaooo
12053,"Yeahh, when I went to bathhouses women were all bare and not care Haha"
12054,"Um, I was wearing a two piece and part of the suit slipped off. That was scaring."
12055,"Really? Where I live (Canada), everyone changes in front of each other in the change rooms without issues. Nobody stares or anything, just do our own thing."
12056,"Yeah, they also shame brands like brandy Melville, that are just giving options to smaller sizes. They definitely have a double standard."
12057,90% of the body positivity movement is toxicity and shaming other people for their body size. just ignore it
12058,"Yeah I've seen that a lot. As a tall but skinny girl (I'm 5'7) and I hate the body positivity movement. It's just a lot of bullshit to me. All of my clothes are either 00 or 0 and it hurts to be called flat, malnourished, to be made fun of for having small boobs."
12059,It really is toxic
12060,"I’m a size 0. I haven’t heard of this before, but honestly it hurts me now because I feel too small."
12061,"As a (debateably) petite girl, the body positivity movement is definitely not for me. I've gotten shamed for being smaller and people have told me about my flat ass and boobs, but if I were to come out and say something back about them being bigger, *I* would be the biggot."
12062,"Bruh I'm 181cm (like 6 foot or something) and am pretty damn thin. Think model body. An (ex)friend of mine legit called me *an Auschwitz prisoner*. This friend was also quite thicc, as in fat, he said it was ""average weight for Americans"" 



:'( no need to call me an Auschwitz prisoner"
12063,"Yea , magazines have photo shoots of obese women (who are unhealthy) which is seen as promoting loving yourself but if they have an extremely thin model (which is also unhealthy) is seen as promoting eating disorders and body shaming buffer girls/women. There is definitely a double standard . 


(Lol did that make sense)"
12064,Body positivity usually brings others down in the process it's bad
12065,"That’s horrible for him to say something like that, It’s good that you aren’t friends with him anymore. Also, him saying that he is average weight for Americans isn’t a good thing, average weight for Americans is likely obese, or at best overweight."
12066,In many places around the world thin people (those that arent considered overweight or obese) are the minority (~30% in the US.) Becomes a funny conversation when you ask any woman less than 150 lbs how easy it is to find clothes.
12067,did you recently have a birthday? i remember your flair being 14f
12068,"Not really. They only offer one size (size 0) and to be honest, finding anything that is size 0 is hard. I’m a size 00 and that’s even harder to find in a normal clothing store. Idk about wherever you live but for me, if I try and go shopping for anything at a store I’m probably going to leave empty handed and disappointed cause I can’t find anything my size. I am they type of person that can’t fit in an S it has to be an XS at minimum but preferably an XXS. I wish there where more stores that sold smaller clothes. Torrid exists for plus size people but if a store opened specifically for smaller people, everyone would lose their shit and say it’s “not inclusive” and “body shaming”. Plus size people have their own stores. Why can us smaller people have ours."
12069,"What I also think is extremely toxic is people encouraging someone who is morbidly obese to stay that way.I mean,if they where born that way i'ts fine with me but if they are obese because they don't have a healthy lifestyle at all and are eating themselves to their graves I feel like people should be concerned and get that person help instead of calling it ""bodypositivity"".




Bodypositivity nowadays is just so double-sided,Once two of my bigger friends where joking about me being a stick and that I needed to gain some weight.That day wasn't my day to begin with,but they just kept on pestering me with it.I called them out on their bullshit,but they then proceeded to call me out for calling them fat...Wich I didn't,I just told them to stop naging about my weight all day long... Apparently I'm not allowed to do that and should just accept being called a stick all day long as being a compliment...yeah right

If body positivity isn't supposed to be fair to everyone and every size then what's the point?I'ts really just being treated as a revenge and win-win situation for fat People to finally be able to bodyshame skinny people back for shaming them all these years.I admit that body shaming over the course of history hasn't been pretty,but seeking revenge this way is childish and doesn't get us anywhere"
12070,Yep! Yesterday
12071,happy belated birthday!
12072,thank you!! lol
12073,ofc no problem
12074,"happy birthday from me too, although u don't know me. Wish you the best!"
12075,really? xaxa I'm kinda new and I lurk more than comment/post
12076,I haven’t seen those videos but damn that’s toxic
12077,"Yeah, like, I’m naturally skinny and I get shamed for it all the time. “Oh, you’re way too skinny, you should eat something!” “You look like you’re starving yourself!” I’m fucking not. But when I say someone who is morbidly obese should lose weight, suddenly I’M shaming THEM??"
12078,[deleted]
12079,I mean I don’t see anything wrong with Brandy Melville but it’s not like it caters to a size that isn’t traditionally offered? Like I’m not incredibly skinny or anything but they seem to fit a size S-M in general and a lot of their stuff is too big. People act like they make clothes for people who can’t find their size elsewhere and I don’t understand it lol
12080,[deleted]
12081,i’m tired of people not having jeans that fit me. like yeah my waist is a zero but i can’t wear a zero. i would like pants that aren’t so tight on my ass that i can’t sit down pls
12082,"Thank you!! 

And I’ve seen you around!"
12083,Yeah I’ve seen a couple of your comments
12084,"that's cool xaxa. Hopefully we'll stick more to the sub. I like it here, cool community :)"
12085,"that's not the point of body positivity though. body positivity is for people that can't control their body on something that might make them look different from others, like burn marks, stretch marks, birth marks, physical disability, etc. you can control your weight.

i hate all body positivity videos that aren't like that."
12086,Not having to sign up for the draft
12087,Big pockets
12088,I would seriously hate not being able to carry all 17 of my graphing calculators.
12089,Okay this may not be true but you know how we have to go shopping for the perfect dress for every special occasion and they could just wear a tux? That and correct me if I am wrong
12090,Haha yeah I take that for granted
12091,The obvious one has to be lack of period right? But I have always been fascinated by what it's like to have a dick honestly
12092,The fact they're ways thought of as sweet and angelic and we're though of as a bunch of troublemakers
12093,That's coming from a lifelong penis haver though. That's like me telling you having a vagina isn't interesting even though to you it would be like being given NASA technology
12094,Being able to be cute and adorable. I wanna be that
12095,[deleted]
12096,You guys don’t get stabbed by Mother Nature every month
12097,Nah ur not wrong lol my girlfriend had to shop all day for the perfect dress and had to go for an hour drive 3 times for it to get altered and I just walked into a shop spent 15 Mins getting fitted and was given a tux.
12098,Yeah that's fair it would really be scary and sad being forced to leave home when others just don't have to
12099,Whats stopping you mate? Lets be cute and adorable together!
12100,It's not very interesting
12101,Boobs.
12102,Thank god our balls don’t hurt while running tho
12103,I can't imagine it I would hate it so bad.
12104,Nearly all of them look like 6/10’s at least
12105,Being able to hold a girl's hand without getting looks qvq
12106,Being wanted and not having to worry about making the first move
12107,yeah. i think its MUCH easier to look like shit as a boy.
12108,We serve the Soviet Union

12122,"Oh god it was awful. We were at the park and he knew I hadn’t kissed anyone before and he said “may I do the honors of taking your kissing virginity” (he was being ironic of course but it was still super cringey, we were 16!) and then he used tongue on the first kiss like BRUH WHY. I think I forgot to close my eyes at first too LMFAOO"

12126,"Pro tips 

1. Don't start with tougne 
2. Don't do it if she is uncomfortable (I learned the hard way)
3. Keep your eyes close in the beginning 
4. Tougne kissing take alot more work than it looks"
12127,ngl i will give mine 8/10 it wasn't bad but disgusting
12128,LMAOOO
12129,"It was okay, nothing special"
12130,Talk to your female friends about emotional shit regularly and eventually most of them will catch feelings. That’s the closest thing I have to a “way”.

Teach me your ways"
12140,"I would rate it because it was a special kiss, that was the only kiss i had like that. Heart level pumping brain thinking is this true, liquids overflowing \[by this i mean we were drooling\] But i hate it because of several personal reasons as well as it was disgusting like our shirts were covered with each others spit. We kept kissing for like  3-4 mins straight."
12141,i've never held hands with a boy much less kissed one 😳😳🤡

 Makes me feel weird, wondering what would happen if I were to talk to that person."
12173, a heated argument💀💀especially when it’s with someone i don’t like at all idk idk
12174,"Oh god, finally. I thought I was insane."
12175,Nooo why is this so true omg 😭
12176,"We shouldn't. Sure representation has its place, but policies and being a good leader should be top priority."
12177,"Policies>race/sex/gender

That is why, mark my words, the first female President of the USA will be a Republican."
12178,The lack of representation though can often be traced back to lack of opportunity I think is the point. Nobody is saying anyone should be voted for simply because they are gender X/Race X. Only that we should be making strides to balance out the representation.
12179,Carly Fiorina (R candidate during 2016) would have made a pretty good president. Far better than Trump or Hillary.
12180,"We shouldn't.

But if any of you think we should, [let's get our first female president!](https://jo20.com) I'm with her!"
12181,"I don’t think people should but I think the reasoning behind it is breaking the precedent of what a leader has to be. Historically, many have been of royal lineage, high finances, high status, masculine or the people desired a male has power, not a minority, etc. That’s not even touching personality and life experiences. A leader should be a good leader and that’s all anybody really needs but it can be harder to get those when the precedent for the pickings are slim. That being said, people definitely shouldn’t vote just because of someone’s genetic traits."
12182,"We shouldn’t, but that’s not what people who are complaining about the fact we’ve never had a female president/ we’ve had very few minority presidents are saying. They are saying that ‘hm maybe out of the 45 male presidents a female president would of done that country better, it’s terrible that they didn’t win the election’

Also, assuming you are talking about America, people think both of the presidential candidates have a mental illness. So if it’s really about their ideas and content if their character why the hell are they the two options? Both are racist rapist."
12183,Yeah really anybody would have been
12184,We shouldn't
12185,We shouldn't. We should vote for someone we truly believe will improve the country
12186,"i couldn’t give a shit about gender, if they make good points as to what they want to do if they’re in power, i’ll vote for them."
12187,Yeah comparing her to Hillary is an insult to Jo Jorgensen
12188,But also- while its not guaranteed- it is prolly more likely that a POC candidate is more likely to better represent POCs
12189,I thought you said policies matter?
12190,"Hell yeah. I would say it's gonna be me but I'm really hoping that by the time I'm old enough to run for office, we'll already have had our first female president"
12191,"Vote JoJo 2020. She’s the best candidate. Fuck the democrats, fuck the republicans, third party gang rise up"
12192,"Yeah I agree. The people saying that kind of thing are usually just talking about how it's nearly always white men in power, it doesn't mean they would vote for someone just because they are a women or a minority."
12193,"thats exactly what happened in Chicago with the Mayor. democrats voted for Lori Lightfoot bc she is black and lesbian, and she used those facts to her advantage a part of her campaign to become mayor. but in reality Chicago is now one of the only big cities that has not taken steps to defund the police. Lori lightfoot has historically been very pro-police and she continues to funnel money to the CPD, so yes, identity is a factor, but it should not be a deciding factor in voting. policies are way more important."
12194,It isn't so much about voting for a woman or a minority. It's more about pointing out systemic issues that make politicians biased towards certain demographic.
12195,Don’t you dare fucking compare to Hillary I stg.
12196,"Here in India we had a woman Prime Minister.

You'd think she'd be great for women and all yeah?

Nope

She declared Emergency, put half the Opposition in jail, forcefully sterilized young men and tapped a tonne of phones."
12197,Yes exactly I vote for whoever's best but I think there is discrimination present which people want to try and break which is why they say such things
12198,Yep exactly.  Like I see so many conservative and libertarians on here voicing support for Jo Jo and she’s a female libertarian.  They don’t give a shit about her gender they just think she’s fucking awesome.
12199,"Yes /s 
Vote jo Jorgensen"
12200,JO FOR PRESIDENT
12201,"Well I hope you become the President too!

And support India when that happens."
12202,Democrats are too stuck up on identity. Like Hillary Clinton being a woman or Beto O'Rourke speaking Spanish.
12203,"Well shit. From what I have studied and know about, generally people will best represent their own groups (Example: An old white guy will prolly best represent old white guys who share similar beliefs with him even thought he might represent other old white guys or others who share those beliefs or, there’s the seemingly unlikely chance the he wouldn’t represent any of the groups or people he aligns with) tbh idk. I could be wrong. I could be right (at least most of the time as I mentioned (“While it’s not guaranteed”))"
12204,It’s like you read nothing I wrote
12205,"This - - one of Hillary's main selling points to everyone was that she is a woman

Nobody should care if you're a man or a woman, just do your job!"
12206,I read ‘lore’ as ‘vore’ then and my heart stopped
12207,"I did! I still listen to creepypastas cuz they are just goos horror storys but im not really in the fandom anymore with jeff the killer , laughing jack and stuff"
12208,"I had a creepypasta phase, but I didn't really enjoy the one's with characters like Jeff the Killer or Slenderman. My favorite from back then was probably Russian Sleep Experiment. My creepypasta phase was also only a few years ago, around 2016-2017. I didn't really have something like a phone to be able to read them on until I was a bit older, which is why I missed the original wave of popularity."
12209,😏
12210,Damn yes! 2015-2017!
12211,"Me too, I mainly listen to the rituals because it helps me sleep and I'm obsessed with the occult Haha."
12212,"Not creepypasta, but I had a middle school Nightcore phase"
12213,no
12214,You know SCPs?
12215,"Yeah in the original wave, I was a fan of the popular characters. But after the initial ""hype"" I found my spot in the ""rituals"" category, like ""11 miles"" or ""The 3 Kings Ritual"". It just always seemed more realistic."
12216,"Defently, when I was 12 I read Ben drowned x reader. That was the shit"
12217,My favorite is hands down 1999
12218,Oof sorry didn't notice how many times it posted
12219,I don’t think so
12220,That one fucking made me not sleep several days.
12221,Still wanna get into that but i kinda know what it is yes
12222,they are fun to read aren't they! i like to read them but not like everyday whenever i see one i read one.
12223,"I like creepy pastas but only because I enjoy short stories and horror.  I liked the character ones for a while, but I realized they were cringe after like a few months."
12224,I haven't read any of the popular ones but I like listening to random creepy pastas and scary stories in the background of doing things.
12225,"Oh, yep. I used to stay up until 12 am reading creepypastas and watching comic dubs on youtube. That was part of my awkward phase."
12226,"I still love creepypasta, it holds a very special place in my heart, I’m still sad the community has died for the most part, but I still love it and all the things that came out of it"
12227,"yes, and now you reminded me, im gonna go back and read more actually and regret it later because i have horrible anxiety. not becausei think its real, just because reading bad things will just put me in an anxious mood"
12228,Haha yup!
12229,Me too haha
12230,Me too girl
12231,"Yeah me too, besides the attempted murder part. The community was kind of cringy ngl tho. I still listen to creepypasta rituals because they're like peaceful"
12232,Mr. Chills? I love him haha
12233,"It is, mostly the rituals. They honestly slap"
12234,"[Urban Dictionary] ""Essentially internet horror stories or a myth passed around other sites, to frighten readers and viewers. The word, ""Creepypasta"" comes from the term, "" copypasta "". An internet slang term for a block of text that gets copied and pasted from website to website. Creepypastas are sometimes are supplemented with pictures, audio or video footage related to the story. Typically with gory, distorted or, otherwise, shocking content."""

12269,"""hello, this drink goes to all the hot fe mall lays out there.. cheers!"""
12270,Then would male be Mall Ayy or would it stay the way it is
12271,I fucking love it!
12272,I think it’d  have to change to Mall Ayy
12273,fe mall ay is the new shawty
12274,i can imagine someone saying “lets go to the mall ayy” and i’d just say “ *thats kinda gay bro* “ and make them confused for the rest of their life
12275,Would it be pronounced like fee-mall-ayy or feh-mall-ayy? I personally like the second one more.
12276,"Ikr same here, it’s just so NICE and pleasing to say it"
12277,Um
12278,I think we’d have to change it to “mall ayys” as well
12279,Second one
12280,I'd probably laugh every time I hear it
12281,I’d be like “👁👄👁”
12282,I would be confused.
12283,I'd feel goddamn empowered
12284,I actually like the sound of that
12285,"I invented that like three years ago lol, now you must give credit where credit is due. Every time you say ""female (fee-mall-ay)"" you must whisper ""*credit to WolvesAndDucksII on reddit*"" immediately after"
12286,I would adore it
12287,What if you were to pronounce shackles the same way you pronounce heracles?
12288,males and fe mall lays 🥵
12289,"My old teacher told us a story about some friends that she had. They had a baby girl and didn’t have a name for it, so female was written down on the tag or whatever.

12298,i honestly don’t get how they think i’m meant to react to that. it be the really cute boy as well and i’m like “ bro i was rooting for you”
12299,"Yea I agree with you on both of those. Those “i like girls who like girls” tiktoks are super gross. It also kinda gets on my nerves that people made a dance to the song that goes “she like boys and girls oh well that’s ok with me”, because it was originally used as a coming out song for bi people and now you have no idea if they’re just dancing to it or they’re coming out with it. Also I hate it when guys refer to women and girls as “females” as if we’re some sort of exotic species."

12313,"Steve Harvey is a comedian but I think nowadays most people know him as a presenter, he’s the guy does family feud and wrongly announced the winner of miss universe (or some other pageant, I can’t remember it just the memes really). On his show, he basically said that no women want asian men. I think Aba and Preach made a video about it, that’s where I know it from."
12314,Tbh I’d still be kind of flattered that someone is sub-consciously attracted to me.
12315,"When people say stuff like ""I'm triggered"" when they get mildly annoyed"
12316,That is pretty creepy
12317,"i hate when people tell me ""if you loved me than do xyz"" like... what? its so fucking braindead like..."
12318,"Saying things like ""that is so gay"" like they are just replacing a bad word with the word gay, and gay isn't bad. ""but they don't mean it in a bad way"" pfft as if"
12319,I say female when I want to mean my friends who are girls. So I say female friend instead of girl friend to avoid confusion. Is that ok?

12366,"I second, third, and fourth this"
12367,"Listen, even if they're messaging a whole bunch at once I'm at least slowing them down and filling up a slot they might be using on someone else. Same with the scam callers, but more efficient. I as one person am tying down one of theirs for as long as I can. I'm stopping them from calling another 900 numbers in the time that that call took"
12368,Hate it all like nothing
12369,"Yeah, I've heard that quite a few times. Don't be afraid to reach out to a friend if you're struggling or just need some attention. Don't go to some weird guy on the internet.

12376,Lmao
12377,...*hey*
12378,Fair enough but that only really applies to the scam callers. Pedos can switch in between DMs as fast as anyone else could and can just add more slots. It’s not like there’s a limit and that they can’t just delete DMs they can’t use anymore.

She has horrible arguing habits and has a lot of trouble forgiving people, which I can't blame her for, she has never seen it in her life. She has at this point no self confidence and a lot of trouble making it through the day. She doesn't work with her therapist because she is scared that she's going to be put in an asylum or something of the sort.

12404,i actually dont think ive ever called anyone miss/mrs or mr. it’s not normal in norway.
12405,Yeah I don’t like calling adults bu their first name. Sometimes I call my dad by his first name but it’s as a joke
12406,Nope it’s completely normal where I live. The only people you address with mrs/mr are teachers.
12407,i call all my friends parents by their first names and have good relationships with all of them. they’re like family. in one case i’m more friends with his mom than him because we drifted apart
12408,"Depends, I’ve always known some adults by their first name or a nickname so I’ll always call them and it feels weird to me to say Miss/Mrs/Mr so I don’t, besides, they’d look at me funny if I suddenly started doing that, but there’s a lot of adults I will probably never call by their first names"
12409,"I was just thinking that, and then I saw you're Israeli too. It would feel weird to call anyone by something other than their first name, especially if it's someone you interact with on a regular basis like teachers."
12410,What if you say Mrs [first name]
12411,Aayyy mein bhi hindustani hoon lekin mera hindi bohath bura hai haha.
12412,Oh my god my dad would kill me lol
12413,modmail. there's supposed to be a link that automatically gives you a template to ask for what flair you want.
12414,"I'd still feel weird doing that, there's only one adult who I say that to and that's just because her last name was too hard for me to say when I was little"
12415,Hehe kaha pr rehte ho Hindustan mein?
12416,[deleted]
12417,Could also be just not being used to it. Not being used to anything is normal to feel uneasy or uncomfortable anyway so I wouldn't worry about it really OP

12419,didn’t even have to read ur name to know ur aussie
12420,a potential reason could be if the guys you're around are assholes. you may be used to crappy behaviour from some guys that your brain associates it with more than just them
12421,"Normal. Some feel more friendly around guys(and have more male friends than female ones), like me. And some feel more comfortable around girls. If u really want to, u can start by just talking to a classmate and just start chatting with a group of friends (that includes guys)"
12422,Maybe you just struggle to relate to them. Thats something I struggle a lot with and it makes me feel really uncomfortable and awkward around them.
12423,"Probably this. I used to be reslly akward and stressed around girls, but as I started talking to more and more girls it became natural. Now I got a gf and one of the best friends I ever."
12424,Whoops sorry I thought it was in a thread
12425,[removed]
12426,"Probably haven’t been around them and talked to them enough. That’s probably why I’m the same why. Funnily enough, I feel more comfortable around girls, but I like being around guys more, despite my nervousness. But yeah once you’re around them a lot, you don’t get as nervous. I’m not speaking from experience, just speaking from what I’ve heard and making logical conclusions lol"
12427,99% sure
12428,"It took me a while to get used to guys, which was probably in part that my dad was never around so it was always just me, my mom and sisters. Even just talking to them online can help. Eventually I was able to talk to the opposite gender without wanting to die inside"
12429,just the way they mess around and tease each other. I find it a bit off putting.

12435,"Could also just mean that she's an Asian Australian, they're really common. Mostly saying that because Oceania is a more commonly used word for the same region."
12436,"By uncomfortable, do you mean nervous, or unsafe? Because they could mean different things ig? If you have a bad history with men, that's very understandable. If a lot of men lack a proper amount of respect for you, that could be it. For me, I've always felt awkward around men because of not only feelings of like ""oh he's a boy that's attractive"" but also because I'd never really talked to guys until this year. Can be a lot of things."

12447,"The only mature answer in here. Lmao

Everyone in here is all ""same punishment as an actual rapist"", but like... Accusing someone & ACTUALLY doing it are two very different things. Both scummy, but different."
12448,"But how long ya think?

I think around the same time somone would get for actual rape."
12449,I  disagree they should get the same if not more people be ruining lives just because they got pissed off tf
12450,both can and do ruin lives lol
12451,They should get the same punishment as the person would get if they actually raped the person.
12452,"Yes, maybe not as long as someone who actually did rape but they should have punishment"
12453,"But in differing ways, to be fair."
12454,People who were actually raped might be scared to come forward because they don't want to be jailed if they lose the case
12455,"reducing rape to ""poking your dick with someone"" is entirely ignoring all of the psychological consequences. No, it isn't just ""poking your dick with someone"""
12456,"I'm sorry you had too go through that man, I can't begin to imagine how much that would suck"
12457,Downplaying rape victims was not the way to go man 😬
12458,"People's entire lives and futures have been ruined by false rape accusations. Yes, it is nowhere near as bad as actual rape, but you're downplaying the impact of false accusations."
12459,"If you get away with false rape allegations your not just sending the person to jail but your ruining their life forever 

No jobs cause no one wants to hire a rapist no social life no one wants to be friends with a rapist these two factors alone can very easily run someone down to depression and then their is very little help for them since a majority of people think well they raped someone they deserve it

And all this why because someone wasn’t happy because their bf/gf broke up with them"
12460,"I think it should be same with any false crime accusations, get charged with a misdemeanor and potentially go to prison for a year and have to pay a $5,000 fine. At least in Washington State."
12461,Punishing them is risky because it could further worsen the mental state of people who were actually raped
12462,Take the sentence that would've been given to the accused and give it to the accuser
12463,this is very reductionist and equating the impacts as any where near equivalent is quite honestly insulting and disgusting
12464,Good point actually.
12465,"It’s already illegal to falsely accuse people, I don’t know why Redditors say otherwise. They should get jail time, but not as much as a rapist because falsely accusing someone isn’t a violent crime and it can’t cause unwanted pregnancies, spread of STDs, and so on"
12466,"Yeah, true. There'd have to be a ""beyond reasonable doubt"" clause to mitigate this, because the only thing that would suck more than being raped would be being raped and then jailed for it."
12467,"Even though I agree with your sentiment, I am disgusted by your reducing rape to “poking your dick with someone.” You are seriously trivalizing rape here, as if it doesn’t ruin the victim’s too."
12468,It's only better than rape physically. Emotionally they're equally devastating.
12469,[deleted]
12470,"im talking about the consequences of said action. Yes that is the definition, however when you entirely reduce it to that you're ignoring it's affects. When that's all you say it sounds like you're downplaying it. let's say i say false rape accusations are simply telling a lie. i mean that's technically true but wouldn't you still say im being reductionist? im ignoring all of the affects of this action and purely distilling it to the action itself which is mostly irrelevant."
12471,i would easily take 20 years in prison over the sheer psychological torture i go through every day. but my case is a relatively average one whereas 20 years for a false accusation is not nearly as common.
12472,"I like the poetic justice of this, but I don't think it's practical or just. As bad as false accusations are, they're not as bad as *actually* raping someone. They should be charged with some jail time and put on a registry imo."
12473,[deleted]
12474,"a false accusation as you define, also doesn't necessarily include the affects you listed, these affects can vary in severity as well. my point is that on average the affects of rape beyond the literal definition are significantly worse and you can never understand that."
12475,"The thing that would worry me about false rape accusations is an unfortunately small amount of rape cases are actually proven, so what’s going to separate innocent, real rape victims who lost their cases from fake victims? There’s not a consistent enough way to tell the liars from the truthers.

That’s what makes this really tricky for me, because I don’t want rape victims to be wrongfully punished but I also dont want fake rape accusators to make people take rape accusations less seriously

Edit: I find it weird that you guys are calling for 20+ year sentences when rapists rarely even get a sentence in the double digits"

12480,"Yeah ikr. There are some memories when i was a kid and i was like ""i'm gonna remember it and i still do"" 😂😂"
12481,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse had some bopping tunes!
12482,Red hands was and is still my fav memory. I always used to be a winner in that game :”)
12483,"yeah dude just remember a kid hit his head so hard his entire forehead is swollen, he's fine after some ice"
12484,"You'll have memory of getting braces your whole life.

As for me yes. I remember some silly stuff. Like ringing people's doorbells and running away."
12485,Yes.  Now Cartoon Network is all Teen Titans Go.

12493,"Dude, literally everyone in my class had a fucking crush on Raven. Raven has a huge impact on people's childhood. Period."
12494,"Tt mate. The new one sucks, the old one was WAAAAY better"
12495,I remember a few specific memories that are in no way memorable. Like one i was walking down the hallway in 6th grade and i specifically remember the way the reflection of the lights looked on the floor.
12496,Oh yea for sure. My earliest memory was from when I was like 4 maybe? I was on my moms lap and she was rocking me to sleep 😌
12497,"Although they look like good memories now, but really, being a kid sucked. Teenage years are way better cause you have almost the same responsibilities/worries as a kid but more freedom"
12498,"yeah and a lot of them, like they are so random but I somehow remember"
12499,"I get them but they tend to be shit.

The good stuff just doesn’t stick that well for me I guess"
12500,"i am the same way!! i remember things from when i was younger and they make me so happy though they aren’t significant memories, they are still awesome :3"

12506,At the end of a scuba dive we were floating at the surface waiting for our boat to pick us up when a fucking enormous cargo ship turns straight towards us and drives at us at alarming speed. We had to dive down (which was not easy since we were all low on air) and avoid the ship by waiting under it. Could've been torn apart by the propellers
12507,i almost didn’t turn in my AP English Language and Composition test in time
12508,"When I was young I used to head off to the book sections of stores by myself when shopping with my mom. One time late night at Walmart there was a sketchy ass dude eyeing me pretending to flip through books. He even picked up kids books lol. And was hovering around me so I decided to leave the aisle and then he followed me. 

I was pretty much half running through the store and this dude was chasing me. I eventually ran up to a woman and told her that some dude was following me and that made him back off. Super strange haha."

12511,"We went with my friends to explore a mountain near my friend's house. Nothing happend tho, I was just terrified because it was midnight"

12513,No 💜
12514,"I’m fine now, but I still see hallucinations every now and then. Messed me up for a good day but everything went back to normal for the most part."
12515,"Once when I was spending the night at a friend’s house with maybe 7 or 8 others, he had the main house, and then a disconnected area that had the garage, which was huge, and a door to outside that lead to a staircase which rounded a corner before going into what they called “the upstairs”. The door at the bottom of the stairs was the only entrance/exit and there was no door connecting the upstairs to the garage or the actual house, which was maybe a 10, 15 second walk at a brisk pace. The house was designed for social gatherings. We were the only ones in the upstairs and we’d left the garage open. This was at maybe 2 in the morning. The breaker for the upstairs is in the garage, which makes me think that we might’ve avoided this entire thing by shutting the garage. Anyway, soon after the power goes out, one of my friends, I’ll call him Alex, starts walking down the stairs to get the power back on. The rest of us start to joke around just waiting for him to switch the power back on when he comes sprinting back up the stairs saying he just heard the doorknob begin to turn. Now, my friend has an electric lock. I don’t know how those work, so I’m not sure if it used an external power source and he forgot to lock it, or it went out with the rest of the house, but the guy who loved there, let’s say his name’s Jacob, swore he locked the door. We here the door slowly creak open and Alex and I decide that we’re just gonna peak around the corner to see what’s going on. We heard the door close and my heart sank as Alex let out a soft, “Oh shit,” and turned and booked it to the furthest room from the staircase. The guy heard this, because of course he did, and started sprinting up the stairs. At the sight and sound of this, everyone else starts panicking. Some ran for the back part of the upstairs, some just tried to hide in that first room the stairs led into, and a couple just froze. The back part of the upstairs was so popular for two reasons. First, it’s the furthest from whoever’s coming at us, and second, this is in rural Arkansas, where every house has a pistol, a shotgun, a hunting rifle, and a set of knives to compliment the collection. The shotgun and rifle were in a safe in Jacob’s parents’ closet, but there were some hunting knives, a couple throwing knives, a revolver, and, I shit you not, three different types of axes. I won’t pretend to know what kind. Now, at this point, the guy turns the first corner and, somehow, despite how dark it was, I swear to god I saw his face contort with glee as he saw me. If I didn’t see it, I imagined it, but I swear I saw it. His face and the big butcher’s knife in his hand are the only parts of him I remember. That was all it took for me to take off and try to get as far as I could from this son of a bitch. In this situation, once we realized that we weren’t invincible, that bad things can happen to anybody and we were just unlucky enough for this to happen to us, we stopped thinking rationally. I’m faster than all the other guys, and I can’t say I’m proud of it, but I went for the revolver, not so I could attack the guy, but because there was this little space I could get into behind one of the beds where a person could literally be on top of you and if you didn’t move and they didn’t know you were there, they wouldn’t notice you and this was in the dark. I’d decided that if there was someone already there, I’d shoot em and go in there myself. There wasn’t. Once I was there, anyone who came close, I’d shoot em. Nobody did. I think somebody who reacted quickly got the attention of the guys who froze, because the guy ran right past the main room and towards the back room. I saw him enter the room and shot at him wildly. By some miracle I hit him instead of one of the other guys because, despite having used a gun plenty of times before, I was shaking so much that I’m surprised I even shot it in the direction I meant to. I heard the guy cry out and I shot wildly again. This time I hadn’t hit anything, but I’d done enough to scare him off. He ran back down the stairs and didn’t shut the door after he ran out of it. Nobody slept that night and we tried to joke around a little bit, but it didn’t really work. We all sat back in the main room. Nobody went and shut the door and nobody turned the power back on until about an hour after the sun came up. I think even as scared as we were, the hatred and fear we felt towards this man who’d been in the same place as us for all of maybe a minute I think drove us to almost want him to come back, if not just to kill him. He didn’t come back, and when Jacob’s mom cooked us waffles for breakfast, some of us ate, some of us didn’t, but nobody really said anything. I think Jacob’s parents chalked the gunshots up to late night hunters. That or they’re way too deep of sleepers. I assume Jacob told his parents about it eventually, cause when I went back the next year. And yes, his house is awesome, I did go back the next year. They had installed security cameras all over and had installed multiple locks on all the doors leading to outside the house. I have no idea whether or not they caught the guy. I’m sure it’s not the same as almost being raped and murdered, but I believe it comes close. If you read all the way, thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

TL;DR: spent the night at my friend’s house, shot a home invader."

Demiromantic is also one you might one to check out which is just demisexuality except for romantic feelings.

Kindness and humor are the most important to me. I like someone I can laugh with and make inside jokes, but also someone who is kind and respects me.

12725,"“Be tough” when I was crying when my sister attempted suicide. A 13 year old being told not to cry while its happening. 

It was such a normal day. Just chilling, doing homework when my parents start screaming. My sister downed a whole thing of pills. (Lucky she isn’t that bright and it wasn’t enough to kill her, but it could still cause some damage). Ambulance came, I was crying in another room, and my dad came in to tell me to “stay strong for everyone else.” Shittest advice ever, but I have a lot of trouble letting go of that. It wasn’t even that long ago, but I still suppress most of my emotions. Anyways, my sisters abusive ex and boyfriend showed up because they were partially the reason and she wouldn’t go to the hospital without them. It was such a weird feeling when they all left. It was utter chaos, most people crying and EMTs asking a million questions, but when they all left for the hospital, I felt more alone than I ever have. Like a hurricane just swept up my family and took them away in an ambulance. And I was left behind to cry by myself at midnight. 

She ended up ok, but had to spend a while in the hospital and in a mental hospital. One good thing did come out of this, and it’s that me and my brother got closer. He’s been away most of my life and, with my parents at the mental hospital most of the time, he now had to take care of me every day. We got pizza and watched tv shows. We never got that close, even in the couple years he was home. But we did in those couple weeks. It was nice. We got so close he even helped me come out as bi (he’s gay so I figured he would know how too come out). I think the sadness of my sister trying to off herself is balanced by getting so close with my brother, and it helped her get diagnosed with bipolar. so I’m weirdly happy it happened. Life would’ve been a lot worse if it didn’t.

Super sorry for the rant, haven’t really talked about to anymore but reddit is pretty anonymous so it’s fine here"

i really thought i was funny back then"
12776,That's good to hear👍

12779,It was supposed to be a funny but I guess I didn't pull it off right. Oh well.
12780,That feeling is so hard because on the one hand I want to protect her but on the other hand I know that there is no way I would be competent enough to protect her.
12781,"I really don't care how a guy looks, tbh. 

To tell you the truth, change your physique because you want to look better for yourself. Not because you want to make yourself more attractive to girls. Be healthy. That's all that matters. Be happy with yourself.

12798,Well shit. I'm tall too so there's that
12799,I think it's very attractive and cute!! There is a boy in my class who has that body type and it's really attractive to me.

12811,Ask her to motor boat you
12812,I had boobs since elementary school 😐😔
12813,i dig the username
12814,now this is the answer
12815,The council of 16m's have decided
12816,"Let her know that you don't care about her body shape (in a nice way), and that she's still (presumably) 14, so she shouldn't be worried about it.

She's still 14 and has a few years of growth ahead of her, but even if she doesn't have big boobs in the end, it doesn't matter."
12817,No other answer is correct

12823,nah he just likes water too much
12824,"18 never got much boobs, personally there will be days I feel good and days I feel like shit. IF she doesn’t grow anymore by 18, just keep reminding her how much you love her and how beautiful she is. Ik I used to get a lot of shit for being more on the small size(it’s stupid there’s not much that can help), but eventually ppl just stop making fun of stuff like that. Hope things get better!"
12825,Hold on lemme see........ Yeah I agree let's do it.
12826,"If telling her isn’t enough, depending on how physical you get, maybe give her boobs some extra attention? Like make it clear you really like them without outright just telling her. Some girls hear that and just think you’re trying to reassure them and that it’s not true. Could help to compliment them non verbally. Of course if you aren’t sexually at that level yet bc *cough* 14 *cough* then this advice was useless so sorry about that."
12827,"Your poor poor future gf..

Oh wait..
If you act like such a dick you won't get one 😂"
12828,Piss off.
12829,Tell her you like her boobs I guess and that she’s 14 so they’ll probably grow in and you’ll still like her boobs then

12833,Buying a new bra can be torture especially if you don't know you're size
12834,"I turned 16 last week and forgot to update my flair and this reminded me. As a fellow 16m, I concur."
12835,"I think compliments, if you say it doesnt matters it might sound wrong to her, and if shes same age as you she got time..."
12836,"For general rough situations, just be there for them. Consider how they may be feeling more than you normally would. Offer to talk to them, if they say no, remind them that you're there for them any time they need you.

Im very sorry your daughter had to go through that. It's very good that she came forward about it. My friend was sexually assaulted and she told me and a few of her other close friends, and we found that physically being with her helped to ease her anxiety. Taking a pregnancy test is definitely a good idea, and possibly one on one therapy as well.

^(ngl it felt like heart stopped when I read that. yeezus)"
12837,I think just them being there for me and helping. Plus understanding if I’m down or want some time alone. I’m sorry to hear that this happened 😢
12838,Okay well first of all send her to therapy. And check if she’s pregnant so if she’s not she can stop worrying abt it
12839,"Get her therapy, I’d only talk about it when she brings it up."
12840,"i would want my parents would not ask questions and blame me, and i would want them to just listen and offer to take me to a professional. tell your daughter you love her and that you will always support her."
12841,"This covers a lot of what I have to say
there will be PTSD and always make sure that you check in with her even if she attempts to push you away please please please don't let her do that.
Take her out and spend time with her and help her the best you can"
12842,"Please make sure that she knows you're there for her and try to support her in any way you can, emotionally and mentally. And please give her a hug from me."
12843,"Side note cause I forgot to comment: is this still recent? It might be a good idea to go to a hospital to get a rape kit done and get her some plan B. If it’s very new then whatever you do, don’t have her take a shower yet. It can wash away a lot of dna if she does choose to go to the police."
12844,"Go get her some plan B ASAP! As for talking to her you have to word this very carefully. Don’t get into how it’s a life lesson or learning experience because it’s not. Rape is never the victims fault and never, ever, excusable no matter who it is. Tell her you love her no matter what and ask her if she want to press charges. Please just don’t lash out or tell her what you think she should have or should do. This is a very sensitive situation and it’s best to get her into therapy and be gentle and thoughtful whenever you talk to her."
12845,She said it was about 20- 21 days ago
12846,"I’m so sorry this happened to her. It’s truly terrible she was hurt like this. I’m not sure if it’s too long for a rape kit but whatever she decides to do, be there for her, many rape victims don’t report it because they are scared of their attacker or scared that no one will believe them. Be there and keep checking up on her you are already doing so great by believing her and actively trying to find ways to help her."
12847,"Well, I don't have an answer to your question as it pertains to being raped, because I haven't been, and it's not my place, but I can give you some legal advice, get a lawyer now, get it now, tell the lawyer that your daughter has been sexually assaulted and raped (they go together most of the time), go to the police department and tell the police,  then while you are out get a pregnancy test if it was somewhat recent (span of a week or so), go to the hospital get a rape kit done, this will be the hardest part for her, and for you so far (I would assume),  getting this piece of worthless garbage thrown into prison will take a lot of perseverance and a lot of tears, but it is worth it.  Tell her not to tell anyone else, other than who is necessary (police, you, hospital people, lawyer), it could possibly jeopardize the case you have.

Its not her fault, its not what she was wearing, its not where she was, some shitty shitty shitty shitty excuse of a human being did this to her because they were planning on doing it to someone (reaffirm all of these things), do not force her to go to school for a bit, the school will understand the stress and anxiety she is having.  Be supportive tell her you love her and that your love will never falter and it is not her fault, if her stress and anxiety don't seem to get better in the coming weeks or months get a therapist, they will help a ton.

**Get him thrown behind bars to rot, and remember they don't like child rapists in there...**

&#x200B;

Edit: I read the comments and I noticed it was 21 days ago, still go to the police and tell them,  and if you are afraid the piece of garbage will attack her, ask her not to leave the house with anyone but her trusted friends that you know, or you, or your SO, if you are worried about the piece of shit breaking into your home, get a tool so you can dispatch of them if necessary."
12848,"Sometimes space can be good and bad, but after so much space is there, there is no getting that room back. 
Giving her space and getting pushed away is different."
12849,"It was hard to not believe her, she was super jumpy, was doing, or not doing certain things. And when she told me it was after she had a panic attack. I don't want to constantly worry but I do."
12850,"Professional help. Support in everything. 

Listen to your kids, give them something to rely on. If they feel alone, its all getting worse."
12851,"1. Tell her you can tell them if it’s necessary and/or tell one of them and they can relay the information 

2. Abortion is an option 

3. Tell her when she tells your parents, she can get professional help

I’m not the best person for this, but these are the first things that came to my mind"
12852,Plan B only helps within the first 3 days of unprotected sex after that it’s effects decrease by a lot. A good suggestion though and doesn’t hurt to try just speaking from experience
12853,"I think to be here with me is really important, in this situation I definitely don't want to be alone, I would hope someone would understand how I feel, I would need a shoulder to cry on 

also I highly suggest seeking for professional help, extreme anxiety with experience of being rape is a really horrible situation 

hope your daughter can walk out this situation one day and hope you can success being a awesome dad"
12854,"Nope, when shes pushing you away means she needs space, give her her space and privacy and don't force-talk"
12855,"Best thing you can do is to emotionally support your daughter and if need be, while I hate having to say this because I wish no one would ever have to experience this, make sure she isn’t pregnant. Last thing you want is for her to suffer because someone attacked her. File a police report and hope the person is caught and goes through due process of law. And again support her, tell her you love her, and show that she has a support system of family and friends that care for her deeply(maybe even ask her if it’s ok to tell other family members if you haven’t already and have them show their support which again adds to the support system). 

Another thing is professional help will obviously help but don’t force her to go to one if she may not want it(based off the fact you said she has anxiety which means if it’s hard to open up to others maybe talking to a stranger will do more harm than good)"
12856,"After I called the suicide prevention hotline, my mother was the first one to barge into my room and make sure I was okay. I was, I’d been talked down by the operator and had decided to get some sleep after telling them my sister’s number for them to contact. Didn’t even think about how it would look to my sister when she tried to call me and getting no answer after getting a call from the suicide prevention hotline saying I’d called them previously. They were terrified and that struck a chord in me, to see my family surround me like that in unfettered love and concern. 

My mom started talks about a therapist after that, and gave me some names in passing conversation. Unfortunately, nothing ever came of it and, in all honesty, haven’t felt the desire to search out help on my own. 

It’s been two years and I feel like the entire event has been forgotten. That it was inconsequential and my mental health was something that was expected to just be something I grew out of. 
It’s not.

Don’t let this fall by the wayside. Make sure your daughter knows you care and are concerned and always willing to help. You have to take those steps first and make things as easy as possible for her to get help. I can’t imagine what she’s going through but I imagine it’s not going to be easy to continue moving forward for the either of you and I wish you both the best of luck ❤️"
12857,"You already are doing something right because she actually trusts you to tell you what happened. I won't even tell my parents how I'm feeling in a general sense because I just am not comfortable with them like that, and if she is able to tell you something this serious than she must trust you. You should just be very compassionate and understanding, take it easy on her obviously and give her time to work through her thoughts and no matter what get her therapy and see about getting who ever did this in jail."
12858,"get her therapy, don’t force her to talk to you about it"
12859,"the first comment was great, also when she is honest like says she feels unsafe or having lots of anxiety def take her out of the situation, if she goes out always pick her up when she asks (could get her out of an anxiety driven situation)"
12860,Im happy and proud of you. What you went trough was probably really hard. Cant imagine what it feels like. Im glad you could get trough it❤❤

12898,Not with that attitude!
12899,Get offended and hurt because that is super sexist
12900,The only acceptable response.
12901,Gets me more mad because most people think they are trying to be funny
12902,This
12903,"just say it, Thats a power move"
12904,"Such a statement devalues ones emotions - you're not *allowed* to be angry about something, it's not feasable. Whoever says it to you is passing judgement, telling you that you're overreacting. Invalidating your feelings. That there must be some outside source (aka the period) that's causing this outburst of emotions. They're telling you you're being illogical. It's dismissive, and an asshole move."
12905,"Yes, periods cause insane hormones and mood swings"
12906,Serious question because obviously I've never had a period. Is that really a reasonable excuse to be mad?
12907,I’ll get even more mad. The person that says that should really stfu.
12908,“Do you have a stick up your ass” is one I’ve heard which was pretty thought provoking.
12909,*slaps ass*
12910,"If I yell at them for asking that then it's a yes. If I say no its ""are you sure?"" It's like the only logical reason I might be mad is bc I'm on my period. Asking that question is one of the most insulting things women could be asked. Plus it just makes me madder."
12911,"Bro calm down, are you on your period or something?"
12912,[removed]
12913,Idk. I've never had any noticable mood swings but I've noticed other guys have it. I guess it's just a strange concept since I've never experienced it first hand.
12914,"If I'm in a bad mood and everything hurts "" I will kill you"" if I'm in just a bad mood"" I will punch you"""
12915,I don’t either. Most times I’m not on my period and people say it to me. 😑
12916,yeah bc dismissing a woman’s anger/sadness/etc in general as her being on her period is totally not devaluing her emotions due to her sex
12917,I don't like that they assume it and I get mad
12918,“What the fuck”
12919,Agreed
12920,No one has ever said that to me lol. I dont get mad on my period (atleast more mad than usual)
12921,It is annoying because to me it is them blaming your bad attitude on your womanhood.
12922,I’ve never had anyone say that to me but I’d be super pissed if they did
12923,"Even more angry, bc it feels like my emotions arent *mine*. God forbid Im mad bc smth actually happened."

12940,Yeah but like we're just random ppl idk don't want it to feel like we're dragging on
12941,Nah
12942,"Not sure if there is much to discuss about a subreddit. As for unrelated stuff, it could work. You could start by making a survey or getting people to submit an application with their information like availability and all that jazz. 
     Since you're a teenager, I assume you aren't very proficient in hosting podcasts, or being interesting on recording, so I suggest you have quite a lot of fan interaction and engagement. I think us as adolescent people would really benefit from that, as well as your podcast.
     Overall, it sounds like a neat idea that could be great if executed correctly, and I would love to see it.

Side note: depending on the number of applications, you should consider relinquishing role as host to two people a little older. like 16 or 17, but it's your project, so it's whatever you wanna do.

Extra side note: it's interesting to see that the ATG post got twice the amount of responses than ATB despite having a smaller community."
12943,"yeah really, there’s nothing really exciting. Also ‘popular users’ just sounds so stupid."

They’re not, they’re just tired of us answering all of the questions on a subreddit that was made for the sole purpose of getting a female opinion. If there were more girls than boys on atb would you be mad that your comment is overshadowed by someone who wasn’t asked the question?

That’s like asking your friend what they’re doing next weekend and another person just slides over to your table and tells you what they’re doing. It’s an opinion you didn’t ask for."

ive never really had any ""necessary"" teen experiences of any kind and i hate it

12998,I read a stat somewhere that 90%+ of people who jumped off something to kill themselves regret it on the way down. This stat is based on people who survived their fall to suicide.

I have a strong work ethic and tend to spend far too much time working than having fun (it’s a huge problem).

My physical appearance is standardized to a uniform for work.

I have lots of meetings, paperwork, and certification/credentialing to constantly do.

Not saying that I’ve had a bad social life or can’t have fun, I have just never gone to parties, made a huge mistake, or anything like that. All of the “traditional” teenage experience. I still have time, so maybe I’ll do something...

13029,Homie is more male than dude. Peep sounds like I'm calling them wierd. But I love nerd. I'm going to call my girlfriend a nerd from now on.
13030,I call everyone dude
13031,"It’s all good. Where I am, some girls occasionally refer to themselves as “man” (I.e “Man’s on it” or something like that). Using the correct gender markers is cool too though lol."
13032,"Peeps. Homies, nerds, gang,"
13033,I’m not really a fan
13034,I call everyone man and people get mad at me :(
13035,This I agree with
13036,What should a person call a girl then?
13037,"Yep, boy clothes are considered super cute on girls, hell, they're not even considered really boy clothes anymore that much. A sweatshirt? That's literally neutral now, it's neither manly nor womanly. A girl ""stealing"" her boyfriend's hoodie is the epitome of cute but if he stole her skirt it would be super creep.

I just really want the same standards"
13038,i don’t really mind it much
13039,I don't mind
13040,"i dont give a SHIT. i personally overuse ""man"" though."
13041,"I don't care, it's kinda comfy actually. Say someone greets you as ""hey dude"" that's not aggressive at all, that's a really calm laid back greeting/title"
13042,I’ve been called and have called girls all of that and personally I think they’re all gender neutral
13043,"It's fine, I won't kill people over it"
13044,"I call everyone dude or even guy, my guy"
13045,"I like anime but it isnt for everyone, dont stress about it"
13046,avatar isnt an anime though
13047,Nope you're not alone. I never got into before it was all of a sudden popular and I still don't like it
13048,"Exactly my dude, its not for everyone. No one should ever feel bad for disliking something, nor liking something. Just dont be an ass yknow"
13049,"Avatar isn't a anime! It's a American Animation Show, Search it Up on google. Many people are confused with avatar being an anime..... Try Death Note's [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJZ-YgAt-c), It is so good Netflix made a live-adaption to it which was shit."
13050,"Try Death Note! Some anime's are good and some are bad, some will be drawn good others might not. Which anime did you try?"
13051,"Honestly when I watched episode one I was kinda eh because it seemed a little kiddish at first but it’s actually a really good show, once you get about 10 episodes in you’ll be hooked (just my opinion)"
13052,I've never really given it a chance
13053, Thats crazy it seems like its always talked about like its the best anime ever
13054,"Wait a minute...what if you just write ""john smith"" do all the john smith's die...because theres gotta be a lot of john smiths!"
13055,"No don’t worry, anime isn’t for everyone, everybody has different preferences."
13056,I mean 7 billion people exist
13057,The only thing sort of like that is Avatar the Last Airbender but that isn’t really anime
13058,i watched episode one of avatar and i just dont know if i keep going or not since theres so many other shows out there.
13059,No you have to think of john smiths face in our head. I have a fake death note with all the rules in it. 66-70 rules. If you watch the first episode you will know a lot about the Death Note.
13060,No clue why your comment is downvoted
13061,I'll give anime a try
13062,i love comedies! a comedy i recommend is nichijou.
13063,"Nope. I hate music. Honestly I think its overrated. Gave multiple songs a shot, and I felt like I was listening to the same thing throught all of them. Theres no appeal."
13064,"Uhmmm from what I've seen you're the toxic one dude... (Few is an understatement as well lol). You were kinda ignoring what he was saying. There are literally thousands of anime, watching 7 anime doesn't mean every single anime out there is identical and trash. Some are trash, some are high quality. He was trying to show you how dumb that your logic is. Just like there are tons of songs out there, there are tons of anime out there. Just like there are good songs out there, there are good anime out there. 

You could say you hate the artstyle or cartoons in general or smth idk

Guess I'm toxic for disagreeing with your reasoning 🤷‍♀️"
13065,"nope you're not alone.  


I don't understand the whole hype around it, I personally find it pretty boring. Tried watching a few episodes of some Anime a couple years ago and I didn't really like it"
13066,"It’s more like, nope I hate pop music. I think it’s overrated, gave multiple pop songs a shot etc"
13067,"I can't. Every one seems break the ""show don't tell"" story telling rules for visual mediums with long, winding and often inane monologues. To each their own."
13068,"If you don't like anime, try mob psycho 100 out"
13069,I don't like anime.
13070,"Nope. I hate anime. Honestly I think its overrated. Gave multiple of them a shot, and I felt like I was watching the same thing throughout all of them. Theres no appeal."
13071,i mean anime has always been popular and loved by many it’s just now socially acceptable to like it and not be ashamed of it.
13072,"Well I mean you do you but I'm just sayin' anime is a media, just like you won't say you don't like all of the American TV shows because you watched 5 episodes of a an American show and it was boring it wouldn't really make sense to do it with anime. There are shitty anime and there are good anime. If you don't like the artstyle or the voice acting (this is a common problem, like in some anime they make 16 y/o girls sound 5, and it's kinda annoying but again, not in all anime) or cartoons in general then that's fair enough, but not all anime are Eromanga Sensei lol

Sorry for writing a whole essay about that I needed to say this \^\_\^"
13073,"No it's fine. I like a bit of it, watched some mainstream ones. Mainly I use it to fill the of more young adult and adult animated content that exists in the west."
13074,No you’re not
13075,"uff He's kinda short for me, but def hot"
13076,^(my bf because I’m a hopeless romantic)
13077,"It's probably Chris Hemsworth or Stephen Amell for me.

What is yours btw?"

13079,Tom Holland. I’m not gay but I wouldn’t say no if he asked me to sleep with him. (No homo).
13080,Siren Head. Those hip bones 🥵🥵
13081,Um.... who?
13082,tbh i dont rlly find anyone physically attractive unless if i know them and love them for their character *thennn* i start finding them attractive lol
13083,"chris is gorgeous, I can def see that. Mine is Jensen Ackles, but on the first seasons of supernatural"
13084,"Alicia Vikander or Florence Pugh...... ohmuhgahd

Also my gf"
13085,"Ah, I see you're a woman of Roblox"
13086,Myself
13087,A king is nothing without confidence
13088,"Ah shit I answered mine wrong 

Also I found the winner of this post ^"
13089,Scarlet Johansson definitely
13090,"HhAHAH I also very much like Tom, but it's not bc of his looks. I physically find him very average, but then I started watching his interviews and now he's one of my many crushes lol"
13091,Hottie
13092,Henry Cavill and I’m very straight
13093,Wut a hottie
13094,I’m literally attracted to so many different types of people this is impossible. I don’t even have a type anymore i have a bunch of types. There’s no perfect 10 for me :(
13095,That height...🤤
13096,Ryan Reynolds. I ain't gay but...
13097,no homo he thicc
13098,"Thats valid, personality really does go a LONG way. There's so many ppl who I used to find average and their personality makes them hot af. But there's also ppl who I only like physically bc their personality is shit. For example, Monty from 13rw. He's gorgeous but a fucking rapist"
13099,Tom Harlock
13100,Omg Florence Pugh is gorgeous
13101,Megan Fox
13102,Captain Hook from once upon a time or Emma Watson
13103,Your boyfriend?
13104,"But I like Stephen more. He has got got more of the upper body. Plus he's the GREEN ARROW, my favourite"
13105,"You already sound like a great teacher! The students are lucky. This is why I like my favorite teacher and it might help

She always provides us with enough material and makes sure that we are able to pass smth but also isn’t disappointed if we don’t pass. She’s very cool with what we do in class and is friends with her students. Tell stories that is relevant and that they might enjoy. If ur students are having fun in class they pay more attention. Memes and slang is kinda cringe but if ur close with the students it’s fun. I fought to stay in her class this year bc Idk what I would do if I didn’t get to see her at all."
13106,"Essentially just being myself and teaching from the heart instead of being the cringey teacher who is trying to relieve their high school years. When I was 15 we had this guy in his 30s who was still obsessed with being cool to the kids and it was just embarrassing. Then I had an incredibly old Japanese woman who was a grump that taught Algebra and Geometry and everyone adored her because she was completely herself, hilarious, and her grumpiness was harmless. Deep down, she clearly loved what she did. And she could care less about memes or slang lol"
13107,"Try to be nice and understanding of them. Don't try to relate to them too much, just try and be that cool down to Earth teacher that doesn't give out too much homework and goes easy on her students"
13108,"I have piercings and tattoos so I can't judge 🤷🤷 And I wouldn't even if I didn't. I love my students who have colorful hair, different appearances etc"
13109,I am half Asain so maybe that will be me 60 years or so from now  😅😅 unless robots are teaching
13110,"Any student who puts in effort can get full credit on my assignments. I love when student do a redo and I let them take testa multiple times. Having strict grading greatly reduced learning opportunities and my goal is for all my students to understand, not for it to just be good grades for the quick learners and not everyone else."
13111,"Got it. Though with remote teaching it feels like it all homework!

I try to be stable and consistent with due dates but if a student works hard and redoes an assignment or turns one in late but clearly put in time and effort, I am not going to reduce their credit."
13112,"you nailed it! that’s exactly how you should aspire to teach :)

i wish you the best with your students!"
13113,"Make lessons short and sweet, don't drag it out for too long"
13114,"I love these questions :) the most important thing for me while doing online school is organization. Keep all your assignments in one spot, it’s very helpful to make weekly/daily agendas too. Be understanding, because technology is sometimes the worst. 

As far as being a fun/interesting class, just switch it up a lot. Doing the same slideshow note taking is boring, but doing little games or trivia or hands on stuff(maybe not possible with online) make it a lot more interesting. I love doing online games like quizlet or kahoot.

Be friendly and don’t load on too much homework, and ask your students if it’s taking them too long to finish so you should adjust.

As long as you’re friendly and help your students as much as you can I’m sure you’ll be great!"
13115,"I love Kahoot and give lots of breaks. Also, I try and make my assignments and tests as reasonable as possible. I give unlimited retakes and redo's including with one on one support because the goal is learning not being agressively strict about grading. 

I have a very silly sense of humor that some student adore and some roll their eyes at but still seem to find somewhat endearing lol"
13116,"Be careful not to be too fun. I don’t wanna be that person but every time when my school gets a new younger teacher they try to be overly fun and ‘down with the kids’ and they end up getting eaten alive and everybody is just rowdy and no work gets done.

It’s fine to be fun but make sure that it’s still a teacher-student relationship. You can be a good, kind teacher without trying to be everybody’s friend and it’s better to be a bit strict so your students pass."
13117,"Please please please dont assign more work just because kids are at home. They're already on a screen all day, and I'm sure they already have plenty of homework in other classes. If you do have to assign homework try and give them a few days. As someone who gets really frequent headaches it's hard to spend 7 hours doing schoolwork on a screen only to have to do 3 hours more. Also while it's good to encourage to unmute and turn on cameras some people get really anxious on camera (speaking from experience) and some can't turn off their camera/unmute due to their home lives. 

For making class fun try and give them little breaks (3-5 minutes) so they can get food or water, or so they can use their phones/do something else quickly. (I personally like to lay down and it actually helps me refresh my energy). Also try to crack jokes every so often, and do activities like kahoot, quizzizz, etc. Try to engage students so they dont end up on their phones or half asleep (ask about their weekends at the start of class, do icebreakers, ask questions about the content, etc.) What also helps me stay engaged is breaking content into groups. For example have videos, have notes, have games like kahoot, and have a time for students to interact and ask questions. (Basically try not to just talk all class.)

I hope this all kinda makes sense and helps ahahahha"
13118,Don't sugarcoat things and tell them your honest opinions. That's what my favorite teacher does and it makes the teacher seem way more approachable
13119,"One thing that my anatomy professor did which I feel is important to do with all students of all ages, not just college age, is check in with them. Ask them how they are feeling, how their mental health is, how confident are they in knowing the material, any struggles they have have school related or not. Often the best teachers are solaces for students that have problems at home or struggle academically. Please just let them know you care, it means so much more than you could know! Be an advocate and go above and beyond to help the students succeed because that is something they will never every forget! They may forget what you taught them, but they will never forget how you made them feel. I know I will never forget those special teachers in my life who went out of their way to help me succeed and make me feel loved when I didn't get that at home."
13120,"Be kind and understanding, and don't try too hard to be relatable. Since school is online, you should try to use websites that are more simple because complicated things are stressful. You should also make it easy for your students to contact you because communication is hard when school is online. The best and most fun website is kahoot, but you need to be live for that to work. Don't assign a crazy amount of work, but make sure the work you do assign is engaging. 

Just by asking you sound like a great teacher, and I hope this helps."
13121,Use discord
13122,Give them office hours!! I hated when my teachers just had the class then left and we only got to email them questions. In person school I was always going it before school/lunch when I needed help so it sucked when they didn’t do office hours.
13123,"I try to do as much direct interaction as possible and use mixed media. I will even let kids use cell phones for some activities, which they love lol. And have an alternative program they can use on their chromebook if they don't have phones.

Technology is most certainly the worst, getting everyone logged into a Zoom meeting then having wifi shut off and boot everyone has me pulling my hair out."
13124,"When teachers just try to be friends with the students, I believe that is a grave injustice to the institution of learning and structured support. I owe the young adult a quality education and while I always try to be kind, it is also important to be in an position of leadership and control for your class and individual students. It helps everyone"
13125,"This is great advice, I appreciate it. I have been working 60+ hour weeks trying to find much interesting and engaging material, rewriting IEPs for remote education and just trying to make it as smooth and comforting for students through such a difficult time"
13126,"It is so good of you to ask this question! I find I am much more engaged when I am asked to contribute to the conversation instead of being muted the whole time. Another thing, if a student misses a class, ask them if they're doing ok. This time is really difficult for everyone, but crazy hard for neurodivergent students."
13127,"Like everyone else said, just be nice! Kahoot is always a fun thing to do. Everyone else already pointed out most stuff, I’m sure your students are going to be super lucky to have you!"
13128,"be as straightforward as you can when teaching lessons, keep it simple! my math teacher did really well with keeping lessons short but managed to make crappy math problems a breeze.

and maybe use crash course/teded videos when you can? the narrators do a very good job of explaining ideas, and if you’re going to show another video PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING MUSIC VIDEOS. THEY DON’T HELP AT ALL. (at least for me, they just take up a chunk of class time)"
13129,Thank you ♥️ I love my job though I miss in person teaching SO MUCH
13130,"I will check it out tomorrow, thank you!"
13131,"Honestly try to minimize the amount of meetings (zoom etc) almost all of us prefer to get assignments instead (even if it means learning alone) 

Try to be flexible, have discussions in class, make sure everyone is engaged, if you're teaching subjects like math in which some students progress much faster make sure you give them something that will challenge them and keep them busy"
13132,"Got it, no Baby Shark for my high schoolers 😅😅

Seriously though, I hate wasting time, I would rather show a science experiment or share a crystal from my crystal collection to students if we were doing a break time vs playing music that most of the students will probably think is lame anyway! Short, consistent lessons are the best, with as much hands on as possible"
13133,"~~Don't label/flair things unnecessarily~~

You could start of by asking the everyone how they have been."
13134,Have some games during class every now and then (like kahoot). And if you have a pet definitely show it off I love it when my teachers show their pets.
13135,"*hem hem*

I only do that when I need to dish it back, otherwise I try to be conscious of what might annoy people"
13136,It's funny and I secretly wish they would tease me back
13137,Cyndi Lauper? Is that you?
13138,That’s what I was gonna say too 😂
13139,"i mean, i double down on my own BS. ill tell dudes i have a dick and when they try to deny it i start to unzip my pants"
13140,So you basically just want someone to double down on your BS and see how it goes?
13141,I know it’s not every girl sorry if it came across that way
13142,"I say it purely as a joke, I don't remember how it started but I've been saying it for a while. The fact that some drunk dude on Halloween said that I probably have a bigger dick than ""the rest of them"", them being a group of my friends I was with has just fortified my use of this joke.

Anyways, I've never gotten to the point of actually taking off my pants, if that's what you're asking, but  I've completely undone my pants a couple of times,  (hoodie was long enough so they couldn't see anything). Other than that, longest back and forth I've had was probably about 20-25ish minutes as we were bored and had nothing else to do in class. It was mostly just threats of taking out my supposed phat schlong and saying how long it is, which increased by about 10 feet every time.

fun times"
13143,Sometimes it might be bc they like them✨
13144,Idk maybe it’s fun. I tease my friends because it’s the way we joke around. Then again all they have to do is say “George Washington etc” and we laugh for 20 mins
13145,"Ok now I have to ask, how far has your furthest back and forth of doubling down gone exactly?

(Also, Ima be blunt with you on this, do you say you have a dick purely as a joke or because you are or maybe trans?)"
13146,Nice
13147,"Ok that all really does sound fun and honestly hilarious but WOW I didn't even expect that much. I mean seriously, what the H E double FUCK kinda Halloween party do you go to where a person (drunk or not) would ask a 14 year old girl to pull it out while gathering a group to see it?"
13148,"Agreed, all of my male friends find my reactions funny when they tease me lol"
13149,"So my friend was hosting a party for my friends and I, at some point about 5 or 6 of us got bored and walked down to the fire station to say hi. On the way there, we passed a couple of drunk dudes smoking in front of their house, I forgot exactly what was said but I know that we said hello to eachother, and on the way back to our friends house one of the drunk guys said that I probably had a bigger dick than the rest of my friends (who are all significantly taller than me). it wasn't creepy or anything, just a funny dude stating the truth, we all got a good laugh out of it, and my dick got a bit bigger"
13150,OOOOOH GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU UUN
13151,"I dunno, but I sure as hell enjoy it"
13152,I don't do it unless I'm sure the other person is comfortable with it. But if they are it's just because I find their reaction cute. I don't do it often cuz it usually happens to me :-[
13153,"That makes sense, I guess. Either way you seem fun as hell to hang out with, especially since your sense of humor seems to be more on the vulgar side which is always more entertaining."
13154,idk it’s funny sometimes and i don’t really mind it
13155,It's fun seeing them turn blood red
13156,"Thanks my dude! That's probably the nicest complicated anyone's ever given me. And yeah, I try to keep my humor vulgar so I can see the different reactions people have, gotta keep everyone on their toes, never know when someone's boutta whip out a 34 foot shmeat scepter"
13157,Honestly because we’re all sick fucks who get off on insecurity. No but sometimes it’s just to test if you actually care or not and/or we want attention possibly because we’re in a shitty mood
13158,Because it's super fun to do.
13159,"I don't do that 

It's an irritating thing for anyone to do to guys"
13160,I try to make others laugh because I dont want people to be like me. Also I joke around a lot but not about the right things
13161,"Some girls are just a different breed, man. I'm convinced the reason they have a reputation in boy culture(?) for being so confusing is that some of the ones who hang out in predominantly male groups just go out of their way to be as cryptic and incomprehensible as possible. 

I'm sure there are boys in predominantly female groups who do the same, but I wouldn't know lol."
13162,"I'm guessing they are just ""Testing the waters"" seeing what they can and can't do, see what works and what doesn't. Or it could just be fun"
13163,Because it’s fun 🤷‍♀️ I only do it to a close female friend or somebody I like
13164,"what boys, and where do I learn this magic?"
13165,"When I have a crush, yes"

13170,"Depends on how much you like them. I've had some minor crushes, where I really only thought about them when we were near each other. But then again, there is one girl I like, where even though I haven't seen her for 6 months, I still think about her a lot."

Oh my god, I just realized Í didn't only have one crush. So those were crushes, hmmm."
13179,It certainly is getting fingerlickin hot
13180,"Isn't that the truth. I constantly have to sort out my feelings for girls so I don't misinterpret them. I certainly know what physical attraction is, I certainly know what a crush is, and I know how to distinguish between the two. But love, idk about that one yet, at least I don't think I do"

But I'm pretty sure that to stop salmonella your supposed to wash the eggs, because the bacteria live on the egg shells. They get there when the hens poop out the eggs, especially when they land on shit. If you wash them you'll be fine

That's all I remember from biology class last year"

13234,you ok?

13236,Damn u monster 😭🤧
13237,I'm gonna take a fat guess and say no
13238,Takes one to destroy one
13239,"Nooooo peachy 😭!!!! I’ll miss you, hope you get ungrounded soon. That’s such a stupid reason as well!!!! 

Are you even religious or do your parents make you?"
13240,My mom used to be happy if I got anything close to 89 lmfao😭

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. Ding  A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Ding  Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, ding”"

13285,Yeah my voice is extremely high pitched and baby-like and it hurts my ego
13286,my voice in videos sounds like a 40 yr old smoker lol
13287,When I hear myself I sound like Jesus but when I hear a recording I sound like a horse with advanced tuberculosis

13295,"Bruh why u downvoted

Damn bro you flirting with everyone in this sub lmao"
13296,Lmaoo r/brandnewsentence
13297,Yes mostly because of my terrible stutter
13298,Hell fucking yes! Ah I hate hate hate my voice. And my laugh its so disgusting I feel bad for subjecting people to it. And I VC in discord all the time where people clip things I say and I have to suffer even more.
13299,Nothing wrong with that
13300,YESS. Microphones convert my voice into shit
13301,"Yeah, but that's because its pretty high pitched, and I dislike high noises."
13302,"Yes, I'm a girl. And it makes me sound a bit like 9 year old guy. No offense to them but like... I may be a bit of a tomboy but like... Idk"
13303,I hate mine sm. I sound like I’m 8 years old.
13304,"No, I like my voice"
13305,Ooooow how cute!
13306,Same tbh
13307,"Me too, I’m not sure why but I find it really cute."
13308,Yes
13309,Yeah mines deep
13310,It's ok I guess.
13311,"If my friends record me out of the blue, yes. But if it's for a school video, like a voice over, I sound good."
13312,"Yeah I do

I’ve just grown to ignore it and not cringe at it anymore tho"
13313,Yes but I’m used to it now
13314,"In real life I have a normal voice for aa teenage girl. On video, tho, I'm a little baby"
13315,"that pose song with uzi, without his feature the song is so ass"
13316,i thought it was gon be good when i went to listen on spotify omg i’m just 🤧🤧 disappointed
13317,Same I don't know why everyone makes a big deal about it. It's the typical run of the mill love song
13318,FR the only good part is like the 30 secs they use on tiktok
13319,Yeah I forget what it was but it sounded rly good and catchy but the song was terrible
13320,Bruh uzi carried Yo Gotti and Megan so hard lmao
13321,"Yeah, sugar crush sucks ass"
13322,streets by doja cat but once i listened a lot i got used to the whole song
13323,basically for every tiktok song i've ever heard
13324,Ya know what’s even worse? Being forced to listen to a tiktok with awful music and then you find out it’s from a song you really like
13325,That drivers license song
13326,The amount of records that driver's license has broke as olivia rodrigo's first real single could only be explained by disney manipulating the entertainment industry as usual.
13327,her big song from high school musical the musical was nice but just drivers license feels like a miss fs
13328,like i tried to give it a shot but fr the only part i liked was the tiktok clip
13329,I love Olivia rodrigo and some of her other songs but drivers license kinda felt meh to me
13330,I liked it a lot because there was a sense of sisterhood to it lmao. why did we all listen to it.
13331,"I don’t use TikTok but I’ve listened to some of the audios used and they sound so fire, but then when I look for the entire song they’re fucking trash like wyd!"
13332,Literally every tate mcrae song is better than that song. I don't understand why anyone thinks it's good.
13333,i like it </3
13334,It was good but I’ve seen these big emotional reactions on TikTok and that kinda confused me. I was like it’s just another song... I loved her song from HSMTMTS tho.
13335,Back in blood is fire fym
13336,it's like if 100 gecs had any melodic competency
13337,"Yeah, sometimes."
13338,"me with Papaoutai by Stromai, lol"
13339,"YRN, that treacherous song, love the tiktok bit, hate the rest"
13340,"That 21 savage and Cardi B song. Savage's part is good, but I can't listen to Cardi B."
13341,There's a song called Hometown and the first 30 seconds are so good and then it kind changes style and beat and in like :/
13342,I mean not on tiktok but yeah there's a ton of songs like that
13343,"Na, lmao. I don't really use tik tok"
13344,Stay With Me is fire though
13345,"> Wait, did u just winked at me?  

 😳"
13346,"7 inch clit

BRO what 💀😭"
13347,Well technically seeing nothing is the same as seeing darkness but to answer your question probably the theory of relativity it just hurts to try to rationalize that time goes slower for fast things
13348,Sounds like something an inexperienced erotica writer would write.
13349,Okay but wtf lmfaoo
13350,😉🤭
13351,"I feel like my brain auto shifts my vision to cover more area when 1 eye is closed so less black is visible

If that makes any sense"
13352,Or a very experienced very specialized writter
13353,I feel like I can actually kinda perceive the darkness in the closed eye when I just have one eye close.
13354,The theory of relativity is weirdly confusing and interesting to me idk

13384,"Can’t wait to watch this sub grow! I’ve been getting some great advice and some top tier memes out of this sub, can’t wait for more. Thanks so much for being an awesome moderator!"
13385,Youre all breathtaking
13386,I know right? I'm very excited!
13387,Well me too bud😭
13388,Uno reverse card!
13389,Thank you🥰🥰
13390,Don't worry! We have auto mod deleting FAQs but people find a way to word around it. If you find common wording for FAQS that are on the list don't be afraid to DM me or the mods. I need help with phrasing as well since I'm usually adding code into auto mod to delete FAQs. I can't speak for ATB though.
13391,every single one of you guys are breathtakingly amazing
13392,Yeah its all about phrasing it a certain way so that auto mod can't detect it.
13393,ayyy congrats ladies good looks
13394,And I still only get 8 comments on my posts max
13395,Congrats! Only thing I need now is a girl to talk to
13396,Thank you so much! How are you enjoying the sub?
13397,Thank you! The mod team tries to keep the subreddit  nice!
13398,it’s dope i love how it’s the perfect size where you can ask a question and expect to receive a few good and thoughtful answers. This sub and r/askteenboys are growing so fast and i feel like soon they’re both going to be flooded with a bunch of FAQs :(
13399,oooh word i see. Good looking out you do your job well
13400,Yaay! Such a nice sub by the way!
13401,Yay! I just recently joined but I've loves this sub!!!
13402,Awe thank you❤
13403,Watchu mean
13404,That's a good start 💕
13405,I know what you mean...I can’t stand how like the first person who votes on your comment often determines how everyone else after interprets your opinion
13406,i suppose that would be part of it. i appreciate your serious answer.
13407,Any time I feel like that I just stick to the more wholesome subreddits.
13408,"I don’t mean the actual subs about wholesomeness, just the milder, more laid back, and kinder subs. Usually any sub about a hobby is pretty good, for example, r/Baking"
13409,"thank god a serious answer
you are appreciated"
13410,"I think I went into reddit knowing that. I take everything with a grain of salt and _try_ not to let people get to me, some people are really hateful."
13411,"that’s another one for shitty website bingo

fr tho thanks for the serious answer you are appreciated"
13412,Tbh they are kinda forcefully positive. They ban people on r/wholesomememes just for being critical for example
13413,"I suppose the anonymity is part of any social media though, if you play it the right way"
13414,"yeah, though a lot of other social medias revolve around showing your face and what you’re doing to the world."
13415,"Then leave if you hate it? there's not many incels, or racists here, I've met genuine awesome people on here"
13416,As someone who may have deleted her account... Just better to walk away because you may come back
13417,"that is true, they do exist. i just hate the fact that so many subs are full of toxic people and it kinda makes me lose faith in our ability as a species to get anything done."
13418,"yeah, most of the hate is not directed at me, but it hurts to see people be so hateful to each other."
13419,This is why I sub to subs with a certain demographic(like r/lemmino) and not subs with a general demographic (like r/gaming)
13420,"Yeah I have. Usually I just take a couple day break and I’m good. I also just love my user name tho, so I don’t wanna delete my account"
13421,"i’m not announcing anything bud
i’m really just asking if anyone else feels the ame"
13422,and blm is something that shouldn’t be supported? or are you saying something else?
13423,honestly considering that i ain’t gonna lie.
13424,"yeah I get tired of it, but also it's a constant stream of mostly interesting  content so I feel like deleting reddit would leave me extremely bored lol"
13425,yeah i’m fr abt to delete my account. the shit i’ve seen lately... it frustrates me more than gives me any pleasure. idk why i’m still here tbh
13426,"I wanted to delete my account MANY TIMES, but alas I can’t stay away lol. But dude, this site can be enjoyable if you utilize it to your advantage. I heavily monitor my feed and what subs I’m subscribed to so I don’t have to deal with that. If there’s a troll, I downvoted and block. I don’t read comments on various posts and don’t bother arguing with ignorant people. I avoid certain subs (specifically the popular subs) for this reason as well. You have control over what you see. But yeah the overall Reddit demographic is annoying nonetheless"
13427,Yeah the hivemind is a real problem
13428,I just try my best not to venture with my lib left opinions into any american sub lol
13429,"Yes omg. I was on r/askreddit and replied to a comment, ‘hi fellow Republican on Reddit’ and got downvoted to hell

They replied ‘hello 🙂’ and got downvoted to hell

I swear it’s just liberal neckbeards on here. As long as you find the right communities it can be fun though"
13430,"Yes, there are subs filled with toxic people but there are also subs filled with helpful and supportive people (which tend to be much bigger). Also having shitty people is not an issue exclusive to Reddit"
13431,I like r/Journaling myself. Wholesome community. r/Immersivedaydreaming too
13432,"people just have no filter on here because there’s no names attached to anything. the things people say on here, they wouldn’t dare say on their twitter or facebook. so it allows everybody to be as toxic as they want"
13433,"Yeah kinda, I doubt I'll delete my account but I might uninstall for a bit, idk"
13434,"good reasoning, though there’s always youtube"
13435,"Why do you have to remind me?
A girl wanted a high-five, context doesn’t matter and I just stood there awkwardly and didn’t know what to do until she lowered her hand...the worst, I had messed up a hug the day before in the same group of people. That happened in winter and I die everytime I think about it."
13436,that's very unnatural reaction why would they do that...
13437,I walked into school early in the morning and it had been raining. The floors were slippery and I didn’t realize how bad it was. I fell forward onto the floor and there was only one person sitting in the entrance area. She proceeded to pretend like nothing happened and asked how my grandpa was doing cuz he was in the hospital at the time. While I was still on the floor. I feel like that’s way worse than saying something about how I fell lmao
13438,Fuck don't remind me

13450,So I was at the dentist and the dentist was handing me the sunglasses and I dropped them. No big deal right? Then I dropped them again. I laughed it off. She hands them to me the third time and... I drop them. I don’t know what was wrong with me that day.
13451,tell us your secrets horse girl :>
13452,"My first language is french and in french the name of the black color is “noir” but the dark is also call “noir”. “It’s really dark outside” will be say “Il fait vraiment noir dehors”. 3 years ago I switch to a new school where the English level was really higher than my other school. One day, in front of the class, I was ask to said my biggest childhood fear. After a quick translation in my head I proudly said in front of the whole class “I was afraid of black when I sleep”. After the most akward ten seconds of my life where all the students and teacher look at me with a weird look my professor said “do you mean darkness”."

13530,"So one rainy day in 4th grade we were having indoor recess. Me and my friend Jayden were messing around with some paper and started blowing on it for some reason. The papers clashed against each other and that was the birth of Wind Racers. The premise of the game is two people to head to head blowing their paper at the other persons paper until eventually one either gets A. Flipped over , or B knocked off the table. It started of with me and a few friends but eventually the whole class joined in and we had a whole tournament. Everybody had their own custom designs and different folds on their paper. We played this game every day for weeks until it got banned, because ya know teachers don’t like kids having fun."
13531,"I remember Silly Bands being really popular. But one of the weirdest things was collecting “star student tickets”. These were printed and issued by faculty who caught you doing a good deed. These were practically the school currency and you could cash them in at your “ home room” teachers room for various prizes they had, or at the school store which just had school supplies. But the strangest thing that apparently made you a top tier comedian, was eating them. Just eating the paper money. On a side note, kids would fake good deed scenarios in front of teachers but generally the teachers wouldn’t buy it."
13532,"Well this is actually highschool, but last year a lot of the “popular” girls started barking at each other. It went on for like a month

Edit: I didn’t join in but it was pretty amusing"
13533,"Omg we had that too. Well the boys did, but I watched Ben 10 so I participated in that"

13543,I actually can't remember much from elementary school
13544,"Not really weird but at recess, we would dig out a pit in the mulch and have Beyblade battles. The best times of my life."
13545,I remember silly bands the more you had the cooler you were
13546,I’m boutta start that at my school if we go back
13547,We had a big chestnut tree at our school so when the chestnuts would fall they became a big currency to trade for the best chestnut (or like Pokémon cards and stuff)
13548,Swinging in grade 4. I started it and the cool kids joined. I got a new friend
13549,There was one time in grade 6 where a bunch of guys in my school went around flicking each other with elastic bands. Basically just stretch it between your thumb and finger and then pull the middle back like a slingshot and flick them with it.
13550,That happened at my school too but people started lying about who had it so it seemed like every other person had it
13551,Silly bands were huge when i was in elementary school and kids would a very excessive amount on their arm i talking like 20 one time my hand started turning purple and i went up to the teacher
13552,There was a weird marble phase in 4th grade I even bought bags of rare ones. It all stopped when the school cracked down on bets.

Do you want all of the nice things you have in life to be stripped from you?  I don’t.  Communism had been tried and tested by multiple nations in multiple decades and it has never worked.  I don’t know how you people still believe in such an evil idea.
13605,oh lordy...

13619,Ok giga chad
13620,yeah quarantine kind of caused my crush on the aforementioned girl in my post to fade
13621,Bruh I had this crush for 3-4 years
13622,"Depends on a lot of factors, if I develop a crush on someone I don’t really know and just see them a lot it’ll last like a week or two, if it’s someone I know and talk to it can last for months or even year unless I find out they’re dating someone or are by no means interested in a relationship past friendship, like if I find out they’re not attracted to my gender I’ll murder my feelings because I’m not going to waste time pining over someone I don’t have a shot with, also if I find out they’re toxic they get yeeted out of the crush zone and usually the friend zone too"
13623,I've ended up dating all my crushes after high school lol
13624,I had a crush on my best friend for 5 years. She eventually found out rejected and unfriended me. It’s been over a year since her rejection and I’m still not over it ;-;

13638,"Unfriended you? Yikes, bit harsh. I'm still friends with a guy who asked me out about three times without understanding my hints lmao."
13639,If I get a crush usually it's for someone at school and it ends a month or two after school ends.
13640,same

13642,I’d imagine the flair would help
13643,"My last one lasted 4 years and she used me/lied to me for 3,and my current one is 1 month"
13644,Way to long
13645,Yes but when you have big chungus out here weighing 300 pounds calling herself *thicc* like no that's just no
13646,some people are just thicc tho

13648,"Don’t encourage it but let people do what they want. Alcohol, smoking, drugs and eating carcinogens aren’t healthy and yet there’s not much conversation about it. We don’t need to talk shit about everything unhealthy that people choose to do. Also overweight and obese are two very different things."
13649,"In other words, we should just shut the fuck up about other people’s bodies"
13650,it's like a sports car zooming at 130 mph down the highway vs a grocery getter falling off a cliff at 130mph
13651,"it definetly shouldnt be encouraged imo

its just unhealthy"
13652,"Acceptance? That's good.

But treating it as normal? That's not.

As someone who was fat, and is working there way to getting very fit, being bullied because I was fat really encouraged me to work to become fit. It's kinda twisted and wrong, but I kinda think that everyone should try to encourage people to lose weight. Not by bullying, as the bullying I had in my past will forever make me self-conscious about my weight, but in a constructive and positive way"
13653,But remember that shaming or making fun of anyone is only doing harm. Rather encourage and support if you are at the position to do so. :)
13654,I don't think people should be fat-shamed really but being fat isn't acceptable
13655,People also think that being 5'9 and still weight 85lbs is normal. Quit acting like having fat people in the media is gonna *encourage* people to be fat
13656,I don't think it should be encouraged but people could be more accepting of overweight people.
13657,"no, because being fat isn’t healthy. some people think that it’s okay to be fat because of influencers or plus size models, but it’s not healthy and 3 million people die every year from obesity, so they should know how unhealthy it is"
13658,"Being unhealthy or overweight should definitely not be encouraged, however there are biological factors that make some people have larger builds, and generally I think our culture encourages being unhealthy to get skinnier.

As well as that you shouldn’t shame someone who’s overweight obviously, as a lot of people who have unhealthy weights are going through tough things in their lives etc."
13659,"As someone who is still fat and was bullied for half a decade, I agree, it absolutely did not help, and it pushed me towards eating to cope with the bullying! I’ve lost far more weight when people minded their own business as opposed to when they bullied me for being a worthless pig!"
13660,"It’s just about accepting and loving yourself no matter what you look like so I don’t really see the problem. Like you really don’t even know why people look the way they do and if they’re healthy or not, or if they’re trying to get healthy so saying fat people shouldn’t love themselves is rude and mean cause it’s not any of your business."
13661,"No you don’t unless you’re talking about obese people. Even then it’s about loving yourself, do you love yourself?? Aren’t you supposed to love yourself?? I love myself and I know that there are many things I need to change about myself in order to become who I want to be. I’m not perfect far from it, but I try to love myself cause if I don’t now and change myself to how I think I’ll want to be, I still won’t love myself. 

I remember having to get our weight checked it PE class. I weighed more than this girl, but she looked fat and heavier than me, and we were about the same height. Ofc people said things about her weight cause “they were just tryna help her” like no one needs your opinions, you really don’t know if a person is healthy or not unless they’re obese, and even then they don’t need your opinions. It’s not like you know what they’re doing to change it."
13662,"It should be treated like smoking, heavily advised against, but understood it is hard to lose weight even if is the right thing for their health."
13663,Being an asshole isn’t healthy either and if people are gonna be assholes they should know how unhealthy it is. If someone makes unsolicited comments about my body I will show them with a swift kick in the nuts
13664,"i don’t think people should comment on someone else’s weight even if they’re under or overweight. obviously the person knows if their weight is not healthy, but it’s not anyone else’s problem except theirs and their doctor. i hate when people say something rude about someones weight and then say they’re just trying to help."
13665,"Do they mean obese or overweight? Because they are, as you said very different things. And I agree that we don’t need to talk shit about people’s unhealthy choices/ lifestyles/ addictions. Other people’s actions aren’t affecting anyone but themselves (especially if it’s someone’s weight)"
13666,"It's not pseudoscience. There is a lot of evidence that being fat is unhealthy. Also BMI is not an accurate way to measure it, body builders are all ""overweight/obese"" according to BMI but they're still very healthy and obviously not fat"
13667,you don't need to tell them to
13668,It’s disappointing how people that are pro-fat-shaming conflate the two. You can be fat and it have hardly any effect on your health because you’re overweight as opposed to obese. It’s like they’re saying someone who wears size L is in the same health category as someone on 600lb life. Not comparable at all.
13669,There’s a difference between fat and thicc
13670,Bullying works sometimes other times it leads to years of self esteem issues so maybe don’t
13671,The only person who should be advising a person about weight is a doctor or other health care professional. No random person should give people advice about their health.
13672,"Honestly it doesn’t even matter if you think it works; it’s cruel, makes people hate themselves and shouldn’t EVER happen."
13673,"For the most part they should be okay with the way they are. They still have to live their lives, they should be allowed representation in the media."
13674,Some people have medical conditions that means they can't lose weight. You shouldn't say things like that
13675,I wish I had been dating the person for longer. It would’ve felt much more special. I also wish it had been in a bed.
13676,"Nah, it was just a little awkward (as it naturally should)"
13677,"Make sure that the guy is wearing a condom.... being a teenage mom isn’t fun. Btw I’m still a virgin but my 16 year old friend has a baby right now, she doesn’t have an account so told me to comment."
13678,[deleted]
13679,With ease
13680,i havent even had my first kiss yet bro
13681,I regret doing it with someone who’s only a friend
13682,How TF did you manage to lose your virginity at 13?
13683,"I don't regret anything.
Remember to do it only with someone you really trust and in a comfortable place. Then you won't regret it as well!
Also, what I would recommend, is putting a pillow under your butt if your partner is on top. When the vagina is higher (at least for me) it makes it much more pleasurable and it can also be easier to put the penis in if you're stressed. 
Try different positions, go slow at first and don't be ashamed if something goes wrong, laugh it off. It'd be good to get some lube before because even when you're usually wet, stress can make you dry and you don't want it to be painful.
And simply communicate with your partner, many people tend to forget about it. Talk about what and how you like it so you can both be fully satisfied."
13684,"No, it was a good experience with someone I truly cared about."
13685,It was in a truck
13686,Lol go ahead man
13687,"Nope, it was fun, a little painful, and I did it with someone I love. I can’t imagine having my first time with anyone else"
13688,"I lost mine when I was 15, I think like the weekend before I turned 16? I don’t exactly regret it, but looking back at it now I feel that I was not old enough or ready for that. I let the boy I lost it to pressure me into a lot of things after that, and that I regret. I probably shouldn’t have lost it to him, but that’s okay. Also, it hurt so bad and I’m pretty sure the condom was expired. Girls, if you are considering it, please make sure you know how to take care of your body during and afterwards. Make sure you actually are ready to do it!!! Don’t be me, know what you’re getting yourself into so you’re safe!! (: 
Edit: let me also add that if you know what you’re doing it’s not scary and I love it now!"
13689,Where was it?
13690,bro 😎💪
13691,"What kind?

I think goofy goober would be a pretty good icebreaker ngl"

13696,"No really, it was a good experience with someone that I deeply love and trust. Obviously it was a bit awkward at points, but that's just sex."

13698,You bloody legend

13702,I don't mean to get to into someone else's personal life but like how did it happen at 13? I literally cannot imagine doing it at my age
13703,I also lost my virginity at 13 and I can definitely relate to that. Here's to hoping your experience was better than mine lol
13704,"No i wouldn’t change how i lost my virginity, i was dating my bf for 4 months and it was great but it hurt like hell. This was a couple days ago so it’s fun we can have sex and its more comfortable and fun"

13725,It's not that I wanted to prove that I'm correct. It's that I already had an answer but didn't notice and kept on trying to solve a problem I already solved
13726,Oh dear god 🗿  Rip our braincells
13727,Yea also pretty dumb to stay up

13761,"im glad i could cheer you up but omg it made me so annoyed on those comments to your post?? you didn’t deserve that at all, people on there were just rude for no reason at all and it was so uncalled for😔it’s not your fault and you’re so fuckin sweet so just ignore the haters steve, you’re awesome😎"
13762,So you didn't get that movie reference 😅
13763,Poor Steve deserves better 🤬🤬
13764,He really dose cause I thought it was a good suggestion 🤬 just for the community sub
13765,"He asked for rules in the girl code, not what rules he would/could use"
13766,"Always let a girl know if she has period stains, smeared makeup, lipstick on her teeth, if her skirt is tucked into her underwear accidentally, if there’s toilet paper on her shoe, if her boob is going to slip out, and if a friend asks you to go to the bathroom with her you go. 

You gotta let your fellow girls know when a bathroom stall has no toilet paper and offer some from another stall. Let her know if you see someone slip something in her drink."
13767,"Don't date your friend's ex

There are exceptions though like, if they dated for a week just ask, or if it was like 5 years ago again, just ask"
13768,that's for me to know and you to never find out...
13769,Ok I’ve never understood number 7. What do you do in there?
13770,"ofc we do use the toilets but we also talk, gossip, fix makeup, cry, anything really"
13771,"If someone randomly goes up to you and says 'heyyyy I haven't seen you in so long', PLAY IT OFF AND GO ALONG WITH HER. She's probably in danger."
13772,[deleted]
13773,"Well ok then. But it’s more than just using the toilets, right?"
13774,"I always found that quite silly.

If I dated someone and broke up with them, I’d have no bond with them anymore, and I certainly wouldn’t own them. Anyone else could date them. If a friend of mine dated them within just a couple days or weeks, that might be rude, sure, as feelings may still be there, but months or years? Go for it."
13775,"Note to self: Carry tampons around, just in case"
13776,i think one is that you cant date someones ex.
13777," its dangerous in public restrooms, so multiple girls go with each other as protection :)"
13778,Or i have a shitty memory
13779,"no lol wtf i would like my friends to tell me if i don't look good

dont wanna go around lookin like a clown"
13780,husband material
13781,I figured something like that
13782,ALWAYS give a girl a tampon/pad if they need it and you have it. I don't care if she is your worst enemy.
13783,"I think part of the code is that you hype her up, tell her she looks good even if she doesn’t"
13784,"this this this

this needs to be higher up jesus"
13785,"That's why I said it depends 

Like I feel like if u were in a year long relationship you'd feel different than a 3 month one"
13786,"Usually you go there to talk privately and if one group is in the bathroom already they either leave or you wait for your turn, and if it’s you already in there with your group talking privately you leave."
13787,You have clearly doesn’t read the bro code
13788,Sorry that my first language isn’t English
13789,"you can only wear jeans or track pants on Friday, you can't wear a tank top 2 days in a row, and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week

(edit: guys it's a quote from mean girls...)"
13790,That’s very different from men’s washrooms. We just stand there in silence.
13791,"Well take me out to DINNER first, geez"
13792,Don’t date an ex without permission. And always let her know if they bled through their pants on their period
13793,Oh damn I’ve never thought of that
13794,ALWAYs eat ur tampon after you use it
13795,"Yea both my parents smokes weed, pretty sure my dad did alot more and they still smoke weed"
13796,"Father tells a story of how he almost become drug kingpin everytime he gets drunk lol.

It is legitimate story but c’mon stop it dude."
13797,"Turns out sending hormonal, horny young people to stay together is close quarters and then expecting them to not do anything isn't the best idea"
13798,"All of this happens in 1998 Bulgaria where the communism just ended and its fucking chaotic and nobody know wtf they are doing.

My father and his friend(who at the time was a literal wall think of it like he is the rock) go to a tavern in a rural area. Tavern is empty except a one middle aged small guy sitting alone in a table minding his own business. My fathers friend goes to the restroom and then one black BMW stops in front of the tavern they close the doors staff runs away(apparently they were bought to not call the police or something) and 3 guys start beating the shit out of that small guy my father seeing this tries to stop them standing in front of the guy and stuff but that changes nothing and now they are just beating up the shit out of 2 guys instead. After a lot of ass kicking done by those black suites guys The Rock gets out of the restroom drunk and confused as fuck he takes a fucking table(yes a table) lifts it up and smashes it to the head of one of the guys breaking the table and quite literally the guy too. The other two guys don’t fear for their fucking life after seeing what just happened and get the fuck out of the place without looking behind. After that my father asks why those guys attacked him and he explains that he is a a LVL60 Mafia Boss and they are probably hired by a rival of his. Then he asks them to work for him as drug lords and offers them great deal of money but my father and his friend (both considering to get married at the time) decline. Then the guy offers to make my father a manager of an hotel instead assuring that it’s legal and stuff but my father doesn’t want to risk it so they say their good bye’s and get on their way. 

I always joked with my father about that story being fake until the middle-aged guy who apparently dropped the illegal stuff after some time and expanded his hotel business who also became a mayor of a small town later on told me the story by himself lol."
13799,my parents have never done drugs.
13800,Bro week is some strong shit
13801,So you just gonna leave us with a cliffhanger like that?
13802,"oh fuck, I forgot that was a drug. my dad drinks occasionally but my mom has never tried it."
13803,"my mom used to tell me about the fact that she smoked weed once to try and deter me from it, as if that would work."
13804,My mom and dad never talked about anything but one of my mom's long time friends had a conversation about how they used to smoke weed all the time. I know my dad drank a decent amount but I don't know if he smoked. He supports it being legalized so maybe but I don't know if he has.
13805,I get you I’m not native speaker and still experience some difficulty when writing long texts! I really understand you and I’m sorry but I’m just too lazy to fix it.
13806,Just alcohol but it's still a drug
13807,🤭
13808,Never drunk a sip of alcohol?
13809,My my dropped out in the 9th grade but yeah she tells me she did acid and shrooms when she was like 14
13810,They've said they've never smoked weed but idk
13811,My sister said she used to find my dads bongs and “borrow” them with her friends. Long story short they were both stoners when my dad was 30 and my sister was 14. They’ve both stopped now
13812,"nope not really, they seemed really studious"
13813,I need a movie of this
13814,"No they're very anti drug and I've asked them about them getting drunk before and they're probably lying but they say they've never gotten *that* drunk

My friend's parents do talk about their weed days tho."
13815,No but my dad smoked for 17 years and quit. Back then it was more expensive but he quit for health reasons.
13816,No
13817,Woah
13818,"Idk weed has tangible negative effects like any drug, including alcohol. No one wants to here that though."
13819,i mean being studious doesn't necessarily mean they dont do drugs but ok
13820,"I agree that if done right both weed and alcohol can be used for recreation with a low chance of any damage. But weed definitely has negatives like exasperating depression/anxiety, insomnia, short term lack of motivation and longer term damage if you're young.
I think saying that weed is harmless encourages people to smoke excessively which could lead to long term stuff."
13821,"I wouldn't count weed as a drug unless you are pregnant. Idk what that would do to the baby. Look up a song by Ill Bill called My Uncle. It's about how he was brought up around drugs. His uncle shoots heroin, his did dad does cocaine, his mom smoked weed with her friends when he was 8 and he started at 12"
13822,"My mom tried weed once in middle school and she hated it. Her older brother started smoking it in the 6th grade, and introduced her and her sister to it. She was the only one that didn't like it, and thank God for that, because her siblings inevitably moved on to worse drugs. Her brother is long dead, and her sister is so morbidly obese and brain-damaged she can't even wipe her own ass.

I'm not saying marijuana is all bad, in fact it has some super cool medicinal purposes besides the recreational ones, but I'm saying it's bad if your brain isn't fully developed. You're 1000 times more likely to be dependent on it if you try it when you're underage, and it's also more likely to become a gateway drug."
13823,ngl i’d love to hear that story
13824,I wouldn't say the effects of weed are worth worrying about though. Think of it as adderall and the effects that can have on you damn near harmless
13825,I use both of them for alternate days
13826,Whoever uses right shift is a sociopath
13827,What type of God are you? Jesus? Guanyin?
13828,Left shift... right shift if I’m only using one hand to type
13829,i use caps lock
13830,You're like Hitler bit even Hitler cared about computers or somthing
13831,"Left, my right hand is designated for a lot more because that’s where the enter, backspace, and number pad is as well as all punctuation, so it’s a little more preoccupied than my left hand"
13832,"I touch type, so sometimes"
13833,You dirty bastard.
13834,Just your average god . ( it’s just that I’m trying to become ambi)
13835,"If the letter I'm capitalizing is on the left side of my keyboard, I use the right shift, and vice versa. It's how I was taught to touch type."
13836,yes.
13837,Guess I'm a sociopath then
13838,YES
13839,Lmao left shift of course
13840,It is
13841,Isn’t this a reference to Rick and Morty? Or is my memory off?
13842,"It depends on what I'm doing. If I'm gaming it's left shift. If I'm typing, essays and shit, it's left shift. If I'm touch typing, it's left shift. If I'm typing with one hand, it's left shift cuz my hands are fucking huge."
13843,Considering there is no mobile right shift...
13844,[deleted]
13845,"You disgust me

/S"
13846,I didn't want to sound mean
13847,"What about Tab, Escape, and tilde '~'. Or is that just programmers"
13848,A normal person at last
13849,Dont worry I know
13850,[removed]
13851,I use both everyday...
13852,The button that makes it capital?
13853,"Left, I have a brain"
13854,Who uses right shift lmao
13855,Sounds kinda suss to me... I’m sure it’s fine though haha
13856,That user name sounds ~pretty~ sus
13857,Awesome! And make sure your girlfriend is hyped up enough to tell him to stop if she's uncomfortable.
13858,Username reference?
13859,You should turn gay then
13860,Soo it's an everyone thing. I'm not alone in this then
13861,idk i just feel embarrassed by it
13862,"Wait, why tho?"
13863,"When I do work out, yeah it feels so awkward man.

Also, am I the only one who gets embarassed when working out even by myself? I always imagine someone from school like laughing at me or watching me struggle and half the time it takes more effort to get those thoughts out of my head that it is to acc exercise lol."
13864,"Yes so much, I hate it"
13865,I used to but then I decided I don’t care what they think
13866,honestly yeah
13867,"Same here, it´s all about wanting to get more toned or more healthy."
13868,Not at all
13869,Not really bc we have a gym in our house so my dad or brothers are always in there... But if I'm doing a workout in my room it's hella awkward and makes me wanna jump out the window 😭🔫
13870,"Yup, my dad literally comes in my room, even tho I close the door for a reason.....just to look at me. I get that he's proud but my god, you're killing my mood and make me feel like I'm a zoo attraction"
13871,"Yeah, I had to make the choice between being a little uncomfortable and working out or just not working out at all, so I pushed through until I didn't feel awkward anymore."
13872,fr like bitch knocking was invented for a reason
13873,"yeh because she just comes in and watches me do my push ups, then leaves again like whatttt-"
13874,yeah all the time 😭
13875,YES THAT SHIT SO ANNOYING
13876,My dad walked in on me while I was in the moment and it's something i'd like to forget tbh
13877,"YES OMFG I FEEL THAT, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME BEING STUPID LMAO"
13878,"I need to follow your example, I will literally not work out at home bc I don't want my parents saying anything about it."
13879,"Nah, they get to witness my transformation firsthand"
13880,You guys work out?
13881,"Yes, that's why I don't work out"
13882,bruhhh she’s a 0 on the swag meter for that😐 i’m sorry :’(
13883,"We’re chill but let me tell you it’s the funniest shit when I’m on GTA and my sister drops down and does push ups, she has a weird bone condition (nothing is wrong they just crackle and pop a lot) so it sounds like Minecraft skeletons"
13884,"My mom is really weird about fitness and stuff, it's awful"
13885,"that’s so cool dude, your fam seems chill"
13886,"Yeh. Especialy cause my dad has always been stronger than me and workin out since a younger age, so I always feel like I'm lackin."
13887,In my house we support each other openly with that because we know it can feel embarrassing. So we’re chill with it and I’ll just be playing Xbox while my sister casually just does 20 push-ups
13888,yup :( especially cause I workout shirtless sometimes(I'm a boy) and my mom makes a comment abt stretch marks everytime :)
13889,"I've done one of those dance workouts and my parents walked in and, I felt so judged and like, idk. It did in fact ruin the vibe"
13890,Why didn’t you capitalize the first letter in your sentence. 😠
13891,How ab u delete ur self stoopid
13892,how about u delete ur account stoopid🤭🙄
13893,"Been there, done that"
13894,LMAOO rip 🙈
13895,it's called an aesthetic
13896,"yup, definitely

^(kinda get annoyed at myself too lmao)"
13897,Why didn't you use a question mark?
13898,iT'S CALLED AN AESTHETIC;
13899,^a ^e ^s ^t ^h ^e ^t ^i ^c
13900,My little sister does
13901,Yesssss
13902,When I’m close to my period or I’m just having a bad day
13903,Yes I’m a very irritable person; I’m working on trying to control it though
13904,yuppp
13905,"Yes

Yes :("
13906,"let’s be real, who doesn’t?"
13907,yes
13908,"This can be a symptom of anxiety if it has something to with sounds (Chewing, slamming doors, fork on plate, talking loudly etc.)"
13909,Always. It's the smallest things that piss me off the most

13947,Wait really?
13948,no 😡
13949,i will stay lazy 😡
13950,It is concerning how guys are always tryna be like 'but it is okay tho in self defense tho right?!?!'
13951,It's quite frankly misogynistic. If the first thing that comes to mind when equal rights is said is hitting a girl you need to get therapy.
13952,Girls can you please validate my need to hit a girl?!?!?!
13953,Yeah don't hit people
13954,"Yeah it’s pretty stupid. Imo don’t hit anyone, I was taught that if someone hit me I can hit them back. But wether a guy or a girl hit first, it doesn’t make it right either way"
13955,"I fully believe that hitting anyone is wrong (unless it’s playful) but I also don’t like how people are like “you can’t hit a girl”. If it’s self defence, I don’t see why not. But yeah, people just finding an excuse or an opening to hit others is concerning."
13956,Just don't hit anyone first please :(
13957,yeah like dude theres so much that could be talked about with feminism but you choose to talk about mens right to hit women? ?????
13958,"If you browse this sub or even other subs guys will usually ask

What is your opinion on hitting a girl in self defence? 

They may also phrase it differently but the main idea of it is being able to either hit a girl or self defend"
13959,"Whaaaat?? I've never really seen this. I've seen it as a tool to show the ""true inequalities between men and women that affect men"" (which, let's be honest being able to hit more people is not an issue when compared to actual men's issues.)

I haven't seen someone say that in awhile but imagining being hit by a guy sounds awful. Anyone who can overpower me tbh."
13960,"honestly it's concerning. like the guys I've had this sort of conversation with always objectify girls they've said stuff like ""she's got big blowjob lips"" about a girl they don't even know,  then when this sort of stuff comes up about equality they'll go ""well equal rights equal fights"" and its disgusting. I've lost so much respect for them over shit like this."
13961,exactly
13962,agreed
13963,"Yeah I know, it's so crazy that their concerned about hitting girls."
13964,"I always found it stupid how they said ""Equal rights? Equal fights""

Like dude, we will NEVER be able to have an equal fight, you are BIOLOGICALLY stronger

I support guys defending themselves, but lets be honest, I get a vibe that they WANT to hit girls"
13965,"Yeah, its kind've concerning that they feel the need to be validated for hitting a girl. Like, if its self-defense, then that's one thing, but you don't need to come here and get validated for it. Those people seem to be the ones who just want a reason to hit a girl. (Except maybe the person who posted it first; they may have just wanted a discussion about it.)"
13966,"I know, the issue is when the first thing that comes to guys minds when equality is said is hitting a girl."
13967,"You can't go as hard as you want just because she hit you first.

It's the same the other way around. In fact, I'm pretty sure a lot of countries have laws regarding that.

For it to be self defense it has to be a reasonable amount of force and you have to be afraid for your well being.

If a girl hit you and the most it did for was make your arm sore, you can't then knock her out. That's excessive and I believe no longer self defense. You just got yourself a worse charge then she did despite her throwing the first punch."
13968,Yea wtf
13969,"It’s really concerning because I’ve been tossed around before by a guy, it’s absolutely terrifying not having control. These people needing validation to hit a girl is extremely concerning to me."
13970,"You can't knock them out. It may not count as self defense anymore.


For self defense it has to be a reasonable amount of force.


The goal is to get them to leave you alone. Not leave permanent harm. Or even put them in the hospital."
13971,Yeah
13972,I wish the mods would do something about those posts looking for validation to hit a girl.
13973,Its absolutely not reasonable either.
13974,"I'm on a few subreddits that some times feature fighting, and its shocking how many people use that term every single time a girl gets beat up by a dude. Like wtf guys. Seems like the only reason people upvoted was because some girl lost to a guy"
13975,Yeah no need to obsess over something that probably won't happen
13976,"I mean that's for when you've found yourself in an individual situation. It boils down to intention and stuff. There are too many factors to account for, but yeah in an ideal world nobody would be hit or abused."
13977,"No I'm a fan of self defense, not murder."
13978,It’s really concerning
13979,That's a good way to end up in prison.

14009,^(Huh? :()
14010,Girls are more emotional and men are more competetive. And no thats not any sexist stuff. Its true
14011,I think it’s more that girls tend to not worry about showing emotions
14012,"Girls compliment each other but do not mean it.

Boys insult each other but do not mean it."
14013,"in general, boys are more reactionary but colder, but girls are more passive and caring

in general that is, there are obvious exceptions 

but it makes sense to me, I'll always prefer to talk to a girl about deep shit cuz they seem much more caring and compassionate about it 

while dudes usually dont like to show much emotion"
14014,"Excuse me, mentally we take around 20-30 years to mature."
14015,"My sincerest apologies, I didn't intend for my calculations to be such an underestimation."
14016,"Yes I agree, I don’t think guys don’t show emotions but rather they don’t know how to show emotions.


This again is because of primitive evolution, men were these ferocious creatures built to take damage. Of course that’s not the case now but the psyche is still same deep inside, so that’s why that happens"
14017,I think boys are more direct in saying what they think
14018,"Okay this guy here, he just made a truthful statement"
14019,"Alot of people think they differ much, but actually they don't, only in the details they differ."
14020,I think this pertains to evolutionary behavior
14021,"I don't think we differ that much mentally. It's up to the individual. Girls and boys are often raised differently and I think that is the main reason for the differences. But there aren't that many actual mental differences. If we were all raised the same, I think we would mostly be the same."
14022,That could be right
14023,I think it is
14024,I forgive thee but you must understand that not everything is individual to the person. But sometimes we can take 40 years to mature mentally so I supposed thou art correct in that way.
14025,"Indeed he did, also you are a stupid shit head."
14026,Allegedly girls are 18 months more mentally mature
14027,"I think the better word can be assertive


Girls can be direct too"
14028,Isn’t that technically being different
14029,"I disagree, physically we are different. Mentally we differ not so much, I think the main reason for that is in the way we are raised.
Personally, I think it's more useful to look at an individual, instead of trying to make generalisations about an entire gender."
14030,Oof I’ve met ALOT of incredibly competitive girls though
14031,"Not only raised by parents, but society. Teachers, relatives, TV, social media, complete strangers, everything can affect us more than you'd think. For example, girls are taught to play with barbies and boys play with cars. Do you think that every child somehow magically wants to do those things? No. If you were raised to believe boys play with barbies, you probably would've played with barbies. Same applies to things like expressing emotions, choosing a job and basically everything else we do. If boys were expected to be overly emotional and girls were expected to hide their emotions, that would happen.

Kinda out of topic, but you'd be surprised by how similar we are to robots."
14032,"That's the problem, we are a little bit different but people make the gap look worse than it is."
14033,Oh wow you’re smart as well
14034,"Thats funny, and you’re a handsome fella, must be a slick with the ladies ;)"
14035,"This is true. In men, neurologically our brains finish developing at around 22-25. Of course this all depends on how fast hormones are released in your body. Some people haven’t hit puberty till 30. For girls, since they usually hit puberty earlier than boys, their neurological development is usually finished by 18-19. Once again, subject to differentiation, but on average."
14036,That’s just being a shitty person tho and that’s not the only time Serena did that I remember her calling out the ref and making a scene out of nothing she’s a great tennis player but just not a really good human being.
14037,I dont think they differ.
14038,Yea of course
14039,Okay then
14040,Hangout with good friends.
14041,"You will always compare them to some degree... that’s my experience at least. I think it’s quite normal, humans try to understand concepts, compare them, make connections.

14100,"When I do it, I do it jokingly. Also sometimes misspellings confuse people like with that one post ""sucj little clothing"" and I thought it was a real brand."
14101,"Shouldn't it be correct grammar? Right grammar sounds wrong.

Just kdding, yeah, it's kinda annoying. Even though it may not technically be correct, as long as it's understandable what they mean then what's the point of pointing out that they're wrong? Sure, I may cringe slightly when I see you're instead of your, but I'm not gonna take the time to point out that they're wrong, because they most likely already know the difference between you're and your and they just made a mistake while quickly writing it. And if you do point it out, do it in a respectful manner and not like ""hAhAhA, yOuR wRoNg YoU cAnT sPeLl HaHaHa WhAt A fUcKiNg NoOb"""
14102,"I do it when I'm really bored but even then not in a serious manner.

To everyone else, I have no idea to be honest with you."
14103,"Yeah that’s what I mean. Like I had a post with a problem in it and all the people fixing it were telling me a suck at grammar, they weren’t even telling me how to do it right!! But if you do it nicely as a little heads up and not to embarrass them that’s okay!"
14104,"I only do it to tease my friends, idc if ppl make a mistake online, except if they're being hypocrites"
14105,"this is reddit lol, what do you expect

it's a free joke"
14106,Ah that makes sense. Like it’s okay for people to correct things if they’re being nice is what I’m tryna say!
14107,Just mad and typing fast mostly. And I accidentally put a. I had to read that 3 times actually before I actually saw the a instead of the I
14108,"Yeah it’s annoying, but then, it’s mostly online when things like that happen and people are almost always rude online. It’s best to ignore!"
14109,It's free real estate
14110,"Yeah. So... uh... I see that you replaced an I with an A just now and I've seen this happen a few times, and, I'm just kinda curious to why, I guess. Because the I and A are not close to each other on the keyboard. Is it intentional like some people pronounce I like ah?"
14111,When someone makes a mistake I normally joke around with it and they know I'm joking so like yeah
14112,When I do it I don’t do it seriously. Like when someone corrects someone else while they have an error in their own writing.
14113,"Ik. I said mythbusters were my favourite tv show   and then some guy comments ""blah blah grammar nazi blah blah it's supposed to be was not were blah blah"". But it was ""just a joke"""
14114,I've been told I had my head up my ass for telling that we shouldn't expect everyone to speak in a perfect english online and that it was kinda rude to get mad about people making grammatical mistakes
14115,"I am really consensus about my writing. I speak very well, but i suck at writing. I haven't seen anyone rude to people who spell wrong here."
14116,"I try to limit myself from doing it, but it just infuriates me when I see improper spelling and/or grammar that is unintentional."
14117,"I only ever do it when the person has previously told someone else to ""Speak English"". Like if you are going to be rude to someone and say that to them I can be just as rude.

 I'm blocked from a lot of American Trump supporters Instagram pages."
14118,Can we get an English 4th language gang?
14119,"To me as long as I'm able to understand what the other is saying I don't see why I'd correct them and my first language isn't english either. 

These people are probably just to mad and/or out of any logical/reasonable argument and try to diminish the othr's credibility in order to appear as more logical and therefore the ""right"" party"
14120,I just tell them I have dyslexia and they usually apologise XD but I don’t really care
14121,I just make a joke out of it like if you go 'my fisb' instead of 'my fisb' I'll just go like 'hey a fisb that's a new one'
14122,"Generally I don’t see a problem with correcting that stuff. As long as you do it politely I think it can be quite helpful. If I make a mistake when learning Chinese I’d be glad to get corrected, and the same goes for when there’s an English grammar rule that I wasn’t aware of."
14123,"I do it *because* a lotta folks aren't natively English. It'll help them improve. Now, people who do it in an asshole way, sure, but most do it just to lightly correct someone and help them improve their grammar."

14125,">There’s

There are*

For legal reasons, this is just a playful joke"
14126,Facts
14127,I was in an argument yesterday and I made a typo. The other guy had no argument and based everything he said from then on out over the spelling mistake. It gives people unnecessary leverage
14128,"I don't bother correcting people bc like you said, it's rude, and even if you do it nicely it probably won't have any effect. It really bothers me to see shitty grammar/spelling tho, probably bc my mom's an English teacher"
14129,"I think it's totally fine online, but in a professional setting or in school, for instance it's not really acceptable (if you're speaking your first language). 

Switching up 'your' and 'you're' is one of the more common mistakes, but you really shouldn't be making them if you've been speaking the language your whole life."
14130,"At this point I've stopped trying, ik I can't focus so I've accepted failure lmfao"
14131,Lol same. My laptop literally has been running for 11 hours straight for the last 3 days for a task that'd take me 6 hours max
14132,Yes i handed in an assignment 3 weeks late cuz i just couldnt write it and any time i tried i damn near cried
14133,"yes, i have adhd and that is a major problem for me lol"
14134,"Yeah I have very little motivation. Sometimes when I work with people it’s alleviated a bit, but I can’t usually work with people cuz everyone’s busy and all. Half of the assignments I need to do were due days to almost a month ago."
14135,i dont even try anymore tbh
14136,"it's because we're at home and we associate that place with freedom and relaxation, it's hard to keep a strict work ethic somewhere where you otherwise don't do anything like that. there are always distractions like other family members, nobody is controlling you and/or looking at you directly so naturally you feel more comfortable. it really sucks, I literally lay in my bed for the whole day and do nothing. I'm supposed to have a history exam in a few hours (i still haven't slept because I've been studying and I haven't even learned half of the things I was supposed to), but I'll probably say that my internet connection is bad and purposely blur out my camera so I'll have to write it next semester if (i hope not) we all get back to school next year after the holidays."
14137,Same
14138,"Yeah, I always used to not be able to do maths homework so I’d just copy it from someone in class"
14139,Not epic
14140,Adhd in a nutshell
14141,"if you do think you have anxiety i encourage you to seek a professional. i think that’s quite important, not necessarily for your studies but just your overall health:) take care of yourself and don’t be reluctant to get help, even if it’s just opening up to a parent or friend or using helplines.

that aside, i get you. so many people do. i do think that electronics such as our phones suck up a lot of our energy and when we want to do work we struggle because we don’t feel fresh. i strongly recommend meditation (you can use apps) and studying first thing in the morning. i think it’s the best time to do some work:) the earlier you start, the better?

also, put that goddamn phone away! literally throw it away or give it to someone you trust to take care of it for you. NOT IN THE ROOM YOU’RE STUDYING OKAY"
14142,"I started strong and then eventually slowed down, I got back into the groove by putting my phone in a drawer far away from me, listening to Taylor Swift/Shawn Mendes, and then going on auto pilot and enjoying the music while I do my school work and it really helps me finish my work quickly. So I’d recommend putting your phone far away and out of sight, listening to music that makes you feel good, and then “get ‘er done” ❤️"
14143,"at this point I don’t even know. I see what I have to do, but I just can’t get myself to do it. Then I start freaking out because i haven’t finished any of my assignments, which makes it even harder for me to do my work . I feel like I’m a disappointment to everyone around me"
14144,yes that is happening to me right now I have 56 missing assignments to complete by tomorrow
14145,I wish my teachers would do that. My teachers all think their subject is our only subject and that they can give up a crazy amount of homework. It sucks
14146,Same! My English teacher set us an assignment today that we have to spend two hours on. It's due in at 4:00pm today and I have four other lessons to do by then. How the hell does she expect us to do that??
14147,"All I'll say is that you should just start by writing something - one word, one number, etc. and go on from there. Just get started and it's usually not that bad at all. I'm nowhere near being good at keeping up with assignments but that's one of the best ways :)"
14148,"Yes, yes and yes, I just Abt had the motivation to study with my bf for a few mins :("

14156,Yeah
14157,My teachers understand this year has been tough so we don’t get much work
14158,Literally on reddit while trying to study for a test
14159,I always get my work done but I procrastinate and have no will to do it
14160,"i usually only talk about guys to my best friend (who doesn’t go to my school, so we can’t really talk about boys we know)

we talk about sexuality and crushes whenever we want to sit down and have a heavy discussion about ourselves"
14161,"We ReDdItOrS dOnT hAvE fRiEnDs 

1. I have anxiety (duh) and im afraid of overstepping boundaries because of ruined past friendships, so it might be different for other girls, but with my friends i talk about shallow stuff like school, clothes, makeup, guys. Ew that sounds so stereotypical, but with my old friends whom i was closer to, we joked and sent eachother memes.

Right now my best friend is my sister so i talk about pretty much everything with her except sexual stuff.

2. I have great parents, but theyre more traditional so even though my grades are important, my dad has less expectations for me than my brothers. I feel bad for them, hes a doctor so hes gonna expect them to go into the medical field when theyre older.

3. Idk lmao ive never had a bf

4. Idk how to answer that

5. Theyre smol :) and a pain running or going downstairs quickly

6. Idk lmao

7. Stress about college apps and the sat and my future in general. Or go on reddit or watch anime/youtube."
14162,"1) When I had friends they were a lot more touchy feely around me than guys. They were a lot louder and had stupider humour as opposed to with guys where their humour was more mature if that makes sense idk I’m explaining this badly. It’s like they toned down the fun when talking to guys

2) my parents were strict and my dad was very traditional gender roles, so I wasn’t really allowed to do ‘boys stuff’ that I wanted to do. I wasn’t even allowed to play Pokemon because it was a ‘boys game’ and I wasn’t allowed to talk to boys (still not)
Also my sex Ed was really crap because my parents didn’t want me thinking about that stuff, so I spent my days worrying about having my period because I thought that once you started bleeding you never stopped until you died

3) I’m big gay so Idk about guy attraction. Dating for me was just like being friends except it was special and cool

4) I’m quite scrawny so I’m weaker than most people, and I’m short which doesn’t help. I don’t interact with any guys so it’s never been much of an issue

5) Other than my dad telling me I can’t do certain things I haven’t experienced much sexism. I’ve had a lot of people tell me I can’t do certain jobs because I’m a girl which sucks but doesn’t bother me much. I also hate the double standard on shaving. Why is it hygienic for a guy to have body hair but if a girl has body hair she’s gross and unhygienic?

6)I kinda used to feel like I had to be good at every game, so that people wouldn’t think I’m just a gAmEr gIrL but now I don’t really care as much and don’t mind that I’m bad at most games because I just play them to have fun y’know

7) I hate it so much. They get in the way of everything and I only have small tiddies so I feel so bad for girls with big tiddies. And I hate wearing bras so much, when I’m naked you can literally see red marks from my bras. But if my boobs are hurting cuz I’m on my period, and I decide to go braless I’m called a slut :(

8) Probably

9) Thats hard to pin down. I guess I just think about normal random things. Like what’s for dinner, tv shows, video games, my pets, what I want to do etc. Just whatever’s going on I tend to think about it. I don’t really think about specific people unless they’re in the room or somethings reminded me of them. I think about girls if I’m actually looking at the girl or somebody’s talking about her but other than that I’m not really fussed"
14163,Yep. Its an awful deal. Flat chest and still get tiddy pain.
14164,"My ex said something about #5, is that actually an issue, even with smaller ones?"
14165,Uh about my non existent boobs hurting? That wouldnt be that great of a convo lmao pretty short
14166,I cabt exactly answer your questions cuz I havent come out irl as a trans woman yet so I'm pretty much a girl in secret
14167,"I’ve just realized how being a girl is so different in both the real world and online. It’s very strange. I think certain people are nicer to you because of it. What I didn’t realize is how crazy people will act online if you’re a girl, even in games like among us. It’s like we are aliens sometimes which is insane bc we make up about 50% of the population and the default is not male."
14168,"1. My friends just act loud and annoying (i say this in a loving way😌) i guess girls can be more affectionate than guys though

2. They didn’t raise me too differently than my brothers. Other than the fact that I’m not allowed to date any guys even though both of them were allowed to at this age there aren’t any big differences

3. i mean i like girls and guys, it’s basically just the same feeling but ya know, for a guy

4. uh idk man lol

5. i used to not tell anyone that i was a girl when i played video games cause i assumed that they would judge me

6. it sucks, bras are so uncomfortable 

8. in my free time i guess i just do pretty normal stuff, reading, gaming, watching tv, listening to music.

these answers probably suck but whatever, thought i’d share"
14169,"in general i think girls are a lot more affectionate and open with each other, although im not particularly touchy with my friends a lot of girls are. sleepovers are fun although in my experience the girls sleepover stuff is exaggerated. nobody's naked, no cartoonish pillow fights, but yknow like i said girls are a lot more open with each other so there's more talking about personal stuff and maybe more gossiping although im not sure since ive never been to a guys sleepover.

my parents suck in general but i don't have any brothers so im not sure how that'd compare. there was the stuff like my mom teaching about bras, periods and how to deal with them, bc, etc.

dating is pretty cool when you're not in a toxic relationship. and im not sure how to describe attraction? it probably feels the same when you're attracted to a girl or whoever. but being in a relationship in general, when it's going well, feels great. someone who's there for you, to support you, to talk to you, to be a really really close friend. and the romantic stuff is just so great, really putting the effort in to look good and have a wonderful time together is just so amazing when you truly love them.

im not very strong lol im pretty weak but i dont mind. ig i don't really think about guys, or girls, being stronger than me ever. one thing id say though is because giys are generally stronger they can be pretty scary sometimes, i mean aside from the strength, guys can be pretty scary in general. but ive never had a problem with not being ""as strong"", I fence and that's more about technically than sheer muscle so ive never had a problem facing guys in that either. 


sexism is a lot to get into and talk about, ill just say it's not wholesome 100


I've learn my lesson, i don't use voice chat anymore because guys are too obnoxious

it can suck but you learn to live with it, it's not like it's on your mind 24/7

yes

lmao yeah... ive caught myself more times than id like to admit just thinking about boys lol but it's not at all like the only thing i do in my freetime

sometimes i think about how stuff would be different, being a guy, some things i think would be a lot easier but i like being girl generally. as stereotypical as it might sound i like trying to be pretty, and other girly things lol"
14170,"* In general, my peers seem to be stricter around girls than boys. Boys seem to get the ""boys will be boys"" pass for so many things, it's pretty stupid imo. 
* I do not have any siblings but again, I see that parents (even mine) are more lenient with boys. I hate it. Why can't I fuck around if teenage guys can? 
* What's it like dating... How do I explain this? Being attracted to men is.... fun but frustrating. I recently had a traumatic experience with a guy I'd known for so long and trusted so much. As a victim of sexual assault and with the wound still fresh, I currently think men are cute and annoying and hot but stupid and sometimes selfish. (I know that's not all of you, don't come at me) 
* Those quotes around ""weaker than guys"" do not apply in my situation, and many other girls' either. Men are physically much stronger and I don't think many are truly aware of how much this biological disparity in strength affects how women move around the world. My former partner was nearly twice my weight and had the physical capability to kill me with his bare hands (he would never have done that though). It's actually terrifying living in a world with half the population so much stronger. 
   * To add onto that, I saw another comment about this a while back, something like ""Men: Imagine living in a forest full of gorillas, 4-9 times stronger than you. Fully capable of killing you in a few minutes. You're friends with them but they're still capable of overpowering you and doing terrible things. That's how women walk around every day.""
* Sexism... This one's list is going to be long, I don't even know if I should start it. 
* Boobs boobs boobs... My life with mine is chill. They're just there. The last bf often used them as stress balls when I let him lmaoooo. I HATE how much they're sexualized and so offensive to society, though. Like shut up, you know every woman's born with these to feed possible babies, and you know boobs are awesome. 
* uhhhhh???
* In my free time, at the moment with PTSD and anxiety I'm constantly thinking of extremely violent or traumatic scenarios. It's absolute torture cause my brain can't stop doing it. I'm getting help soon. (And sorry to hear about high school bullying)
* In general I don't enjoy all these consequences we have to deal with for being born with 2 X chromosomes. I'm so jealous of how much safer life is for men. (I know men are also vulnerable to attacks and other awful things, but again: strength disparities. And the possibility of getting pregnant from rape. And the likelihood of a judge letting the rapist go. And the chance of a woman being denied an abortion with women's rights in grave danger right now) 
   * I gotta add how insensitive society is towards menstruation... So many people act like it's disgusting and it's a sin, blah blah blah... Look, people. None of you would be here if a lady's cycle didn't exist. Sit down. There are cultures out there that see it as a curse and women are shamed and forced to isolate while menstruating. In many places, period care products still aren't considered ""essential."" (E.g., in the US, we pay a ""tampon tax"" because of this) (It's like women CHOSE to get periods. What.) So many girls out there are embarrassed to talk about periods because of how people react to it. Shit needs to change."
14171,I talk about my sexuality and crushes all the time with my best friend one person who I trust with my life
14172,"On a consistent basis I get people online- boys- maybe jokingly saying how women aren’t funny, and if I express even the slightest discontent with the comment, I’m immediately bagged on and seen as the dumb one in the situation. I don’t even know these people that say it, and they don’t know me other than that I’m a girl. I don’t understand why wanting equal rights and being a feminist is somehow embarrassing or sad. The fact that the word ‘feminist’ has been dragged through the mud says a lot about the type of society that we live in. However, this is just applicable to that small fraction of men who are afraid of a comedic woman and can’t handle when *a girl* is funnier than them."
14173,Getting the fucking niagara falls of blood every month.
14174,"
>I’m quite scrawny so I’m weaker than most people, and I’m short which doesn’t help.

I was thinking more specifically about just sort of gender roles and how women are """"""supposed to be weaker then men"""""", but you kind of answered that in your other response about jobs.

Also, I'm pretty scrawny, and yet I'm surprisingly strong in my arms and my legs. So, you never know.

>I’m bad at most games because I just play them to have fun y’know

And that's about all that really matters.

>And I hate wearing bras so much, when I’m naked you can literally see red marks from my bras.

I ain't a girl so I could be wrong, buuut I think your bra is too small for you

>But if my boobs are hurting cuz I’m on my period, and I decide to go braless I’m called a slut :(

Calling people a slut because they're braless is kinds cringe nlg"
14175,"Nah my bra isn’t too small, my skin is just sensitive as hell, I went up a size because of this issue and the cups were just empty and it was falling off me lol"
14176,Shit
14177,"All I’m gonna say is I never said men don’t experience bad things. I’m just sayin what experiences I’ve had as a girl as the original question asked. No need to blow it out of proportion. I never said I wanted guys to stop talking about things they like, including boobs. I said I wish they weren’t so over sexualized and treated like some offensive body part by society. There’s a bunch of other stuff you mentioned in your comment that I don’t ever recall saying. 

And nah, I’ll discuss my experience as a girl as much as I want to thanks :)"
14178,Me too smart
14179,jeez wanna talk about it lol
14180,"1. Girl’s sleepovers go two ways. (Middle school age.) Either you’re with really close friends and you watch movies, eat snacks, and attempt to “pull an all nighter” but pass out before 3, or you’re with acquaintances/not friends and you’re a little bit uncomfortable the whole time. You get asked questions in truth or dare that you don’t want to answer, (usually who you like,) but you do because they’ll make fun of you if you don’t. You’re scared to fall asleep because they were joking (or not?) about colouring on the face of whoever falls asleep first with a permanent marker. 

2. I am a girl and have one brother. My dad took my brother hunting and passed down his hobbies to him. My mom did music and crafts with me and passed down her hobbies to me. My dad attempted to do activities with me when I was younger, but would only do what he was interested in. When he learned I didn’t like that, he stopped doing things with me. I was constantly told that I needed to learn things because I would “be a mother/wife one day.” My brother was just given a couple chores here and there. To this day, (I’m close to 19, he’s 22.) I clean up his dishes, I replace the garbage and toilet paper when he overfills it/uses it all, I clean up our shared bathroom counter. He doesn’t even make an effort. I wish my parents had drilled into BOTH of us the need for basic cleanliness/skills, not just me.

3. It’s scary. You don’t know if they’re going to actually pursue a relationship or if they just want to see your boobs. You’re so excited to meet them for a date, so you text your friends pictures of different outfits and get their opinion to choose the perfect one. You get ready early so you can get your hair/makeup done perfectly. Then he comes to get you and he’s dressed like normal or sloppier, and just calls you “hot” or something so you feel like he’s just after a one night stand the rest of the date. If he’s actually invested in conversation and asking questions/listening to your answers, you get overly excited and he ghosts you a few days later because you were “too much.” If he’s not, he’ll sit there and act cool the whole time because he thinks you’ll find him macho. In reality I’m just sitting there feeling out of place and wondering if I made a mistake coming. 

If you actually get into a real relationship, it’s great but you always feel like you’re doing something wrong. Like if he did something to upset you, you don’t want to show it and just end up saying you’re “fine” so he doesn’t think you’re some crazy girlfriend. 

4. It’s annoying but sometimes nice. I work at a restaurant as a dishwasher and the chef, (who I am good friends with) will always offer to dump out the mop water bucket for me because it’s heavy. I said no the first time and attempted it myself, but it genuinely was fuckin heavy and I spilled it everywhere. So now I just let him do it. Sometimes guys will just grab things out of my hands saying it’s because I’m “too weak,” which pisses me off. Or they won’t let me try something because they think I won’t be able to lift it. In general I know it’s a fact that men are physically stronger than women, I just don’t like when they rub it in. As a helpful gesture it’s nice.

5. I could go on about this for DAYS. Everyone has different opinions, so I just try to stay away from those who I know hold opinions that anger me. I know people who are angry that my parents are “letting” me go to college to pursue a career. People have said my two small tattoos make me look like a trashy whore. I’ve been followed in my car, down the street, and catcalled by big groups of men. 

Here’s a small tangent about catcalling, by the way. It first happened to me when I was 12. I was walking down the street in my tiny hometown, and a group of college aged guys in the back of a pickup truck slowed down beside me and started screaming about my ass and boobs. They were all yelling over each other so I couldn’t make it all out, but I specifically heard the words “rape” and “bitch.” I was wearing floral shorts and a hot pink t shirt with a giant heart on the front. I had a clip bow in my hair. I LOOKED 12. I was around 5’2, probably 100lbs and there were 7 of them, and they were big. I started sprinting down the street and they pulled the car over and got out to follow me. I had to hide crouched down between shelves in the tiny corner store until they stopped loitering out front. I thought I was going to be raped and killed, and knowing they were that much bigger than me and there was nothing I could physically do to stop them was terrifying.

As for video games, I just play the ones I like and I don’t try to flaunt it or make it my personality. If guys or girls like the same game, they don’t seem to care that much if I’m a girl playing it. I don’t play multiplayer online or talk to people during it though. I have had a couple guys poke fun but I don’t really care about them.

6. It’s heavy. I physically can’t do jumping jacks without a sports bra or it hurts. I have to hold them when I run up stairs. Some part of me is always slightly uncomfortable because you have to adjust them. Also guys stare. I’ve figured out that if I face a guy but don’t look directly at him then suddenly make eye contact, he will 9 times out of 10 quickly look away because he was staring at my boobs. This has happened with countless men between my age and upwards of 50/60.

7. Not a clue.

8. I think about either what I have to be doing at that time, whatever pop culture thing I’m into at the moment, or something completely random like wondering exactly how tall the Eiffel Tower is. If I like a guy at the time I’ll think about him randomly throughout the day. I also will watch shows/movies, play video games, or scroll through social media. I listen to a lot of music. I also spend a lot of time on my hobbies. (Drawing, painting, piano, etc.)

I know this is long, but I deal with this bs every day and it’s exhausting, so I figured I might as well share."
14181,That’s not what I’m saying dude. I hate how we’re blamed for falling victim to sexual harassment and assault because we were “distracting the learning environment.” Take dress codes. My school tried to start one lemme tell you it didn’t work well with the girls at all. Why should girls have to hide their bodies more when we can teach others to control themselves more and that harassment is wrong? Clothes have nothing to do with harassment/assault anyway. Why are women shamed for breastfeeding in public? Our bodies aren’t offensive. They’re just human bodies. No girl here needs you coming up to her and trying to challenge everything she said and telling her to shut up when she talks about her experiences as a girl. I’m sure you wouldn’t like it either if you shared your experiences as a guy and girls came up to you doing the same thing.
14182,"hahahahaha NO lol 
ABout ur anxiety it's god too be anxious buuuut not when it negatively effects ya mental health."
14183,"Oh no lol everyone has anxiety i think and i get anxious when i text people in dms anyways so that wouldnt be a great idea lmaoo

Thank you tho thats very kind :)"
14184,"Well maybe you and your friends don’t, but also, you’re 14, you know? Not in a bad way or anything. Maybe you guys just aren’t there yet. But I know for a fact my guy friends talk to each other and to me about their crushes, and though less often and way more awkwardly but they also talk about their sexuality."
14185,dope
14186,"Damn, that's a terrifying story, I'm sorry that happened to you and probably other girls as well. I hope that you carry pepper-spray with you nowadays"
14187,"You’re getting upset by interpreting everything I say as some stereotype about guys and then stating stereotypes about girls, saying they cheat and gold dig. I don’t find talking about so much bad stuff very comfortable either but this doesn’t help anybody involved. If you’ve had past negative experiences inflicted on you by girls or them being ignorant to guys’ struggles, I’m sorry you had to go through that and you didn’t deserve it, but it’s only toxic for others and yourself wherever you bring it."
14188,"1. Most of my friends are guys. They mainly act the same around me as they do with the rest of the boys. They've accepted me as one of their own lol. Never had a sleepover tho.

2. That I don't know the answer to. My parents are pretty strict, so I would imagine that they would raise them the same.

3. Dating is pretty chill. I would imagine it feels just as good as a guy. It's just a sense of euphoria. 

4. I haven't actually thought of that one too into detail. 

5. Sexism is just ehh. No bueno. 

6. Video games are dope. Because my parents are strict, I haven't actually gotten a chance to play all the games I want to, but I keep up with a few games. 

7. I have smol size, its kinda just there

8. It sounds like they would. 

9. In my freetime? I think about what the fuck I'm eating later. Maybe games, and maybe thinking of browsing subs for memes to send to my bf. 

Ye thats pretty much it, all the answers to your questions because I'm not creative enough to come up with my own to answer."
14189,"1. I'm in a all girls school, so I don't know how my friends act around boys. But I do know that if they have a crush on someone they becmone super shy around them (hehe)
2. I don't think there's much of a difference between how my brother and I were raised, but it feels like my mum likes me more and my dad likes my brother more..
3. For me, I'm not super into dating, cos I feel like boyfriends are gonna take a lot of effort which I'm not willing to put in and commit to a relationship especially at my age. But I do have some friends who can wait to have boyfriends.
4 and 5. Those go together kinda. I don't get the ""girls are weaker"" stereotype from anyone for now, but I think it shouldn't be like that. In my school cos we're all girls there's no sexism.
6. I don't play video games, because my parents don't allow us.
7. At first it's kinda weird, but after a while you get used to it I guess. Wearing a bra can sometimes be uncomfortable tho :/ Also mine aren't massive
8. I've never heard of that hahaha
9. When I think usually think a lot about the past, and people I miss, the memories we had. Honestly I'm not that interested in boys so I don't think about them that much. I pretty much just think about anything I want to.
10. I don't think it's very much different being a boy/girl. It's like we are mostly the same, there aren't so different expectations anymore :)"

There are many LGBTQ+ people out there but sad thing is, not many support them.."
14221,Yeah but there are still a lot of people who are anti-LGBT for whatever reason. Usually they use the excuse of the bible but they all wanna have sex before marriage so we know that's bs. I honestly think it's just some fear of either breaking societal norms or it's just a desire to oppose the left wing
14222,"i think millenials are as accepting now but when my sister(millenial)  was in highschool, no one dared to come out as gay while in my school multiple ppl identify as lgbtq"
14223,"I’d say yes but also no?? I’m LGBTQ+ so of course I support it lol but there are those types of girls who are like “omg I want a gay best friend” and then think that bisexual/lesbian women are predators or some shit

But there definitely still is a struggle, like in other countries and even some states in the US. But, same sex marriage is legal in the US, the community still struggles with trans rights, equality, and often times acceptance from family and close friends"

I wouldn't call him homophobic. If anyone he knew well told him that they were homosexual, he would respect it.

He's just had bad experiences with people who are homosexual, and I'm not calling them bad either.

You dont need to continue to try and call me transphobic or anything, I do not care what you do until your rights step on my rights."
14244,Yeah I think nowadays it’s only far right people who are against it
14245,"ooh ok thank you for clarifying,that’s 100% ok"
14246,"proof being lgbtq+ isn’t natural that isn’t from an anti lgbtq+ source. also you are homophobic than there is no getting around it. if you don’t treat gay people like you do straight people )gay marriage,gay adoptions,gay people on tv,in kids toys,ect) you are pretty homophobic."
14247,What’s it like living there as a girl
14248,"I have a friend who's quite similar to yours. She doesn't hate on LGBTQ+ people, but has had bad experiences with them. Once a few friends of our explained to her how it works, she's become more accepting. I'm not saying she used to be homophobic, she didn't really mind the lgbtq community, but she didn't really care for them either."
14249,yes thankfully the us is improving in the way we treat lgbtq+ people. also fun fact guys if you don’t know if what you’re saying is homophobic replace the word gay with a race or something. EXAMPLE: if you say “i don’t like gay people getting married” try “i don’t like mexican people getting married”. if it sound racist it’s probably homophobic too.

14285,"The hoe. Not a label I particularly like, it sucks cause guys only see you for that and girls hate you before even getting to know you. Plus ppl create some rumors that got me rolling lmao like how much creativity do you have?

Also some moms dont really like their kids hanging out with me, even though I would consider myself to be a good influence. But go off ig. It's just unfair"
14286,"uhhh...normal?

i have lots of friends around school, im kinda outgoing and other times i just stick with my friends."
14287,"Excessive endowment down below... i hope thats a PG enough way to say it. 

Its a label that be take good or bad but in terms of how people know you, i would say its not the best label to be known by...
(Sorry)"
14288,Band kid
14289,"Outcast. Definitely outcast. For all of my time in school I've struggled to fit in with any group of people. I'm a metal head and a nerd while everyone around me were drama students, stereotypical stupid people and the smart kids. I'm in college now so I'm in a friend group of people similar to myself where we all don't really fit in with the stereotypical social groups that exist in school."
14290,... your penis? People called you a nickname based on your dick? What year is this
14291,"The tall silent type 

Or maybe the reader

I don’t take a light 

My lungs aren’t that meager 

I’m cool with everyone 

It’s easy to tell

But when I go back to school 

God I hate the starting bell."
14292,Why Horse..?
14293,shy commie 😷
14294,"Nope, definitely everywhere in real life."
14295,"im basically the emo girl, and if you know me then im the one who can draw"
14296,2020
14297,How tf do they know
14298,I hope some people try to get to know who you really are more than that label.
14299,"Same bro. Play drums for school events and play in a band. I’m known by other year levels as the kid who played the PH theme at an assembly, (Got suspended) kinda my claim to fame."
14300,Yeah everyone secretly hates them ngl
14301,Tuba
14302,"I’m known as the ‘smart kid’. People will come up to me, say ‘you’re smart, can you ...’ nobody except for my few friends really know anything about me except that I have good grades."
14303,Thank u
14304,"don’t really have one, kinda blend in with the masses."
14305,Whatcha play
14306,I’m ‘the computer nerd’ even people in years above or below me come to me for help/advice. At first it was flattering but it’s annoying now
14307,Nice
14308,Mmmmm watcha plaaaaaay
14309,Let’s just say that about half a school of 1000 kids laughing is gonna raise some eyebrows and eventually some kids gonna talk to a teacher
14310,Ugh same. It's so exausting trying to talk to some people especially if you don't want to. There's the good friends you could spend hours with and then there's the ones which can annoy you by breathing to hard
14311,"I don't socialise with boys at all (not kidding, i am in a girls school), but my friends really do not understand mean/teasing sense of humour. I tend to insult my closest friends the most, and some of them just don't get it :/

I guess i would have more meaningful friendships with boys, but back when there were boys around in school, shipping was real. (I LITERALLY only took a photo with a dude for official school purposes, and the next moment, people were childishly shipping us together......)"
14312,"i’m definitely not on of the “i’m only friends w boys, girls at too much drama😒” girls, but i rly wish i had more boy friends bc i tend to have a very mean/teasing sense of humor which,if  i’m correct, seems more common in guy friendships."
14313,"Yes. Some friends only have very boring interests like 'work' and... well, work. Then there are a few friends with whom I make music for instance, or can talk about more silly stuff or morally gray stuff. Hard to explain that last one without being downvoted... Anyway, you can probably guess which friends are more exhausting to hang out with."
14314,"I wish i had that......Male friendships seem to be more relaxed than female ones (the GOSSIPING, the DRAMA 😖)"
14315,[deleted]
14316,I just make every conversation awkward :/ Or maybe it's just me who thinks it's awkward. I'm way too self conscious. :D
14317,"yeah. they always get it but they don’t really make teasing jokes back at  me, so i just feel like an asshole. i don’t want them to get hurt you know"
14318,"nah not really, as long as they’re not annoying as fuck"
14319,"That might be because of the different contexts in which you see your friends. When you’re in regular class you usually don’t have lots of fun and talk to people because it’s still better than sitting in a boring class, however when you’re practicing a sport you have a lot more energy and generally have a lot more fun than when you’re in a classroom. This energy makes you more capable of socializing because you’re talking to people who have the same interest as you and so you naturally enjoy spending time with people similar to you, if that makes sense. 

The best way not to become drained of other people is to have common interests with them, I’d suggest finding something like that with your school friends if it isn’t the case already. If it is, then I guess you’ll have to either find a new group of friends or remain with this one, idk"
14320,My social anxiety makes me feel exhausted socializing with anyone except my really really close friends
14321,"before covid, my friend group got so stressful and tiring, there would be like one or two ppl I'd talk to saying like can they calm tf down. but at the same time I secretly lived for the drama lmao. I feel like this was not helpful at all but like ah well"
14322,Yes exactly 🥱🥱
14323,"Unrelated but your dog's adorable, I have a German shepherd to, his name's onyx :)"
14324,"not for me :,)

ANYWAY the drama is pretty fun ngl"
14325,"That explains a lot, thanks for elaborating. And no problem, I hope you’ll find new people you enjoy being around"
14326,"DRAMA IS AMAZING

as long as yu know who yur real friends r then drama is jks honestly"
14327,Thank you so much :D
14328,Awww
14329,"Im in a class full of girls, can i dm you to get some tips about talking so im not silent all the time"
14330,Most groups of people
14331,"This is normal. I have a friend group for my classes because I’m gifted and I have a friend group outside of school. My class views me extroverted while my outside of school friends view me introvert. I talk a lot and am pretty dumb in class but when I’m with my friends outside of school let’s say there is only 4 spots in a game, I pass and let them go. I usually go to sleep early in sleep in. I don’t really interact with them much unless it’s like birthdays. So yeah I get your situation and there are multiple people at my school with about your situation. If you don’t feel comfortable good luck getting out but if your fine have a good day."
14332,"Way too often, tbh. I, myself just try to isolate from people who exhaust me"
14333,"No, since I am an introvert. If you feel exhausted around anyone it probably means you are introverted."
14334,"Really, I feel exhausted from any kind of socializing."
14335,"Yeah most people tbh. I am very lucky I have a few friends who I totally and completely adore and, although 2 of them arent at school (they're girls and I'm at an all boys school) we still feel very close. Hang in there"
14336,"I would say that in my school, it is equally stressful in class and at trainings. Our lessons are generally fun, and trainings are grueling, considering that our team is top 4 in our country. I usually talk to my classmates about politics, which can be quite serious, so perhaps it is about the common interest.

Something i didn't bring up is the fact that i have never had a best friend. One of my classmates was what i thought to be my best friend, but we had an argument last year, where she really hurt my feelings. I just can't unhear it. It made me question everything she says, and I became very self conscious. She is the only friend that knows everything about me. (I have only been with my teammates for a year) I really hope that we would be in different classes next year so i can start anew.

At this point, I am just ranting. Thank you so much for the advice. :D I will try to find new friends :)"
14337,It's interesting to see people who enjoy drama 😅 (i feel that dramas are nuisances)
14338,"Thanks for the assurance, have a nice day! :D"
14339,"I would isolate from those people, but i don't have the courage to do so and i have no one else to talk to in my class...... :("
14340,"you're 2nd after your dad.

14356,No you're not
14357,Probably slap them with the notepad
14358,Idk prob give them an 1 rating on yelp
14359,Kidnap the dad. Then he’ll always be next best. Cant upgrade

*C O N C E R N*"
14362,"Bruh... that's a good Idea lmaoo, I can stop laughing"
14363,Well you don't really get a choice in the matter.
14364,i’d walk away cause fuck em for that
14365,Call him a creep and walk away
14366,"Honestly, I'd probably just stand there quitely."
14367,"Take out my phone and make a voice recording saying “one down, two left to go” then walk away"
14368,Damn there’s just a pill for everything huh
14369,i won’t even know what to say lmao
14370,"no

but like

im kinda in the opposite situation"
14371,😳
14372,One time I was speaking to a few random boys on discord and out of nowhere they just started saying that I sounded attractive. It was very awkward
14373,"To be fair voices can be super cute. 

But yeah weird comment, other ways to say that lol."
14374,"Oh, yeah. It makes me feel really weird, because I don't want to ask them to stop if they are just joking."
14375,"*""Your hair are sooo soft.... anyway I'm 28 years old and from Philippine""* bruh 💀💀💀💀💀💀 that dude needs to get a life"
14376,I had a 28 yo lmao
14377,naw that’s a weirdchamp
14378,We were talking about gaming and stuff and then one of them just said ‘hard pp’ and they all started simping and it was very weird
14379,Same bro 😀
14380,I feel like getting the vibes are worse than actually knowing if they do or don’t like you
14381,I've had two online people admit to liking me but it only ever happened twice and they both knew me for months
14382,I had a guy send a really creepy voice message that was basically exactly that
14383,It do be like that
14384,oh yeah wtf
14385,"I personally feel like it’s awkward. Like you can tell it someone sort of like you, but  you don’t want to break it up you know what I mean"
14386,👁️👄👁️ umm.......u only told me about it
14387,"Nope, nothing to like about this side 😃👍"
14388,[deleted]
14389,"Yes, she was very nice but It felt very weird."
14390,it be like that
14391,Ohhhhh oops lol
14392,It used to happen to me on instagram a lot when my bio said single in it. Then I changed it to not taken and it stopped. Idk why.
14393,All the pedos that lurk this sub
14394,Bruh
14395,YES YES YESYETSYEYSYEYYES
14396,Same I wish this happened to me ngl
14397,Yup lol. Also had one dude lie and say he was 16 (he was 24 I think). Then another strung me along thinking he was chill until the next day before turning pervy.
14398,🤣🤣
14399,They are probably just desperate people please ignore them
14400,"I think this wins, and thank you; it’s really nice quality for how cheap it was"
14401,So when she steals it you can call her a snack
14402,Oh shit true
14403,[deleted]
14404,"Meat is a snack? What's a meal, then?"
14405,Add vegetables and a starch
14406,Hell yeah lmao
14407,there is no way to explain it. it will probably make u look like lady gaga w her meat dress tho
14408,Because it's amazingly cool
14409,I mean is it a bad thing to look like lady Gaga?
14410,NEVER
14411,Tell her you got it so you can fry it using her super-flaming hotness.
14412,show up to a date with it
14413,Why do you have it tho? Why not just tell her the truth?
14414,Okay so tell her that lolz
14415,MEAT
14416,You don’t have to who doesn’t want a raw beef hoodie
14417,I dont know what that is
14418,"Tbh I don’t know why I got it, I guess I just thought it was funny now I like it"
14419,You wear it when you beat your meat
14420,"""I got this jacket because it's epic as fuck and I feel no shame in wearing it""


beware though, she might notice you're the average person who spends money on stuff just because it looks cool. 


Jokes aside I like the hoodie dude its sick lmao"
14421,because it's a fucking dope ass hoodie
14422,"That's very dangerous, if I was her I would steal it immediately"
14423,I did and I couldn't tell what it was a d still cant
14424,"Well, why did you?"
14425,Because you're a snack
14426,"Well, I mean, if she steals it, her answer will be she wants your meat bro."
14427,Look on the profile comrade
14428,I thought it was funny also I needed a hoodie and I don’t think she’s gonna steal this one but I’m not sure
14429,She’ll look like a snacc
14430,[deleted]
14431,I just say “are you dating someone” unless I know for a fact what their sexuality is
14432,"Heteronormativity 😋😋

I usually don't ask but I would probably ask like, oh are you dating someone? I try to avoid gender"
14433,Funny story: I was in the teachers lounge talking to my HS principal about the upcoming junior students joining my grade (keep in mind I’m lesbian) and I said to my principal who’s a man “are they cool?” And a director of another HS program quipped in and said “Did you mean to ask if there are any cute boys?” And y’all I looked at my principal and awkwardly looked away and said “no not really it’s quite the opposite actually...” the room goes silent and everyone went 😳
14434,"And this answer makes me consider what I don't think of. As a cis female, I still think of gender and am not being considerate of NB and gender fluid individuals. I'm actually glad I asked it."
14435,YES! That would include all genders!
14436,[removed]
14437,"Why is your principal so chill lmao

All those that I've met were super strict and ""no fun allowed"""
14438,[deleted]
14439,"It's ok it's not ur fault, society's got some changin to do"
14440,Well ya heteronormativity 98% of the population is straight
14441,I assume first and if they say no I ask about the other gender. I'm mostly pan myself and I really don't mind if someone assumes I'm straight.
14442,He’s both ahhaha
14443,I always ask if someone has a partner if I don’t know
14444,i asked a guy if he had a girlfriend or a boyfriend and he took it like i was trying to offend him
14445,[removed]
14446,I love that
14447,"I usually ask if they're in a hetero relationship, followed by a ""or [same gender] if you swing that way"""
14448,"I only ask if they are in a relationship, avoiding the assumption of heteronormativity (and cisnormativity). But who am I kidding I am like the ultimate useless lesbian, I don’t ask at all, lol."
14449,"Most of my family (especially my uncle) has always said bf...or girlfriend. But always girlfriend a bit after. But it still felt nice know that they were going to accept me when I realized I was gay. And my parents have never really asked me about boys, I think they've just always asked me about ""my love life""."
14450,Where I'm from most of us are traditional. Even people my age are usually very against LGBT stuff. So no I say what I expect a straight person to have
14451,"Conservative or liberal is irrelevant, gays make up like 2-4 percent of the population. Generally, it’s safe to assume that the person you are talking
to is heterosexual."

14453,"I'd just ask ""are you dating?"" Cishets can be easily offended by others questioning their sexuality from my experience. Of course not all of them, but some of them.  
  
I don't assume much especially since my social circle is pretty diverse in LGBT and stuff. I personally wouldn't be offended if anyone asked me if I had a boyfriend or girlfriend if it was someone in the same general social circle (like friends and mutual friends) as me, but if a random person asked me that I'd be kind of offended (like they were assuming something about me based off of my looks, which I advise against wholeheartedly).  
  
So there's my take"
14454,tbh i don’t want anyone being uncomfortable have having me guess their sexuality so i just say “are you dating anyone?”

edit: sorry he i forgot men were allowed to post on here"
14477,Yes it’s called petrichor
14478,"Yeah, who can't?"
14479,Yeah I understood it the trans way.
14480,"Idk it’s really specific, like a fresh scent"
14481,I believe both of these are true
14482,"Heyyy I thought people might find it interesting: 

Petrichor (/ˈpɛtrɪkɔːr/) is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil. The word is constructed from Greek petra (πέτρα), ""rock"", or petros (πέτρος), ""stone"", and īchōr (ἰχώρ), the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology."
14483,Is it possible to learn this power

14508,"My country is weird because we're deemed as LGBTQ friendly and we have lots of representation in media yet after all that we still don't have gay marriage available.

I think main reason is religion. I mean 90% of us are like Catholic and the church here doesn't really have any grudge against it and people regardless of gender still go to church.  I think it's just like, *traditions* you know. It's kinda sad but people just go somewhere else to get married and go back home."

14551,"It can happen in a lot of ways. For example body just doesn't produce eggs. I don't know mutch, but this is one of the ways.
Edit: spelling"
14552,I woke up to my sister sobbing because she was puking all over the bathroom. She thought she was pregnant with her ex-bf's child. I secretly bought a pregnancy test and turned out she wasn't. Most frightening hours I had.
14553,"Ok this is going to sound really stupid.

 During an experimental time a friend of mjnr and I were stoned out of our mind and decided to fool around a little.

And after we were done she asked me if I took the pill. I didn't and she freaked out, making me start to freak. Like it wasn't a panic attack. But we where both losing our shit. Googling if its fine if only one girl took the pill etc. Since we couldn't find anything online (shocker) we decided to ask for perantal advice.

She called her mom crying on the phone to telling her what happened. Idk what her mother must have thought from the very start. But she explained to us basic human anatomy (that 2 biological girls can't get each other pregnant)"
14554,Every time I’m .00000001 second late for my period
14555,happened to me more than id like to admit in my last relationship and have bought A LOT of plan b... realized my boyfriend was sexually manipulative and my body is my long term responsibility so i left him.

But how does that even work?"

14559,"One of my internet friends said that his gf said she was pregnant , this was a lie. And a girl who is friends with my friends thought she was pregnant and i dont think she took the morning after pill  ( she wasn’t pregnant)"
14560,I’ve gone through a pregnancy scare once. My period didn’t show up while on my pill break and I panicked. The fear Really ate me alive. Pregnancy test was negative.
14561,Good for you
14562,Have you never heard of a woman who can't get pregnant??? Like ever? I'm mind blown.
14563,Huh. That's something I didn't know was possible. I swear it wasn't covered when I was learning the topic.
14564,Call the Vatican. I just might be the next virgin Mary
14565,"I'm cackling, I don't even know how to respond to this lmao. Glad you're all good now"
14566,"Nope, can’t get pregnant if you’re lonely 😌✌🏾"
14567,I’m lesbian anyways so it’s not like I will ever get pregnant
14568,"even if you were never taught, it makes sense that humans can glitch and something cant work"
14569,Too many times but never bought the morning after pill because in my country they have to be prescribed to you
14570,I have never had that problem but a friend of mine had to get the morning after pill once
14571,Jesus Christ reddit
14572,"I remember being secretly terrified thinking that I was pregnant because I was having morning sickness symptoms for around a week but didn’t tell my boyfriend because he’s far more terrified and cautious about things like this than I am, but it turned out to be nothing lmao. A friend of mine, on the other hand, almost certainly was pregnant but lost it when she was hit in the stomach in a fight with another girl before she could do anything about it or get herself tested, though I still feel sad for her that she never got to make that choice for herself."

14601,"You sound like one of those “chivalry is dead” chanters. That’s a problem. There’s a difference between “being a man” and “being a good boyfriend” and tbh, none of this except for apologizing makes a guy any better of a boyfriend unless he consistently goes to a bar instead of spending time with you.

If you’d turn a guy down for him not letting you wear his hoodie, you don’t deserve him

Imagine if a guy said “a girl turns into a woman when she: -crosses her legs when sitting -apologizes -picks you over the salon -lets you wear her scrunchie

14691,"Oh I *hate* it. It takes forever and you rarely find what you’re looking for. 

It’s not so bad when I shop by myself or with my dad, he goes into a store and grabs what he needs quickly. But shopping with my mom and sister is hell. 

I remember Christmas two years ago, I went shopping with them (unwillingly, mind you) and we were in the same mall for **8 HOURS.** Not only were we there for so long, I was also sick with a cold, on my period, and we didn’t eat all day. Somehow, they weren’t hungry, and were having a wonderful time! Meanwhile, I did nothing but bitch the whole time. And they just shrugged me off, saying I was just whining because I don’t like shopping but you know what? I think being sick, cramping, and starving gives me every right to bitch. 

Yeah I’m still not over this okay"

Sex is pleasurable having to deal with children and spending a lot of money is not. And not everyone wants to have children. Fathers can leave them, mothers can leave them. It’s like you’re saying “sex bad, everyone should want kids.”"

yes


we do"
14708,"See, that’s the slippery slope argument I **hate.** 

I doubt you’ve ever had an abortion (I haven’t myself) but I’ve cared for a friend after she had one- IT IS NOT FUN. It’s not like “la dee da da okay baby gone let’s go pARTAY-“ a lot of times it’s a big, badass pill that forces a miscarriage- or even a surgery. 

I don’t know a woman out there who would *ever* choose to have that happen to her (especially not multiple times) instead of using a contraceptive. 

I think that fallacy soaked argument is just trying to slut shame women."
14709,"As a male, we do not claim this one."
14710,:)
14711,I fully support abortion
14712,i think it should always be up to the mother. why should a man have *any* say in what happens in a woman’s body?
14713,"i think you meant legal everywhere, lol.

i just think that getting an abortion truly only affects the parents of the child and there are usually good reasons behind it. there's no reason someone else should care, if you don't want an abortion then fine. but don't judge someone who isn't capable of caring for a baby and wants to terminate."
14714,Im pro choice but personally would probably never abort.
14715,Especially in the more poor countries where birth control is expensive and the education is bad
14716,"THANK YOU. i read an article about that and i was going to link it but i couldn't find it again. 

it's not a baby until it's born. it's an embryo, then a fetus. taking abortion away will mean mothers will die, babies will be abused or left, and children will be uncared for."
14717,:)
14718,That’s perfectly reasonable.
14719,"I'm definitely pro choice, but I don't know how I feel about very late term abortions, like after 25 weeks. Overall I'm completely pro choice, I don't understand why people feel the need to dictate womens bodies and choices."
14720,I subortion
14721,"I am a very, blazing pro-choice because this issue strikes close to home. 

If you aren’t ready for a kid, you shouldn’t have one. It’s as simple as that. If it isn’t your kid, it isn’t your business what a woman does with her body. If you aren’t going to stick your arm up, volunteer to take that kid, raise it as your own because mom can’t- it isn’t your business. 

You can feel however you’d like about abortion personally, a lot of pro-choice people would never do it themselves but want everyone to have the option- just in case. It *should* be an option.

Food for thought. Here’s a study that has quantified the many reasons why a woman would receive an abortion. 


https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf

One of the highest, a **73% said they could not afford a baby right now.** As in, they cannot afford to *feed a baby, house, clothe, take care of a baby* right now. Would you rather a child grow up in poverty, starving, living a poor quality of life- with little chances of going to college or getting a better life for themselves, with a slow, painful death- or it just is eliminated from the beginning. 

The adoption system is broken in America. It absolutely is broken. 

https://amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/275370/


If you truly despise the idea of anyone ever getting an abortion: then the way isn’t slut shaming women or blaming women for not using contraceptives- *give them better access to contraceptives.* Numerous studies have found that THIS is how we lower abortion rates. 

TL;DR - Blazing, pro choice liberal rant"
14722,Well said.
14723,i would rather them get aborted than grow up with parents who resent them for being a certain gender
14724,Full support ✌
14725,"if someone is raped at a young age and gets pregnant, they would be too young to have or raise a child so not only would it ruin the child's life, it would ruin their life, but none of this would happen if they got an abortion"
14726,"That's a good point. A better example of an inappropriate or stupid abortion is saying ""my baby is a boy/girl and I didn't want one of those, so I'm going to abort it"""
14727,It’s so crazy that we value the pregnant person’s life????? Also tell me if I’m wrong but you’re not going to be giving birth right? If you feel so strongly you better have adopted 10 children to sit on that high horse of yours
14728,I understand where you’re coming from but I feel like we’ve progressed enough in the medical field with birth control that people are usually boning each other for fun and not thinking about the responsibilities of raising a child.
14729,I mean unless it's one of those people who abort their child for not being the gender they wanted them to be

14735,use quizlet! either make your own sets (imo best for remembering) or search up the topic

14740,I’ll share my secret. Put more effort into homework. Don’t just half ass it and look up answers. I’m not very good at the traditional “looking over your notes” studying but this has helped my reach likely top 3-5 in my grade.

Then after I had gathered up the energy to work again, I worked and shoved the music back to being background noice."

14746,If ur trying to memorize something come up with a rhyme or abbreviation or something
14747,Simply rereading your notes does pretty much nothing - rewriting a paraphrased version of my notes works best for me
14748,Throw ur phone to the other side of them room and put in headphones. Shuffle a good playlist and you won’t be tempted to look at your phone as a distraction to change songs and then see other notifications.
14749,Set up practice tests and what you have a hard time remembering sticks more
14750,"Don't study with friends who take breaks every 15 mins. 

When you are trying to memorize something but you keep forgetting it: write it down 50 times, simple but 
effective. 

Keep telling/reminding yourself that studying is not a hard thing to do, it is YOU who makes this process hard by exaggerating it. When it comes to studying, just be chill, and react like: yeah sure i can do that, why couldn't I? 

Talking to yourself, can be an effective way. Act like there is someone next to you, and that you are helping them understand what you are studying. 
This method helped me a lot when i was studying for university exam."
14751,"this!!!! 
i love quizlet and have literally been using it since third grade. our teachers utilize it as well, but as a naturally competitive person i have realized how much i benefit from the games when doing something that requires memorization (like vocab). our english teacher will assign crazy amounts of words for vocab tests but i find that an hour or two on quizlet and i’m good :)

edit: just wanted to add im a straight a student and this has always worked for me. however, remember diff ppl study differently!! don’t be worried if something like quizlet doesn’t work for you :)"

14755,"Put yourself in a good environment that you’ll always use when you study and try to keep in consistent. Open your window for a breeze, play some jazz, etc. Idk why but when I do these things I actually look forward to studying"
14756,"Remove distractions like your phone. Know what you have to get done. For math or science topics: do practice problems like a shit ton till you really understand the concepts. And do it in 25 minute chunks and then take a 5 minute break. And if you’ve got a ton of hw from 1 class and smaller assignments from others, feel free to switch it up(like do 1/2 the big assignment and then some other class work then go back to it)"
14757,"Find a list of everything you need to know for what you’re preparing for. Immediately take a test on all of these things. This test will tell you what you already know, and what you need to learn. Then, take it slow. Learn one thing every half hour. Just one equation and its uses. Just one event that happened in history. Then, think about this all the time. Think about what you learnt whilst you brush your teeth, or whilst you brush you hair, or even whilst you’re on the toilet. If you ever forget any of it, immediately go and redo everything you did to learn it the first time.

Also, make sure it’s hard to get to a second time. You want to make it as difficult as possible to reach the knowledge you need, because that means it’s too much of a hassle to do if you forget it. You want to dread relearning it so much you have no choice but to remember it, because if you fail to remember it, you will have to do so many difficult things to get to wherever you put your materials.

Then, it’s test day. Revise during every free minute. This is your time to notice what isn’t sticking. If there is anything you still don’t know, find it, and keep repeating it over and over in your head. When you get to the test, you’re immediately going to write it down somewhere. Even if you forget it during the test, you wrote it down, and you can check it. 

Finally, he confident. You want to go into the test wondering how anything could possibly go wrong. You’ve learnt everything you needed to know, and if you didn’t, you wrote it down straight away. You’re going to ace this test, because how could you possibly not?"
14758,"I’d say try to keep your environment fairly inanimate and make it so it’s easy to solely focus on your work. You can study much quicker that way. And for learning a list of things, make things like PEMDAS where it’s a word on saying that helps you remember the list of things."

14760,"I wouldn't say anything I don't mean, I might be a little nicer than normal but if I don't think ur somewhat cute I'm not gonna call u cute to boost ur ego"
14761,if you dont have any compliments why lie tho
14762,Peoppe just dont want to be dicks also some of us probably dont have the highest self esteem so a positive comment may make them feel good
14763,That’s a very heartwarming fact to hear!
14764,"Yeah, exactly. There’s literally very few people who are actually ugly. There’s at least one thing pretty cool about them."
14765,It doesn’t really matter if it boosts them up.
14766,[deleted]
14767,"I don’t fake it, that’s why there’s only some of them I comment on. But none of them I’ve seen were ugly necessarily"
14768,It's just hyping them up. That boost can show and will have an impact. It's not better to say nothing or even call them ugly if they actually are
14769,I’d rather leave a positive impact than nothing at all. And lies come in many different levels. Not all lies are wrong/bad
14770,oh huh. guess I'm just a raging lesbian
14771,because girls are cute. all of them. most people aren't sugarcoating anything
14772,i dont think i sugarcoat things. if i have nothing nice to say then i dont say it at all
14773,"I'm not the kind of person to be mean. If I wanted to comment, I would find something nice to say. 

Otherwise, I just wouldn't comment at all."
14774,"I said this on ATB but I don’t fake shit. If you look more on the less attractive side of things I won’t say anything. This isn’t to say if you didn’t get a reply from me that I think you’re ugly, I either just didn’t wanna type out “you’re so cute!” again orrrr I didn’t see it.

Also cause in the ATG thread.. omg they’re mostly cuties"
14775,whatever.
14776,"ye only comment if you have something good to say, I agree with that"
14777,I don't. If I call someone cute I mean it
14778,I just don't compliment on selfie threads I don't think I can compliment
14779,"I dont think a lot of people lie. I usually don't, not to people online about their appearances. It's honestly really easy to find one positive thing to say, all you need to do sometimes is isolate the part you like. Plus, things like people's hair and face shape sometimes obscure the fact that they have sharp cheekbones, or full lips"
14780,"Personally, I don't. If I find somebody cute or there's an attractive feature about them, I just say it. If I don't find them attractive then I don't say anything. Either way everybody has types."
14781,[deleted]
14782,It’s annoying because even all the rate me subs don’t give accurate ratings.  I have no idea how ugly or good looking I am because they all want to feel good for calling ugly people good looking.
14783,thank you sexy
14784,People are admitting to sugarcoating and lying in the comments
14785,Not really. Who does it hurt?
14786,"Sometimes being too raw and upfront to someone can make them feel really bad about themselves. It isn't 'sugarcoating' it's just being a kind and considerate person and trying to make someone feel good about the parts they are insecure about. If the person recognises (which they usually do) their flaws and doesn't try to fix it, you being a bit harsh about it won't either. There's a saying where if the person can't fix whatever in 5 minutes, don't point it out. It's just not very nice to be very rough about someones flaws."
14787,but what if they're lies
14788,"Here in Austria people would just shut up when they don't have anything to say, but in America, people tend to give fake compliments often. It's just normal there, no matter how much you don't like it, cultures only change slowly. That being said, a lot of compliments on selfies are honest. It's more of an issue when you tell/show someone something irl, they have to respond. They usually don't have the guts to say ""I think that looks awful"", so they lie instead. Here people are more honest usually, but yeah, that's my observation."
14789,That's just wrong. Nothing bad comes from a lie like that. It puts only good into the world.
14790,Even lego has been a bit gendered tho with lego friends for girls which is a bit annoying because original lego was fine.
14791,"I just looked it up and the logo isn't any different, they literally just plastered ""friends"" on the side of it.

Plus who cares if it has been gendered? it's not like it makes any difference it is just plastic blocks."
14792,"Probably. I mean all the boys are ""supposed"" to play with cars and girls with barbies and dolls. I have only found toys like a doctor or a kitchen set that both can play with. 

This is based on my little cousins and I do not have any other experience with other little kids cause I've always played outside with them(no toys)"
14793,"yeah, I remember being embarrassed to ask for a specific toy because it was “for boys”"
14794,"There should be more genderless options, yes. When I was little though, I preferred my gendered toys a bit more, so I think they should just expand the options instead of make them all the same"
14795,"Yes

I feel like gendering toys really just establishes dumb gender roles for children early on

People should just be able to like what they like without worrying about the gendered nature of the thing"
14796,"I liked my Barbie a lot, I had a bear with a bow on her head, I had a kimberly power ranger figure with a changeable head"
14797,I remember being in tears once because I had to wear one of my brothers shirts and all it was was a scooby doo shirt but society does so much to teach girls to “not be like boys” and boys to “not be like girls” that it’s genuinely traumatizing for small children
14798,True. I used to love lego friends and then moved on to lego technic.
14799,[deleted]
14800,"yeah i definitely agree, all the girls toys are about cooking and taking care of babies whereas boys toys are about cars and building"
14801,"Meh its all for better propaganda. I do think most girls play with ""girly"" toys and most guys play with ""boy"" toys. Thats not to say a guy can't play with barbies or vice versa, but I think we all know its generally not like that."
14802,"You are spot on. Everyone here forgets that it is business, if genderless toys were selling well, you would see them everywhere. But they don’t"
14803,to avoid competition within a company
14804,"They’ve actually tested this in primates to see how they differ from us and they found that boy chimps tended to go for Thing like toys such as trucks and tools while girl chimps tended to go for People like toys such as dolls. The hypothesis is, girl chimps/girls are biologically disposed to care more about people than things. This is reflected in job selection too in especially egalitarian societies where girls tend to choose fields such as psychology and health care and boys choose construction and engineering. Of course its not exclusive and we live in a society that lets you do whatever you like, but egalitarian societies that have  really done equality well allow for men and women to differ as they please. 

And the theory is that this is because girls have been the biological carriers of life for all of our existence, so being predisposed to care about people and especially children who are always right no matter what in their formative years is a huge evolutionary advantage to the species. So play abstracts the role. 

But of course the option to choose is the best option because not all boy and girls exclusively like the respective thing and people like toys. Everyone falls somewhere in the middle but the far end of the spectrum is where you see the extreme manifestation like for example in Oil Rig Workers in Alberta are 99% men. They lose their fingers and shit. Idk why any sane person would willingly do that I personally couldn’t imagine it I’d rather work somewhere with gals to chat with. And its warm. 

So toys dont need to be gendered but all the options of people and thing like toys should be available to kids."
14805,[deleted]
14806,I noticed that playing with barbies seemed different for boys and girls. I had two friends that were boys that would always come over because our moms were best friends and we’d end up playing with barbies. There was a lot more screaming and action than when I played with them alone though.
14807,"You can just say 'let boys play with girls toys', but in practice, unless parents are super PC, they're gonna buy toys for kids that are targeted at their kids' gender. By gendering toys your indirectly preventing most kids from playing with the other genders' toys and probably enforcing some gender stereotypes in the process."
14808,"But don't you think that girls have always enjoyed those type of toys? I mean girls do like those that is why they are successful. Being 100% honest did you not want to play with something like a barbie but you really did want to play with something like a hot wheel? Even if you preferred the more 'boyish' toys, many girls preferred the toys that were more girly."
14809,"I don't know the ype of lego I used to play with, never really owned lego because it was always so expensive."
14810,"I'm sure there is probably some natural link to prefering toys of stereotypically girlish things (like young girls identifying with their mother more, maybe?) that might make them want to play with barbies over hot wheels, but I think a large part of why she might've wanted to play with girlish toys more is also because most girls are conditioned to like them from really young anyway. Kinda chicken-and-egg-y, really.

But yeah, some girls will prefer girlish toys and some more boyish toys, and thats exactly the point. Even if statistically more girls prefer girly toys, why not just let them choose the specific toys they like instead of targeting certain toys just at one gender?"
14811,"It is a little different, the girl Lego people can't move their legs, can't customize their clothes (like change body) , they also get  loose for the hair piecesq"
14812,"Yeah exactly. If you think of when you were a kid, most people genuinely preferred the toy that was for their gender. And there us a reason those types of toys ended up being more targeted towards a gender. Most kids don't care at all but some sort of societal views they just want they toys they like."
14813,"I often think the reason why boys and girls play with the toys that are ""meant"" for them is because its what is usually bought for them and if they ask for something that is considered a toy for the opposite gender they get given out to.

I was allowed to get any toy I wanted to as a kid and usually bought toy cars and farm stuff but I remember one day when a boy who was about 4 or 5 wanted a barbie doll and his parents shouted at him and made him leave the shop. That sort of stiff would happen all the time and I always felt bad for the kid."
14814,"I think you're underestimating the number of parents in the world that are just dicks. Even if they're unlikely to refuse, they'd probably say some shit like 'isn't that a girl's toy?' or something- but I'm telling you, some parents definately would care. 

But my point wasn't really that they wouldn't buy those toys when asked, my point was that they wouldn't buy them just when choosing a present themselves, meaning kids get much less exposure to toys for the opposite gender."
14815,"Exactly! And on top of that, making sure that people don't like the toys of their natural gender is just as bad as forcing them to be all gender neutral"
14816,"Kinda, yeah. I don't see the point of gendering them, they're just toys, gender shouldn't define what's more acceptable to play with."
14817,Doesn't exactly matter. Children can play with what they want.
14818,"I always played with boys toys when I was younger despite being a girl and idk it just always made me feel bad to see things being labelled as not for me. It's not a major issue but it does annoy me. 

It's like labelling certain subjects or careers as ""male careers"" - sure most people who end up studying those subjects or doing those careers are male but that doesn't mean we should label them as male subjects male careers. If we do that, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. 

You can't really compare toys and things like careers but I think there's something negative about teaching children that there is something inherently different about boys and girls in terms of personality with no exceptions (as labelling toys by gender suggests). It tells children ""these are the things that boys like and these are the things that girls like"" and that idea can be carried on to later life in the sense of ""these careers are for boys and these are for girls"". 

Even if you think that it's not that big of a deal, there's still the fact that it's pointless. If you categorise toys by type or franchise, children will still be able to find the toys they want. There really is no need to divide by gender."
14819,"TIL the smallest Lego sets cost around $15, while the normal sized sets I'm used too, costed around $30-$40, and the biggest ones, could be over $100, thats some expensive plastic."
14820,I definitely agree with this
14821,"Yes, if they do stuff to make you loathe them"
14822,You talking about erotic love or love to a friend?
14823,a lot of people have stopped loving me b4 so yeah
14824,Either
14825,"yeah, things change and so do people. I'm honestly not quite sure bc I think there's always gonna be that little part of you that still cares about them"
14826,"Absolutely I do, it's 100% possible"
14827,"I mean, yea, that’s how divorces happen
Edit: if this is some sorta deep thing that girls only understand, I’m sorry"
14828,"Yeah true love is unbreakable, changeable? Yes. But eternal"
14829,Yes
14830,"Lol your good, I think everyone has a different opinion on it"
14831,Yes
14832,Idk. I just broke up with my ex for the second time after she started lying about my friend. I know she was lying and manipulative but she was always nice to me and we shared a lot of common interests. In the end if she ever wanted to get back together I honestly don't know what I'd do. I really liked her and I still kind of do. I just know it would end the same way again though.
14833,"You can’t stop loving them out of nowhere but love can go away over time if you don’t give it enough attention it’s a finite resource that we have to take care of 

Or the person you love could break your heart that usually kills it"
14834,"Well, depends. If there is no particular reason - no. If under certain circumstances, yeah, emotions can cool off. Like, if you don't already have time for each other and you can't really talk or you simply... grow out of certain hobbies of yours that connected you, any emotion can die out.

And another situation is when either people change or they show their dark side that had been hiding. An example I can give is from around 8 months ago. So, I had befriended this person (who was a part of a whole 4-person friend group and so I got close with them too), we were very close - playing league, chatting, watching stuff on Discord basically daily, etc. etc. but as time passed, fights started happening and she started acting rudely and we ended up hating each other and I decided it's better for both sides not to communicate at all even if this meant me leaving the whole group."
14835,"That's why my ex-girlfriend broke upwith me so yes, I believe that it can happen"
14836,"Yes, quite obviously."
14837,"yeah, i think people underestimate falling out of love."
14838,"No. In general as a concept, I think so. But personally no. You have to be very de-humanised if this ever has a chance of happening"
14839,"If someone does something too bad for words I believe I can hate them, but some say that to hate someone you must care for them as well"
14840,you know i can i'll block that bitch out
14841,"Yes. 

Ex-best friend. Harbored platonic love for them for six years (e.g. loved then because they were my friend.) I am, as of relatively recently, wholly unconcerned with their existence."
14842,"Absolutely, many people go down a dark path that causes them to get rid of all love they once held, until there is nothing but a writhing mass of hatred left within them. Once someone learns to love, they carry the risk of learning to hate that person/object/hobby they once loved."
14843,"You can stop loving someone, but you can keep the memories of who they were and love them."
14844,"Yes, I've had it happen. Usually only with girlfriends though."
14845,"Passion (the powerful feeling at the beginning of the relationship) will definitely worn out rapidly. Then love, as you call it, will last three to four years. From there, there will only be attachment."
14846,"I think if you love someone, you'll always love them, but not in the way that you want to be in a relationship with them. I don't think you can leave feelings as strong as those. Not truly."
14847,"I think ""care"" Is a better term.
If you care about someone that doesn't stop. But the way in which you care may.

If someone you once cared about betrays you. That love can turn into hate. Usually about equal."
14848,"I know that if you feel legitimate love then you can’t stop feeling it, it hurts sometimes"
14849,"Yes. If the relationship is that badly damaged, I think it’s entirely possible to stop loving them. Because there is a thin line between love and hate"
14850,"Not really, I used to be pretty jealous of my best friend who's pretty, kind of popular, and has had 5+ boyfriends while I've had none, but years of experiencing people's favoritism for her has numbed my jealousy to the point where I'm only really just happy for her. I can't think of many other long-term occasions that I've been jealous and don't find myself randomly jealous."
14851,bruh accurate
14852,"Yeah. When my gf talks to other people it bothers me, like when I’m not included in the conversation. ugh but I’m just unreasonable."
14853,"yes i am, im jealous of other girls bodies and how much better they are in comparison but it’s no big d"
14854,Makes sense
14855,lmao
14856,"nah i’m not jealous, usually i’m p chill about most things. but i do hate being compared to other people. cause it’s like i didn’t think that i lacked anything until you made it clear that i’d be better with something this other person has. so uh not jealous but i don’t like being compared to other cause i’m doin my own thing yk"
14857,"> ugh but I’m just unreasonable.

14870,i guess we have a lot in common. We both have a username with some variation of the word thot in and we’re both pretty lonely
14871,I wouldn’t call myself a jealous person but I get jealous sometimes
14872,[deleted]
14873,"5+ bfs huh, those mustve been some short relationships... unless she woulda break up with one and insta date another"
14874,"Yes, I'm a VERY jealous person - there's this girl that I have a big crush on, but have never even mentioned it to her, and one night out we were at a club with a group of friends, and I saw her making out with one of our friends (a lovely guy) and I just got really upset and jealous for a few weeks, and I noticed that I'd started to act a tad strange around her, and began to think negatively of the guy, even though there was no reason for it, just because I was really envious."
14875,Don’t be upset that other girls have a bigger dick than you :((
14876,I get what u mean
14877,No.
14878,"All the time, I get jealous of my friends having more friends than me, and I get jealous of their accomplishments. It kinda sucks."

14886,When I’m in the kitchen making food my boyfriend comes behind me and does that thing where he puts his head on my shoulders and hand in front of me in a “V” way like he’s holding his own hands (hard to explain lol) but it’s very sweet and I like it as he has trouble with showing physical affection but knows I’m keen to it

3. sitting as close to me as possible.

5. when they just nuzzle their head in my shoulder and go sniff.

remember i have never gotten any of this but i want em more than most people can imagine.

14945,I turn into a super baddass warrior
14946,I think about being with my crush in a few years and us going on a ferry together
14947,that's adorable i hope you guys make it ❤️
14948,I create a character and imagine them in the world of whatever book I’m reading or show I‘m watching
14949,I think about falling in love with someone
14950,"hemsworth brothers, man 😳"

My business revolves around space exploration. I like to think I fall in love with an enemy alien and eventually end the rift between that alien species and the rest of the galaxy.

I know it's a lot but yeah..."

Then he goes and asks to 'give me money to talk about my beauty and give him attention ' or 'I'll ask you weird questions, not creepy tho, at a respectful level' and other weird shit. I said no and he's like 'I'll pay more ' LIKE DID I STUDDER"
14983,"So pure, stay this way"
14984,"Personally, I (a trans girl) don't like the MTF flair because it reminds me of my AGAB and I don't like that. I'd much rather have a transfem flair, which would also be inclusive of non-binary transfeminine folks"

Guess in your case you know the answers."

15023,Especially when they keep asking u to explain the joke to them 🤠🔫 now it's not that f u n n i
15024,"Not really. I usually use proper grammar and spelling, but people do ask my why I don't use ""Slang"". but, sometimes I do say a joke and since it's typed out I have to explain that it's actually a joke."

15034,Sometimes my humor is super dry and people don’t know I’m joking and then I end up having conversations where I’ll say something funny and then it’s like “uh” “...” “um okay lol” “do u not get it” “what”
15035,It's the worst when they haven't met you irl and insted of it sounding cynical it ends up sounding dead serious.
15036,I have another personality for my friends. So they usually get it ig
15037,I connect to this on a spiritual level

15040,yes 🗿
15041,Oi that hurts reading lmaoo
15042,could you explain like the difference of to and too because like i get you say too after something state that you go through it as well like “me too!” but sometimes i feel like i use too as like “too hot” 🧍🏻‍♀️

15111,15f flair is so weird to see
15112,"It could be an evolutionary thing. Back when we were hunting mammoths with spears, it was generally more important to remember that there were bears and wolves in the area, than it was to remember that there were beautiful flower fields in the area. We can generally learn more from negative events, which is why they stick with us"
15113,Damn that's a pretty cleaver explanation
15114,"I think it depends on how pessimistic/optimistic you are. When I'm happy, I tend to recall happy moments. When I'm sad, I tend to recall sad moments.

I don't know why people are more likely to remember negative things on average.

Research has shown that we tend to underestimate our likeability, and that we often overestimate how many people have noticed something embarrasing we did. It may have correlation with our tendency to remember negative things."
15115,"Evolutionarily, I think there was much more danger out there, which was important to remember. I like to think that 'warning' signs keep us away more than 'welcome' signs invite us in. 

It has more of an emotional impact on us. Trauma, both physical and emotional can [change our brains](https://recoverycentersofamerica.com/blogs/how-trauma-changes-the-brain/). 

I also like this quote,
> ""The human race tends to remember the abuses to which it has been subjected rather than the endearments. What's left of kisses? Wounds, however, leave scars."" - Bertolt Brecht"
15116,Dunno man . I like to remember happy stuff more.
15117,Because my brain hates me
15118,I think it tends to leave a bigger emotional mark on us. It's the same thing as when celebs say that they get 100s of positive comments but the 1 bad one is the one they remember
15119,I came here to say this. This is called the negativity bias
15120,I think just as humans the more negative things like embarrassment or sadness just stick with us way harder than happiness maybe because we want to avoid reliving it again?
15121,There’s been studies done on how [a loss hurts twice as more as a gain feels good](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/ie/blog/science-choice/201803/what-is-loss-aversion%3famp). Maybe that has something to do with it?
15122,"Positive emotions are kind of expected, and bad ones make the biggest impact."
15123,I think it's because we might get insecure (?) about it
15124,"To everyone saying it’s evolutionary, i could see that, but I personally think that we just haven’t had that many great things that have made us exceptionally happy. Statistically, if you play a sport in high school, you won’t win a state championship. It’s a very slim chance, so the overwhelming majority of people just have more heartbreaking things than joyous things as a teenager. I feel like I was blessed to have such great experiences as a child that I will never forget, and I personally feel as if I have the bad and good around 50/50, and I feel lucky."
15125,"It's biology, you remember it better so you never do it again [basically]"
15126,I find that I've been shaped much more by the bad stuff that has happened to me then the good stuff. My tragic experiences are a big part of me which is why I hold on. While they may have been bad times I owe the experiences for what I have become today
15127,Unless you do a true reset
15128,Do you know which study has shown this?

15132,Trauma
15133,"Someone already said this but as far as I know it's evolutionary, like it's more important to remember that Bobby got eaten by a mammoth so you don't do the same thing than to remember that roses are nice bc that won't help you survive."
15134,"Cuz feelings like sadness, anguish,anger, sorrow are stronger than happiness and joy"
15135,"That shit teaches you things, they change you. You are more likely to remember them beacouse you dont want ti make the same mistakes"
15136,So that it can warn you for the future
15137,The bad outweighs the good. It's as simple as that.
15138,"Humans remember negative things a lot longer and a lot more than we do positive things, it's what shaped us to be our society today. When something good happens, you probably don't think how it can go better but when something is bad you have to learn to fix it. That's how mankind has evolved. Oh and the fact negatives emotions stick with us"
15139,"it’s just because we always downplay good stuff that happens in our day, and let the bad stuff overtake it instead. When we feel good it’s just overall not as strong as an emotion if we did bad. Like how would you feel if you got a 93 on a test compared to a 50? The 50 would totally be a stronger emotion"
15140,Because we are meant to be happy and joyful but when something bad happens it is meant to bring us into darkness and it goes against our very being. That's how I think if it sometimes
15141,I’m a pessimist so I tend to focus on the bad over the good and I feel like a lot of other people are like that too. Also you don’t realize how good you have it until it goes bad.

15147,Fuck no. Boys are yucky 🤢

15149,It's satire because of that other guy.
15150,"it was ""can girls be funny"" and he was saying he has never laughed at a girl's joke and that humor must be a masculine trait, and that he wasn't sexist because all his friends are girls"
15151,It was deleted but basically this guy said girls weren’t funny and everyone hated on him. It was annoying but kinda funny in hindsight ig

15166,which other guy? what did he do?
15167,Funny and guys don’t go together I’m a sentence
15168,No funny allowed
15169,What was the other question?
15170,Yea I was the guy sending detailed death threads to every black person I've ever met but I can't be racist because I have one black friend (please don't talk to him about me he would pretend to hate me haha it's an inside joke)
15171,An absolute buffoon

15174,"yeah, with a girl it’s like omg she’s so attractive oOh like woweeeee and with a guy it’s like oh shiiiiiiit he can push me up a wall and stare at me till my knees give. or it’s just kind of bubbly like oh okay they’re attractive and that’s cute haha sort of thing"

15194,Am straight however my friend has told me how he feels. He says that he is physically attracted to males and emotionally attracted to females. I imagined that would cause problems with a relationship but he explained that it could work if he liked the person enough
15195,"Idk if i'm bi, i think i'm bi-curious, but like, if someone hot like neil patrick harris asked me to have sex i would say yes because he's hot, but i'm mostly straight so my attraction to men is very limited"

15197,I love nice thighs on guys.

Like I get that not everyone is super confident, or even confident in general, but this one time when me and my girlfriend were cuddling, she literally buried her face in her pillow and turned away from me, because she was embarrassed that her knee accidentally grazed over my junk. And she proceeded to do this for a solid 5 minutes, while saying in a high pitched voice 'I touched your..ah'  And I tried to get her to turn back around by saying that it was fine, I didn't really care, but she still continued to do it. Like okay, you're embarrassed that you accidentally touched my junk, I said I don't care, get over it already."

So being alone is the best for me since I don't have to deal with all that worrying.

15350,Now I just gotta figure out how to make friends irl but I'm too awkward
15351,i wouldn’t know but tbh lots of the users get popular here through drama or having their own gimmick thing
15352,"Well the lots of friends part wasn’t true for the whole year. That first week of school, everyone is your “friend,” but that fades away very quickly once people start settling into their cliques. My college was very cliquey and “exclusive” and a lot of the kids were very superficial, so it was harder for me to make and KEEP friends. No one ever mentions that part: “making“ friends is easy, but maintaining the friendship is the hard part. 

These kids party from like Wednesday-Saturday it’s insane. Idk how they have the energy but they do it, especially during rush. 

I would definitely say college gave me a lot of freedom to do my own thing. I got to decide what classes I wanted to be in and didn’t want to be in and I got to decide how and where to spend my time all day. That’s my favorite part: the freedom and the opportunities. 

Being broke and crappy dining hall food: check and check. I actually lost about 10 pounds this year because some days the food was so bad I’d just have grapes and rice for dinner. 

Dorms are veryyyy small. I don’t have a lot of things tho so it didn’t feel crowded, but it did feel like a box. And my roommate first semester was a mess so it made the room feel like an even smaller box. She always left clothes all over the floor and let the trash pile up. 

And what kind of RA you get really depends. Some are strict, some are laid back, and some are just never around. I think I saw my first semester RA once or twice that whole semester. We rarely spoke. And second semester was basically the same thing. She was laid back, but like always gone and never in the residence hall. So a little too laid back I guess. 

I think college is worth it but not for this out of state price."
15353,I'm not in college yet but I doubt I will have less stress than in high school
15354,"Try and meet new people day one. 

If you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to get help. 

Always wear a condom. 

Those are some simple suggestions I have."
15355,Yeah that pretty much sums it up
15356,"It's definitely a lot different from high school. I have fewer classes and more free time, but the classes are much harder and take up a lot more time as far as homework and studying. I'm still stressed, but I have a lot more freedom to schedule my time than in high school.

As far as friends, I personally found it difficult because I left all my friends behind and went out of state. I'm really bad at starting clean and meeting people without a sort of wingman friend/friend group. Everyone is super nice at my school so honestly I'd probably have more friends if I left my dorm more often lol

There are definitely parties out there, though I've only gone to a few. I think it's mostly up to you as to whether you wanna party in college, the option is certainly there.

Food is meh. Didn't gain or lose weight, though I did give up on breakfast since I didn't have early morning classes lol

I guess to sum up college so far, it's a lot more freedom but a  lot more to think about since you have pretty much complete control of your life now - you gotta choose your classes, you gotta plan when to eat meals, you gotta decide when to do homework and study since homework isn't typically due every day (but the assignments are larger), basically you choose what you do with your time. It takes time to get used to.

The one thing I was really unprepared for was missing having my own space, cause now I have to share with a roommate. Yay college"
15357,[deleted]
15358,[deleted]
15359,"I got to Community College and its really boring. Everybody there is just trying to get the best grades possible and transfer, so most people are just in and out. The brightside is that you can schedule classes later in the day, which for me means that I'm getting a lot more sleep, and I've become way more productive than I was in high school.

 I'm taking around 13 or 14 units per quarter, or around three classes. Each class meets for 4-5 hours a week, which is less than high school, but there is way more content to go over. You'll have more time to yourself, but that means you have to be responsible and learn most things on your own. 

I read something that explained it well, which is:
""College professors don't really teach you content. They teach you what you need to learn"""
15360,"Oh. Well, since you’re 18 an probably a senior it’s probably a little late, but in general, have a good GPA, have a good ACT/SAT, and do stuff out of school. Also have strong essays and LOR’s."
15361,I’m in the U.K and uni is definitely living up to the hype
15362,"Definitely lived up to the hype for me. I loved being able to do my own thing and be constantly surrounded by friends. During the week the study was always tough but on the weekends we would go to town and have drinks and all that fun stuff. The food was pretty good in my hall, I probably put on the fresher 5kg. 

Unfortunately lock down has forced me to go back home, but I can't wait to go back to uni!"
15363,Hey how did you make friends? Just by roommates or did you approach people on campus? Classmates?
15364,"Most of it was terrible, as expected. Not one party, way too many all-nighters because I'm a world champion procrastinator... Uh, the freshman 15 became the freshman 45 for me. Oh. And I never lost my virginity and am now 24 years old. So yeah...

Now keep in mind, if things socially and romantically and whatever else are working for you now, then none of the above will apply to you. But if you're like me, well... Just be proactive and do everything you can to be more outgoing IMO."
15365,">As in lots of friends

A ton of people (maybe even the majority, idk for sure) will struggle with making friends, especially if you don't come into college with high school friends. I've made one good friend since starting school (which for me is enough, but might not be for others)

>parties

I go to a party school. I've been to one small party as a part of a club. Other than that, I have zero experience because I'm not interested in them. If you want to go to parties, it depends on what school you go to for how good and accessible the parties are. If you don't care for parties, you won't really ever hear about them anyway.

>less stress

I went to a competitive high school, so college, to me, requires less effort so far. But also, I'm in classes that I really like, so I put more effort into them. So the stress is still less than high school, but very comparable. But keep in mind that I was pretty competitive in high school, so for most people, college will be way harder.

>crappy dining hall food

Dining hall food at my school sucks. Honestly I would try to contact current students at schools you like (on reddit, perhaps) to ask about meal plans. In many places, theyre completely not worth it. I spend $40-$50/week on food for myself at Publix, while my roommate spends $100/week on a meal plan

>strict/laid back RAs

Mine was chill but YMMV

>Freshman 15...

Didn't happen to me (although it may during quarentine lol). Don't knoe anyone who had it either"
15366,"I started college and am already done with my semester.

The Stereotypes were pretty true for me. A lot of friends, a lot of parties and general freedom. People just start talking to you, you can easily make friends and they are super tolerant and open: 

At least that’s what it was like for me"
15367,"Marching band lol. It makes it so easy. I didn't do it this year though and ended up getting double depressed, I have no clue how to make friends without being forced to interact with people"
15368,"I am still in university, but it's something kinda like college I think. 

Friends is right, people are all around friendly and helpful.

Parties, yep. Even on campus sometimes.

Freedom, yup. Freedom to fuck up? Definitely! But more leniency. You can eff tests like 3 times before you get kicked out lol

Less stress... You can make it as stressful or laid back as you want as long as you can deliver the test results.

Crappy food... Ours is actually decent, cheap and decent.

I don't live in a dorm, I live at a rented apartment, so no RAs."
15369,"Same! That’s why I’m asking. I’m in y12 of sixth form (uk, I think it’s grade 11) and I still don’t really have a friend. But good to know: hobby clubs and activities can help."
15370,"In general, it's much easier and less stressful than high school, I think. The coursework can still be difficult, but being able to choose your schedule, study things you're actually interested in, and be treated like an adult makes it way better. Sometimes it's kinda scary to think about being a real adult lol, I'm graduating next semester and the thought of finding a job and supporting myself makes me a little nervous. 

Parties definitely happen, but they're pretty overrated. It's more fun to hang out with a group of friends

A lot of college kids are broke, but you don't have to be. I think some kids go into college thinking they can't have a part time job because they have to spend all their time focusing on school, but it's not that hard to do well in school, have a job, and still have a life.

Also, dorms suck. But they're a good opportunity to make friends!"
15371,"I’m a British uni student and reading some of the replies there’s some key differences, but a lot of similarities too. Personally, uni’s definitely living up to the hype. 

I’ve made some great friends on my course and in the societies I’ve joined. There’s a lot of freedom to do what you want, so I’ve defo gone out a lot (purely because I didn’t when I was at home). 

Being broke sucks lol, but if you find a part time job it’s not so bad. You always find a way to be okay somehow."
15372,"Some stereotypes happened, some didn’t. 

I lost 15 pounds upon joining college, I never really was broke, and I didn’t make a lot of new friends.

However, I had a lot of parties, had more freedom, and was able to explore more."
15373,"In America, college=university. There's no difference here. So the ""partying idiots"" are in college/university."
15374,"Complicated, I was in a french school until I was 15 (finished 3ieme, which is y10 equivalent) and then switched to a british school (which is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time because my first language is English and it’s more natural to me). 

But because I switched in the middle of GCSEs I had to go back a year to do the full 2 year GCSE’s. So no I didn’t redo a year because I’m dumb I swear lol.

My birthdays in January too so."
15375,Wait I thought sixth form was the last two years so all of that means the last two years?
15376,"Unlike the others on this thread, I did gain the freshman 15! I was super active throughout high school (been dancing every day since childhood) and when I got to college, I stopped dancing and exercising in general because I thought my metabolism would be able to sustain my weight. Well I was very wrong... there’s just so much food at college!

I think if you’re not very active in high school, you end up losing weight freshman year of college because you have to walk everywhere. But if you’re active in high school and stop in college, you gain weight."
15377,"College has been a lot better for me than high school. Better friends, better teachers, and better me. It lived up to the hype.

You kind of find your groove in college as you go, but in a good way. That social pyramid in high school doesn’t exist anymore, and if anything, chances are you’ll meet more people who share similar interests as you than in high school. 

I’m not one to have a lot of friends but the ones I’ve made post-high school are some of the best I’ve met. Parties are great too, though I’m not one to attend them. You get a LOT more freedom though. It’s something I take for granted now. 

Edit: added some stuff"
15378,"It definitely did live up to the hype. I made lots of awesome friends, had cool classes, dorm life and parties were fun, got to stay up late and talk about deep shit with friends, meeting new interesting people all the time... I finally feel *alive* in college, like I have a solid identity for the first time. 

imagining going back to high school is a literal nightmare for me. My high school experience wasn’t as horrible as some others, but I was sooo shy and socially awkward and miserable. I felt like I had no close friends. Going to school every morning, I just felt this pit of dread/anxiety because I’d have to face all these people who I felt like didn’t like me. But I worked really hard at the tail end of my senior year to make the best of HS when I was there, and work on being more confident and social so that I could make new friends in college in the fall... and it worked!

My disclaimer is that college is what you make of it. I think the reason I enjoyed it so much is because I put a lot of deliberate effort into being ready for it mentally, and I had the mentality of getting as much out of it as possible. I didn’t really try to get the most out of my high school experience. once I really started deliberately trying to be social and talk to people at the end of the year, it started getting better, which implies that it was more of a me problem than a problem with high school in general. I think the reason college has been good to me is because of my mentality towards it (but ngl the freedom is amazing)"
15379,"I didn't have a lot of friends in high school and I thought college was going to be my chance to start a-new and find more people like me (I'm in art school). Long story short: I'm even more friend-less. I don't feel as depressed about it though because in high school it was harder to ignore everyone hanging out without me, where in college there's so many people it's harder to feel truly impacted by that stuff. 

Freshman 15 was deferred to Sophomore year for me. 

I go to a small school, so there's no big parties here. Def not the stereotype."
15380,"I made some new friends, but not too many, simply because I'm not a social person. I went to a few parties here and there - my school was definitely known for its parties, but you have to know people to be aware of them. I'm thankful about not worrying about the 'broke' part, my parents were willing to help me out first year so I didn't have to worry about working during the school year. 

My dorm was recently built and an apartment-like style, so I never felt too crowded. Not only that, but my floor was pretty quiet in general, so it was usually quite peaceful. My RA was a mom figure; she discouraged illegal activities, but understood she couldn't stop us. Instead, she gave us advice and resources (like free condoms.) Food was fine. 

Honestly, the stereotypical college experience can happen if you make it happen. Usually, it requires putting yourself out there and maybe pushing out of your comfort zone, but if it's something you'd like to experience, I'd say go for it."
15381,"Finishing my first year at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (AZ). Aerospace Engineering student. 

Mediocre cafeteria food in the dining hall, but there are other options that are pretty good, like Starbucks and a BBQ cafe. 

Really great people, the professors I've had so far are nice (especially the professors I've had for Calculus 1/2 (same professor), Physics 2, and COM 122 (English Composition)). 

Really easy to figure out the layout as the campus isn't too big, sand everything is actually closer than they look. 

The University is located in the mountains, in Prescott AZ, 1.5 hours north of Phoenix, AZ. There is no Transit except for a bus that stops at the grocery store 45 min walk from campus every 2 hours. There is a proposed bus service that is planned to launch next year, and will make it so much easier to get around with a stop on campus and more options. 

Anyone looking into Aerospace Engineering/engineering degrees, feel free to reach out to me. I can send you info and give you detailed insights about the University and I'd be more than willing to guide you on desiding on it. 

If you do end up going to ERAU AZ I can help you navigate the tools and pick a place to stay on campus. Once you're there, I'll give you a tour, I'll help more in detail especially with tips around campus, and we can obviously then already become friends but IRL then."
15382,Mhm it’s like ik my music taste is basic stfu😭
15383,Oh no i used to be one of those people when i was 13/14 the “im not like others” and i would say stuff like “old music so so much better than music now” like who gives a shit! Let people enjoy there music and quit being a little shit.

But it’s not because I wanna be different it’s because I like those genres and don’t really like pop or country music. I sure as hell don’t feel the need to insult others for it and rub the things I like in their faces as if those genres are better than pop or country. People that do are massive assholes."

Girls can send their father or brother or guardian to ask for a male's hand too. But you get a third party (said guardians) involved right from the start to make sure it remains halal, and you meet up and discuss and get to know each other (this can be for however long you feel you need to get to know another person) and then if you decide you like each other you get married. Then you're free to do everything you want with your spouse. There's a lot more to it, too.

> Jake is a very fun and outgoing guy. He has a smile that will brighten anyone's day and [**eye's**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=eye%27s) that [**alway's**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=alway%27s) have the girl's looking twice. He is a kind, sweet, trustworthy, cute, caring, smart, loving person that will alway's be there for you. But dont take his kindness and [**sweetness**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sweetness) as a weakness, if you ever dare too touch his girl or anyone in his family, he would be the first guy too beat a fool up.  
Jake has alot of female friends, but his girl alway's come before them. If you ever get the chance too be with [**a Jake**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=a%20Jake), take it and never let him go. Cause if you do youll regret it for the rest of your life. 

I dont know about this one though.

Edit: I added a thing"
15616,She deserves to answer some questions too
15617,"It means what..

Cause my nickname is Emma and I wanna know"
15618,Oh this is so precious
15619,john
15620,Jan it means i'm going to be in every damn math problem ever
15621,Sophia and Eren are names I see often though
15622,"Yes. Online is not anonymous. Yoy harass me verbally, you should be punished. Specially those pathetic 30 year olds that contact us sometimes"
15623,Like the school could suspend them if they go to your school.  If they just dont know you from anywhere though then society should publicly shame them.
15624,I'm just not sure who would suspend them and from what.
15625,Yes of course. But it would be kinda difficult to implement I guess
15626,"Those chances are pretty real actually. People on the internet do this everyday whether its political figures, celebrities/influencers, especially petty high schoolers or middle schoolers that have drama with someone. Rumors fly around all the time in schools."
15627,A fair amount of times its also guys out age just being gross and immature and I honestly feel like the fact that they are allowed to do this at such a young age makes them think its acceptable and it can  escalate to something more dangerous.
15628,Do you not get creeps? Online they should have their account shamed. Like on reddit they should get an award calling them a sexual harasser.
15629,Screenshots can be edited too
15630,"I get some. I don't really let them occupy space in my head. Just block and move on.

What you are ultimately asking for will never happen, sadly."
15631,"No. Unless it's incessant, repeatedly done by making new accounts if you block them, or involves threats and stalking."
15632,"I meant online. There isn't anyone who can ""suspend"" them.

Idk I just block them. Sorry you get creeps"
15633,"It *Should* be punished, but if we implement a law against it, it’d either be very difficult to prove or very easy to lie about"
15634,The problem with this is that photoshopping and editing is very good these days. It would also be easy for a creeper to delete and wipe him or her phone clean.
15635,"Countries are thinking of making unsolicited dick pics illegal, and I hope this is next. Because if it’s not unwanted sexual harassment then wtf is it?"
15636,"People aren’t pets. You can’t “train” them not do things like that, especially by publicly harassing them. That’s only going to make them more hateful and probably make them do worse things."
15637,There’s a big difference between a horny teenager making a mistake and somebody sexually assaulting somebody
15638,"But by publicly harassing them you’re practically inviting worse behavior. People don’t change their behavior because they are hated, they just start to hate the people that hate them. In my opinion as long as they aren’t sending threats then it’s not really worth doing anything about it. You can pretty easily block communication with the person or just simply ignore it."
15639,It happens all the time I know it seems insane but it happens all the time
15640,"Yes. Just because it’s online, doesn’t mean it isn’t a form of harassment."
15641,"i wish there were more people who cared about this kind of stuff. one of my classmates at the time was constantly asking me for nudes, but i was too scared to tell anyone. it'd be hard to implement punishments for these things, but i also just wish it was talked about more. online harassment has a different type of impact on people, you feel helpless because there's nothing authorities can do about it."
15642,"Unless it’s a threat of violence no. If it’s just ‘hey show me your tits’ then no punishment, but if it’s like ‘hey I’m going to break into your house and...” then it should be treated the same way an in person threat should be treated."
15643,Yeah.  I think we should just publicly shame people who do sexual harassment so they are trained not to do it when they are online.
15644,Exactly my point guys escalate gonna say to much when they think it's anonymous. Even irl if you just start talking to me about your dick I'm gonna punch you if you dont stop and your in my face.
15645,I get it from every race.
15646,"Correct me if I’m wrong but I thought we were talking about online sexual harassment. For the record, I have been sexually harassed before. I know how uncomfortable it feels. But making a sexual comment about someone’s body isn’t harassment unless it’s repeatedly done after you’ve made it clear you’re not okay with it. A stranger saying something to you that makes you uncomfortable isn’t automatically some form of harassment."
15647,I think it should be punished when it's constant or very bad
15648,Im annoyed of those creeps tainting the reputation of Indians on the internet. Trust me all of us are not the same. Thats why i like to handle such creeps my way... If anyone creeps yall lemme see if i can help.
15649,I think guys should know right from wrong and know what is appropriate behaviour and what isnt. I say the first time they do it they need to go to domme kind of sexual harassment training any time after they need to be punished.
15650,Unsolicited dick pics? Yes. Flirting straight off the bat but take a hint and leave? No. Harassing you or threatening you? Yes.
15651,Yes. Horny jail.
15652,"I live in the country, which is great for this sort of situation, with the pandemic, and the political riots and shit. If I could give you one of our rifles I would. Unfortunately it is also not very diverse, so you get a ton of trumpets. It scares me as a girl and a member of the lgbtq+ community"
15653,"not american but i'm a scared for you, i really hope everything goes well"
15654,I got homework and I’m not old enough to vote. I hope the states picked the right guy so that I can have a senior year next year
15655,"*all I want for Christmas is a functioning democracy, a functioning democracy*"
15656,"A little nervous to be honest.

Walmarts in my area are boarding up windows and taking guns off shelves....

I just hope that it’s not a massive shit show here, but chances are is that it’s gonna be. Idk tho."
15657,"I know, but if it's in his favor, which it probably will be, trump will do his damn best to not count votes after election day"
15658,That's what I call trump supporters lol. Trumpers was the original but it kept autocorrecting and a decent amount of people on the internet call them trumpets so yeah
15659,"There will be chaos. There will be protests or riots no matter who wins. We won't know a winner till about December, because of the votes being counted and electoral college. The election will be argued about who really won. And I really hope it does not go to the supreme court."
15660,Not an American so like I just realized election day was tomorrow. Just gonna say the US is pretty fucked either way but like other than that good luck...?
15661,No matter what happens there's gonna be riots
15662,[deleted]
15663,"bro

this country's already gone to shit and if trump wins im getting the fuck out of here"
15664,"I value the second amendment and the economy too. I also value my rights. Most liberals don't want to take all the guns from everyone, we just want background checks to make sure they don't get into the wrong hands. As for the economy, we can have a successful economy without destroying the planet. We can also afford to give healthcare to all if we adjust some things, such as decreasing the military budget, which currently sits at 686 billion dollars. We could also legalize recreational marijuana and tax it for extra money, and put aside less money in corporate tax cuts to be put into other things like healthcare, education funding, and environmental protection. The big thing on the ballot for me this year is LGBTQIA+ rights. It is already illegal for transgender people to serve in the military, and with Barret on the Supreme Court, there is a chance that if Trump wins, same sex marriage may become illegal."
15665,2016 could always happen again tho
15666,What do you mean trumpets? I assume not the actual instrument?
15667,"100% gonna be riots, i saw that people were planning to go after LGBTQ+ communities if biden wins but i hope that is just a crazy rumor. i know i’m not going outside for a couple days in any case"
15668,"Oh ok, thanks for the response"
15669,"1. Why do you need an assault weapon unless you plan on killing people. Shotguns work just fine for home defense.


2. Fracking is extremely harmful to the environment, it causes seismic activity, and people in neighborhoods where fracking is taking place are often exploited by large companies. It can literally cause peoples tap water to become flammable. We have safer and better alternatives to getting energy, like windmills and hydroelectric dams.


3. Trump's tax cuts only really benefited those who need them least: people with high investment income. In contrast he payed 750 dollars in taxes over 15 years whereas my working class family payed around 10k.

4. Trump may have done ok with the economy early on, but then denied the existence of a pandemic and refused to act on it, which has only hurt the economy that was granted, already going to be tanked because I don't think any president could have prevented a worsened economy during a pandemic,but trump didn't help the situation.

5. I'm not claiming that she is going to because she is a Catholic, but because she has made some very questionable actions regarding it."
15670,No social media for me tomorrow
15671,I don’t live in a major city but I’m scared for my brother cuz he lives in Philly
15672,Biden will probably win lol
15673,my senior year rn. hope i get a prom...
15674,"Oh god I hope that's a rumor but I doubt it tbh. Now I'm just like super terrified. But hey, I've got an axe and a shotgun lol."
15675,I know but he has no ground to stand on now either but I still saw a trump parade yesterday
15676,"Washington has gotten ready for riots, people everywhere bought guns to no end because they fear riots and I for one as a German sit back, look anxiously how the election turns out and am mentally prepared to see America go to shit for the third time this year"
15677,It's whoever the military sides with lol
15678,"lmao the thing is, votes have always been counted after election day. 

he has no ground to stand on whatsoever, in regards to appealing against it."
15679,what the hell why is there so many trump supporters on this subreddit
15680,if it goes to scotus we’re fucked
15681,Oh yeah no matter what happens shits gonna get wild in the cities.

15712,Welll we still call each other like ever day so doesn’t that count
15713,"no

bruh the rona is the worst its ever been rn"
15714,no cuz that's me
15715,I knowww and they keep asking and I just can’t go💀
15716,Yaaa but we talk about random stuff so it’s never boring
15717,That has already happened to me and I didn't got mad
15718,But it's just not the same. Calling is getting a bit repetetive and it becomes meaningless after a while.
15719,"Not at all, they’d be taking cautionary measures that I completely understand."
15720,"Why don't you wanna hang out with your friends

Isn't supposed to be a thing when you're friends"
15721,No. I never hang out with my friends even pre-covid. They all kinda accepted it but I think they believe I'm trying to isolate myself or something.
15722,"it is VERY annoying, i haven’t been able to see u/im-not-male in literally forever"
15723,"I have gone through that in HS too, but being alone didn't bother me that much and indeed I am more of an observer, but what I didn't know is that I am more of a tight friendship(s) kind of person (one close friendship >>> a bunch of friends) and that I just needed time to find the right one."
15724,That's literally me. I've been saying no since the beginning of quarentine.
15725,Sure it is. But I'm odd and it has been so long since I last did that that it's too awkward to initiate it for me. I still talk to them a lot but they don't invite me places or bother asking because I am not a staple of the friend group (kinda just sit and quietly observe) and I'd say no anyway.
15726,No... more like proud
15727,I don’t have any friends so yea I can’t relate.
15728,I thought we were friends 🥺
15729,No not at all instead I’ll appreciate them
15730,Not really to be honest. They are In their own right to decide if they don't want to hang out because of covid
15731,"I wouldn’t be mad at them, but I’d be kinda mad at Xi Jinping."
15732,Hmm. I don't really have any close friends. I'm closer to some than others but I don't rely on them for anything and I don't tell any of them personal things. I just appear very nonchalant. Kinda sad.
15733,"No, just a bit sad."
15734,nah I'd just be bummed out
15735,"No, not at all. I'm that type of friend too rn lmao"
15736,Nah covids rough. I understand anyone taking precautions like that rn
15737,"Nope, I'm that friend"
15738,Of course not.They have the right to not want to go out in general.
15739,No just sad.
15740,No because that is the right thing to do
15741,"No, you never know how careful people have been being. I haven’t been hanging out with my friends either."

I think you maybe have brown hair, 5'4, pale skin? idk"
15758,People who hate users on here are just funny lol
15759,"I once read you drink a lot of beer so im thinking you give out junkie vibes,(and also prefering feeling good over other things)

and your pfp has blond hair so im geussing you have blond hair in rl to

so here I go: blond hair in a pony tail, kinda fat but nothing serious, loves hoodies but also want to be a bit fashionable, kinda wrong posture but again nothing serious

^(sorry I was bored)"
15760,You seem like a pretty cool person
15761,That's the ultimate answer to every question ..... Playing smash bros
15762,"LMAOO I love this

I don't like **beer**, but I do drink a lot. Just not beer lol

I have dark brown hair, in a bun rn, wouldn't say I am fat but I can see why you would think that, I do like hoodies but don't have much of them, and a big FAT YES to the wrong posture one"
15763,That's scarily accurate wtf
15764,what you think about me 🍯🍯
15765, 😮 me to
15766,That’s better 😊😊

15768,yo that’s kinda weird you know that about her she doesn’t have a pic of herself anywhere 😳😳😳
15769,you have a nice house too
15770,"ikr, probably a pedo"
15771,I am talented like that
15772,"No because the amount athletes get paid depends on the viewership. There are less people watching female sports so they should get paid less. It's pretty much the same as demanding that World Chase Tag athletes should get paid as much as NBA athletes, which is not gonna happen because WCT attracts way less viewers"
15773,well to be fair Basketball is typically played by the richest countries whereas soccer is played by basically every country
15774,So soccer players should make the most because it’s the most popular sport world wide and football players should make less then?
15775,[deleted]
15776,"No, basketball is most paid, and soccer is fifth most paid from what I read"
15777,Many female sport events don't draw as much attention as male sport events. That's why most of the female athletes don't get paid as much as men.
15778,"The real answer should be we should promote female sports by advertising it, making it interesting to people. Gender shouldn't be a factor of how money u are paid. So the answer is a big NO this is capitalism, and is OK. Yeah, may seem unfair to you, but is totally right and how capitalism works. U get the money you generate, why Messi get payed more than Dybala? Because messi is almost a brand, everyone knows him and he generate a lot of money selling tickets for games, T-shirts, etc. And if female games are least interesting to people, what can we do? advertise it."
15779,The women’s US soccer team had higher viewership and higher jersey sales than the men but the US Olympic organization was still paying them less.
15780,Really funny how most of these responses are from teen boys
15781,"Well, i would assume that the richest soccer players are paid a lot. It probably also depends on how many other people have to get paid and how much the arena costs to do upkeep etc. Not completely sure tho"
15782,It doesn't work that way.
15783,"Only if they pull in as much money as the male counterparts.

Ronda Rousey was the highest paid fighter in the UFC for a while, not because Dana wasa good Samaratian, but because she sold the maximum tickets."
15784,"They r right tho, and I am a girl"
15785,"There is a reason they are paid less though. When CBAs were being signed, WNT was offered the same contract as their male counterparts, but they rejected it to sign a different one, with more guaranteed money, and less bonus money. Basically, they thought they would suck, and when they didn’t, they wanted to retroactively get paid the contract they rejected( all this info is from the last time this topic was brought up on r/sports )

>”The WNT [Women's National Team] rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT [Men's National Team] and ... the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for other benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,"" Klausner wrote. ""Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT's pay-to-play structure when they themselves rejected such a structure."""
15786,"it doesnt work that way, it would be foolish to pay them more than what the organnization can afford"
15787,"Indeed. Nowadays feminists (not to generalize, but it’s true) tend to jump to conclusions about unfairness, gaps in pay, etc, instead of thinking logically about why there is a “gap” in pay."
15788,"Sure you can promote and advertise as much as you want, but that’s not going to suddenly make people more interested in it. You might make people more aware of it (but most people already know of sports with female athletes’ existence lol) but it won’t necessarily increase interest"
15789,"Bro, Basketball is popular in US the world potence, the money in the NBA is probably more than the GDP of lots of countries, so yeah is normal."
15790,"I think the reason for more viewership in make sports comes down mainly to the fact that people come to sports for the best of the best. Since males are just better suited for physical labor biologically they are able to accomplish more in sports. Obviously women in sports are still great at what they do, but there's a reason why sports aren't everyone together."
15791,Neither of you are even addressing the argument they have for it and just writing it off as a bunch of teen boys being sexist instead of admitting that any athletes value is determined by the viewers and female athletes get less attention.
15792,Oh wait do you mean that everyone should get the same salary or that they should get the same dollar amount (if that makes sense)
15793,"It’s not gender based it’s just based on how much money the league makes. 

So if ur in a league that doesn’t make as much money, you’re going to make less."
15794,"They're still right tho.

&#x200B;

Edit: Heckonmyneck rlly just put a ad hominem and left huh."
15795,Why do you think that?
15796,"There’s no should, that’s how fucking life works. Less popular = less income generated = less pay, general rule. Not saying I think they don’t deserve to be paid more, female soccer players or whatever are putting equal effort into it as males. It’s just that males tend to be more athletic and people find the sport more entertaining, and like I said that tends to result in less income. Your analogy didn’t really make a point."
15797,"Gotta disagree, players get payed based on interest and viewership of there sport/team. In stuff like basketball more people watch men’s than women’s, so the men would make more"
15798,I mean yeah. Ronaldo has a billion.
15799,Womens sports arent viewed as much because they arent as interesting to alot of people.. Just take a look at the NBA vs WNBA what would you rather watch? The NBA makes more money because its more interesting to watch and not because of gender.
15800,i’m a female and most female sports are boring as fuck. the only exceptions i can think of are UFC and gymnastics. wnba is a fucking snore. the problem isn’t that people don’t know that the stuff is going on. if that was it then advertising would fix it. the problem is that most people really don’t want to watch it
15801,Sure but money doesn’t grow on trees m8. Idealism is not equivalent to reality.

i will get almost whatever i want, sometimes for free, i almost never pay for my food if i’m out with a guy friend, i also get better help in stores, people are so so so nice to me now

there are downsides, i work hard ( 4 jobs before pandemic, 3 sports, volunteering with 4 different orgs regularly and hard classes and a 4.3 gpa) but everyone assumes i’m dumb and have no future other then being pretty and that hurts so much because i’m so much more then just a body

15847,"Me, knowing full well that I am attractive and still hating my appearance anyway"
15848,i forgot to put my attractive on this morning 😭
15849,Simp for me I need it lol
15850,"That's not exactly a good answer for this question but I feel lucky for my hair.I wake up and they look good.Even if I didn't comb them no one would notice.(they are straight)And my ponytails always have a nice shape if that makes sense.So my hair are never a problem.

And another good thing is that I feel like having pretty eyes is an advantage now that we are wearing masks.Cause you can tell I'm cute behind my mask.And by that I mean that I think people can see that I'm nice and not like 😠🤨😤 that"
15851,Why? Did you stop today?
15852,If her age is off the clock
15853,It’s time to pull out the cock
15854,"awe tyyy ❤️️❤️️❤️️

^(tyyyy! my brain just randomly dropped a box of questions on my brain last night, most of them being sleep related)"
15855,"I don’t know how I look, because I have body dysmorphia.. I look different to myself everyday :///"
15856,i’m not attractive
15857,slick
15858,I can't judge without an image
15859,aw thanks
15860,"what are you even tryna say lmao, he was asking a genuine question no need to get offended"
15861,you heard him
15862,[deleted]
15863,"exactly, biology has nothing to do with feelings tbh, the fatherly bond will still be there"
15864,He's still your dad and I bet he's proud be did such a thing. Those years were definitely not wasted.
15865,"Just because he’s not your “real father” doesn’t mean he’s wasted time on, you *are* his kid and he is your dad"
15866,this 200%
15867,He spent 15 years of his life on you caring for you and being your dad. He may not be your father but he is your dad and that’s what matters.He did not waste those years. Biology does not make a family.
15868,this 1000%
15869,I came here to say this
15870,Reverse Guardians of the Galaxy
15871,Good username
15872,family has nothing to do with biology. he raised you as your father and so he is your father
15873,"family does not have to be biological. it seems like he genuinely loves you and you love him back just as much. time spent raising a child is not ""wasted"" and you shouldn't feel bad about it at all."
15874,"The point =====>

                 Your head"
15875,This 10000%
15876,"Family isn't defined by blood, blood relations are. Family is the people who are there for you, and care for you, people you trust."
15877,thanks 🥶
15878,"Blood doesn’t make family. Love does. Whether you have his blood or not, he’s always gonna be your dad. No. Matter. What."
15879,"He’s still your dad, even if he isn’t biologically. I wish you all the best"
15880,how in anyway is it wasted at all like what
15881,"Look he raised you like his own he was there for you like his own and he loved you like his own


That's your dad biological or not"
15882,"family has 0 connection to with blood and genetics . a father is somebody who will love you unconditionally , and he did so anyway . it wasn't wasted at all . he was a role model , and somebody to depend on . n i can tell that ur relationship was v healthy :) so ofc it wasn't wasted . not even for a second ."
15883,He is your dad
15884,r/rimjob_steve
15885,"Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone like this man to be a dad. So embrace what you have for him, and remind him daily of how much he means to you, because believe me, he'll need it."
15886,"It will not cause a strain unless you create one. It seems like he genuinely cares about you and has helped you so much, he is priceless and not worth losing"
15887,"It will only put a strain on it if you choose to, he might not be your biological father, but he’s still your dad and you love him so don’t let it."
15888,"He loves you. And you love him. He's been your father for fifteen years.

He hasn't wasted anything on you. At all. You're his daughter. Who cares that your father is a different person, he's the one who's fathered you."
15889,"I guess is just feel extremely subconscious about it because my dad has always been a ""Your problems are yours not mine"" kind if guy and here he is raising someone else's kid for more than 15 years."
15890,Apparently none of us did either 😅
15891,Does this really matter? He's still your father because he raised you.
15892,"As a frequent lucid dreamer, yes"
15893,"Dream journaling, reality checks, mindfulness"
15894,Teach me
15895,"In a bigger nutshell: 

Count your fingers once in a while, if you can't or there's not 5 of them, you're dreaming. If you do this often irl you'll start doing it in your dreams. 

Write down everything you remember about your dreams every morning. 

Maybe meditatate sometimes, people say it helps."
15896,That was how to lucid dream in a nutshell
15897,"Sounds like a lucid dream of some sort, maybe?"
15898,Ok now the not in the nutshell version?
15899,Yes. I remember being so confused in my dream and I woke up like “ah. That makes sense now”
15900,Wut
15901,"With once in a while, do you mean just randomly throughout the day?

Also what kind of meditation do you do?"
15902,yeah it's super weird. i thought it was normal that i had to shoot flying plates on my way to school. i was also living in a house i have never seen in a place i had never been and was fine with it
15903,Thanks
15904,"Trying to read everything, always, compulsively is also a way to get this effect. In a dream, you often can't read text.

Too bad my dreams don't agree here, I can definitely read in dreams and the text will make itself up as I read."
15905,"Ye doesn't really matter when, just try to do it at least a few times a day. Counting fingers is what works best for me but there's also plenty of different RCs you can try if it doesn't work 

I barely ever meditate anymore lol, but you could Google it and just try different apps or youtube channels and see what you like, idk"
15906,I think that’s a lucid dream
15907,/r/luciddreaming
15908,Okay thank you :)
15909,Wait are you actually doing this now? Lol
15910,Do what?
15911,Try to lucid dream
15912,Yes
15913,Good luck with that then
15914,i recommend to lay in your bed when you’re going to sleep. start imagining an object and focus on it. lay still while focusing on the object until youre asleep. you’ll know youre dreaming and you can start controlling what happens. be careful not to.go crazy bc it’ll just make you wake up.
15915,yes
15916,"Usually the weird thing is that i feel like im moving through syrup, and i notice more often than not because its annoying as hell."
15917,"Actually, yeah but I just went along with it cause lols"

it's kinda NSFW too

I'm like vibin in some dessert and I see a house, I go in and some girl is like totally into me and then I'm like wait a minute what's happening but just when I started becoming more aware I woke up

kinda annoyed because you know lucid dreaming is known to be cool"
15920,"I had a dream my brother and I were hiking up a snowy mountain. We were walking near a cliff and beneath us was a frozen over lake that our mom was sitting beside, waiting for us to come back down. All of the sudden my brother  falls off the cliff! I freak out and am screaming his name. I quickly run down the mountain to see him calmly climbing out of the icy water. I help him out and am like ""OH MY GOSH are you ok????"" And behind me my mom is like ""Calm down he is fine geez."" An my brother is like ""Yeah im fine."" I was SO confused. Like you just fell off a huge cliff and no one is worried?!?!?"

I dreamt about getting almost ever single mole or freckle surgically removed or just waking up without them. (Thats like 20 moles/freckles on my face) one time i almost took a scissor to my face and just snipped them off.

Im glad i didnt do that, cause i realised im attracted to moles on others, so why cant people like the moles on me? They make me unique and give my body just a liiiittle bit of that extra spice ahaha. Now i actually hope they stay, because i wouldnt recognize my face without them."

15984,a 28 year old guy asking for my number so he could call me and jack off to my voice 🤩😻
15985,that is disgusting
15986,I think I've said this before but a 24 yo dude offered to teach me how to masturbate
15987,A creep in my PMs found out what city I live in
15988,"Definitely. The weirdest part is that he was basing all of this off of a few replies I made to different Askreddit questions asking about music taste. 

The rest of my comment/post history is literally just true crime lol."
15989,"I posted a “looking for gamers” thing on 
r/teensmeetteens. I ended up getting this one guy’s discord that seemed interested in gaming. In the end he wanted to play truth or dare and he kept on trying to get me to send him nudes and stomach pics. Shoutout to r/teenamiugly, there are a lot of pedos there"

15995,thats horrible wtf
15996,i-
15997,"wasn't on reddit but i had a guy harass me on discord once. he made a bunch of dirty jokes which i was ok with, but started taking them too far. he said he'd stop but didn't until it basically culminated in him sending me some woman's nudes and me blocking him."
15998,girl RUN
15999,everyone always thinks I'm a guy online. and then when they find out I'm a girl they either get thirsty or tell me to stop lying and shit? even though I never said I was a guy but ok
16000,Ok so it started out as a normal conversation and then he asked me what things I liked to do and so I told him about what sports I play and movies I liked then started making it sexual and then I thought ok I'm done then blocked him
16001,Posted a picture of myself once. Got a dude offering to pay me for feet pics. Another where someone started a normal conversation and they asked me if I wanted to see their dick. I did not.
16002,too many
16003,I’ve been lucky enough to have none and I’m so happy for that lol
16004,guy offering to pay me $200 for feet pics
16005,"when I don't reply I'm met with ""um... hi!!!!"" ""hello??????"" ""!!!!!!"" it just makes me not want to reply further. and they also want me to sext which is just gross... they know how old I am and still want this shit... thirsty 22 year olds"
16006,Bro that’s easy just send him some random feet off the internet
16007,"Ye, that sub got closed today"
16008,"I posted in r/askwomen about dating apps, I got some random 40 yo guy asking what datings sites I was going to get on. Idk what he would've done with that information, because i blocked them immediately."
16009,"There was a guy once in dms , just desperatly saying me to give them my pics , blocked him"
16010,felt that
16011,now u jinxed urself lol
16012,If I like them option 3. But option 2 would work fine as well.
16013,"Either 1 or 3. But 1 could be seen as just a friend conversation so it depends how much you want to put yourself out there. 2 is kinda annoying tbh, at least to me, cause everyone says it. But maybe other girls disagree."
16014,"Start with 1, end with 3."
16015,wow im gonna use that next time
16016,Ok ok.. please continue
16017,start with 1. it'd make me the most comfortable and know that he actually has a personality. just explain how you know yall have the same dog names
16018,"i like this one too. if i were her, i would want to be able to have nice convos just to kind of connect. get talking with her, maybe stray out of your comfort zone a little and throw in a compliment, and if she’s giving back positive vibes and green lights (not to mistake this with being polite!!), then end with 3."
16019,"""What's up you beautiful bastard welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show"""
16020,2 drives me nuts 🥜
16021,"i would go with 3, def not 2 or you’ll sound like a dry fuckboy"
16022,"This is dope, I've learned I should be a riskier texter"
16023,"Number 3. Flirt a bit and make it up front that you like her, *love it*. Number one is pretty good icebreaker but doesn’t make it clear you want to date her. Depends on how you want to go, some people like building up a friendship and waiting for enough courage to ask. Others make a flirting relationship and ask them out if they get the same energy back basically, more upfront and saves time- but can be nerve wracking for many!"
16024,My guy friend does this. He’s strictly my friend.
16025,I would say 2 but 3 is pretty nice? Why not ask her out on a date like what are you doing this weekend or something
16026,"If I like you I’d LOVE option 3, you can also use option 1, but just the fact you’re hitting me up is great"
16027,He's about to Phil her in
16028,Well some people might be upset if they would be forced to use a flair that was chosen for them and not choose one themselves
16029,This
16030,This thread has taught me that I need to be a riskier texter. Love it!
16031,"Why doesn’t auto mod do this, it’s not hard"
16032,I think he meant remove and reply to the comment
16033,"How about:
You: Is that jacket made of up dog?
Her: What's up dog?
You: Nothing much, what's up with you?"
16034,WELL IN LAD! Hope you have a sick time on your date:)
16035,"Please flair yourself by going to the front page of the sub, clicking the three dots in the top corner and selecting ‘change user flair’.  Automod has automatically removed your comment."
16036,"Depends if she wants to be friends first (like I would) but 1 and 3 are the best, 2 is a little too casual. In conclusion, 1 if you want to get to know each other before getting romantic, 3 if you wanna head straight into the chase"
16037,I agree with the folks who say start with 1 and end with 3!
16038,"option 3, but you can also slide in with a meme/ something both of you like."
16039,"1 or 3. I think 3 is the best way if you want to go somewhere, but I guess 1 could be considered as the long route"
16040,starting witt 2 doesnt give the girl alot to work with as a response and 1 definitely does so i would recommend 1
16041,Option 3 is better if your intentions are wanting to date.
16042,man just wanted to share his tractor
16043,"I have to say, it was a bomb ass tractor"
16044,"Not me but my dad keeps getting spammed called by tons of different spam callers/texters and they all ask for someone named “Rafia” but we have no idea who that is. Like, doorknob salesmen (how is that even a thing) or roofing salesmen. Weird."
16045,Anyone who can appreciate a good tractor is a nice man.... You have my trust 15 M
16046,Dang dude. Ask them if they've got any openings for a doorknob salesman. People'll be buying new doors just to keep up with the amount of doorknobs I'll be selling them
16047,"yeah i have, and i just block them"
16048,"I will block soon. I have to admit, it's a little amusing"
16049,"I got texts from a older woman who sent pictures of her butt and feet.

16130,Thank you 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
16131,Okay but imagine a big tiddy bear lmaoooo that's funny ash😭😭
16132,Glad to know I’m not paranoid
16133,Constantly. Idk when I’ve ever not thought this
16134,"You may very well be. Some days I feel great but most days a sudden burst of ""Holy shit everybody hates me"" comes over me and hits me like a truck a couple times a day."
16135,The world went down hill the day Harambe was shot and I’ve stood by this since
16136,"Yepp, I think everyone hates me half the time despite them doing literally nothing to suggest that 🤔"
16137,For me it all stared in 7th grade when life went down hill
16138,I wonder if everyone thinks that about everyone and we are all just mega paranoid
16139,Dude I’ve never thought of that but holy shit your right come to think of it
16140,"Yeah, eventhough there's no evidence that they're just pretendint to be my friend, I can't help but overthink everything."
16141,Sometimes
16142,All the time. Every day I convince myself everybody hates me
16143,"Yes, everyday. Even when they give my unlimited support and praise I can’t help but think it’s all fake."
16144,I'd only be worried if your cats start hating you.
16145,"One of my two cats hates me , what should I think? :("
16146,"No. And heres how I know. I can hang out with any of my friends just the two of us and we can have a great time. Nobody wants to hang out alone with someone they don't like. 

Im actually really lucky to have the friends I have because despite our differences we have a really good understanding that we're all there for each other even if it is through tough love."
16147,Yep
16148,They like me yes.
16149,"You could name any random event in the last 5, 10, 20 years and it would be the same. I think you could name any frame of reference and people would agree ""it got worse"""
16150,Nah it was definitely when we killed Harambe
16151,I've had her for two years and she bites and scratches me whenever I try to pet her . I've another cat tho and she loves me. Guess you can't have everything.
16152,She climbs on top of the headboard and launches herself on top of me lol
16153,That's cuteeee
16154,Perhaps
16155,Yeah I feel like everyone hates me and they only hang with me out of pity.

J/k, these thoughts are super poisonous huh"

16166,"I feel your scenario. And what’s more is when people complain that your sad about an A-. It’s like I put in more work than most of the class, I deserve to expect a little better."
16167,A couple years ago I was told I’m gross because I’m Latina and “too dark” and I never really completely got over it
16168,I hope you’re doing okay. I assume you’ll hopefully be able to move out in the next couple years? Good luck 💛

16173,"That I don't believe in the religion that I was brought up in anymore. Also I'm starting to really wish I wasn't homeschooled. I hate to say that the stereotypes are true, but I haven't had close friends for a couple years after losing my best friend and a bunch of other personal stuff. I feel kind of ostracized from other kids because I've never experienced school."
16174,thank you so much omg :’)💙
16175,"YES, YES, YES!!! Finally, someone else who understands! My friends always claim that I’m being over dramatic bc of an A-, but it’s just the fact that I strive so hard for success just to basically get shutdown is disappointing."
16176,That is fucked up. You are not disgusting. You are valid and beautiful and your skin color is beautiful any way that it is 💛
16177,"My dad was abusive and r*ped my mom for most of my childhood and everyone just ignores it. He was smart so everyone tells me wow you’re just like him even though they know everything that he’s done.  It just doesn’t seem like a big deal for them, but it was for me, to see or hear that shit weekly.  Everyone still tells me to keep in contact or appreciate him because he loves me, but I don’t want to. And the shittiest part is that I don’t even hate him; for some reason I still love him even though he’s only caused me pain and trauma."
16178,There are a lot of things about my past that I want to tell everyone but I can't because a breakdown real hard thinking about it
16179,This is such a frustrating feeling and I’m so sorry that you have to deal with that. I hope you can feel better 💜
16180,Just everything that’s been going on that makes me so emotionally exhausted
16181,I’m so sorry that that happened to you. I hope you are doing better now 💛

16183,Dysphoria is killing me and my mom denies the fact that im trans so cant really do anything other then dress up in my room from time to time
16184,I get physically shaky and terrified even when just casually going out in public. It’s so scary. People are so fucking scary.
16185,"That doesn't sound like you have everything. First, in a literal way, you're literally saying that you have a considerate amount of something but not enough for it to be really useful. That's not having everything.

Second, there's having everything and *having everything*. The first is what you feel you have, the latter is what you don't have. If you felt satisfied enough with yourself, you'd truly *have everything,* even if you don't have everything.

It's a very hard state to achieve; even harder in teenage years, but it's possible. Imagine having a thousand-pieces puzzle. You start to build it, then you notice that, for it to be fully complete, you need some pieces that are apparently lost (or you were scammed).

You can spend your whole life trying to find those pieces, but it's a very stressful experience. You can't have the cake and eat it too — you can't have all the pieces and live a happy life.

Let's say you do search the pieces, and after 60 years you found the last one under the fridge. You complete it, at last. Yeah... At much, you will have an hour of dopamine. Congrats!

Completing the puzzle is what I mean by having everything, while *having everything* is something that's hard for us to do: accept that it's pointless to try to complete the puzzle. ^Assume ^that ^you're ^pretty ^dedicate, ^btw

What you need to do, then, is to feel satisfied without having all the pieces. That takes a long time too, since removing that itchy feeling is hard to remove — the feeling that getting satisfaction from life (I mean, the puzzle) would be way more easier if you had all the pieces.

What you do in order to get a satisfactory result out of an incomplete puzzle is up to you, sadly (or fortunately; life would be very boring without creativity!). Just have always in mind that, if your objective is completing the puzzle, you're going to live a stressful, disappointing and hard life.

Hope it helps you see the situation in a better way. Since it's too long I won't read it again before sending lol, so tell me if you have any doubt about the text. Also, obligatory ""English isn't my first language"". Thanks for reading! :)"
16186,Also i’ve been hiding secrets about how bad everything is for like 4 years and problems just started to rot and are basically unfixable but saying it would make people sad
16187,childhood trauma and family stuff
16188,"You are perfect!🤩You don’t need anyone’s validation to be your best self and DEFINITELY NOT a colorists’! Those kind of people are battling with themselves and want someone else to feel the terrible pain that they are in, WHAT A DISGRACE!"
16189,"That posting a picture on Instagram or signing a petition is not going to do anything 

I think my friends would agree but knowing my luck it will get spread around the whole school and everyone is going to think that I’m racist"
16190,I don’t even know what to say. Anyone who tells you that you are “just like him” or that you should still stay in contact with him is fucked up in the head. That is SO wrong and disgusting. I am SO sorry that you have had to deal with that. Stay strong 💜
16191,"I am doing a lot better, thank you! It was a few years ago and I was in a really dark place, but I’m happy now"
16192,"No way, I read them recently too!

Just survive, let the strong ones kill each other off, set traps. After that, I'd make some alliances, and since by then I'd have a reputation of being good with traps, they'd ask me to set up a trap around our eventual base. I'd tell them to help, and since they'd be too stupid to actually understand how the traps function, I'd be able to guide them into making the trap affect them, if that makes sense. So boom, those guys are dead, let's see, maybe 1 or 2 more people left, if there are more than 1, I'd just let them fight it out and wait, I might try to use a distanced weapon like an arrow or something, otherwise, I'd just set a final trap and kill the last person off. I'd only rely on hand to hand combat if I need to, but the reality is that since I would already have had to gotten so many materials to use for my traps, I'd be able to multipurpose some of them, for instance, I could make a garrote if I needed to choke someone in their sleep or smth"
16193,Meh.
16194,"It's not explicitly said, but if you don't play the way the capitol wants you to, you pay for it"

other than that i’m pretty much dead lol, not much a skinny guy who lives in a city could do out in the wild against people way more prepared than me"

i think i gotta reread the books"
16198,become a cannibal to save resources
16199,"i wouldn't win tbh. so, id just wait for my inevitable doom"
16200,Smart man
16201,"Clean ups. Just fucking clean the shit out of the people that are fighting.

(For anyone wondering, in combat, cleaning means getting in a fight where there are already two people and one is about to die/bad conditions. So basically you can kill the the one in decent conditions and get the other one with ease.)"
16202,"Ahh, but if the audience loves you enough, they can hassle the capitol to help you"
16203,Or they make u a sex worker
16204,I don't think they have a Calvary readily available in the arena
16205,Like i would ever tell you :)

16208,The capitol kills your family if you try to suicide so what do you do in the mean time

Smh my head that’s enough over sharing for the day"
16223,no i get it. don’t belittle someone’s pain just because someone may experience more. it’s still pain
16224,"sometimes, but then i remind myself that our feelings shouldn’t be invalidated just because someone else has it worse than us. it is completely okay to complain about things, no matter how trivial they may seem."
16225,"It's stupid anyway. How is that supposed to make you feel better? If anything, it makes me realise the world is a terrible place to live."
16226,That's the reason I don't complain.
16227,"every time, I trail off because I don't think it's that bad"
16228,"No, the people I complain to complain to me too. 0 guilt"
16229,"yeah, and I never know how to help people who are going through really hard times because I can't relate to their situation (which i guess I should be thankful for)

:/"
16230,"no. I’ve gone through some really bad times and good times, but nothing will stop me from bitching about the dumbest things :)"
16231,No.
16232,You shouldn't feel like your emotions don't matter because someone had it worst from you there's always going to be someone who suffers more but it doesn't mean you should take your own bad feelings and shove it up a dark corner because you don't think it's big enough to be a problem your feelings are valid no matter how small everybody goes through different obstacles the fact that yours are smaller doesn't mean they are non-existent you shouldn't be feeling guilty for having feelings or struggles
16233,The human condition summed up in a sentence
16234,yes
16235,"Yeah I just think ""damn, my life is actually pretty good"""
16236,Yes
16237,"Yes, all the time. It’s weird, my mom says it’s okay to complain since I’ve had it hard recent, but it feels weird since a lot of people have had it worse recently"
16238,"Yes, I’ve also been made guilty tons of times because of it. But your problems don’t magically go away cause someone else’s is much worse. Ig it does get irritating when you complain non-stop tho"
16239,"I feel bad all the time about this. Like, there’s nothing wrong in my life and I have so much privilege and I barely have any worries yet I’m so stressed and unhappy. I don’t really complain though I just keep the complaining thoughts in my head and dwell on them I guess. My life should be so enjoyable, but my stupid brain is preventing me from being happy and not stressed out by the smallest things and having a good work ethic. All my problems are caused by me, so I shouldn’t complain about them even though I just did :("
16240,"That is a exactly what I do, if I feel like complaining, I say that to myself, but I don't want to bottle up my feelings accidentally."
16241,"yeah, all the time"
16242,no
16243,"yes, but i just complain to myself.



***self-hatred***"
16244,"Sometimes, yes. But then I realise that other people having problems worse than mine don't invalidate mine in any way. End of the day, there will be things that upset me. Complaining and acting as if I have it the worst will be wrong, agreed. But feeling dissatisfied with your life to some extent is normal and doesn't make you a bad person since you're allowed to feel just as much as the next person."
16245,"no, the significance of problems compared to other, far away problems doesn't change the fact that i can't have problems"
16246,"I have it pretty fucking bad, but I still do feel bad about it"
16247,"Yes, that's why I bottle it up."
16248,"i mean ya but everyone feels different levels of pain differently. i don’t like to respond to someone’s pain by saying “there are people going then so much worse” because no matter what that person is going thru, that’s their pain. i’m not gonna respond to someone mourning by saying people are starving, because most likely that person can’t relate to that."
16249,"I did for a long time. Most of my life actually. I was talking to this guy of a friend group I had been in for a long time. We were all depressed and fed off of each other. We were all pieces of shit. I was complaining about “Oh my parent bad” even though I have very great parents, typical angst. I told him “Oh, I shouldn’t even be complaining, so many people have it worse than me” and he said “there’s only one person in the world who has it the worst, and by your logic they’re the only one who should get to complain about their life.” I don’t feel bad anymore, but I don’t complain as much."
16250,No. That just shows how existence is terrible.
16251,"Yes, that's why I hardly ever complain to people. I just keep it to myself"
16252,Basically the mods had a sub specifically for talking shit about specific users
16253,"I thought some of the mods were nice and can’t believe they would do that. I talked to Star a lot and thought she was sweet and can’t believe she would join a chat like that or have some sort of insider shit. I knew that callum/kwertz dude was a bastard anyway though.

Also, fuck them for talking about Ari and Dria. I like them a lot and they’re really nice"
16254,Do we know who the users were? And how did it all get out
16255,in the imgur link there's a bunch of screenshots of stuff they said
16256,The mods had a server meant just to bully different users
16257,[removed]
16258,This changes everything I thought about this community
16259,I don’t have discord what happened?
16260,That... justifies nothing on your part.
16261,Honestly I'm happy I never went on the discord
16262,"I read through all the screenshots, some of them said some really mean-spirited things about my friends and I, naming us directly. As such, I've lost respect for all but a few of the (now former) mods."
16263,I don't know but they ended up stepping down
16264,"Yeah, if you want the list go on the server and look at announcements, and a bunch of mods actually stepped down because of all this"
16265,Wtf is wrong with them
16266,[removed]
16267,"First of all to everyone that is gonna bash people listen up.

&#x200B;

Yes what the mods did was bad i agree but listen up. The person who leaked these screens made that server and was a heavy contributer to it. She later removed an entire channel with all the bad shit she said and putting the blame all on the mods. Second at the time of that servers creation most of the people in it werent mods yet. Third it was a friend server everyone was making bad jokes that were promptly taken out of context to make the mods look bad. Besides that they did ignore a ban evasion and that is enough to be demodded. However Raya did alot for that server and she really wanted to help but got struck by this she shold not have been attacked this hard.

Also about the fact that wahat was on that server was bad you are forgetting a major thing these were all friends of different races ages and sexual orientations they dont hate on anyone. The hitlist was a joke no one on that list was banned or even close to being banned.

This situation was blown way out of proportion and the admin of the server handled it very poorly this cold have stayed under wraps and solved with the ""corrupt"" mods but they didnt get contacted or pulled aside to explain themselves not they jjust got shamed and when they tried to explain they didnt get the chance too they just kept getting attacked. Now disconnect from the heard mentality and think for yourself."
16268,So all the mods besides the currents of ATG (I'm not active on ATB do idk) are shit? Sure I can get behind that
16269,"Yet, here you are, still only talking about the small part with yourself and then going back to ari again to redirect"
16270,"A “private chat between friends” in which they tried to get their friends on the mod team so they could vote out the head mod, try to get certain users banned that annoyed them, which is just abuse of power, said extremely rude things behind our backs and called the head mod a homophobic slur."
16271,"I don’t think letting a guy ban evade knowingly, calling people names, or plotting to force other mods out is something where what they’d have to say would be worth anything"
16272,"Ant hills compared to homophobic slurs and plotting against another mod. Knowing about the ban evasion was the smallest issue. Also, a couple
Admittedly didn’t seem too comfortable and seemed pressured into the chat from the screen shots, even though they should have left and still makes me question them a little. I don’t trust the former mods also because of not only the shit talking, but they created a distraction of trying drag ari down with them instead of taking responsibility or trying to change"
16273,"Random jokes about people, behind their back, being incredibly mean and shitty to people. I'm not saying anyone involved is better than any other, in my opinion their all shit. Fuck em"
16274,....wow
16275,"I've never modded a server and help people break their own rules. Fuck em, I'm glad it got out and their getting shit"
16276,"This.

I still respect the ones that admitted fault and stepped down. The ones that are trying to drag Ari with them have mostly lost my respect."
16277,"The mods did something real shitty, but people have to realize that they aren’t *shitty people* and they still can redeem themselves. However I never particularly liked the mod team and I’m kinda glad that some of the mods are gone (William mainly)."
16278,Theres a discord?
16279,"It isnt the sub, it was mostly the discord, and either way the problem is mostly solved at this point. I hope we still see you around!"
16280,Im glad I don't use their discord server lol
16281,"same, i joined the server but only talked there like once or twice"
16282,"once i was talking spanish with some people in a discord vc and was talking about how trash the class was, and the teacher told me to mute and asked me to stay after class. at the end of class, she said to me: ¡Qué tenga un buen día! and smiled. I was so horrified and just left awkwardly. since then, I've been permanently scared of getting on my teacher's bad side 😭"
16283,"I was just kinda mumbling the lyrics of the song I was listening to lmaoo 😭🔫 I thought i was muted, mfs at least know I have elite taste.

The other time I had math and my mom was screaming at me bc I wasn't bringing enough money home 🗿 she doesn't even work"
16284,"Lmaoo same, i don't trust myself, I check if I'm muted like every 3 mins"
16285,"bruhhh indeed 😭

what were you listening to tho?"
16286,i think it was a track off the NFR album from lana del rey 🤧 gave all my peers a quick concert ig
16287,i was yelling at my family while unmuted n they were saying some fucked up stuff
16288,"Yeah.

I was having a lot of anxiety and my mom had come upstairs during my class. I turned off my camera but not my mic 

**“don’t give me another sedative I already had one”**

I will never recover"
16289,"valid🗿

at least someone had to vibe with that"
16290,"Haha I actually have this one story that happened last year. 

I was in English so naturally I was bored as hell. During the big quarantine, I started sending voice notes as opposed to texts because its easier and I can get what I want said faster. 

A friend of mine in a different school was texting me, and asked how my zoom was going. I sent a voice note saying ""Horrible! I hate this stupid fucking teacher and her dumb fucking work! Oh shit! I'm not muted"". I of course felt horrible about saying it, I wanted to just melt and slip in between the cracks in the wooden floor of my room.

Since then I have always made sure I was muted before I send a voice note while on a zoom."
16291,"I was on a call with my best friend back in like December, and he said something and I said ""get your panties out of a knot, you're fine"" Well, that teacher and I already didn't get along... And he said that was too inappropriate for class.... So now he really don't like me"
16292,"happens to the best of us

one time I did it in a real programming class, I was listening to All star and started mumbling it while everyone else was quiet 🗿🔫 got clowned lmao"
16293,"No, I check If Im muted 10 times because I talk shit abt my teachers and their class"
16294,i'm going to do that now
16295,My mic was unmuted while on discord my friends and I were arguing about anime.
16296,"Was playing a shooter while ""in class"" and threw some very explicit but creative line towards the guy who just killed me. Teacher was impressed with my English, but asked me to refrain from using this kind of language in her lesson."
16297,that is horrifying
16298,[deleted]
16299,Better than one of my friends. She unmuted while listening to WAP.
16300,People who didn't vibe prolly lame anyways 🥱
16301,I was talking shit about my history teach bc I hated the work in it- not only did he hear me but THE REST OF THE CLASS DID TOO 😭😭
16302,"Not me, because I always check if im muted every 5 minutes, but I’m like 99% sure a kid was masturbating in PE"
16303,"Out of all the songs to get caught listening to, that one isn’t that bad"
16304,Mumbling crazy story pt.3
16305,"that's yikes bro

yeah i'll be making sure that i'm muted too from now on"
16306,onggg not their lame asses trying to study🗿🙄
16307,"I had History, and basically I was talking to my sis how bullshit online classeees are and I even swore at the teacher. Luck was on my side tho because aparently he didn't understand what I said and asked me politely to close my microphone."
16308,"No, but I have said some things accidently out loud where I double checked to make sure I was still muted, just in case.

For example: ""This class is fucking boring holy shit"""
16309,"Oh my god so when we just started online class back in September I was EXTREMELY careful about being muted. Like I tripled checked every 5 mins. But the thing about our meeting is first a little page comes up to confirm ur mic works.  So you just talk to yourself. And I remember this one day i was really tired and skipped through that page, but in my mind I was mic checking rn so in the middle of class I confidently go “HELLO” like that melania trump meme."

16342,I just want to get out of my house. I haven’t stepped out of my house and seen the outside world in 6 freaking months T-T
16343,"why, whats up with Sweden?"
16344,"Well, I wouldn't say they handled it very well, but I can't say they've done that bad either."
16345,"Yes because no more extra free time, allnighters, being awake 'till 4AM and doing whatever I please during classes 😭"
16346,"I'm still in quarantine and have been so since march, and everyday I wish the torture ends"
16347,Damnn 6 months?
16348,Yess from the day lockdown started in our country
16349,"Oh wow, Sweden must've handled it really well"
16350,*cries in USA*
16351,"We do have one of the highest percentage of people who got infected that die if I'm not mistaken though, so I'd say we handled it poorly"
16352,Didn't know India started lockdown that early though. Cases are spiking rn so I guess it makes sense.
16353,I'd glady swap places. You can go back to school and it'll stay home lol
16354,"nope, my country is in quarantine and it's still going. 

And i can't properly game with my friends because e-school keeps me occupied, on top of the fact that my brothers complain about me talking loudly when i'm on discord because i'm in the middle of the goddamn house.

So i'm not gonna miss a thing of quarantine"
16355,"No, you definetely don't want that. It was good in the first few months but now it'a driving me insane.  
  
Also, online class sucks ass"
16356,Amazon got us all covered in everything
16357,Yes we shouldn’t have ended it
16358,Damn what how do you guys get groceries and other stuff
16359,Yea was great imo lol. Good times
16360,"How? Online classes are school but shittier, I literally cam't pay attention to any of them"
16361,Ye
16362,"Oh no, I definitely want that lol. School sucks so much id rather take online classes"
16363,Yep because now my anxiety is even worse
16364,"I’m still in it (Frick yea, ‘Murica), and it’s been so hard, I’m dreading starting the school year tomorrow"
16365,hö hö hö
16366,R u swedish too?
16367,we never had quarantine
16368,Same lol. School gets me worked up.
16369,"> lonely as fuck and have no irl friends 

Good, nothing much changes"
16370,True but I think online classes are way more flexible cuz you can sleep and get wake up late and stuff
16371,Sweden gang!
16372,I have not dropped hints to anyone
16373,"I said “ I wish you would take me on a date” and he said “sure, I got some friends free that can hang out too”"
16374,I was practically on his lap lol
16375,Time to drop some to automod 🥱
16376,I missed that hint one time 👀
16377,"... the way you phrased that I think he got it.

I may be wrong, but that sounds like a friend zone to me."
16378,She won’t talk to me 😭
16379,"I held him by his shirt collar, pulled him towards me and told him that his lips looked very kissable.

We did start dating a few weeks later tho."
16380,[deleted]
16381,Idk I thought it was normal ig
16382,I may have missed a couple hints myself cause I didn’t want to seem egotistical by assuming someone liked me
16383,She ain’t gonna respond 😢
16384,u/automoderator  is this true?
16385,"Jesus christ , how hard is is just to tell him that you like him?"
16386,"We dated a month after lmfao it's not a recent story, sorry for the bad wording uhgghh English isn't my first language"
16387,I did the same and he still isn't getting it. Even if I proposed to him or something he still wouldn't get the hint.🤦🏾‍♀️
16388,"look man we're stupid, please just tell him outright"
16389,"Yeah you could. Just ask him. A boys mind is wired differently. He's probably thinking it's him, but doesn't want to risk/ruin a friendship over a misinterpretation. A girl does anything except ask the guy out lmao"
16390,Ass sign heheh 🤭
16391,Damn that's not a hint that's a whole ass sign
16392,"the thing is tho, i’ve had a girl sit on my lap before and it turns out she wasn’t interested. girls are hella confusing like that

usually us guys get the hint. but we don’t want to misinterpret it because there are so many girls that do those sorts of things in a purely platonic way"
16393,Howw
16394,"not me, a friend's crush literally confessed, and they weren't convinced"
16395,"Ehm, I guess I'm stupid then 😳😳 (happened to me years ago, just found out it was a hint)"
16396,Definitely a friend zone) :
16397,"Had to scroll down way too far down to find this, but yes just tell him. Like legit most of us don't take the hints cause we chalk it up to overthinking or it just being a coincedence or literally anything else. Because in our minds you could never be talking about us/like us."
16398,How could she do this to you
16399,Lmfao frfr 😭😂 mfs acting like they high 24/7
16400,A girl literally kissed me with no dare or anything and I still thought it was just her being nice until about 2 months ago when I finally realized it was probably a hint
16401,"Lemme guess, he was your uncle?"
16402,"I was really smart. Like for real.

I wonder what happened to that."
16403,i legitimately learned that there wasn’t land there in 6th grade. omfg how am i still alive rn 😭😭
16404,I thought when actors died in movies they actually died.

16413,When I was 12 my brother convinced me guys got periods. I didn’t think to google it lmao.

Bruh this one again?? I saw him die last year!!!"
16420,"Canada, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Russia, or a couple of smaller islands is probably the best bet."
16421,u should own a car company and do that so the kids can have their McDonald's
16422,"Indeed, it do be like dat"

16440,Nope

Also there's actually a post about double upvoting that reached r/all a few months ago so I'm telling you you're not alone."

16463,"Dria. Maybe Annelise or some spelling variation

Also hi Esme <3"
16464,I'm changing mine to Sarah because that's what I would've been named if I were assigned female at birth
16465,"Esme is such a beautiful name! 

I don’t think i would change my name"
16466,👉👈 :)))) also Dria sounds like a paladins namd and i love it it's so purdy
16467,You gotta scream if u wanna call me by my name
16468,Violet
16469,"As a little girl I wanted to be Alex, later I liked Haley. Now I really like my name and wouldn't change a thing about it :). My given name is Alexis but I've been called Lexie since birth. Also my middle name is Laine and I've always loved it!"

Probably Bob."
16477,Lexie Laine sounds like a superhero. I love it.
16478,"Fuckin' Abbys.

*(My cousin is an Abby. They're a species.)*"
16479,I'd change it to Butt Ass so my life is even more of a joke than it is now
16480,Can't hate a Bob. Bobs are always cool.
16481,Probably Anastasia. Its the name of my favorite anime girl and It’s just such a pretty name in general. I already hate my name so I would pick this in a heartbeat lol
16482,flower names are so cute !
16483,Bonk. I wanna legally be called Bonk.
16484,either camilla or vanessa bc i think they sound pretty.
16485,From Caitlin to Kaitlyn because 1) the spelling is more common and 2) it's how my name was supposed to be spelled before getting biffed on my birth certificate
16486,I would maybe change it to Séan because my parents almost named me that and I’m tired of people calling me Patrick Star when they first meet me

16526,Valid
16527,"Yeah 

 I'm losing my mind in 11th grade"
16528,"Kinda, I don’t understand how it all works that’s why I’m so stressed!!✨"
16529,"It's fine not to know, a lot of people tend to switch their major in the middle of college. Obviously that doesn't mean you should just jump straight in without a clue about what you wanna do, but still, you always have the choice of switching"
16530,I havent a clue what I want to do
16531,"Oh yes, certainly. It’s been very stressful with the restrictions in place mucking everything up."
16532,noooo I was trying not to think about it D:
16533,I didn't know what to study 5 days before i made the decision
16534,"No, I know what I'm doing and I'm going to a community college so once I get tuition payments set up I'm good to go"
16535,Lol on the flip side I’m 18 and as a result also not worrying 👌🏼. Already in one
16536,If you know anyone who's currently going to university get them to help you out. Especially if it's the university you plan on going to.

16543,"yep, gotta start that UC application and personal insight questions soon, also i was stressing over what major to enroll in since there’s like nothing that really interests me but i guess i’m going for stats now 🤷‍♂️

problem is i’ve never taken stats and i’m not taking AP Stats next year either so kinda have to use Khan Academy to catch up"
16544,"Tacking on to this as someone attending a state college on the fall, please please please make sure the credits are transferable (check with both the community college AND the school you plan to transfer to).

16546,Medical
16547,Oh nice! I suck at bio
16548,"I am, but definitely not as much as people who are going into college this year. Good luck y’all"
16549,"Yeah, for sure.

Imma start Junior year over distance learning, and my grades are going to reflect that in a bad way.

Also, how the hell am I supposed to tour colleges when I can't even go to my own school?

Also, I don't even know for sure what I want to study yet.

I'm actually very worried about all this stuff, because I think I'm screwed"
16550,I swear signing up for classes was the most stressful thing I've done in my life!
16551,"Completely fine, honestly I 100% recommend a community college over a university, if you don’t know what you want to do, it’s way easier to figure that out at a community, it’s cheaper, classes are roughly smaller, and it’s actually easier to transfer from a community to a university compared to high school to university"

But I'm not done yet. I'm still probably being searched for, and Interpol is now also on my case by now. I have to dye my hair, change my clothes, put on a spruce mustache and thicc accent, and try to stay away from any cameras that will give clue to my location.

according to all known laws of aviation there is no way a bee should be able to fly. its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. the bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. yellow black yellow black yellow black yellow black. oh black and yellow! let's shake it up a little. barry! breakfast is ready coming! hang on a second. Coming! hang on a second. hello? barry? adam? can you believe this is happening? i can't. i'll pick you up. looking sharp. use the stairs. uour father

16673,Excuse me WTF?
16674,"It was imaginary.

Ok, but for real, even though I’ve never been on an official date or had a formal SO, my best friend and I were definitely more than friends at one point. We’d hang out like 4-5 days a week and totally liked each other, even though we didn’t know it. Like, we flirted a bit and I missed a *ton* of hits she dropped. 

It’s totally my fault we never dated, and it kind of hurt our friendship (even though we’re still friends). I miss those days, and I wish I could go back and fix things, but I can’t change the past. It was fun though, and I think I’ll always have feelings for her in some way considering I’m still not over it after 4 years."

16680,"it was good ig- 1.5years, we’re still best friends, but we never talk about it lol. occasionally, i’d make dumb jokes about it, but she ignores them for the most part. 

^(she broke up with me because turns out i wasnt as gay as i thought.)"
16681,i’ll tell you when it happens
16682,I was an 8th grader dating a 10th grader and it continued a bit when I was a freshman too. It was not good. I didn’t know how relationships were supposed to work/look like (my parents got divorced when I was young) so he pressured me into stuff that I wasn’t that comfortable with but did because I thought that’s what it meant to be a good girlfriend. I couldn’t be vulnerable with him and he was always kinda judging me. He took my first kiss and kept kissing me but did it everyday and a club we both went to and so I would just dread it and I didn’t know how to kiss back so I literally just stood there and let it happen till I broke up with him (mind you there was a break in our relationship when he broke up with me for this other girl).
16683,It was (and still is) pretty damn good. It’s our one year thing today
16684,Was the beer good doe?
16685,F
16686,never use your diamonds on a hoe

16694,I’ll update you once applicable
16695,You think too highly of them
16696,F
16697,"Well, I loved him and he loved me. But I could never understand why I was nervous when we would talk about things like kissing or getting married someday. Turns out I wasn't attracted to him in that way because I'm a lesbian. Now we still talk and I still love him (just not in a romantic way), so it's all good."
16698,"I've never been in a real relationship yet, but here's a fun little anecdote:

I was in kindergarten and my best friend, Brendon, and I were ""dating."" My mom picked is both up from after-school-care and took us to McDonald's. We sat a a high counter and my mom bought us ice cream sundaes. Mine had peanuts and his had caramel.

It's weird how I remember little things like these."
16699,"yea ik, but i like gay more lol. 

^(i hope this isn’t insensitive or something)"
16700,Damn

16704,"My parents didn't start to panic. They make sure we stay clean and wash our hands and things like that, but we can meet up with friends and do what we want. We're just worried for my grandparents so we don't meet them for now."
16705,"At first my parents let me go out and gluant with my friends, but they announced school was closed for two weeks and school is NEVER cancelled in my state so they now are not letting me leave the house."
16706,"My grandparents are still going out to get coffee like every day, going to their favorite bookstore to browse and then sit and read a little. They are both news junkies so it isn't like they don't realize what is going on. 

But they are in a state with few cases so far, so ig this could change."

16720,"same, the virus was already here where i live and we could go out and do stuff normally, then they shut down schools and suddenly everything related to social interaction is bad. doesn’t make any sense."
16721,"Yeah, fr. My mom kinda yelled at them (nicely) yesterday, so maybe that will help."
16722,"They’re not mass buying things, but they are taking precautions and trying to limit how often they leave the house. They have cancelled some plans, but it’s justified IMO (I’m having a sore throat and drainage, so while it’s almost certainly just a cold, it’s probably best to keep me away from my 79 year old diabetic grandpa...)"

16767,"Literally every western power has genocided. Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands. If you might recall, Columbus and smallpox wiped out 90% of the Native population. They might have let go of their colonies however France still owns French Guiana and many islands. Britain still owns many islands. The US owns islands. If you think about it, the Europeans are responsible for America. Without them, we wouldn’t be here. Did the US genocide? Yes, and we aren’t proud of it. But remember that The US isn’t the black sheep. Is 65 years > 300 years? No, no it isn’t.

Yea sure we own a big arms industry. So what?

“Marginalizes Native Americans and non white people in general.” What is there? Fucking segregation? Death camps? Having to pay more taxes? I am personally a minority and my family have never received these bad treatment. I’m still able to go to college, like everyone else.

Yea sure corporations have it.

16859,"Sort of similar, but I was confused when the word fag was banned on this sub. Where I'm from a fag is a cigarette."
16860,"daddy

my 11 y/o self is still in shock"
16861,Slut. When I was 12 I thought it meant slob and was confused when a girl started crying when someone called her mum a slut in an argument.
16862,I used to say it all the time in front of my family (who definitely knew what it meant) bc I thought it was just one of those things people said.
16863,"""the popcorn trick"". For those of you who don't know, the popcorn trick is when you cut a hole in the bottom of a popcorn bag and put your dick in the hole. The idea is that your girlfriend or wife of whatever will touch your dick while trying to eat popcorn. I may have messed up on that last part but you get the idea."
16864,"Same. I'm from the UK, was playing in a really nice park with a friend from America. There were cigarettes all over the grass and I accidentally sat on one and said, ""For fuck's sake, I hate fags.""

The rest of the day was very awkward and I couldn't figure out for the life of me why the American friend refused to speak to me. I asked my mum and fuck, I realised that the American friend thought I had said something very different. I explained what a fag means here in England and it was all good tho. Lmao that day was wild."
16865,u were kil from club penguin
16866,Clap those cheeks ughhhhhh
16867,"Not as bad, but my mom used to call family members 'ladybugs' bcuz she loves ladybugs. Welll she saw the term on Urban Dictionary and was horrified


ETA: Sorry guys, I meant to add what it meant in the comment. But according to Urban Dictionary, a ladybug is ' A straight girl who has a desire to make love to or fool around with another girl'"
16868,Scat. Didn't know it existed. Don't want to know it exists. NSFL.
16869,AAAAhAaaaHAaaaa
16870,OOOOOOOF
16871,what part did you mess up? the part where i have a girlfriend?
16872,no
16873,prick... definitely used it in the wrong context
16874,Lose your virginity to girls
16875,"Not a sexual word, but ""coon"" I just thought it was a cute version of raccoon and not a racist term"
16876,I wanted to nickname my sister muff when I was a little kid
16877,Wait what does ladybugs mean?
16878,Same
16879,r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
16880,Smoke a fag can either mean have a cigarette or kill a homosexual
16881,Holy frok you did the right amount of A's
16882,Well I am an organ donor
16883, I want my body thrown in the sea
16884,"_♪ Undah da sea, undah da sea, darling it’s better down where it’s wetter, take it from meeee! ♪_"
16885,"Probably whatever is the most environmentally friendly... Depends also on how I die, if I was like murdered or something like that I'd probably want them to use my body as a rallying symbol for a movement lol"
16886,"This made me laugh out loud, sneeze, then laugh again."
16887,"I think it would be cool for my body to be donated to science or maybe returned to nature, but to be honest you could just throw my body in the woods and I wouldn't care."
16888,Exercise often so your organs' next owner is happy
16889,You wouldn't know
16890,That's literally what I want too
16891,"well, there is a thing where they bury your body in a capsule, packed with dirt but it's actually a little tree growing on top. You could donate your brain to science and return the body to nature, acting as fertilizer for a tree. And every year your family could come check up on the tree, and plant another (but without a body, you know what I mean)"
16892,"Lmao iam litteraly planning on keeping a small paper with ""cremate me pls"" on it just incase I die somewhere unexpected and so nobody lets me rot"
16893,Cast it into a statue and cast it in the heart of India
16894,"I like the idea of being fertiliser for a tree which would be a lot nicer to visit than a gravestone, donating organs would be good also."
16895,"I want my body to be thrown in a forest and let it be eaten by wild animals, I want my body to be useful and not to waste money"
16896,"I’m in the diagnosis for a brain tumor so I’ve fully planned this out in case everything gets fucked up. first, i want the organs that can be of use taken out and donated EXCEPT my eyes and then either 1) launch my ashes to space so I can float with the stars or 2) mix my ashes with Bodhiva seeds and plant me in a protected forest in SriLanka where I was born and raised for my first seven years."
16897,"indeed! I'd love it if a someone just spread out a sheet under my tree and had a picnic and had fun. Though I doubt it'd be that fun knowing a dead person is under you, but still

And always, brain matter is also not that widespread, donating brains would certainly help with research."
16898,well if you donate your body after they use the good stuff you don’t get thrown in a trash can they probably cremate the rest of the parts
16899,"That's awful!

I hope you make a full recovery."
16900,Probably to be eaten by some animals
16901,Probably donate organs or something and then cremated
16902,the necrophile in the morgue be like
16903,Buried is the only thing that’s allowed to happen
16904,"Boring, I know, but I would like to be burried"
16905,Hopefully donated
16906,I’d like my organs to be donated. If I’m dead I won’t need them
16907,Throw it into a volcano
16908,"Whatever the hell my family wants to do with it, I won't be around to care lol"
16909,I wanna be a tree
16910,I want my organs to be donated and that they put a picture of Rick astley in my body so when they dig up my body 10 years or so after that they get rickrolled.
16911,"I want to be cremated. The burial that we do is just so disrespectful to the body. They stuff you full of preservatives, wire your bits closed, dress you up in makeup, stuff you in a box that keeps you from feeding the environment, and more. I then want my cremated body to be made into a gem, then that gem to be placed into a skull, my skull, and then I want it to be give to my family. I even have a plan for how I’m going to die, I’m going to gather round my kids and just as I’m about to die I’ll say, “My favorite child is......” then die before saying."
16912,"Online classes, 2020, fucked up sleep schedule, teacher asked me about something about first tanks of ww1. I replied something along ""those big metal box things with guns""

EDIT: got reminded. It went as follows:

Teacher: ,,So, *my name*, what was first used during the battle of the Somme?""

Me: ,,Those big metal box things with guns""

Entire fucking class: laughter"
16913,how do you fuck up this badly Sam
16914,"Bad mod!

I once called my cousin by my ex girlfriend's name."
16915,I’m trying to solidify my place as the stupid mod
16916,“Metal box go boom boom” lmao
16917,">Bad mod!

best*"
16918,Don’t forget pervy
16919,"I said ""fuck u"" to my dad when I was starting to being high on sleep Deprivation. He has some hearing loss so he wasn't able hear it. Thank god

But now....I'm like living on sleep deprivation. infact I will say something fucked up if I ever sleep for straight 8 hours"
16920,I’m fucking awesome tf😤
16921,I think u also named yourself whoresam because of this too
16922,...
16923,[deleted]
16924,Banana
16925,"‘Twas intentional 

*Unlessssss ur making a joke and i totally missed it in that case rip to me*

Now that i think about it ur prolly making a joke so lmao"
16926,I laughed at the word screwdriver for 15 minutes
16927,You sure?
16928,[deleted]
16929,[removed]
16930,Yeah that came to my mind as well after I realised what I said
16931,"I laughed at a 45k character text document for a solid 2 minutes.

Only thing on the document was the letter A."
16932,I forgot that “fee” was an actual word so I was laughing my ass off because I thought the word “fee” was so stupid until I realized it was an actual word
16933,"Yeah, being high on sleep deprivation is a mood."
16934,"Last night at about three AM I was wheezing so hard I couldn't breathe over the sentence 'Not funny, didn't laugh'. So I can relate to that."
16935,#B a N a N a
16936,............
16937,You sure bout that bud?
16938,🤷‍♂️
16939,"""I can't reload, my hand is in my ass"", when I woke up, I was lying down with my ass ON my hand













Edit: I was 10"
16940,"I AM NOT YOUR BUSINESS TRIP!!!!

i was angry and sleep deprived"
16941,HAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHA
16942,"when I realized I wanted to pursue music

It had just been a hobby until then, but at that point I knew with absolute certainty that it was what I wanted"
16943,"yeah, probably finding out that Junior Classical League (Latin club) was really fun and that i should spend more time doing it and with my friends there"
16944,"yes, especially when you have a trash explanation for something and you eventually get it. or when you finally get the muscle memory for a game mechanic

so I'm assuming it's Palutena?"
16945,Nice
16946,"yeaaah cynical!

and a no from me"
16947,Yeah it’s Palu
16948,That sounds really cool
16949,"YEAHHHHH!!!!

god i’m so hype rn"
16950,"Yeah, I was making a wrist mounted GPS, and my touch screen lcd, raspberry pi, my lith ion, and the GPS dongle all lined up beautifully. I just remember thinking ""AWWWWW YISSS!"". It clicked so well that I even managed to add a pop-up flash light using LED's."
16951,Same
16952,What genre do you do?
16953,"Ah yes, Milf Goddess"
16954,Yeah sometimes u just really like where ur at in life
16955,"YESSS 

so i was playing this game called hollow knight for the first time and i thought it was pretty boring and then i got to an area and fought an amazingly fun boss and it felt like.. the whole game just clicked for me. idk how to explain but it all clicked i realized how to play better and i realized how fun the game actually was and now it’s one of my favorite games"
16956,"Yep. I don’t think I was as happy as you are rn, but it felt nice to have something click for me"
16957,"Dude Hollow Knight looks sick, I definitely want to get into it"
16958,Palutena
16959,Guys do you think this guy likes smash?
16960,"something similar happened to me when I played smash ultimate for the first time, I wasn't really invested in it until I started playing as Robin. 

same thing for Osu! I didn't see the appeal of a game about clicking circles until I got a drawing tablet and it turned out to be more fun than I thought. I still suck at it, but at least I have something I can play often."
16961,not really
16962,"Not quite to that extent, but yeah."
16963,Hell yeah congrats man! Wish I could find a character that fits for me lol
16964,"It's kinda cute how excited you are about finding a good character in smash lol.  I love when people get excited about their passions.  It's something you wouldn't expect someone to get so excited about but then again I totally get it.  I've fallen in love with characters in smash and other games that are just fun to play, even if you're not that good you just enjoy playing them, it's awesome"
16965,Well? Who is the character??
16966,For me it’s when I started to really get into the combat loop of doom eternal that felt great
16967,Jazz mostly
16968,Palutena is awesome and I love to use her
16969,it’s fucking amazing it’s my favorite game ever i love it so much my god i have 120 hours all in one save it’s so good
16970,Oh you should play it 100%. Only $15 and it has more content than most AAA titles. Plus a sequel is coming out (hopefully) soon so you’ll have that to look forward to as well.
16971,Nice

16974,"I wear it once, and I wash it once I’ve accumulated enough laundry to warrant doing a load of laundry :/ unless it’s a hoodie, in which case, that thing can go months at a time without being washed lol"
16975,I'm telling you dudes are like apes man
16976,"When ever somthing is actually dirty I wash is, other wise a tshirt would probably be 2 wears, jumpers would be 4 or 5 and jeans I'd say close to 10 or somthing"
16977,Exactly
16978,T-shirts after two wears. Hoodies not for a while unless I spill something on it. Jeans after 3-4 wears. Leggings after 5 wears probably.
16979,I don't reuse clothing
16980,I read “two wears” as two years and was like wtf
16981,i do it too.
16982,Same except 1 or 2 months go by and then I have too much to wash.
16983,Even Jeans (if you wear them)?
16984,"Yup, if it directly touches my skin that’s not limited to just my arms I’m washing it pretty consistently, especially around this time of year because of flu season, any germs I picked up throughout the day, all those dead skin cells, I’m washing that shit lol"
16985,Holy shit your water consumption must be astronomical
16986,Same. Until it’s washed and dried😎
16987,Accurate
16988,[deleted]
16989,i definitely do it too
16990,yo tf how do you guys have that much?
16991,Yeah but she probably smells good tho
16992,"I usually wear a shirt twice, as when I get home I take all my clothes off. But my mum usually irons or washes my shirt anyway because she can’t stand 2nd day shirts lol. 

Jeans, I wear them and wash them. As otherwise they lose their shape and tightness not only that but jeans I believe need to be quite hygienic compared to a top."
16993,Lol tbh that’s happened to me and I’ve got a ton of stuff to wash after 1-2 months
16994,If it's not stained or stinky it's good for a while
16995,....I do this.
16996,"Once every 1-2 weeks but I have a lotta clothes so I never re-wear something, I also thinks it’s nasty re-wearing clothes before washing them"
16997,i usually wait until i’ve worn everything in my wardrobe at least once to wash my clothes
16998,im a girl and i do that lol
16999,Some people say they wear stuff like 4 times before they wash it on here and I’m just like... okay that’s why the kids in my school are musty asf lmao
17000,I just throw out everything I wear and buy new clothes 😎
17001,"One or two wears for t-shirts

Week or two for pants

From 2 wears to a week for hoodies/sweaters. It depends on which one it is. Some get bad much faster than others"
17002,Just because she's 13 doesn't mean her feelings are invalid.
17003,and you're 16 you should be nicer to her
17004,That's me since some years now.
17005,I think she just meant that u/edgy-hippy will have plenty of time to do all those things
17006,"Analyse your blood test, I'm pretty sure y'all got some deficiencies. It's absolutely not normal. Take complements after comparing your results with OPTIMAL ones, don't wait for your doctor to just say that they're okay, they're probably just enough."
17007,Sounds like my whole last summer
17008,"yup, recently for me. it hasn't been as bad as what you described but i can't even bring myself to talk to people."
17009,"I've never had my first kiss or snuck out or did any teenager things honestly besides smoke a lot of weed and I'm 1 month from being 18. You have time. just do things for you, not because of others expectations. Take that advice and you'll go far"
17010,"What makes me feel better when this happens is learning something new, right now im on rocket science for a challenge."
17011,You're 13.
17012,"Flair says everyone, and you sound insensitive"
17013,i think she did too but she couldve phrased it a different way :)
17014,Yup
17015,yea fr i was hella tired a few years back and i had iron defficiencies it cud be anything
17016,"You really need to eat something and get some help, because I don't think this is normal"
17017,somehow i don’t feel this
17018,"sometimes, but i keep going cause occasionally i get that spark of motivation"
17019,"""weeks"""
17020,Just reading the question i would say yes but after reading the text i would def say no. I don’t think it’s normal to go for stretches of days straight up not eating. Do yall need help?
17021,"those are huge signs of depression my friend. please tell someone, i'm here if you want to talk"
17022,"I’m 15 and still am missing a lot of that, middle school and high school definitely are product-not-as-advertised, but there’s a lot of other experiences and nuggets of wisdom you’ll gain that will keep life entertaining regardless. Try to stay positive, I know it may seem impossible but if you puff out your chest and peace yourself for whatever comes next you can put your worst years behind you. (Side note: wow, this is a really long comment considering it’s a femboy on r/askteengirls responding to a thread from an original post. Wow.)"
17023,that doesn't make her problems non existent mate
17024,i didn’t take offense to it but sometimes when people say stuff like that it feels invalidating and like minimizing my feelings. but i know what he was trying to say and i appreciate it
17025,Make the memories YOU will cherish.

17027,"nah, I've never really experienced this."
17028,"omg this was litteraly me in 10th grade. I did not do shit, but somehow I managed to get really good grades and got into the school I wanted to get in to."
17029,Everyday for the past month or so
17030,Literally every day since school started. I just sit in a discord server with my friends and do virtual fishing
17031,That's called the last 6 months.
17032,"The switch from ffn to ao3 was ridiculous, ao3's just so much better quality"
17033,I still read some stuff on there lol. There's a few hidden gem books & authors
17034,I was never quite a wattpad gal but my ao3 phase lasted so long
17035,"ME ME ME! 

Omg even writing it too!! I have over a 100 random followers on that stupid account and idek why the hell they even follow me in the first place lol

and I have written at least 5 books already??"
17036,Which fandoms did you read?
17037,homestuck
17038,"Tbh there’s some amazing writers on there. Once I left elementary school I hated reading, but wattpad made me love it. I really should get back on there but video games is life. 

There’s an author “Blu_Fate” that writes taboo stuff and it’s crazy how good her writing is and stories you forget it’s taboo."
17039,"went through one 3 years ago, slight regrets because it raised my standards but overall good times"
17040,The switch from wattpad to ao3 is even bigger
17041, Like other said mostly ao3 and the occasional fanfiction.net viewing
17042,And it feels amazing to stumble upon them
17043,"BRO ME OMG...
middle school was a time"
17044,I’m in the ffnet and ao3 phase rn but I prefer ao3 a lot more
17045,Boy here. My wattpad phase were actually 3 short phases. One of witch was a Lion King one. Never finished any
17046,I'm still in that phase- but at the moment I'm gradually switching to ao3
17047,Can confirm the wattpad phase did happen
17048,yessir i did
17049,"No lol, I mean I think everyone has looked *something* up before but I never had a phase"
17050,That was like 2015-2017 for me
17051,"yeah i was super obsessed w it, i think a lot of the writers there are female too. i mean during my 13-16 year old phase was reading those cheesy cliche love stories about dating bad boys (super common on wattpad), having boyfriends and just high school love things in general bc honestly that’s something i can never imagine to occur to myself (then) so obviously it was fun to fantasise and fangirl over those bad boys HAHAHAHA but i guess that phase is now well over? occasionally i still go to wattpad for fun but not as often as before"
17052,"Started three years ago, still in that phase lol, also use ffnet and ao3 too. Aaah, help lmao."
17053,Ah yes my 14 year old self. I was obsessed as hell
17054,I wrote a Hermione and Draco fan fiction and it has like 2.5k views and I still use it when I’m bored. But I used Wattpad never really got the hang of other platforms.
17055,"I mean, I still read stuff from wattpad and ao3 if it's well written..."
17056,"Oh boy, I remember it.
People were supporting me and saying""more! More!""
Now that I look back to it a year ago from last week (yes lol, for some reason I remember when I uploaded the last chapter), I was pretty decent.
It was understandable but not very detailed when explaining things."
17057,i'm still on that phase i already have  500 stories in my library and i have written 3 books. the writing is shit but i still like reading my xreaders once in a while
17058,I went through that phase starting at 9-10 years old when I was starting to be obsessed with Undertale. I honestly hate the youtube user who linked a smutty Wattpad book about it and I hate my really innocent brain for clicking on that mess.
17059,Ao3 not wattpad but yeah the fanfic phase
17060,Da fuq wattpad
17061,Me
17062,"Yeah, but the old songs."
17063,Agreed
17064,"i have a collab playlist w my friends, one is french and one is german so sometimes yh but generally i listen to songs in english

ngl french drill kinda slaps"
17065,"never , i really dislike my language"
17066,Same
17067,"Sometimes, if they are good"
17068,[deleted]
17069,"bangladesh. rock or folk music is popular here, and it’s beautiful. such good music bro"
17070,yesss i love music from here it’s so good
17071,some but its not my main jam
17072,Exactly lol
17073,ayyy French drill is fire
17074,i mean yeah there’s talented artists out there but like the language sounds kinda rough so imo it’s not good for songs
17075,No they're just stupid and 80% of them was made with itotune(shit that makes you sound like you're singing but it's easy to see difference between normal singing and that)
17076,Dutch music is terrible and the language just sounds really cringe
17077,"spanish language pop is just a bunch of robots singing about kissing and sex, but i haven’t looked much into the language’s music so i’m assuming the rest is better. holy fuck what i have to listen to for 6 hours a day is bad"
17078,where are you from if you don’t mind me asking?
17079,"macarena - damso ngl is a vibe

not really drill but still hard"
17080,[deleted]
17081,"No, because they speak too fast in the songs for me to understand lol."
17082,[deleted]
17083,"Kinda rarely, but yeah"
17084,"Almost never, I hate it with a passion"
17085,Can confirm

17091,What’s the problem with Dutch?
17092,I had a DSi. Traded away mariokart to a friend with a promise that I'd get it back. That was a lesson I learned the hard way
17093,no😔
17094,"DS, DSi, and a 3DS

My mom found the DS and DSi at her work and nobody claimed it after like 3 months"
17095,pog
17096,People never follow up on their end of the deal. Jordan Jacobs from the first grade still owes me two fucking sour gummy worms
17097,I had both and the PSP actually still somehow perfectly works and I play on it
17098,Same here and then I had to get a new DS around 7th cause my old one was kicking the bucket. Still have my 2nd I totally didn’t hack

17108,Same I had a DS that got broken and then I had a dsi that I used so much the bumper stopped working then I got a new one that I played for a couple years before I got a 3DS I only played that for about a year before I got bored of it tho but then I got a 2ds a couple years ago hacked that baby tons of fun
17109,A girl still owes me seven bucks.
17110,"DS and 3DS, my 3DS still works but I can't find the charger :("
17111,Ds
17112,"i had a PSP until my fam moved out when i was like 11 and i left it at our old house, i still get sad whenever i think about it lmao"
17113,"DSi and 3DS here, my brother broke my DSi but I still had a lot of other Nintendo consoles lmao"
17114,I had a DS when I was 5 but it was stolen. Fortunately now I have this magical thing called an emulator.
17115,"i had a psp. got it when i was 10 in 2015. had tons of fun with it. took it everywhere. played assassins creed brotherhood, god of war both ghost of sparta and chains of olympus, prince of persia sands of time, a random cars 2 game and a lot fucking more. still have it and i just pull it out once in a while to feel good about those times. simpler times man simpler times."
17116,Psp
17117,I had neither
17118,None 🙁
17119,"have psp, dsi, 3ds, new 3ds

the nintendos' batteries have all gone to shit but the psp is still like new basically"
17120,"Yep. Had a 2DSi XL. I had it for a long time, then I lost it 😞"
17121,i had a 3DS. I still use it sometimes and I had such a good time playing pokemon y and animal crossing new leaf on it
17122,Same I have the most basic ordinary simple normal average usual typical common regular plain conventional run-of-the-mill unremarkable mainstream guy in mind
17123,i just imagine them as either their pfp or a generic person with shadows instead of a face.
17124,Idk I just don’t. Also how would you even imagine it like do you imagine them looking down at their phone or sum?
17125,Like the default Facebook profile picture:)
17126,She's really trying to stress that she doesn't create the mental image with any adjectives in mind.
17127,How do you not have any assumptions on how someone might look like?
17128,Why so many adjectives?
17129,Yo did someone call me?
17130,I don't think I really create any mental image of them now that I think about it.
17131,Thats weird lol
17132,When they have a pfp of some hot fictional charcter 😭
17133,"Depends, most people I meet on the internet will remind me of someone or something I’m familiar with, maybe their speech patterns remind me of a friend that shares their gender, also they might have given me details about their appearance, I can’t say that they would by default be super attractive, unattractive or average, they would just be how they are...but...ya know...as a visible human being in my mind, does that make sense?"
17134,"Nah I just imagine a person, nothing weird about it."
17135,"I jus imagine the generic dudes at my school (tallish brown hair, brown eyes, sporty white bois who are decently attractive)"
17136,Nah just imagine what their body might loom like you know.
17137,"""fuck ig they're hot now"""
17138,If I like their personality I perceive them as being super attractive but when they aren’t it’s not really a shock.

17141,Just don’t.

17143,I just think of them as their pfp :/

17151,"I just imagine a regular guy. Brown hair, just.. No color eyes? Hahaha. Unless they tell me something about their appearance I will change my picture of them. They are usually not super attractive. Just average."
17152,yea boys will be boys is one of the dumbest and most misogynistic things to teach a young kid😐
17153,"lmao shut the fuck up. i can recount dozens of times i was assaulted by women, a lot of them occurring when i was a child. there is a literal epidemic of female teachers who rape male students, you just never hear about it because no one gives a fuck. you havent got the faintest idea what youre talking about"
17154,"Boys will be boys is supposed to be for funny things, not sexual harassment lmao. Yeh it should be a thing to teach people basic boundaries"
17155,"A lot of ppl don’t take boys being raped seriously and don care or find it harder to believe that a women raped someone, and i think that is reflected in the court.  And I think that generally speaking men have a much higher sex drive than women."
17156,Boys will be boys is them loving fart jokes and trying to bring worms into the house
17157,[removed]
17158,"> Boys will be boys is supposed to be for funny things, not sexual harassment lmao

Exactly. I occasionally wonder how has that phrase been morphed to mean ""rape is okay,"" when that was never its use case."
17159,"same reason why some people smoke, drink and do drugs.

&#x200B;

they know it's bad, yet they still do it. 

&#x200B;

fuck do I know why"
17160,"Honestly I don‘t think rapists give a single shit about what their parents taught them, they’re bad people, so their parents saying “don’t be a bad boy <3” is gonna do anything."
17161,Thank you for agreeing 😌
17162,I love how the same people who are saying “boys will be boys isn’t a thing” are saying “it’s just in our nature to do bad things” like dude that’s what boys will be boys IS
17163,Then why do women get sexually harassed so much by men? Yes lots of people are taught not to be pieces of shit but clearly it isn’t effective or a lot of people just aren’t being taught that.
17164,Your trolling efforts are weak. Try harder.
17165,"Yo, what the fuck? This was just unnecessary as fuck.

Sure you had a discussion with her and she got kinda impulsive on that but she realized her mistake and then it's really not the time to just attack her for no real reason.

I mean, what is that about? She has done more for this community than you will ever do, and that's just a fucking fact. She's super dedicated to this and really tries her best. You not liking her is a completely different story.

Literally all you are doing rn is being an absolute idiot for no fucking reason."
17166,[deleted]
17167,Okay bud
17168,"i mean... theres a reason they became bad people. no one is born bad, and if they are showing problematic behavior they should be taken to a therapist not “boys will be boys”"
17169,“Rape is not poggers” is the sentence of the day now
17170,"I explained that in the second half, I completely agree. It’s just statistically more common with males"
17171,makes sense until you realize that experience is raping someone else before finding out oh rape is not poggers
17172,When people want to excuse bad behaviour of their child they'll use everything
17173,"Idk much about this subject, but the best I can come up with is that one, girls are most of the time weaker than guys, two, guys are usually a lot more hormonal that girls, three, there is a lot of rape culture and ease for guys to get away with rape."
17174,"i think that already happens. at least for me, in elementary EVERYONE was taught to never force someone to show their private parts and never show ur private parts to people and other stuff like that. you just seem to forget that this stuff is still relevant, and that leads to many horrible teenage boys and girls."
17175,"oh, no. Women don't 'rape' children, they just perform non consensual intercourse! haven't you been reading the news lately?"
17176,They're a social justice warrior don't bother replying to them. They just find ways to bend your words and try to start a fight for no reason. Don't bother talking to them they just have savior complex.
17177,"I've read 'boys will be boys' being used as a reason a student shouldn't be expelled from a school for sexual harassment 

People really will try to excuse everything with anything"
17178,My first sentence was literally that boys aren’t taught that which is exactly what you just said and if you had basic reading comprehension you probably would’ve figured that out
17179,I agree but you do realize what you said made it seem like you thought his trauma is invalid right?
17180,"What do you want me to say? Beg for you to believe me? If people don’t wanna believe me they won’t believe me but I feel like shit cause I acted like shit. I realized that Joji may have taken that as invalidation of trauma because I didn’t think before i said something. I know how that invalidation feels. Of course I feel bad

Also dear god that second part"
17181,"That’s literally the point of this post - because boys aren’t taught that from a young age by their parents or media or other people, ESPECIALLY media and other people. You constantly see schools restricting what girls should wear and older people telling girls to be polite while no one talks about self control to boys. You can’t just say that boys are biologically going to be rapists and women never do that stuff because that’s ignorant and wrong. This kind of behavior is taught either directly or indirectly and it’s up to parents and the general media to put a stop to that."
17182,why are u getting hate dms wtf

17199,Yep yep
17200,"Yeah, I’m sorry you do too"
17201,Yeah lol. Sometimes my mood just switches like a blink
17202,"Yeah I have like the worst mood swings. I usually use music to try to get myself out of a funk, but it doesn’t always work."
17203,"all the time, i try to convince myself i’m just pms-ing but honestly at this point who knows"
17204,"Sometimes but it usually has a reason, I might not know what that reasoning is but it still exists"
17205,"Not that I know of, Ik typically pretty happy and if I’m ever upset there’s most likely a reason, like someone being too annoying or mornings"
17206,"Yeah, all the time"
17207,Yeah happened right before I saw this thread actually
17208,"Okey a slight disclaimer that I have looked into the subject in my teens so I don’t exactly remember the whole science behind it. Or if it still holds as valid. And I spent an unholy amount of time searching for a tumblr post that explained it quite well -and provided sources- but I didn’t find it.
 However we need to understand that sadness and happiness aren’t polar opposites. [The opposite of sadness is actually…the absence of sadness.](https://www.google.ch/amp/s/fujikosuda.com/2013/09/02/the-opposite-of-sadness-is-not-happiness/amp/) and once we understand this we are half way there. A second thing to keep in mind is that as far as our brains are concerned elevated emotions take a tiny push to change from one to another. Which is why it is quite easy for you to go from really happy to really sad because your emotions are already on a heightened state."
17209,"Yeah, pretty often"
17210,"usually happens if i accidentally fall asleep, im the kind of person where if i take a nap midday i dont feel very refreshed i just feel confused, disjointed, and overall in just the worst mood"
17211,All. The. Damn. Time.
17212,"I always feel that way. I'm sure it's just me trying to convince myself that I'm not a good person.

I wouldn't actually know if I am a good person or not."
17213,"You're the sweetest, nicest most compassionate person I know."
17214,"don’t worry sid I wasn’t digging for anything I’m actually doing pretty good

thank you for your kindness"
17215,"This is probably what I most agree with.

I don't know if I'd call myself a good person, but I do *try* to be a good person."

17218,All the fucking time
17219,Constantly
17220,"I KNOW I am not a good person. I am pretty toxic, but hey, at least I can recognize it right?"
17221,"i feel like that sometimes too. my ppd makes it hard for me to trust others, causing me to believe that they’re malicious or trying to harm me with little to no evidence. this makes me push them away, even though they haven’t done anything wrong.

but about what you said: pushing people away, even if they haven’t done anything wrong is never your fault. even though no fault may be able to be seen on their side, that doesn’t mean the blame automatically falls to you. if you make excuses to justify your actions, it’s no reason to feel bad. heck, you don’t have to feel obliged to make an excuse in the first place. if you’re pushing people away, just remember that it’s probably your subconscious telling you that you just don’t want to be around this person rn—which is perfectly normal and justifiable in itself. regardless of all this, always feel obliged to make your own decisions & be around who you want to, because you’re the no.1 in your life. live for *you*. that doesn’t make you a ‘bad person’, it makes you a normal person with a good head on their shoulders in my eyes."

17376,"its not about getting mad, but they will probably remember what you did forever. you will still have an impact on your loved ones. their impressions on you will change... if you did fucked up things. but if you took some embrassing selfies you are good i guess"
17377,"You know, I don’t think I’d mind. There’s things I’d prefer them not to see while I’m alive but if I pass suddenly I think I’d be ok with them going through my stuff and my phone. Maybe they’ll learn something about me they hadn’t known before or they’ll laugh and reminisce on all the pictures I have. Maybe they’ll even be a little shocked at some things but I think that’s ok. I’d want them to have things and pictures and memories to remember me by. Plus I’ll be dead so even if they find anything it’s not like they can do much about it. 

Gonna make a shameless announcement here: 

Have a death plan. Go  ahead and make one if you haven’t already. Yes I know we are young and not likely to die soon but in case of a freak accident or in the event you can’t make your own medical decisions, it’s always good to leave instructions behind so your family knows what you want. Start the discussion if you can with love and care with your family members. It’s never too early to think about what you want when you die. Whether it’s burial or cremation or whatever you choose. This is just me but if I die I wouldn’t want my family struggling to pay for a funeral. If possible I’d honestly just want a home funeral with everyone there. After that but put me in a box and dig a hole I don’t need nothing fancy anymore. So yeah make a death plan and start talking."
17378,"if i said my mom that i want my phone to be burned when im dead, she would steal my phone at the same night and would look through all my embrassing things lmao. almost every mom would do the same btw"
17379,What I want to know is how many times he'd done that previous.
17380,"Ah damn, well I guess my Mum will see my nudes then, but at least she police won’t know about all the crimes I’ve committed."
17381,oh nah i aint doing that 💀
17382,If they ask the police they can get access
17383,Lmao
17384,So....what’s on your computer that you don’t want them to see? Why does everyone have more interesting secrets than me?
17385,They can just unlock it. The phone company can too and if they are really desperate face id lol.
17386,Never thought of that but guess I’ve unlocked a new fear now
17387,Same haha. The problem is I have a pass code but my mom knows it and I can't change it
17388,I’ve been workin on a death plan cuz ya I’ve had way to many damn close calls >! An tried suicide to many times an I’m suicidal!< an there’s certain things I only want certain ppl goin thro
17389,Me on my way to make a pact with my bsf that if the other person dies we have to go through eachothers phones before anyone sees them
17390,i’m so sorry to hear that! the world wouldn’t be the same without you. hope things get better ❤️
17391,"not OP, personally I'm not worried about my phone but my computer, as its storage isn't encrypted (looking at you windows, not offering encryption except on the pro version (unlike pretty much every single other major OS)), so they could just plug my hard drives into another computer and go through my files

but they probably don't know how to do that lol"
17392,"The time I cried it was kinda good actually. I was in the state Honor choir last year, and I was there with so many of my friends it was great. I just realized how good it was, and that I'd probably never get that again and I broke down. But everyone was so supportive I still miss them. Gerome if you're out there, I love you"
17393,Yes. Usually when I was sent to the principal’s office in kindergarten but also when a kid got my entire class to hate me multiple times in 7th grade
17394,"Yeah, I have anxiety so I've had panic attacks at school and when I have panic attacks I usually cry."
17395,"Yeah, so many times. One of the most recent times was around 2 weeks ago. I was crying because we had to write a poem about our personal lives, and I kept on thinking about my family's issues."
17396,Yeah I love Gerome too
17397,"Nope. My anxiety got so bad I had to drop out. One of my favorite coping mechanisms is music but I couldn't used it because it went against ""school rules"" and they said if they did it for me they would have to do it for everyone. Which I call bullshit, because no you don't, all you have to say it that it's a medical exemption. Simple.

Not to mention my counselor didn't do a lot while I was in school, like I was having a really bad panic attack once and she told me I was acting like a child.

Overall they haven't been helpful."
17398,Best comment here
17399,"I cried in my English class, and History class in middle school because one of my friends (not my friend anymore) called me a narcissistic slut just because I was better at playing an instrument in band then them. And then my whole friend group kicked me out of the group at lunch because they believed them. Very toxic shit, now I've got trust issues lol"
17400,This is my favorite comment
17401,You gotta love Gerome
17402,At least you didn't shit yourself
17403,Gerome is a solid 8 outa 6
17404,"Yeah. I wanted to draw minecraft potions in class, but then my teacher told me I couldn't do that and then I startet crying cuz I wanted to finish my potion... I think it was in 6th or 7th grade."
17405,i fucking FELT this sooooo hard😭😭😭
17406,"Yeah, I absolutely hate when school wants you to write something about personal life, like why the fuck do they want to know."
17407,Dies your school have a good way yo help you cope?
17408,"Oh God I'm sorry that happened mate, a whole class too"
17409,"Yup, near tears when I'm embarrassed or stressed that I don't understand something right and I just feel sooooo dumb!!!

also if we are watching a really good movie (eg: Inside Out) in class, the emotions hit me hard and I'm sobbing there, smiling (pftt btw this happened last month in psych class which is one of my favourite classes, and the most recent times I've cried at school)"
17410,"Ah shite that's rough, I'm sorry that happened to you. What instrument do you play? It sucks when people get jealous"
17411,Gerome is da bomb
17412,"Yeah I kind of feel you on that one. I had to drop out of my school too because of issues, and my schools response was to just try and sweep it under the rug. No support, no counselling, just try to maintain their reputation (spoiler, did not work)


They did let me keep a instrument I had on loan as I suspect a bit of hush money, which is cool. But overall when your in school and you have all that sort of stress people really need support, it should be normal to make exceptions for people zfor their mental health"
17413,"i cried today because the state college that everyone in my school applied to sent decisions on friday but for some reason, there’s a glitch and i didn’t revive mines yet. over been stressed about this because it’s my top pick. my toxic ex friend knows i didn’t get it yet (she’s also a family friend so that’s how she found out) so she purposefully says really loudly in the beginning of class “omg i’m so so so happy i made it in!! i’m just glad i’m not one of those people who didn’t get theirs yet haha!”. way to rub it in."
17414,"Thanks for caring dude, I appreciate it. I play the flute, and yeah I agree it's problematic when friends get jealous. Also, that group I was friends with ended up realizing that they were wrong around a month after the incident. But instead of apologizing, they told me that they kicked that person out and that there was an open spot for me now. Friends are tough sometimes jeez"
17415,I cried under a desk once
17416,[deleted]
17417,"More often than not, it's for self reflection and introspection- it allows you to see your life a different way. Many of these things aren't shared in class and only ever seen by the teacher, at least where I am"
17418,"This is so fucking embarrassing I don't even know if I want to say it 

I was in class and some kid had is nails inside my hand I don't know why he was fully gripping me so I don't know what I was thinking but... I fucking licked his hand he fully screamed and I instantly just acted like I was looking for something in my bad I.e I had my head in my bad all of class and I started just slightly crying but then I couldn't stop and I just wanted to hide it was sad / pathetic and yeah I just did that all of class and people kept asking if I was okay so it was worse since people where finding out so yeah I cried of guilt / embarrassment"
17419,"Honestly it ain't because I have family issues that it is hard to write, it is because my life is way too boring to write anything solely off of."
17420,"Yeah, my sister brought one of the family cats to college with her (90 minutes away) and I hadn’t seen the cat in 2 weeks so she texted me in class that she was bringing him home because she couldn’t handle taking care of him on her own so I was going to see her and the cat which made me bawl my eyes out."
17421,"Not recently, i dont cry anymore i usually just swear but when i did it was because this kid opened a window straight into my face"
17422,"Try to make long distance work for a while, ik rn it probably looks like she's the love of your life, but I would wait a couple months before buying a plane ticket. Also, you have to make sure that somehow your parents and her parents would let you go which might take some time. I know it sucks, but good luck."
17423,It won't. I'll just swim the ocean
17424,"Hope she is.

Don't let the distance stop you ;)"
17425,"can’t you guys video call or something? it’s kinda impossible to meet face-to-face at the moment, maybe when you’re older (like 18?) you could try meeting up if you guys are still able to keep in contact"
17426,"I hate to say it, but you probably rather need a reality check. You've never seen her, you won't be able to meet her and even though maybe this can be fun on the internet and the way it is now, this is not a good or stable base for a relationship. It just isn't."
17427,Dig down trough earth
17428,"Hey buddy, trust me i know the feeling. My boyfriend and i are long distance too (i live in canada he lives in europe) and we've been together for 3 years. We will finally meet this summer. My advice to you is wait. I know its boring but waiting and seeing how your relationship goes with her is the only way. Right now you're too early in the relationship to spend that much money on her. I'd wait at least a year to see if not only you can trust her but if she is also willing to make LDR work."
17429,This. I'd at least wait a year to meet her.
17430,"You’ve only known her for like a week. Calm down,"
17431,"I mean you're only 15, so if she's really worth it you'll wait I spoke to a guy online for 6 months and now we don't talk, life just got in the way you know. 
She might only think of you as a close friend and who knows maybe she's dating someone irl that you don't know about. You've only been talking to her for a week..."
17432,"Check out r/airplanes/. 

The people over there might be able to help you."
17433,That is my problem. I can't wait. I feel like i need her. Now. And delaying anything will result in a faliure in the realtionship and one of us will end up being heartbroken
17434,[removed]
17435,"PLEASE don’t commit suicide, I’m sure everything will be fine. There’s probably some kind of explanation, like you were going too fast for her? It has only been a week and you’re already planning on flying to the US for her. I understand how you feel about her. I met a guy who lives in the Middle East and I’m in America. It sucks and I really, really want to be with him, but I can’t. I have a strong feeling she might have seen this post and freaked out because you’re moving too fast for her. Just give her a little space, I know it hurts, and if she doesn’t come around eventually, it’s her loss. You seem like an incredibly loving, dedicated guy and (as much as it probably hurts you to read this) she’s an idiot if she doesn’t want to be with someone as sweet as you. I’m begging you, don’t kill yourself, things will get better one way or another."
17436,"I’m from the US, I’ve been with my boyfriend from EU for two months now. Just FaceTiming, sending dumb selfies, and talking whenever we miss each other. We haven’t been able to meet cause we’re both underage, but just building a relationship on trust and not forcing things to happen or like not setting days to call (cause if you do that and it falls through you’ll be disappointed), and learning to love each other despite distance is key imo. Good luck dude"
17437,"Dude I would absolutely 100% wait. I was in your exact same situation myself, but as time went on I realized she wasn't for me. You're still in the honeymoon stage of talking (everything seems sweet and perfect to the both of you). Step 1 would be to actually start the relationship, then wait *at least* 1 year before you do anything major like flying across the world.


Trust me on this, from a bro to another bro, you don't want to rush this."
17438,/s or no /s?
17439,"I'm dumb, soo no  /s probably?"
17440,Agreed. I’m genuinely thinking he’s a troll honestly because I can’t believe somebody can be this obsessed over someone they’ve known for a week.
17441,"Holy shit you’re lucky af, I wish mine could have worked out that way"
17442,Wow you are obviously dumb dumb
17443,"Time to spill it out...

I can relate to your story, OP.

I met a guy on Reddit, we know each other for 3 months and later on we became boyfriend and girlfriend.

He's from America,I'm from Europe.

When we met...we both had depressive thoughts...but we talked to each other, and we found out we were quite similar...so we chatted even more...everyday...after school...I also took into account the timezone difference....
And we fell in love,it just happened.

He's also describing me in the same manner you did for your girlfriend.And he really wants to travel to my country too...Just to see me...

But we've decided to wait until we get older.We both have families,friends,school in real life,and we don't want to step over any of that.

My advice for you,OP....is to wait for a time,like a year(or when you'll be both 18).One week it's way  too early to really tell.You can get a flight ticket,but it's very risky when you're a minor.Does anybody else know about your relationship?

*Please don't kill yourself.* It'll bring pain to your family,friends,AND girlfriend.It won't help anybody,believe me.

Tell yourself : *I WILL meet her in the future.I'm sure of that.And my love for her will break any distance and will pass the test of time.*

Sorry if it was a bit too sappy.

I don't think that will help too much ,I guess.
Good luck,OP.

Hope you both will be happy eventually.

 Kind regards,
a plain Redditor

P.S:Excuse me for my bad English."

17446,"Hehe that sub is awesome

r/flying r/aviation and r/shittyaskflying are all also cool subs

Basically planes are dope"
17447,"What do you mean? Seriously, please don’t kill yourself over this. I know it seems like a lot right now, but things will get better."
17448,Amen yeesh
17449,Well lucky because he is great but unlucky because he lives 6000km away.
17450,My great friend
17451,"I am also in a similar situation to you as my crush is in America while I'm stuck in Britain :/ 
We've known each other for 2 years and a few months but only started developing feelings for each other since August 2019 and ever since I've been the happiest I've ever been! The way you describe your crush is literally how I would describe mine. Even though the distance between us is very long we don't let it get in between us by talking a lot, sometimes I'll stay up just to talk to him and we've been trying to call every weekend (and it's been successful so far :D). 

Anyways as a person who is in a similar situation to you I say see where the relationship leads to in at least a year, I don't think it's a smart idea to meet a girl over the internet who you have only known for a week. For all you know she could be trolling you but then she could possibly be genuine, there's no real way to tell just based of a week and this is the internet after all. It's worryingly really easy to lie."
17452,"Not really, pregnancy is my worst nightmare"
17453,I don't think I want kids anyway but if I do I'd probably adopt
17454,"I don’t want kids in general. But, if I do end up wanting kids, I would adopt."
17455,I do want bio kids but giving birth sucks and I have a low pain tolerance.
17456,Yes.
17457,Same . I don't know what I'd do if ended up pregnant. It seems scary af.
17458,lol me too
17459,C section isn’t any better from what I’ve heard
17460,"maybe, but i’ll think more about it when the time comes"
17461,"Probably yeah, cus im really curious how my kids would look, and even though birth and pregnancy seems really scary i think it’s worth it to experience at least once."
17462,I would literally rather die than get pregnant
17463,Only that it doesn't involve pushing the bowling ball out of the va jay jay.
17464,AHHHHAHAHAGAGAGAGAG sorry omg.. 😭
17465,"That's my view on it. World's hella fucken overpopulated as is, I'm not adding to that even if I want kids. Which I don't."
17466,"With every generation thinking less about getting kids, how high do you think your chances are to adopt? Just a piece of thought, nothing else.

Let me just say even today, the chance is pretty slim where I live... But our country has a good social system that rewards kids so I guess less kids are getting impoverished..."
17467,"That’s literally what... vaginas are supposed to do...

Edit: can’t believe I’m getting downvoted for this. Goddamn I forgot how much I hated this sub lmaooo. Downvote me moooore it only makes me stronger"
17468,"Imma still pass. The world is overpopulated and there are millions of abandoned children, I'll stick to adoption. Mad respect to those brave enough."
17469,It's really not something you want to do unless you have to though
17470,That's why so many ladies died during childbirth before modern medicine
17471,C section is possible
17472,I want physics kids
17473,[deleted]
17474,"pregnancy is terrifying, physically, emotionally, and socially, and I do not want to deal with it. some people would call that selfish, I call it my basic right to not consent to having a child, or whatever comes before that.

I might change my mind sometime idk"
17475,"Not really, I don't even want any kids, but if I changed my mind I would probably adopt."
17476,"Yes, but it's particularly hard for humans because of our head to hip ratio. It's not the most impossible thing ever, but it's definitely hard. It's definitely easier for cows and dogs."
17477,[deleted]
17478,"Exactly. And the fact that there are so many kids out there ready to be adopted, it wouldn’t hurt to give some of them a home. Plus, pregnancy is pretty painful."
17479,"Hormones are a really strong thing and believe me, I know girls who would have said ""absolutely no"" and have considered a nightmare but then were happy to do it anyway, somehow?!"
17480,I feel the same way about pregnancy!!

17509,Not if I stalk you first.
17510,Have you stalked me?
17511,stalk mine and rate the dog pic 🔫
17512,I only got told that girls have a vagina and boys have a penis. Never learned about the clitoris or shaft or labia or foreskin
17513,We were told that boys could masturbate but nothing was ever mentioned about female masturbation
17514,We don't have sex Ed here 😑
17515,It was basically just them repeating baby bad condom good for 5 hours.
17516,when I went through puberty I went to the doctor cos I thought my labia was cancer or something
17517,"I remember one day back in 5th grade after PE class, the teachers separated the boys in one classroom and the girls in another and all we did was basically watch a video on how our bodies will change from puberty like developing body and facial hair, deeper voices, etc. However, after the video, they warned us not to talk about what we listened to outside of class otherwise there would be a possible chance that we would get suspended.

So I'd say it was alright but honestly could've been better lol."
17518,I was never told about masturbation at all
17519,I think it is sad that we dont even get taught about all our body parts
17520,I didnt even get a diagram
17521,"> I didn't know my own anatomy, thought my clitoris was my peehole

Hmmm I'm learning. I mostly remember putting condoms on cucumbers and feeling inadequate about my pp size because cucumbers."
17522,"I had sex-ed about 3-4 times because I move a lot and different districts have different curriculums.

It took until the most recent sex-ed for me to learn that girls have 3 holes down there and not 2.

Half of my sex-ed classes kept saying that abstinence is the solution, but the others said that sex was an inevitable thing and just prepared us for safe sex.

My most recent health class was the best one ever because it taught me literally everything. But the one before it was the funniest.

One of my favorite questions ever asked in my class was ""If semen was sucked up by a pipette and squirted drop by drop into the V, would the girl get pregnant?"""
17523,Ummm yeah that's what I mean 😅
17524,"One of my female teachers said that women do not get physical pleasure from sex, and that it's all emotional.

The internet keeps saying that she is wrong, but it's really been messing with me mentally."
17525,Lots of country's dont
17526,What the fuck?!
17527,They said the word condom and said it had something to do with the penis but never said how or why
17528,cucumbers can be massive tho
17529,And now you know
17530,"Mine was in fifth grade and it was very detailed for each gender although we were separated. It went into heavy detail (excluding mental changes and sexual intercourse kept it to what you should expect during the first couple years) on what will happen during puberty and explaining the anatomy followed by a brief lesson on female anatomy.
I remember most of the girls looked shellshocked (some were even crying I actually felt pretty bad until I remembered when I originally learned some of it) but us guys on the other hand were completely fine a couple looked a little confused but most of us were grinning because we thought it was all hilarious. I had an entire elective health class in seventh grade which was mix gendered and it went into much deeper detail about anatomy and stuff."
17531,"Ours was pretty decent from what I remember, we learned the basics of everything"
17532,"It’s weird how many places don’t have sex Ed it should be required by the EU and the UN.
Also I feel like I remember you from somewhere.

Edit: to the person who responded and hit deleted I saw a bit of your response and I believe the UN are the ones who write the Geneva convention and pass international laws so I believe they would have that power"
17533,it was good
17534,"I'm Indian, and this is literally the only ""sex ed"" we get"
17535,I put a condom on a banana in front of the class lmao that's the only thing I remember
17536,I didnt know there were 3 holes in the vagina and butt until last month
17537,Sucked but slightly better than some peoples
17538,"Let me tell you that’s some bullshit. Your teacher either only has bad sex, or she straight up lying to you. The clitorus is literally made for pleasure the genitals are filled with nerves. If it didn’t feel good no one would be having sex."
17539,Oh oof. They told us what it was and said if we visited them they'd give us some for free no questions asked. Most of it was just trying to get past a billion childish jokes after every sentence.
17540,"It was good.

we learned about female and male anatomy, periods, contraceptions, giving birth and being pregnant, even a little about masturbation.

Also the teacher made us think of question that we had to write down (anonymously) and put in a box. Then the next lesson he would answer the best ones. 

There where questions like 'what is the average pp size?' 'At what age do most people lose their virginity?' and so on

We didn't learn a lot about actual sex tho, more about everything around it."
17541,I’m surprised they even went that far for you. The most I got was an old diagram of a nude hairy guy
17542,"I can’t say I do this at all, though I get to be on the other end of this fairly often lol

^dw ^tho ^I ^don’t ^hold ^it ^against ^you"
17543,"yesss i'm gonna be like ""aw damn"" and then read our previous convo and be like ""oh it was my fault"" lmaoo"
17544,i always feel so bad lmaooo i can’t speak for everyone but i’m sure they don’t actually mean to do it to you😭
17545,"Then I gotta hit them with the ""sOrRy FoR tHe LaTe RePlY"" 😩"
17546,Yeahyeah I get it so it’s all good lol
17547,me too they gotta be used to it by now😭
17548,"No I'm so desperate to keep conversations going that I'll keep talking until they end it. A bit of an exaggeration but not really, occasionally I'll just completely blank on what to say and sit there staring. I wish more people would realize that it means you have to literally just send another message and that I'm not ignoring them"
17549,"My phone is awful with notifications sometimes. I was once wondering why someone hadn't messaged me back yet, turns out they did, over 13 hours earlier 🤧"
17550,Yeah sometimes and then I feel dumb 😭😭
17551,"Yo, fr this happens way too often"
17552,omg yes too much and then i realize they'll hate me for eternity
17553,Yeah I've done this too many times but I realize it too late and now I have a few messages from like two years ago that I've just never responded to.
17554,I've done that to friends before lmao. Tbh I get it done to me more than I do it tho :')
17555,"Not a huge texter, I usually VC with imp people"
17556,Yes. Often.
17557,"Yeah, I've accidentally left my girlfriend on opened so many times....

17617,"I'm FTM so I feel like I'm qualified to answer here. If you want to do that it's totally up to you, just know that it might overtime make your breasts less perky and more droopy. Also it gets really hot in the summer, and it can damage your ribs if you don't do it safely. (No more than 8 hours, don't sleep in it, no intense exercise.)

If this is really something you'd like to do, I would recommend investing in a good one, those cheap ones can really mess you up and trust me you will not be able to breathe. I'd start with our most trusted brand GC2B. They have 5 different skin tones and some other colors. DO NOT SIZE DOWN. Get the correct size for your measurements, if you're on the fence go up. It will still work. 

Here's the [brand](https://www.gc2b.co/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo6D4BRDgARIsAA6uN1_AmJ68_fNEVhqIYDV-tOkJsQPGTF5bRX0f7fIQa_GybgqpReYrg8QaAqt5EALw_wcB), [size chart](https://www.gc2b.co/pages/sizing), and a [guide](https://www.bustle.com/p/11-of-the-best-binders-you-can-buy-according-to-a-trans-person-30921) I've found very helpful in the past. 

I hope you have a good binding experience, feel free to ask any questions I didn't cover."

17624,"i love that ,that sounds great ."
17625,What’s that supposed to mean?
17626,Hehe great that im being remembered because of that .
17627,No I don’t see the point
17628,"I think it’s fine. I’m also a cis girl and the first time I heard about a binder, I almost ordered it (the price kinda killed me). I’d love it to have one because it’d make my boobs flat so I could wear shirts that are more revealing and tight in formal settings without being sexualized by men as much. Also, I like the ratio full thighs/big hips/small waist/small boobs more than my actual full thighs/big hips/small waist/big boobs."
17629,"I don't understand people who think that, I hate not wearing a bra. I always wear a bra, maybe it's because people who think thatb have a bigger boob size... I'm not gonna ask cuz that's inappropriate but I just don't understand the ""bras are uncomfortable"" thing"
17630,"yeah, definitely. i hate the size of my chest (it’s not that big) and i don’t like how it protrudes (weird word sorry) and how it’s so visible when i wear a shirt."
17631,I might. I’m super into SFX makeup and costumes so if I wanted to do a male character I would probably have to use a binder since I have a larger chest

17647,Are barbies and kids toy banned in your country because most of them are choking hazards?
17648,Yooo I'm from Indonesia too so same thing lmao (and when they banned tumblr wtf)
17649,Can you sleep IN the refrigerator outdoors though? Asking for a friend.
17650,Wikipeadia was banned for a long time (3 years) due to political things.It was so hard but it is accessible now.
17651,"Yooo, I live in Oregon too, and I've broken this law. Also, you can't bathe naked( its a law from a LONG time ago, but still stupid)"
17652,"In Poland abortion just got banned, basically the only reason an abortion can be executed is if the pregnancy endangeres the womans life. The last time people were protesting this much must have been when the communism feel and Poland got it independence back."
17653,"In India, porn is technically banned to prevent sexual violence and child pornography."
17654,You can't call someone a communist in the irish parliament.

And yeah but I'm scareeeddd"
17678,"hey weenie! college apps szn really hitting different huh

honestly i don’t see the problem, colleges will like it if you can write about things you’re passionate about and especially good if you’ve helped others. If you frame it as something that required lots of time and effort and contributed to a positive environment for teens across the world, i think you could make it into a good essay

let’s just say if i got mod i would’ve at least included it in my activities section"
17679,Trueee lol. if it’s rlly personal for you then it might not be the best thing to write about. Don’t sacrifice yourself for the app yknow?

I probably won't I just wanted an excuse to post ha"
17681,😂oh wow my first joke about me. I absolutely adore it
17682,"Heyy weenie! Good to see you here

Well here in India we don't need college apps, we have entrance exams but that'd be quite impressive ngl cause there is a lot of competition but I exactly don't know so kinda take other ppl's advice too

Good luck on your apps and again good to see you"
17683,"Look, I'm sorry but no. Moderating a subreddit isn't very useful. If they even know what reddit, or moderating subreddits means, they will see it and be like ""Wow she clearly hasn't done much and is listing useless shit to impress us. Deny her.""  This is very similar to a discord moderator who has a million roles on his server. You need to put some actual work experience. Try

1. Previous/Current Jobs
2. Volunteer service
3. Awards
4. Skills/Talents
5. Maybe a club you administrated. I started a self-improvement club at my school and I put it on my resume

Sorry if I sound rude but I'm just trynna provide some honest feedback"
17684,"You should ask this question in r/ApplyingtoCollege too.

I think you should. Worst case scenario, they ask you about it. As long as you don’t directly lie you’ll be fine."

I just have seen ppl put discord mod on their apps so was curious"
17689,"Yeah I have seen a lot of y'all stressing over it

But like it's good also. Colleges there check your over all personality and practical knowledge. Here is just study like robots for 2 years, give an entrance exam (very tough tho) get a good rank and get a college, no applications

But I think they are kinda better cause talents in other activities are kinda suppressed here and that's sad"
17690,"I'm doing okay it's nice to not have to worry about some of the stuff on here

But I'm bored cuz of rona lol, hope y'all are okay too."

17693,Never slept in a bed with a guy that isn't related to me so idk
17694,"Yup. Friends are friends. Also, I'm bi so same applies to girls and enbies. The only time I'd have inappropriate thoughts is if I was in a relationship with them or had a crush on them."
17695,Well I really didn't expect so many yeses
17696,Lmao ye ofc
17697,Yep!
17698,Idrk why I'm upvoting these as a male

Could be down to the fact that I’m an asexual lesbian and that all my guy friends are gay but who knows"

17703,"20x testosterone.

For me though of the girls I’ve as friends slept with that never crossed my mind."
17704,"I’ve never slept in a bed with a guy before but I’m bisexual and I’ve slept in the same beds as girls and sometimes my mind wanders to that kind of stuff but mostly I just wanna sleep, so I’m guessing it would be the same."
17705,Bi gang bi gang
17706,"Ye, I have the secret powers of anAsexual"
17707,I use the label lesbian but in reality I’m just homoromantic. Lesbian is just easier to say lmao
17708,"Testosterone is generally more powerful, and guys generally have higher sex drives"
17709,I'll sleep with you broski
17710,Sure.
17711,"I think it's just that, generally, it *seems* that girls have lower sex drives than guys.

But I believe that they're equal and girls were just raised to hide it subconsciously."
17712,What if that guy had a big tromboner tough?
17713,Which is sad. Imagine how much more fun the world would be if girls were raised exactly like boys are now.
17714,i wouldn’t have inappropriate thoughts i’d just want them to gtfo of my bed

17722,Yeah they used to but I have more freedom now luckily
17723,Such as?
17724,"Does it annoy you?

How do you react?"
17725,"Yeah it's annoying, but they've backed off a *bit* I think. Mine wasn't as bad as yours so I just acted visibly angry and after 100 times of that I think she got the point"
17726,Thankfully no
17727,"Yes, I struggled with eating as a young teen and now my mother will never let me eat a meal without me telling her exactly how much I ate"
17728,Thats because you're in America
17729,"Lol 100 times 

I'm glad your situation has changed 

Yeah mine is getting kinda too much now. 

Imagine my mother teaching *me* how to workout.

At least my father has my back."
17730,"only my mom sometimes but she usually lets me free, not as much with my sister though she really micromanages my sister at times"
17731,"Kinda understandable 

Are you annoyed by this?"
17732,Yeah you're really lucky.
17733,"extremely, encourages me to lie about stuff because I’m so tired of the micromanagement"

17736,"Yeah 

Imagine my mother teaching *me* how to workout."
17737,Mommy knows best
17738,except when she has no clue how anything works. this feels awfully similar to those stories of kids who grew up with antivaxx parents
17739,She wants to but does not?
17740,She does but I don’t think it’s as bad as your situation
17741,Oops imma go kms😬😬
17742,Yes all the time. Then when I try to even ask them to lay off a bit they say “we wouldn’t be doing this if you didn’t need it” like dude fucking what
17743,My dad does that. It’s really getting on my nerves.
17744,Somewhat yeah. Mostly deals with my electronics usage
17745,"Not micro-managing usually, but they don’t let me do anything. Such as, I’m not allowed to get a job until 18"
17746,"Same

My mother always replies with 

""It's for your own good""

At least my father is reasonable."
17747,"Same

Does your mother help you out?

My father often tells my mother to back off"
17748,"She was really controlling and would try to dictate everything I did. But since I was really rebellious and don't follow her shit I would always be grounded, until my dad ungrounded me"
17749,Nope just other stupid restrictions

My mom heard and came to my room to check on me before she got water. She asked me to unlock the door cause she heard a banging sound. So with my last bit of strength I unlocked the door, then I proceeded to hit my head on another wall again and collapsed. So there I was nothing with a towel to cover me and my entire family screaming because I passed out.

If someone starts to follow you, call the police. And if the problem escalates and starts to get serious then confront and be ready to fight. Even though that might be a little scary and you might not be confrontational but like I said, this is your life. Live to fight another day

My dad used to give my sisters pointers on how to fight lol. Kicking a dude in the balls or knees is very effective. And also, surprisingly, stomping on someone’s foot really hard. As well as taking your two hands, and smashing them onto someones ears can really throw them off. Just imagine that you’re trying to do a really wide clap, with his head in the middle

Also if you’re going to punch the power comes from the hips.

But even if it's the nice sewing scissors that are razer sharp. An older male can likely overpower a younger person, male or female. Plus, human skin is fairly hard to penetrate, throw a shirt and a jacket in the mix, or even jeans, good fucking luck.


You're right, again, it is better than nothing, you can always go for the face, but id rather suggest a deep carry knife. Won't notice it in your pocket and your shirt covers it. If you makes you uncomfortable to carry one at school stow it away in your backpack, or locker, or in a bush outside school. But it'd work miles better than a pair of likely dull scissors"

18044,"You can’t really carry anything here. Unless it’s a thing called farb(?) gel, but all it does is stain clothes and skin, to “help identify the threat”."
18045,"yeah and it's likely the dude's quickly gonna overpower her and take the scissors from her rather quickly, so that wouldn't really work but good try"
18046,"My actual advice is at the bottom, but if you want to see what definitely not to do, look at the other stuff aswell.

Knifes are a terrible option! Unless you know where to stab to get a quick kill (or to incapacitate) it might just enrage him, same with pepper spray, not guaranteed to stop him (tho it's a good way to get time to run away).

Tasers are equally unreliable, if he's wearing thick or baggy clothing then the taser is basically guaranteed to do nothing, and even if it connects there's a good chance that it won't stop him (like in the case the police used a taser 3 times on a guy which did nothing).

A few people are saying get a gun, if you were 18 I'd probably suggest it, but you're 15. If you illegally carry a gun with you you might get in serious trouble (and is not great for going to school) also if you have to use it, with no training you're as liable to hurt someone else as you are to hurt the dude. To legally carry a gun you have to (despite what many people say) get a background check to own a gun, then get a second to conceal carry. 

If your parents are gun owners, and there is a gun Ind the house I would HIGHLY recommend you ask them for some training, at a local range or anything. This could save your life, even if you don't plan on owning a gun in the future.

Your best options are to get lifts to places and have the police on a speed dial or something like that, as just calling and saying ""[his name] is following me"" is enough to get him to back down. Although I cautioned it, pepper spray is a good last resort to distract him and run to a safe spot, anyone you know who has children, GO TO SOMEONE BEFORE THEY COME TO YOU! There's a much lower chance that a person you go to will be a threat than someone who comes to an obviously destressed teen girl."
18047,"DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO AVOID WALKING PAST HIS HOUSE. 

If you absolutely *have* to continue walking by his house

1. If possible, always walk with a large group, preferably with at least a couple of large/older boys. Unfortunately, these types of people would only be afraid of someone who can overpower him. 

2. Carry a large bag that you can easily get off of your body. If he tries anything, throw it at his feet and run away. With luck, he will trip over it

3. Befriend his next-door neighbors and ask them if you can use their houses if he tries anything 

4. Use social media and livestream yourself as you walk by his house. He will probably not attempt anything if he knows there would be a video record."

18087,"i’ve had “not like other girl” experiences, but they’re a lot less extreme compared to your examples. most of the girls in my grade who want to act different usually aren’t doing anything that unique"
18088,They are missing out man. Girlfriends are amazing and sometimes better then guy friends.
18089,Yeah definitely I can see that
18090,"Most of the ""not like other girls"" Girls always seem to flex their taste in music and movies 24/7 even though it's such a weird thing to flex about. It's really annoying cause they think they have the best taste even though music and movies are all about preference."
18091,Probably would have done the same tbh
18092,the identity crisis is spot on
18093,Yeah usually they aren't in real life. I notice online however that a lot of girls seem to suffer from internalized misogyny.
18094,Some of them are amazing...I kinda got ditched by this girl I've known since I was 9 . She changed schools and is friends with all the guys now..I mean ofc she's allowed to be but she was just like this when she was in my school ...she used to forcibly become friends w the guys at our school and then cry when they weren't there for her...I was and she took me for granted....I just miss her so much...
18095,"If you were a previous not like girls attitude, how did you get over it? And how do you help those girls who seem to developing internalized misogyny?"
18096,"I used to be kinda like that, although not as extreme, but i grew out of it. I guess i still kinda carry some of that mentality, in the way i dress and some of the media I consume,but I no longer internally shame girls for liking stereotypical things because that’s toxic af lol. I think a big contributing factor of this behaviour is how men tend to shame *anything* girls like(not all men obviously), like how if a girl wears trendy clothing and listens to chart music, then they’re ‘basic’ but if they don’t conform to these trends then they’re ‘qUirKy’ and ‘not like the other girls’. I think a lot of girls take up these misogynistic views as a way of validation from their male peers. Personally a big part of stopping these opinions is recognising that these views are indeed misogynistic, and a lot of posts on r/feemagers really display how rampant these opinions are, especially on most subreddits where the larger part of the audience are male (case and point: the infamous boys vs girls meme). Can we just stop shaming people for liking things and let everyone be happy dammit!

Sorry for the wall of text, but as a former ‘not like the other girl’ I have a lot of thoughts on this subject."
18097,I was kinda like this but i think it was because i was really really tomboyish and the girls in my elementary school and even highschool made fun of me for that so i hella over compensated by being the exact opposite as much as possible because i didnt want to be like them. I “woke up” from it when i started making friends with girls who were actually nice to me  later in high school but it took a learning curve. I grew up with all brothers and my best friends were always dudes and my i didnt understand how to properly socialize with girls and i didnt really care about socializing with them but then i guess i grew up and stared liking dudes and saw the value of femininity and good gal friendships. So perhaps other girls might be hurt by their experiences with other girls social expectations but maybe thats just my experience. I think its just a growing up thing.
18098,"I guess I was sorta going thru that phase before. Kinda still am honestly 😔

But ya like it’s pretty cringe looking back but like honestly it’s just that these girls don’t know what to do. They don’t know where they fit in or what they wanna do. You know what I mean?"
18099,"I think I'd respond with ""oh I've never heard of them. do they have any songs I'd know?"" and proceed to act like I've never heard any queen song (really, queen isn't generic?)

and then get her to play a song like bohemian rhapsody or don't stop me now or we are the champions etc. and insist that ""oh this song is from glee"""
18100,I love kids but imo giving birth is kind of immoral in this age
18101,Definitely I felt the same until I met a bunch of girlfriends and realized that what I thought was wrong and that girls can actually be better friends since we relate better.
18102,ooh yeah i know what you mean. most of the girls who act like that that i’ve talked to online really do have a crazy mentality about themselves. i’m in a few art communities and it blows my mind how some people think they’re different than the rest *just* because they draw. ???bruh

I'm pretty sure the camera thing is illegal, especially since you don't give permission for it.  Schools have gotten nailed with child porn charges because of doing this, and lots of kids who have desks don't bother to close their laptops, and obviously you get changed in your room and stuff... You get the point

I'd imagine goguardian didn't want to get nailed either so they changed it, but other sketchy software that's similar may still do it.

Watching your browsing at home is also a stretch in terms of legality, but they get around it because it's considered school, so in most cases as long as school *would* be in session normally the school can monitor what you do legally. 

At the end of the day it's pretty creepy, and if you use a non school issued computer that you don't sign into your school Google account with (the browser, you can sign into apps with it just not the browser itself) you'll be fine.  I do this and the school can't do anything to see what I'm doing.

18241,This is definitely a good thing to do because it motivates you to be the best person you can be. However you need to make sure you're not changing yourself to the point where it makes you unhappy. You need to remember who you are and that just being yourself is always the best option.

I joined different groups on DA and discord that support me and help me improve on my art skills. I always try to have a positive attitude, even faking it helps tbh. With that positive attitude I can brighten up people's days at least. 

And finally... Looking at people much worse than you to feel better about yourself. It's not the most... Nicest thing to do but it does help out knowing that there's someone worse out there than you (once again I know this is not the nicest thing to do and you don't know circumstances of other people.

18255,What really worked for me was to raise my chin and try to keep my eyes looking forward. At first it was uncomfortable but with time it got better and now I have no problems with self-esteem at all and I don't bump in people
18256,[deleted]
18257,"I just stopped caring and eventually started liking myself better lmao

Fake it till you make it"
18258,"Mine might seem kind of insensitiv,  but to improve my self-esteem I just thought about all the people that I don't find attractive that have significant others. Then when it comes to dating I keep replaying in my head that question ""why would I want someone to like me who doesn't find me attractive or like me for exactly who I am?"" and this really helps with my confidence about how I look and helps with insecurities in a relationship."
18259,First of all surround youself with the correct people. This may sound silly but being surrounded by people you feel comfortable with and can be yourself without worrying that they'll judge you it's important. It's the first step to improve your confidence.
18260,"I'm having the same struggle with my self esteem. My mom told me to start putting more effort into my appearance. I usually just wear hoodies and leggings or sweatpants, but I've started working out a little and wearing crop tops and shorts again, and it feels really nice. It's so easy to sink into a mindset where you don't care, and that's where I was for so long. But putting in effort has helped get me out of that mindset, and back into the bad bitch mindset lol"

18264,What?

18319,Wdym Shrek is a sex symbol
18320,"It’s actually because mirrors flip our faces the other way around so we’re used to seeing ourselves like that. The camera shows us how we actually are but it looks ugly to us because everything is just... off.

18325,"Ye ye ye yeee. It's fucking terrible! I completely understand how you feel, and I hope you start to feel better about yourself soon."
18326,"Yeah I don’t think this is unique to girls. I mean stereotypically girls are more vain, but I’m a guy and I sometimes get this exact feeling too."

18330,"Since noone can be as sexy as shrek.

You just called yourself sexy (not as sexy as shrek tho)"
18331,"I don’t think I’ve ever seen a picture of myself that I liked. After seeing a picture of me, what tiny self confidence I have just gets completely destroyed. That’s why I hate getting my picture taken, and never post anything on social media. It’s gets a little better as I get older, but it still really sucks."
18332,Yep. I read it’s because we see ourselves in mirrors and pictures are an opposite reflection of that. So if your face isn’t super symmetrical it looks off to you but normal to everyone else.
18333,"I’m with you on not taking pictures. 

It sucks because everyone thinks it’s weird. No class pictures, no pictures with friends, no pictures of me when family is on vacations. 

I just think I’m ugly af and don’t take any"

18335,Lol no comment
18336,yes :(
18337,Same honestly
18338,I see myself in pictures to much and now Idrc
18339,"[M] ok so y’all listen. When you look at yourself in the mirror, you see an inverted look of what you look like.

That’s why when you look at a picture your self esteem melts. There’s a weird uncanny valley effect thing taking place or something and your brain doesn’t like it.

That’s why selfie apps (i.e. snapchat (i think, i’m too lazy to check)) reverse your facecam like a mirror, so you don’t see yourself as a monster.

18367,I'm scared of that happening
18368,I'm too much of a coward. What if I get ignored. What if it becomes awkward? What if I stop the conversation flow. What if Im trying too hard to be casual? What if....yh and that's pretty much how it goes all the time

But I will"
18373,Yes. I basically just read the general chat in the atb/atg server and it’s so awkward cause I wanna say stuff but at the same time I don’t.
18374,Take atgb discord server for example
18375,yeah but that’s probably my fault since i never have the motivation to pay attention in any of my classes lmao
18376,yeah i'm tired already
18377,This is exactly it
18378,You just summed up my whole senior year in a post
18379,"Yes and no. I like school, the subjects, the lessons and the people. I just hate exams"
18380,Absolutely
18381,"Absolutely,  I usually lack motivation to do things but this year my motivation for school has been at an all time low, I stopped talking to two of my best friends and I barely do homework"
18382,"Yeah, even tho my teachers are giving less work then ever i just constantly feel stressed out about it."
18383,YES
18384,Not overwhelming but I struggle to do the bare minimum now. Though being assigned a 20 slide presentation on a material did not help matters
18385,"Yes, I used to be a really good student but lately I just can't find the motivation to do anything."
18386,"For me it being online kind of makes things feel not real? Like if I don't hand in an assignment it's not like I will be confronted about it I just quietly don't submit. If I don't go to something nothing happens. I also find it's really easy to forget to go to stuff. 

And in general the lifestyle of online learning is very depressing. It really isn't conducive to being motivated. How can you be motivated when every day is just waking up and sitting at your desk?"
18387,"Online. For me at least I don’t feel motivated to do any of my work, and my gpa has taken a dive"
18388,"yeah, it does that sometimes."
18389,"Ugh, school is becoming so much more overwhelming. My school district is about to return to a 5 Days A Week schedule with the entire school, so I bet the workload is going to be skyrocketing in the next coming weeks. Not looking forward to it."
18390,"I feel the same man, and especially in lockdown as my adhd is taking over, it seems like life's hollow now"
18391,Honestly cheating feels normal at this point
18392,yeah it sucks
18393,Yes it has been and also with adhd like fuckkkkkkkk I’m failing 3 classes 😐🔫
18394,Reminder — School is not designed to be done during a global pandemic.
18395,"I was, and I was so close to just skip multiple school Days, because I couldn't do it, with the lockdown and all. 

Luckily, we had winter break for a week, last week, and that has definitly helped me, get motivation again"
18396,Yeah. I don’t even want to do school work.
18397,It has been ever since distance learning started
18398,"Same here, I feel like I’m always trailing behind and I have so little free time"
18399,"Bro same with everything you just said. I’ve always had a hard time keeping friends, and only have one irl rn. But this year I’m getting very overwhelmed with school. I can’t focus, and always turn my work in late. And I have cheated on every possible test/ assignment I could. Also I have no motivation to do anything productive, I always have, but now it’s 5x worse lol"
18400,"yep. i can't even pay attention/participate in the classes anymore. i don't have any motivation to do anything, my anxiety is getting worse and worse. the only subject that i'm actually enjoying to study is biology. last week i cried out of anguish because i couldn't solve a simple math problem. i absolutely hate online classes but i also don't know how i'll be able to re-adapt  with ""traditional"" classes once the pandemic ends. i needed to vent, i'm sorry for the huge paragraph lol"
18401,yeah :( ive have ~30 missing assignments and i just can't bring myself to do them lmaoo

18405,"That's way too blunt lmao, we don't know how she feels exactly tbh. She might be a bad texter and trying, saying would make her insecure + probably lose feelings. 

I wouldn't want someone to say that to me tbh"
18406,"Just tell her that it's just you doing most of the talking and that she should try to initiate a conversation, too.

It's pretty blunt and she might leave you on seen, but at least it'll sort things out."
18407,"Don't just ask questions, tell her things about yourself, things you experience, whatever comes to mind. When yiu share stuff it'll encourage her to share things too. And if she still doesnt then she might just not be interested...?

Just asking questions can often feel weird, kinda like some sort of interview like you said.

Oh she could also jus tnot be feeling so well"
18408,"I mentioned that she might be a bad texter but imo if only one person contributes to the convo, and other is just answering stuff without asking something back it just seems like they aren't interested and don't wanna seem mean.

I'm not saying that the case everytime ofc, but speaking from my own experiences that's how I see it"

I actually appreciated the honesty, tho"
18411,"Don't ask questions, instead try to think about something cool that happened to you maybe a few days or weeks ago and talk about it casually, bit confident as if you have been friends for a while, or send her stuff and say something like ""it reminded me of what we were talking about"" 

Anyways as a girl who likes girls I'm tryna figure this out as well💀 but this works so far on my so it might work on other people? Also she might just be nervous or a dry texter, try a few more things to see if she's actually not into you or just doesn't know what to say, if she's still dry after a few days then it might be better to stop"
18412,Facts
18413,Talk about the fact that our existence means nothing and no matter what we do it doesn't stop the inevitability that is death. Usually keeps the convocation flowing.

18415,"i once texted to a gurl 4 days and we seemed to like each other and then out of nowhere when she found out we both r cancer she never texted again :/

idk what the fuck was going on in her head cause i was still the same as 4 days ago but yeah ok after 4 weeks i just told her what i felt and said bye 

¯\ _ (ツ) _ /¯ ig i wont ever get girls or at least the one that love astrology ಠ_ಠ"
18416,You probably have more experience then me.
18417,I am sorry you had to experience this. But life sometimes brings awfully things to you and you need to learn how to deal with it to stay alive. But there are thousands of others who love astrology. And even people who dont love astrology could have other interests that you like.
18418,"Damn, let’s make her have an existential crisis so we can have something in common. Thanks bro!"
18419,"Start talking about yourself as well. Tell her a funny story that happened to you or something more intimate(if you're comfortable). When you ask her a question also answer the question yourself. Tell her about your day, hobbies, things you accomplished, etc."
18420,"person in a long term relationship here:

Unlike what I saw someone else suggest, texting is not something that has to come naturally. Neither is conversation in general. However, getting stuck in what feels like an interview can be uncomfortable, so here's some tips:

Don't actively shut down conversation. This may sound obvious, but if there is something they are interested in, and they talk about it, try asking questions about that and trying to understand what they are talking about.

Show active interest! Texting is actually super convenient for this, because if you have no idea what they are talking about, you can just Google things! If you like this person I'm assuming you enjoy when they talk about things they like, so show it!

Make jokes! This one has the biggest likelihood of not being useful at all, because jokes are hard and very subjective. Bottom line though, treat conversations like you would with friends. Even if you never get together with the person, you should still try to make interactions  fun.

Hopefully some of this was helpful, but honestly I'm not good at judging. Good luck!"
18421,"Ask open ended questions, don't make conversations about yourself and don't kill the vibe"
18422,"I feel like it's a two person job to be honest, but you can't be asking like ordinary questions, you need to find a way to ask something that could get some elaboration out of her, if she's  interested in talking she will probably give you something substantial that you can both work off of, but if she doesn't it's probably safe to say she isn't particularly keen on the chat"
18423,"Np, my entire life above the age of 9 was an existential crisis."
18424,"heres how i do it and this is from my experience of texting a FUCK ton of girls

seem interested in the questions youre asking, answer it yourself if you ask one, and when she replies, comment on it, and try to branch off into a different topic

find common interests between you both. this is as simple as asking her ""hobbies"", and such, and try to talk about that. she'll probably feel less uneasy, and probably open up more in convos

try and tell like a story, whether it be something that happened a few weeks ago, or a few years ago, and relate it back to something, or just tell a funny story

rant. rant. rant. ranting brings everyone together, and ive gotten to closer to a lot of girls i talk to just from rants. if its cool w/ her, you can rant or she can rant and yall will both grow closer if shes had that same problem that youre ranting about etc.

the ultimate goal is to try and draw common interests between the both of u"
18425,"Hmmm there's not really one singular magic advice.
(TLDR: Some advice about how there's no single answer and to try and be assertive and address the issue with her in a polite way even though this may end in failure.)

As you can see in the comments many people say, maybe talk about yourself as well cause it might encourage her to share stuff or give it a more natural vibe and make it feel less like an interview. But there's also people who'll see that as you being self-absorbed, so there's not really a right answer. I'm gonna be honest we can't help you. There's so many reasons why you feel as if she isn't showing much initiative. She could be a bad texter, you could be a bad texter and it's just not engaging, she has no interest in you, she's incredibly shy and doesn't feel super comfortable yet, ... Those are just a couple off the top of my head, and all these situations would require a different approach. 

I'd say honestly the best thing to do is try having an honest conversation with her or trying to have one at least, and trying to understand why you two appear to be stuck in this interviewing vibe. Now I won't lie, addressing it might make it worse, she might just read it and get annoyed and not talk anymore. So if you address it directly i have some tips: 

-Don't be an ass about it, if she shy or something this will destroy her insecurities. 

-Don't act as if it's solely her fault or only lay the blame on her, this will only make her become defensive because you're blaming her.

-Be polite, but also be stern. Don't become sub-assertive because that will only encourage passive agressiveness in the long run. What i mean with this is, think about what you want to convey and think about how she would interpret that and try to find a middle ground where you conveyed your message in such a way where you won't hurt the other party. 

-Be yourself, even if it means you won't end up together. A relationship on a foundation of lies is never bound to end well.

On that note sorry for the long text i wish you good luck with your endeavors and if possible keep us updated on how it goes if you want."
18426,"It's not that hard man. Here are direct quotes from *Simplelation; Jason; 16:31*

\- Just be yourself. Talk about your day or some other shit that's going on around you or world events.

\- Don't reply with 1 word answers often.  Replying with lol or yeah is okay to say a couple times. If you say if very often in a convo like they say something and you reply with lol, ok, yeah, or some shit like that, they're gonna get bored mad quick and leave your ass on read. 

\- Be interesting: When they tell you something, you could elaborate on what they're saying like if they say something like my dad died of covid don't reply with lol or ok because that shit ass. Instead reply with something like my apologies. When did he catch covid? or some shit. 

\- Don't be an asshole. People get tired of one's bullshit mad quick.

\- Don't be a horny fuck. Girls don't like that. And if you actually wanna fuck, calm the fuck down. You'll get more chances when you get to know them and you become close with them. **If they say no, the answer is no. Don't insist.** I say this because there are a shit ton of dudes that don't know how to control themselves."

18432,"I just got into a relationship so I think i can give good advice. Unless she’s a bad texter you can’t force it, there has to be a decent amount of effort on her part. If she had feelings for you before that is not great, as thats happened to me where the girl I liked also liked me, but I only found out after she had stopped liking me. Tbh, your best option is to try and hangout once, see what the vibe is, or to try and move on"
18433,"I guess the most important thing is that you don't force the people involved in the convo.

18450,"Nah, cause im probably a bad candidate given how weak I am..."
18451,Yeah. Either I'm richer or die. So win-win?
18452,Obviously. I need to fuel my addiction to monster somehow
18453,"If I have a disease that's incurable, hell yeah"
18454,"YES, sound fucking fun :D"
18455,Yes cause it could help people
18456,Depends on what it's for but probably not.

18458,No health is more important
18459,"Maybe, not to be depressing but if I die I wouldn’t be missing much"
18460,"Sure, science and money in one"
18461,"Depends What it is ""here, now we are gonna replace ur heart with This pump"""
18462,nope. money isn't worth risking my life or health
18463,"depends on what. in most cases, yes for money."
18464,"Nope, I’m not ready to die get."
18465,But I'm not a guy you numpty
18466,5'7 I'm ight
18467,"172, but i've still got room to grow 

I look at myself and look tall some times, other times i'll see myself as hella short and wondering where my parents' tall went"
18468,"I'm only a few cm taller, feel you"
18469,Bruh
18470,"5’5

so i’m short"
18471,"6’2/188cm, I consider myself short."
18472,"HOW is it the perfect height, I look like a pitbull lol"
18473,HOW ARE YOU SO TALL ROEJSJWJENA IM ONLY 168 😢😢
18474,if you were a guy you'd be short though
18475,"Wow, looking at all these comments made me realise how short i am"
18476,5'8 I guess I'm average
18477,You are taller than Kevin Hart
18478,Haha shorty
18479,"First time I've been called a numpty, props to you for originality"
18480,"5'4/163, pretty short :)"
18481,"Me reading the comments and seeing people with a height of 5'5 calling themselves short when im just 5'2 and was kinda proud to be this tall 
 👁️👄👁️"
18482,"5'4"" is the perfect height"
18483,Stop bullying me 😔😔
18484,168? I’m 160
18485,"175, kinda short"
18486,"I'm 5'9"", once i was leaving art class, and a group of girls, all of them 5'4"" walked in front of me, and before I could stop i walked into one and broke my tooth. Perfect to do that. But also, you're not short but you're not tall, you can walk under a tree without leaves in your face, but if it's raining you won't disappear in a large puddle. You can reach most top shelves on your tiptoes but dont need to bend down to reach lower ones. ITS PERFECT"
18487,152cm/5’0 so I’m short
18488,Can you like please donate a few cms to me 👉👈

18495,That’s so sweet tyyy 🥺💙
18496,Missed you too uncultured degenerate ✨💙
18497,"I feel that way too. Also constantly feel like no one actually likes me and people only talk to me because they feel like they're obligated to or something. And in most cases, it doesn't even have to do with them treating me badly, I just let my insecurities make me feel like I'm worthless and that no one in the right mind would ever actually like me... It hurts like fuck and I wish it could stop"
18498,No problem!!! ❤️
18499,Constantly 🙃
18500,"Oh wow, that's how I am remembered by a filthy gorsflimging milk hater

(Don't search that word, is made up)"
18501,a little bit. i havent forgotten about you at all though
18502,People never knew me so they can forget me
18503,aw that feeling sucks fr 😖😖 i promise no one is gonna forget about you bb
18504,Kind of. Although I remember you as the milk-hating warlord of the deepest darkest hells.
18505,"I wish people would forget about me irl. I understand how it would hurt to be forgotten, but in my case, I only feel bad that people know me. It hurts to know eventually they’ll grow tired of me, so I hope for a day where I’m a stranger that they slightly know. I’m really sorry that you feel like that. I’m sure that there are people who value you"
18506,Yeah. It hurts
18507,yeah :(
18508,YUP IRL FOR SURE which is why i like interacting online more than irl
18509,Yes I am uneducated. Uneducated on Disgusting Demonic beliefs that is.
18510,aw thanks mate :3
18511,No class in demonism. I am an 😇. ❤️
18512,"Yes, my only friend has made a bunch of new friends and a boyfriend and now she basically acts like i don’t exist..."
18513,"That’s one of the nicest things anyone’s said about me thank you, you uneducated heathen 🥺💙"
18514,I won't forget you :)
18515,"Nah love, you just have no class 💙"
18516,you're welcome 😊
18517,"Nah, I dont care and would prefer if people forgot about me from the past, I wasn't that good of a person and Im trans now"
18518,I don't have friends irl and no one online remembered me to begin with so no.
18519,"i’d never forget you you’re super epic💙✨ 

i feel like that too tho!!"
18520,"yeaaa, but to be honest, I don't really care about things such as this, cause I know for a fact that this fake validation will last for only so long and you can't do anything about it, so... enjoy while you can"
18521,Yes. Always.
18522,"No. I am absolutely positive that anyone who has known me for at least 5 minutes has a permanent memory of me with them.

Even people from places I moved away from 5 years ago remember me. I only knew them for 5 months and very recently they contacted me for the first time to see what changed.

I guess that my personality is just that abnormal"
18523,"No not really, if I actually want to be social and make myself known, I can do it. Most people can't forget about me, some guy who I knew from a friend I played GTA with remembered me after over 1 year of me not talking to him. 


It's hard for me to forget about people if I interacted with them so I remember a lot of usernames if I see them but I can't remember their full username because I remember them by a short recognizable part."
18524,Yep! Got Athazagoraphobia
18525,Oh for me it depends on how close I am with them if they are family idk if I'll ever be able to get over it if it's one of my guy friends ill just be excited to see others reaction lol
18526,"I think it depends on how close the person and I are. While moving on from someone can be really tough, it's a very important and necessary step to detach and focus on other things."
18527,Its always sad when someone dies I personally wouldn't wanna move on from it
18528,"Yeah, makes sense. To me, it's just something that will come at some point for everyone and it means peace for some, so idk, never saw it as a big deal to grieve over but to be happy for that person's peace yk"
18529,Yeah that's nice
18530,"I think it depends on how close I was to the person. I'm not gonna loose my mind over someone I barely knew dying, but if a family member or a close friend suddenly died, I wouldn't handle it well to say the least. I'd have a very hard time coping with their death and getting over it"
18531,Yeah that's true
18532,"If its someone close to me, I try to deny and move on, as a coping method. I take it seriously."
18533,I personally don8care about it much. But I get why that might hit some people hard
18534,"My mum died 9 months ago and the biggest difference between now and then is that I gotta live with my dad.
But overall everything is kinda the same,
One day you just see them for the last time and that’s the end of it."
18535,If someone close to me dies I'll just kill myself that's how bad I am with coping with stuff
18536,"Very 

I’m terrified by someone close to me dying. Or even someone like a teacher or a classmate that I’m not close with, it’s just so weird that one moment they’re there and within a second they’re not anymore ):"
18537,Me too
18538,"Depends everyone has different connections and different ways to grieve. If my teacher died it would be less impactful to me than if my parents or sister died. I wouldn't beat myself up for my entire life, but of course one should generally expect sadness when someone they love dies"
18539,"I make jokes to myself, none else like them"
18540,Right? The fact that people are just alive one moment and then aren't anymore is so weird. And the fact that that will one day be you is even weirder.
18541,What does that have to do with death?
18542,I'm gonna honest that's just fucking insensitive some people value their family too much to move on in just a day or something
18543,"depends on how close they are to me and how well I remember them for family and friends. for strangers, I care a lot more than the average human I'd guess"
18544,I’m dead serious
18545,I take it very seriously. Death is sad and tragic
18546,This dude gets it.
18547,That's very deep
18548,Thats sounds like mocking people who Greive
18549,I don't take death very seriously (probably because none close to me has died) so I make jokes to myself
18550,Oh
18551,Yes very true

After those 14 hours, testosterone returns to normal.

So a general rule of thumb, one orgasm per day

Edit: I'm talking one orgasm per day as in general rule because with one orgasm per day you'll get good orgasms. If you do it multiple times a day the orgasms won't be that intense

Edit 2: it isn't testosterone levels that drop, its the nitrous oxide levels that increase in the bloodstream and then for a certain period of time the person is unable to get an erection"

18680,So some do? Or all but u don’t use urs

18727,"The last time that happened to me was 2nd grade. I got sent to the office because I went into a stall with a friend so we could secretly trade pokemon on our DS. Someone snitched and told the teacher I pulled a girl into a stall. Rachel if you're reading this, you still a hoe for that"

18738,A couple weeks ago my Spanish teacher really freaked out and thought I stole a Chromebook.... School Chomebooks don't work outside school property...

18741,That seems very unnecessary yeah
18742,Friday. I made a joke about shooting a cocket launcher at a kid. Someone overheard and reported me. I had to explain it to the principal. Saying I was going to shoot up the school would probably have been less uncomfortable

18752,"She how big my slong would be if I was a man

~~I imagine at least 9 inches~~"
18753,Someone here's asking the right questions
18754,Why does everyone want to fuck their alternate gender selves? I'd just be friends with them.
18755,Idk but that sounds weird
18756,Avoid him because there’s nothing more annoying than myself.
18757,A hole is a hole
18758,do I have a genderbent version if I have no gender?
18759,Ima go with masturbation unless you get pregnant. Then you’re just fucked.
18760,"I feel like that would be on relation to your boob size. Your flat, you have a micro dick"
18761,Because both me and female me are desperate as fuck
18762,i mean i think i’m kinda attractive so i’d want to have sex with a girl version of me
18763,"Shit now Im too curious. Lets say the average size we are using is American, ok? The average dick size here is 13 cm. If the average person wanted to see their genderbent cup size, lets use your hypthetical and say its proportional to the dick size.The issue comes in with the necesity of a proportion. A dick is not measured the same way a boob is. Its can be measured in cm for length, but boobs have cup sizes. The work around is to use a spectrum, rather than a mathmatical ratio. Middle of the pack in dick size, middle of the pack in boob size. So, using America again as our base (DD cup size average, 13cm dick size average), here is the spectrum: 3< A. 4-6 C. 7-9 D. 10-13 DD. 14-16 E. 17-18 F. 19-20 G. 21+ H.

All done on mobile btw, sry for spelling or formatting."

18771,"FINALLY! A FRIEND!

*cries while hugging each other in the corner*"
18772,Says the person selling kids for cocaine
18773,"Oh wow, I never thought that DD would be the average, I would've guessed smaller. 

My thought with my theory wasn't a mathematical ratio, it was more of a general preference ratio. With that everything under 

A-cup would possibly be <5 as it isn't really considered pleasurable and comparable to the general unactractivness of <A; 

DD comparable with 15-16 cm (or higher) as I heard it is pleasurable but not too big;

F (E and DD is the same) would be 17-20 as it's still nice but could be too big for some and 

G probably 25+ as it is too big for most people.



Now these are just some numbers I didn't think of too much due too me being tired. They are also based on my perception of the general likings of men and women so they may not even be the general preference, it's just an rough idea of what I had in mind.

Your proposition although seems more reasonable as it's more of a biological approach which makes more sense in this scenario.

Too any girls reading this, please don't feel bad about your boob size because of this, any size is fine and every guy will be happy about it.

Also, formatting on mobile isn't that hard, just throw in a paragraph for every new point and it's much easier to read and edit."
18774,I’d say masturbation cuz I’m doing it to myself
18775,"I'd just be hanging out with them then


and thank youu!🎂"
18776,Confuse everyone I know by having her do my activities for the day. Also probably practice kissing and cuddle if i ever get super lonely
18777,"talk first I'd presume, it would be weird af"
18778,"This is also not very realistic. I mean i get what you're trying to do but i have 2 main problems. One- the paragraph about small boobs (they're great, and not only size matters). 2nd- there are statistically more females with G cup boobs then males with 25+ cm dicks."
18779,Stay away from each other. I don't know how people are saying smash to themselves.
18780,Smash like I'm playing Smash Bros
18781,I think in this case it would be opposite sex but same gender
18782,100% agreed! Thanks for the input.
18783,"(I'm assuming I can reply since this is a mod post, please remove this if I'm wrong) I'd fully support that!"
18784,"I really agree. I don't think this place is for people to point fingers at each other. I think this type of post is toxic and is really far from the real intent of the sub.

Also, for those who are targeted by these answers, how does it make them feel? They could feel left apart or hated, wich I think is unacceptable."
18785,I don’t like it
18786,Add it. They're pointless and toxic
18787,"Yep anybody can reply, thanks for the input!"
18788,"Agreed. I don't want unnecessary drama being started + I want everyone to have a good time here and feel apart of the community, these posts discourage both of those things imo."
18789,Definitely should be added. The last thing this sub should be used for is bashing another user
18790,Yes this is my reasoning as well if we could all just not get worked up over a subreddit where none of us probably know each other in real life
18791,Those are only good for memes and no one ever memes them correctly. I also don't think it's serious enough of an issue to have a rule tho but it is really unnecessary.
18792,Doesn't matter to me. Though I'd love to be tagged in one of those lmao
18793,"I agreed with it too. I remember we had a quick chat about this on the discord. I don't see how saying who users dislike other users makes for a better community, personally. 

Also, if I were the one everyone hated(i hope i'm not, lol), i'd feel like shit."
18794,"Yeah, among other people."
18795,"Seems like a good rule, but when has there ever been negative posts about individual people? I don’t think I’ve ever seen one."
18796,Sounds good
18797,"Ahh I'm not really on the discord, you likely talked to Games about it? Agreed though, I don't want any users feeling that way."
18798,Yeah those are stupid as fuck
18799,Yes please
18800,I haven’t noticed a problem but if it is a problem I am not opposed to this rule
18801,Happy cake day!!
18802,Gotta agree
18803,"> I want everyone to have a good time here and feel apart of the community

This is the kind of mindset I appreciate"
18804,Excellent idea
18805,">""Who do you dislike the most on this sub?""

This looks like witchhunting with extra steps..

I haven't seen any posts like that (thankfully).

But yeah.. ban it"
18806,sounds good to me.
18807,"Surprised this isn't already a rule, however I think there should be an exception for warning other users about pedos and creeps on the sub by making a post about them."
18808,"Yea ppl on here can be rlly toxic??? like one time I made a post an someone just randmly said that ""the way you type is like how a drunk valley girl sounds"" or smth like that an when I told them that's kinda a toxic thing 2 say they jus started acting rlly toxic for lttrly No reason"
18809,"I dont really care that much since ive never seen a post like that, but if i had to vote, then sure, add that rule"

So she pronounces my first and last name wrong in front of the class and ofc ppl laugh bc we’re all close in that class(there was like 10 ppl), so she’s like “what’s so funny” and I said “oh that’s not how my name is pronounced and I explain how to pronounce it” (I did it nicely) and she says “that’s not what it says on my list” like excuse me lmaoo, I didn’t know the class list explains how to pronounce everyone’s names"

18852,"I think it was at some point, but yeah, unless that person lived in the 19th century they're dumb"
18853,"that it's pronounced ""lip sing"" and not ""lip sync"" (Grade 6)
same 2 kids also argued with me that the verb ""to ice"" (like with a cake) is ""icining"" and not ""icing"". 

With 2 against 1 I already knew I lost. But me being the petty-ass child I was, I wanted to not only win the arguement, but to utterly DESTROY the 2 kids. So I plopped a dictionary on their desk and told them that if they could find it I'd buy em both 2 chocolate milks each. (At my school chocolate milks were like $1, so that would be $4 I'd be losing if I lost) but me, being super duper confident at the time, made the deal because I already knew I was right. 

The 2 kids flip through the dictionary and couldn't find it (obviously) and went to another dictionary. When they couldn't find it there, they deadass went up to me and had the audacity to tell me that the dictionaries wouldn't contain those types of verbs. (WHAT THR SHIT?)  They actually asked me to pay up. 

While they were being so goddamn hell-bent looking for the word ""icining"" they somehow skipped the word ""icing"" which shoulda been like next to it had the word ""icining"" existed. But I guess they thought ""icing"" was just a noun so they skipped past it. After they still disagreed they looked it up online to which they THEN claimed that American English Is different from Canadian English (Canada being where I reside) and still expected me to pay up. I was like fuck it and we asked the English teacher. 

The sheer shocked and smirk that fell off their faces was worth way more than the 4 choclate milks I got that day.

18989,lol this arrived in my inbox and it took me a moment to realise what it was.
18990,you called?
18991,"no, but it just indicates that i don’t give a fuck

or i’m rushed/mistyped"
18992,"Bro it’s called depersonalization/ derealization. I’m not too sure on the difference between the two terms but it’s one if not both of those. I’ve had it since I was young and it used to make me panic, now I handle it much better. I think maybe it started when I was 10"
18993,"So if I'm not actually me, but looking through my eyes? Idk how to comprehend not being me."
18994,"Nah. Depersonalization is when you don't feel real or connected to your body, like op was talking about. Derealization is when you don't feel like your surroundings are real, for example you may feel like you're in a simulation or dreaming."
18995,"Not what the question is about, though."
18996,No
18997,[deleted]
18998,I'm just an empty sack of cells at this point.
18999,"Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that depersonalization is when you don't feel like a person, and derealization is when you feel like you are just not real/dead but imagining your life/made up/a character. I'm pretty sure they are both forms of dissociation, which has been mentioned in this comment section before."
19000,Idc lmfao
19001,"Yeah, basically, i think."
19002,"Sometimes I feel like I'm on autopilot, I walk somewhere and I don't know why I was there.

I think that's similar to what you're saying."

19004,All the time. Like you're life is a movie and you're sitting in a dark room inside your head watching my life through a screen
19005,"Sorry but I gotta ask

https://youtu.be/ZT2z0nrsQ8o



How does this make you feel? 😳"
19006,Oh ok thanks for clarifying!
19007,Hmm. Never really thought about it. I know my mind exists but everything else is impossible to know.
19008,"This is how I no longer am socially anxious

I feel like I am playing a videogame and my life is the game. Everything I say is just a choice and the way the world acts is very interesting.

My life's a game"
19009,I haven't. If you have the resources I would recommend speaking to a mental health professional.
19010,"yeah, the type that OP is describing"
19011,"Yeah, but how do you know that your mind is your mind and not just a mind that you're observing?"
19012,"It's the old ""I think therefore I am"" saying. You can think and so you know your mind is real. But you can't prove others' minds exist. If I am observing it then it would be very similar to not existing, as I can only think from my perspective and I cannot think as if I am seeing my mind."
19013,"yeah dude that can be a sign of mental illness such as like anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, etc. you should talk to ur doctor"
19014,"this sounds very much like dissociation, it’s not something i currently experience but i had episodes like this in the past- would recommend doing some googling on dissociation/depersonalization, might be helpful."
19015,"that happened to me when i was little things would look like they were zooming in and out at the same time and i’d walk around the entire house in the dark at 12am but i didn’t feel like i was me, i was just in a body walking around at top speed"
19016,"I just had this thought earlier, you are the protagonist of your own life but in the grand scheme of things you are a background character"
19017,"But what is this ""Grand Scheme""?  Does it have a plot? An ending , and most importantly does it really exists? Or we humans just made it up, to sound Philosophical?"
19018,"First one I think is right, second one, derealization is feeling like things aren’t real. That happens to me often, and it doesn’t always feel like I’m in a video game but like that things just don’t feel real and everything feels fuzzy. 

> Depersonalization is specifically a sense of detachment from oneself and one's identity. Derealization is when things or people around seem unreal.

That's it. That's my sense of humor. Maybe i could make another example of it.

Three guys met a golden fish. She said she can make them 3 wishes to each of them but just 1 wish each year. So, the first year one guy wished a big house. Another wished loads of money. The third guy wished to make his hand shaking nonstop. Another year, first guy wished loads of money, another guy wished a yacht. The last one wished to make his another hand shaking like the other hand. The third year, first guy wished his own plane, another guy wished the fastest car in the world and the last one wished to make his head shaking. After a year, the first two of them met and was talking about how great lives they have now and how it's amazing and everything, than the third guy came and said: ""Guys, I fucked it up."""

We kissed for the first time, cuddled in the cold (at the time I was hiding him from my mum as he lives 2hrs away and was worried abt her reaction which ended up being very extreme ouch) and he looked after me with such love. He bought us matching llama teddies which we named similarly.

However, that was when we were dating for 3 months. It's been a year now and whoa everything's different, so much more comfortable, we're wild with each other, not afraid to argue because we trust each other to not leave one another for something stupid.

Every relationship has its ups and downs, but that first time meeting up/date (to me) is something to be treasured!"

19084,Damn thats nice.

When I was in 6th grade, this girl I didn't even know, didn't have classes with, and had never even seen before came up to me and told me she liked me, and asked me if I liked her. I had never been in this situation before, and didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I said,""yyYyeEEeeEesSSs????"" In hopes that she would be like,""oh, you don't really like me"" or something, but no.she hugs me, asks me to go to the auditorium for movies during this free time we had during school, and I say ""yyYYyeeEEeEeEsssSS?"" And I show up the next day. I can't find her anywhere, but 6th grade me was also not very committed to anything. I leave and go to another class. I technically haven't broken up with her yet, so that's a nearly 6 year relationship."

19104,We drove 30 minutes to an antique store in the middle of nowhere and spent 3 hours looking at old clothes and yearbooks and cool old shit
19105,"My date with my current boyfriend, definitely. Though I'd never been on a proper date before this date anyway.

&#x200B;

Before we started dating I asked him to go hiking. He had just gotten his license on the same day. It wasn't technically a date, just a hangout, but we both liked each other by this point. He didn't really know where my house was so he kept passing it on accident, it took him over 30-40 minutes to get to my house when it should've been 10-15 minute drive. We both learned we were horrible with directions so we kept having to turn around and figure out where we were going. The hike was really fun, just talking and hanging out. It was a bit muddy, though.

Then we went to Culver's to eat. He eventually went to order the lemon ice and they gave him two spoons. We both think everyone thought we were dating at this point. We both shared the lemon ice. 

&#x200B;

It wasn't until our second date that I asked him out, though. We also went hiking for that one. After hiking we went to Culver's again, and right when we were ready to start leaving I asked him. When we went to his car he realized he locked his keys in his car, so his mom had to come drive over to give him the spare keys. It was really nice to spend the time waiting for his mom then the drive home talking about our feelings. We kind of consider this our first date since it's the first time we both knew for sure we liked each other."
19106,I mean it's kind of a trope that lesbians move really fast so don't worry.

19118,"If it’s unsafe for you to handle alone (like if he has a gun or knife on him), get help and call the police. Otherwise you should: 

1. Verbally confront him

2. At least try to get between them

3. Act like you know her and get her out of the situation 

BE SURE YOU RECORD THE INCIDENT. IT CAN BE USED AS EVIDENCE IF THINGS ESCALATE"
19119,"If you feel comfortable hitting, go for it, but at least try and get the girl away"
19120,This guy is fucking awesome thanks for sharing this video with us man really appreciate it
19121,"I'd say just intervene verbally, and get here outta there. No need to put both of you at risk by starting a fight."
19122,"This is just stupid, it escalates the situation to an unnecessary level and could end up in likely more repercussions for you than the predator"
19123,"Ok in order to explain this i have to tell a story

So my and my family are at a quarry and there is quite a bit of people there and one homeless guy comes around there often and was just having out went to a group and they were talking and then it came up that they all had guns done stuff. So the guy runs to the ramp and  starts to make a crowd to draw them away it work beacuse they did not want the attention. 

Morel is if something like that happens pull your friend away to a crowd and start making a scene to light attention on him. He will then walk away denying what happened but since everyone is focused on you they will believe you so they will rat him out. Don’t touch him tho beacuse if you do he is going to make a clam that you attack him by showing the wounds of it. All in all make a scene draw attention rat him out"
19124,Help her
19125,y do u h8 Ron weasly 😔
19126,"act like you know her and get her out if the situation. assaulters can get violent so its best not to escalate the situation for everyones safety. try to remember the time, place, and as much info on the assaulter as possible in case its needed later"
19127,"do not beat them up. idk what makes so many people think thats the right thing to do. at this point, its the girl thats important. priority isnt to hurt the asshole, its to help the girl. beating him up isnt helping her. at all. and would probably land the both of you in jail. especially since we've an absolutely amazing legal system."
19128,"If you a bigger dude, knock the fucker out. That's what I'd do."
19129,"Well the logical thing would prob be to discretely get video proof that he did it, and then deck him in the fucking face right?"
19130,"Pretend you know her and ask if she's ready to leave/go somewhere else. She can leave with you safely. 

Don't try to fight the guy, especially if he's bigger than you. I know it's tempting and he deserves it, and I love and appreciate all you guys for wanting to protect and defend your friends and girlfriends and everyone, but you can't help people if you've been beaten to a pulp. No shame in that.

If the guy won't back off and things start to escalate, record him with your phone. If he tries to hurt any of you, you have evidence."

19135,get her out of the situation as quickly and smoothly as possible even just talking to a girl like you know her will stop the creeps don’t risk a confrontation that could go ugly
19136,Act like you’re friends with her

fallback: pornstar

tbh tho, i dont think i could relate to some1 who's 100% sure about what they wanna do, picking a career scares the shit outta me"

Maybe the course duration might differ idk??? At what age do y'all graduate tho?(like when y'all are all set for a adult-typishh job?)"
19178,"that really depends on what you do . here you start highschool at age 12 and graduate when you are like 16-17-18 ,that depends on what level you do . and then college can last 2-4 years depending on what level you do .  and since i am underaged and graduated at 16 i was forced to follow some form of education . my grades werent good enough to follow the higher level in highschool so i had to go to college ( not that i wanted to , i tried to ask for a gapyear but it was declined). with the education im following now i would graduate college when im 19. feel free to ask more questions"

It’s funny tho because my dream is to make enough for my partner to stay at home or work part-time, like my parents."
19198,"well, I can certainly speak for technology related professons: That's not going to make much of a difference.

Job Interviewers just care about what you know, and what you can do. If your profession revolves around making/maintaining stuff, as long as you can do that, you're fine.

You might have small issues with terrible startups, but companies have a strong incentive to accept you based on merit alone.

Furthermore, technology is one of the most diverse fields I know. Race and gender seemingly don't matter, and in certian groups, straight white dudes are the minority. I already have a bunch of trans friends just because of working in that field.

I'm sure this applies to a lot more production environments, but I've never worked with them, so idk.

Edit: This should apply to almost all of the midwest, north, and coasts. If you're in the deep south, I can not speak to that."
19199,"Man, did you see me specify my 1st career choiceee?? My career choice is *still* soul purchasing and doing internship under satan himself is good enough for meeeee 👀

But.....if that doesn't work then definitelyyyy *pornstar purchaser!!!*"
19200,God!! India is soo much chiller than this!! That would be a nightmare!!
19201,"I'm pursuing animation and digital art right now, but since I haven't developed enough experience in the field, there's always the chance that it's just not the right thing for me. But if it isn't, that's not the end of the world. There's still all kinds of other careers that I could try out to see what really calls out to me.

You're only 16. Most people only find out what they really want to do much later than that, like when they're adults. Don't stress if you think the field that you've wanted to be in just isn't the right fit for you. You'll have plenty of time. But don't give up on it because you think you aren't smart enough haha because you *can* be. If you work hard toward it, then no one can stop you, not even yourself 👍🏻

Holy crap I didn't realize I just wrote a mini-essay XD sorry about that"

19205,I pinned him against the wall
19206,Wait so how’d you say it
19207,Could’ve been a bit more straightforward I would say
19208,Just didn’t seem to pick it up
19209,Damn should’ve made the move
19210,"Okay so we were talking about how it was hot when someone pins you against the wall, then he started to get flustered so I pinned him against the wall. Surprised he didn't get it"
19211,"For my middle school crush: sent him a vague “send this to your crush w/o context” post. Also made a self-insert fictional story where we clearly had romantic chemistry. Embarrassing, I know. We do be good friends now tho.

For my current boyfriend: Sat on his lap because “there were no other seats,” even though I could’ve gotten one. Embarrassing, I know. It worked tho."
19212,It was cute at the time
19213,"Him: Who do you like?

Me: Someone on our discord (5 people including me)

-*he goes through the other 3 guys*- 

Him: Wait I don’t get it. You said no to everyone

Me: (ｰ ｰ;)

Him: *ohhhhhh*"
19214,"i don't really give hints but i went out one time with this guy and after i was like, ""we should do that again some time"" LMAO thats p much it 😳"
19215,Probably wouldnt   with me. Im stupid as fuck
19216,Wtf
19217,"I used to (and still do) hug him, compliment him, flirt (just a little), and send memes about crushes, liking someone, sending signals, giving hints, and cute relationship stuff. He would send some as well and once referenced one in a really obvious way so that there was no way I could have ever missed that hint. A few days later, when I went to visit him at his workplace (and, let's be honest, get a hug from him), we were talking like we normally do, then he told me he wanted to ask me something but didn't want to be weird about it. 

”Do you like me?”

”Uh, yeah, it's kinda obvious.”

He didn't tell me how he felt right then. He just told me he would be back, and then walked off to the bathroom, I guess. He came back as I had to leave (my dad wanted to leave once he found me, and it's not like I could just keep him there), and he looked at me, smiled an award-winning smile with those adorable dimples of his, and said, ”See ya later!”

About 30 minutes after I had left the store, he texted me saying he forgot to tell me he felt the same. I already knew it, but it was great to have him tell me directly. 


Sorry this ended up being super sidetracked. ADHD brain. Plus I just love telling the story of how we both confirmed our suspicions of our feelings for each other."
19218,Kinda can’t believe sitting on someone’s lap worked
19219,Is there a story behind this cause it’s really weird out of context
19220,I wouldn’t either tbh
19221,i told him “i have a crush on u” we’ve been dating for almost 10 months:)
19222,You know what I don’t blame him
19223,"I wouldn't know how that feels. I always thought girls were super non outgoing, but now I think maybe I'm just ugly."
19224,Asked him to date me
19225,"Indeed... Should've proposed on the spot, none of that girlfriend boyfriend BS"
19226,Be looking like https://images.app.goo.gl/zeSEuFBUhRHLKUAMA
19227,I was going to tell the girl I liked that I liked her but I got stopped by something
19228,"Yeah ikr. I’m not even hot, but somehow, it worked. I mean, if a girl who isn’t objectively unattractive sat on you, how would you react?"
19229,"Probably be very shocked because I’m the type of person who wants contact but hates it, then I’d probably ask why they did that and be completely oblivious"

19304,Yea oops 😳
19305,It’s torture tbh
19306,"i think i have never

but i also think that teenagers mostly have and envious heart or admiration thing going on, so it's not really a crush as they actually look up to the person instead of actually liking them. but most of the time they're too young to realize that.

with that said, these things do happen, but when you grow older into your adulthood, it would seem silly in retrospect and fortunately, i came to realize that all of my past crushes weren't really emotional affection, but more of an admiration for them and wanting to be validated by them.

but ye i have never"

It's not that we're ignoring the fact some guys do it on purpose, but just going off of the premise that it isn't intentional in the first place."

A few tips against itching:

-Don't shave against the pattern, shave within the direction that the hairs are pointing

-Use shaving cream (Watch out that it doesn't get inside your urethra or vagina, if it still does, wash it immediately)

-Do not use one use blades more than once (They will rip you hairs instead of cutting them)

-Do it after taking a hot shower (It prevents cuts and eases the shaving process)

-Wash yourselves down there before and after shaving

-Wear something loose and breathable after shaving (or nothing if you go to bed afterwards) (No tight Jeans)

-Maybe use baby powder (yes, it works) or skin care on the shaved area to prevent itching and infections)"
19446,Laser hair removal

19448,Thanks for the tip
19449,I love this answer haha
19450,I love this man haha
19451,A lot of people say to use conditioner but I've heard it's not good? Or well maybe using that and shaving cream is better cause some people ditch cream all together.
19452,"Yep, it takes quite a bit of sessions but yeah"
19453,"I shave every two weeks, in between I trim and save like the more visible parts. After shaving I use aloe Vera which helps reduce the bumps."
19454,"Where I live, a brazilian for example is about $37.90 USD. So it’s not too much.

I’ve never had any laser done on my pubic hair, but I get it done above my lip & on my chin and it’s really good!!! It works best on light skin and dark hair, but dark skinned and dark haired girls can get it done too!! They just use a slightly different method I believe, and from my experience it doesn’t hurt much or anything. I don’t think it works on blond hair but idk.

It depends on where you’re getting done, but you may have to go for multiple appointments to make sure the hair will stop growing back. It doesn’t hurt that much either, some ppl say it feels like a rubber band snapping on your skin which is kinda accurate. It’s probably worse down there though"
19455,"I mean like, I gotta' be honest, even when I was around 15-16 I was aware that surely some girls in my age group at the time did things like laser hair removal, or actually went to a place to be professionally waxed.

But the whole thing is pretty foreign to me, like I can't imagine it's as common as it is, even for adult women. Just this whole, ""Yeah, I go to this place regularly and I open muh legs up and a stranger stares at my vadge and rips my pubes out, no big deal."" I can hardly wrap my head around it, especially for high schoolers.

I'd still think shaving has got to be the most common though."

19463,"I used to do most of these, not the baby powder tho lol. I won't be needing these anymore tho cause I don't shave"
19464,how much does that cost
19465,"Oh, I agree!! Honestly I’m not even sure if they allow it on underage girls lol, since I’ve never been interested in it. Most girls my age haven’t even been to the gynaecologist yet (me included) so I can’t imagine it ether.

Yeah I think shaving is pretty common, I hear more about shaving than laser hair removal so"

19470,Do you guys shave against the hairs or with it? Because going the same direction as the hairs really help reduce discomfort and ingrown hairs.
19471,"I shave twice a week but im Italian and my hair grows non stop. Make sure you're not doing it dry,  just using water isn't good enough. If you don't have shaving cream for sensitive skin then just use conditioner/plain soap. Try and use warm water to soften the skin and hair and then when you're done use cold water. If you can, exfoliate just after you shave and keep doing that a few times a week after you shave. Shave with the hair growth, not against it (I know it's not a completely clean shave but I have soft skin and thick hair and it stops most of the ingrown hairs and itchy-ness). Pat dry after shaving, DO NOT RUB WITH THE TOWEL. wear breathable underwear like cotton afterwards (or better yet don't wear any you can). I've been doing this for a while and these are all the things that make it much more bareable. Also, don't shave around your butt if you can, it's much more sensitive and a lot more dangerous if you cut/get an ingrown hair there.

Hope this helps! :>"
19472,"nahhh

who stole my boy automod 🥲"
19473,idk it sucks but I pretty much stopped using it more than a year ago and when I came back a few weeks ago it was fun for a few days and then I lost interest again lmao so I don't care. this sub is better and there's also r/feemagers and r/teenagersnew i just use them and it's more fun
19474,Teenagers is a dumb subreddit and I honestly don’t pay attention to the stuff that’s going on there
19475,Yeah I only joined in the beginning because I'm a teen but I hated every post I saw on That sub
19476,rip automod 😪😭
19477,Idc I stopped using that sub a long time ago
19478,"I think that society as a whole is going through somewhat of a male “identity crisis” and that as funny as it can be to laugh at that absurd mindset, we do need to acknowledge that most of these boys are victims themselves. Also, that sub is so repetitive and bad, im not even surprised"
19479,[deleted]
19480,"That was the first subreddit I joined, I didn’t like it, I found this one and I’ve enjoyed it"
19481,Sub has always been pretty bad imo
19482,"It’s not really an “absurd” mindset, more of a hateful and dangerous one. Lots of incels advocate for violence against women and there have been multiple incel school/mass shooters. I think incels need to be taking more seriously, in the sense that people need to realize that their ideology is dangerous and it shouldn’t just be seen as “teehee, look at those silly virgins!”"
19483,I stole em and yall not getting it back
19484,"Trans male to female, so I use she/her"
19485,a sub run by teenagers to me was weird
19486,Idk honestly I just scroll past those comments/posts and move on with my day
19487,you'd be surprised how many 11-12 year olds are on reddit haha
19488,the mods here arent making awful merch and using the money on who knows what
19489,"Honestly reddit generally is becoming an incel hole (ofc not all, there are some good subs) it sucks, but I just move on with my day"
19490,glad im not the only one who thinks so
19491,"God the photoshop on the hoodie advertisements were so bad as well, the hoodie string went under the text! The design was just... meh. Who wants to walk around wearing a hoodie that just said TEENAGERS"
19492,"i don’t know what’s going on there, i checked it out once and thought none of the memes and content were funny. this sub is way better and i like to avoid toxic subs bc it can hurt my mental health

edit: i just checked some of the posts there, that’s a big yikes. i hope they’ll educate themselves more in the future into adulthood and change their toxic views"
19493,👀👉👈
19494,Not cool dude
19495,i honestly could care less about that dumpster fire of a subreddit
19496,Aren't the mods here teenagers too?
19497,"You’re being downvoted for your attitude. You didn’t change your flair, you can’t expect iJailr to magically know that your MtF when your flair says that you’re male. Also like,, “you fucking cishets” and “shut up cishet” are unnecessarily rude. Calm down dude"
19498,"I think it’s pretty dumb that a lot of teenage boys are referring to themselves as incels, when on average, most teenagers haven’t had sex yet. They seem to have really unrealistic views of how much sex people are having, I wonder if they get that from porn or made up stories on the internet. Either way, it’s taught me that if I have kids, they’re not getting any internet access until they’re 13 and I’ll have a talk with them about extremist movements online."
19499,what does MTF mean?
19500,Wack
19501,Bigger subs tends to suck and attract all kinds of people. Really not suprised.
19502,"Thanks, that's super helpful!"
19503,Thanks for your advice :)
19504,I use overnight pads for that and yes it happens
19505,Oooohhhh. Okay that’s actually a good idea. I’ll try that out tonight.
19506,Lol I do too but like somehow sometimes it happens
19507,It's happened several times but not like Everytime
19508,Ya same. It’s so annoying tho. Like my sister and I share a bed and whenever it happens we discuss how someone has spilled ‘chocolate milk’ on the bed.
19509,Only blood stains though!
19510,"I know it’s super weird to ask your mom for that kind of stuff, but you should. I didn’t tell my mom when I got my first period and didn’t for like a year until she realized I was stealing *her* pads and tampons. She was high key pissed at me for not telling her because obviously every girl needs guidance when they first start using these products. My point is, she will understand. If she does your laundry she’s probably noticed the stains anyway. Doesn’t hurt to ask—*everyone* has at least one heavy flow day a cycle and some people have more than others."
19511,"Thank you so much, I’ve never heard about hydrogen peroxide getting out stains"
19512,On my Samsung I have a pre downloaded period tracker on samsung health
19513,Ah I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you again :)
19514,"I usually use pads, but yeah it's happened once or twice"
19515,[deleted]
19516,"Here's my little trick for avoiding night leakage: basically give yourself a reverse wedgie. It sounds uncomfortable, but it's really not bad and ultimately you're just ""sealing"" off the sides to avoid leakage. Works really well"
19517,"I know it’s super awkward as the teenager to talk about this stuff with your parents, but your mom has been having her period for decades, at least. Trust me when I say that she won’t even bat an eye. Having your period isn’t a shameful thing and tbh adult women talk about agonizing period days with our friends for moral support! But we mostly talk about normal stuff, just to be clear lol

Anyway if you don’t want to ask your mom, hydrogen peroxide gets blood stains out of *everything* and it’s way less awkward to ask for. There’s probably already some in your house with whatever first aid stuff you guys have.

Edit: also if you order overnight pads and she checks it, she’ll get the hint and just start ordering those for you."
19518,Do tampons work well? I'm afraid to use them because I don't want them to leak.
19519,"The only thing I’d add to this is instead of tampons, try menstrual cups. I’m personally afraid of something happening in my sleep and having a tampon in for way too long. They’re also good for the environment!"
19520,Cry
19521,Ahh all the time. I just put a pantyliner behind my regular pad and hope for the best
19522,I use over night pads and put a towel Down
19523,"Doesn't really happen for me, since my flow is never very heavy."
19524,"yeah, i hate it. usually i just sleep w 2 pairs of shorts on so that doesn’t happen lmao"
19525,I’ve always been scared of the cup! But tbh it didn’t exist until I was in my early 20s. I was super freaked out about toxic shock syndrome for at least a decade after my first period lol
19526,"Yes! Tampons are great. iIcyou’re worried about leakage, also wear a panty liner the first few cycles so you can kind of an idea of how often they should be changed."
19527,"Well I do my own laundry and wash my own bedsheets and stuff and when I run out I tell her but like it’s really awkward and I don’t rlly say it she just knows what I mean and then orders them to the house but Im not gonna just like...Idk ask for specific ones 

I don’t really care idk when I’m older I’ll get my own"
19528,"no, happens"
19529,I have never had this problem. Idk what to do in that situation
19530,It doesn't happen to me but it sure happens to a lot of people. I hope you find a good comfortable solution
19531,"Yeah, thankfully it happens rarely with me, and it's super fucking annoying. I can't roll around my bed peacefully after waking up when it happens and it pisses me off lmao"

19533,Valentine's is a not fun corporate fuelled holiday. There's nothing redeemable about it
19534,"i didn't care that much anyway but it was a nice day 

also see you in hot"
19535,"This is getting less than 30 upvotes

I'm callin it

Edit:Yeah yall can clown me"
19536,lmaoooo FRFR tho all i saw is valentines questions 😭🖐️ understandable tho
19537,cancel valentines day 🔫😐
19538,"thank you! also you'll find someone, I can tell just by you being on atg that you're a pretty chill person"
19539,its nice to see people happy
19540,"Wait, that's illegal"
19541,"lmao np and im not looking for anything rn lmao, im enjoying the single life 😽

 i just like to joke abt it lmaoo"
19542,"Because why not? And it’s also a fun day to mess around with your friends even if you don’t have a partner. 

You could say that about any day lol, why do you have to wait for Christmas, or your birthday just to give someone a gift? What is that person going to expect if you start buying them gifts on random days of the year? Are they going to expect to continue getting that many gifts? Probably. Even if, yes obviously you can give them a gift on a random ass day if you want to, but that doesn’t invalidate a holiday lmao"
19543,my valentine’s day was p nice honestly
19544,"Yeah obviously you should treat them the best everyday, but you’re missing the point obviously. It’s just nice to have a day like that to give hand made gifts to each other and stuff, and just enjoy it together."
19545,[removed]
19546,"Right, because this is reddit.. It’s always been like this, people are always sad and a lot of people have no friends, because those are the type of people that are on these subreddits. There’s also a lot of normal couples out there who casually enjoy valentine’s day. 

That’s not the point though, nobody disputing that you shouldn’t love your partner the most everyday. However it could be a day where you go out of you way to CREATE something for them. Because realistically you can’t create something special for them every single day.. It’s special having it once a year."
19547,"I don’t rlly get the hate for it tbh, like I’d rather be happy for the people who do like it than be bitter"
19548,🔫😐 then be happy for me real quick
19549,mayhe if you asked me out you wouldnt be spending your night on reddit🙄
19550,i didn't spend my night on reddit 😽

This post has already many comments and upvotes,it will blow up😔"
19555,yes very i aint got time for that shit💅🏾
19556,we busy busy 🙄🥱🥱
19557,Wish I could ngl it sucks ass and not in the good way
19558,"Valentine’s Day could also be a holiday for people to spend time with loved ones they don’t get to see often. For example, maybe there’s a guy who has a very time consuming job and can’t really afford to take days off. So he comes home to his family tired and not wanting to do anything. He could take Valentine’s Day off and do something to show his appreciation and love for his family."
19559," someone told me ""u somehow found a way to twitterfly the sub"" lmaoooo 😭🖐️"
19560,"i didn't care much about the questions but im fine with yesterday being over, it fucking sucked bruh 🤔"
19561,Ahhh valentines is just everyone rubbing it in on the single people that they have a partner smh my head
19562,My best friend is the “weird kid” but he’s perfectly normal. Sometimes he talks a lot and he stutters but some people treat him like absolute shit and I hate it.
19563,"We didn't had a ""weird kid""


But there was this boy who would exchange underwears from others boys bags and god knows what"
19564,there’s a group of them everyone calls them the “emos” and they screech up and down the hallway about how gay they are and how dream and george not found are the cutest ship ever. god help us all.
19565,Bruh wtf 💀
19566,Not rating other people is usually a thing you should learn early in life.
19567,"A teacher faked throwing away his pencil (like she opened the lid but thew it behind but it seemed like she just threw it away) bc he would mark the walls, desks and wtv during class, and he threw a whole desk at her way and started saying shit"
19568,Twitter manifested into a living being
19569,"She once showed her undies in class, she left the cubicle door open while she peed once, she ate food off classroom floor, she sings randomly in class, she once went around asking for a scissor and once she obtained a blunt scissors, sh went around rubbing the scissor on her wrist(it just rubbed off her dead skin), she lied about getting raped in the girl's c.r. (there are cctvs facing the bathroom entrance so if she WAS raped, it would be known), she thinks all the boys like her(she told me and a few people this), I think there's more but I just dont remember. 

But yeah, she was bullied bc she was weird asf, I used to bully her when I was a kid bc my ""friends"" influenced me to, I was a dumb ass kid. In grade 7, I asked her to forgive me and became her friend but then she copied my manners, way of speaking, always tried to go everywhere with me(she had an only friend that time but she kinda pushed her away bc she wanted to be my friend, I THINK it was bc I was more ""popular"" than her friend) and also, one time there was this secret note picking by our teacher(we would put stuffnwe wanted to say in small papers and put it in the smol class basket) she wrote ""Peter, I like you, do you like me too? -Lili"" THIS BIH WROTE THAT and I didnt even like the guy anymore wtf SHE'S the one that likes the guy."

19571,"u ArE 3/10 hAhA!



fucking idiots that type of people. Everyone is great in their own way."
19572,he has some pretty controversial opinions and usually speaks like the average redditor
19573,She ate lead.

19576,[deleted]
19577,"Aside from sexist/homophobic/racist jokes, he used to Naruto-run wherever he went and make weird (and sometimes sexual) noises during the lessons. Most of his 'jokes' were targeted at me, for some reason. Haven't seen the guy since middle school and I sincerely hope it stays that way."
19578,Honestly that could be me

That and the cheating. But mostly the cringe ships."

Heck i dont even rate apps on the play store after using them."
19585,Does your name happen to be Micah?
19586,"Left school last year but the ""weird"" kid was in my class for the last 3 years of school. He was obssessed with porn but really violent, sadistic porn and would show everyone it. He would put a belt really tight to his neck to leave marks and act like he tried to hang himself but failed (more than 3 times a year). And my school would have a tradition were before you write your last exams we have a dress up day so people would come as fairy's, princesses etc, he dressed as a school shooter (it was so fucking creepy). He would also get really attached to certain girls that showed him attention so me and my friends would feel sorry and talk to him for a bit but then he wouldn't leave you alone and just follow you around. i genuinely believe he was a psychopath. I remember one time aswell he did really well in an English essay so the teacher read it out and he kicked his cat at one part of it (he was writing about a depressed character which I believe was actually himself so I think he truly would kick his cat)."
19587,"First one has adhd and other things, makes me feel bad for him.

Another one is my ex friend who i fucking hate so much, so attention seeking, so rude, hes such a dick but he still wont get the hint that i hate him.

Oh and the last one just harrasses girls from time to time."
19588,"Tf, why would he kick her"
19589,Bruh how did he not get suspended after throwing chairs?
19590,He got suspended but for a few days
19591,At first i thought you were actually trying to rate me but yes you're absolutely right.

19595,"Ye, I don't celebrate christmas but even then, I'd always walk around at night and go places, looking at all the Christmas lights and how different stores had different things and then like the parade stuff too and just

can't rly do that this year, kinda sucks"
19596,I usually love Christmas but ya I just feel so out of it this year.
19597,How did you describe this so well? Ignoring the last part
19598,i felt it in like the summer but not anymore
19599,"Could have something to do with the fact that the weather is like the middle of June, and the days just blend into each other because of home office and quarantine."
19600,"Yeah, I haven't felt festive since I was twelve. The only reason to do Christmas, for me, is to see my older brother and to get free food from the Christmas dinner at my gran's house."
19601,"You know what, for some reason I kinda just started feeling it. Sure, the last 12 days may have not felt too Christmassy and such, but let's just make the next 12 days amazing and christmassy. Of course, that's not actually going to happen. Soon enough I'm gonna feel down and really unmotivated again, but let's just pretend like everything's alright until then, right?"
19602,"i dunno, i was so excited last year, now i don't even know what to ask for, is this what adulthood is?!"

19606,Honestly I feel more Christmas spirit this year than any other since I was like 7
19607,Haven't felt it since age 11.  Sucks
19608,Try to feel it harder then!
19609,That's nice
19610,Ya guess I’ll try it out.
19611,i never do tbh
19612,Christmas
19613,Wow never would i have thought that!
19614,I never feel it any year. It's honestly just stressful and expensive
19615,I'm super into Christmas it's my favorite holiday but my boyfriend hates it and I've been hanging out with him alot so I'm kind of losing my obsession with Christmas.
19616,Yes. I feel holidays less every year 😣
19617,"Aye nice tag

Edit: and username"
19618,"Oh, that sounds pretty nice. And the later part sounds not so nice."

19626,i used to ://
19627,I like ur pfp
19628,"Ohh kk, that makes sense"
19629,Nope. I believe the few people I consider friends only see me as an acquaintance rather than a friend.
19630,"nope, no best friends

i have different friends and i’m close with some of them but no best friend"
19631,Legit dadzoned “you’re like a father to me”
19632,"Dont feel bad, once I got dadzoned lmao"
19633,Yes aha 😌
19634,I dont know if I want to laugh or cry
19635,Daddyzoned or cringy dadzoned?
19636,Yep I know like 2 other people who consider be to be their best friend
19637,"Nope, there are like 5 to 6 of us close friends"
19638,"I’ve known a female friend of mine for around 5 years now.  We’ve always been labeled as “best friends” up until recently, where she flat out told me that she didn’t have time for me and then sort of brushed it off (still not talking to me very often and we rarely ever see each other.  The only time she ever messages me is when she has a question and expects an immediate response).  You could say she was demoted, although I think she still believes we’re just the “bestest of friends”.  Think again bitch.🖕 You’re not going to say (these were her exact words):  “gIRL I DON’T HAVE TIME TO TALK TO YOU” and then basically expect me to be ‘okay’ about this.  Fuck you bro.

Also my cousin who I’ve known all my life ditched me because she’s “too cool” for me now.  (We used to be best friends — that term wasn’t thrown around, but that’s how I felt about her).

But I do have one close friend that I love to pieces!🥰 Though I’m not sure that we’re best friends."
19639,No I have like 4 or 5 best friends
19640,I sure hope so. She was my first friend when I moved to this side of London over a decade ago and we’ve been friends since and we stick together at school and stuff so I think so.
19641,Yeah my neighbor. Always together lol
19642,No. I have got a few close friends but generally no one picks himself a number one friend out of this group
19643,"Nope, definitely not"
19644,Same my dude
19645,"I didn’t know whether to file adoption or stop bein friends, but they made the decision for me! So laugh for them putting me in the dadzone but cry because I made a mistake and should’ve used a condom, which in a literal sense i should’ve avoided the friendship lmao"
19646,No
19647,i have 5 who i consider my bestfriends and im pretty sure they consider me as one of their best friends aswell
19648,"Not really; I have two best friends, so none of us have a #1, but us three are best friends."
19649,"Idk, I’ve never asked if I’m his best friend."
19650,Idk maybe
19651,"I dunno my best friend has a lot of really close friends

I’m probably one of his best friends though"
19652,Right! It's fucking awesome. And if you can listen to music there's nothing to complain about at all. Guess i'm slightly privileged since i'm quite smart too but some people are just straight up not even trying to do it.
19653,"English for sure. I write, so that’s probably why, but also because anything can be the right answer depending on how you frame it, if that makes sense. I love open ended questions because there’s a near infinite way to answer them, and almost all English questions are open ended. That’s why I hate math, it’s so boring when everyone gets the same answer"
19654,"This year it was physics. I might hate physics but that class was a ton of fun and was taught really well. 

Normally I'd say art because I am good at it I think"
19655,"It's not that you're smart, its that you have good teachers in a recruit difficulty class"
19656,Me too! I love seeing all of the different perspectives and then proving everyone else wrong!
19657,"math math math

There’s a goddamn answer. You can have a different approach than me, but we can both get the same answer. It’s not wishy washy like English or history (sometimes.)"
19658,"Chemistry, it's the only class that makes me think and not wanna die"
19659,"Me too.
Arguing with people about government or history and proving them wrong is fun."
19660,"BC Calc, cause the teacher is amazing and the subject genuinely interests me. Another big reason is that my crush sits next to me."
19661,[deleted]
19662,His got a point the teacher makes a huge difference my teacher speaks broken English and you have to use all your energy to comprehend what she’s saying
19663,History because I like history and there’s no math
19664,I like Maths over English for this reason lol
19665,"English, Science, or Math. It depends on the teacher and how the material is taught along with what's currently being taught in the class. Those are just my top three :)"
19666,"Probably science (general) I like all the practical work done in lessons, the dissecting of plants and organs, being hooked up to equipment during lessons (I'm basically the lab rat of my biology class as I volunteer to use the equipment) the reaction of chemicals and burning of stuff over a Bunsen burner."
19667,Band cause it’s fun and one of the only things I’m good at
19668,"Math, more specifically Calculus and Differential Equations"
19669,But it’s a double edged sword that way because some teachers will be asses about it and INSIST that you do it in a specific way. It pissed me off because I learn ahead of my class in school so it’s like I have so go back and relearn it.
19670,"but it's downright repetitive. sure, figuring out how to do it on your own is fun, but doing the same. exact. questions. for an hour, well...it gets frustrating quickly."
19671,"Oh, of course, it's reddit, you can't mention you're smart without people doubting it.

Sure, i guess i may not be extremely smart compared to the people that go on to do higher education in math/physics, but i'm at least kinda smart."
19672,which is usually because the teacher is boring at teaching
19673,That’s the same way I feel about it. There’s a million ways to get to they answer.
19674,Bro that’s always a bonus when your crush sits next to you.
19675,Agriculture because the class is easy and the teacher understands the students and tries her best. I’m also lowkey friends with the teacher
19676,"Physics, it just makes sense to me"
19677,"Chemistry is fun, organic chemistry especially"
19678,History because I'm interested in it and arts because I like drawing and painting
19679,Chemistry and biology are things that are at least interesting and new.
19680,"Agreed. The first couple units of learning how to do limits (without l'hopital’s rule) and derivatives I found pretty boring, but once we got into applications it became one of my favorite classes."
19681,Happy cake day!

Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.

Section 2: Ball stretcher

Section 3: Parachute

Section 4: Humbler

Section 5: Testicle cuff

Section 1: In pornography

In addition to it’s occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (literally Ball kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.

Section 2: Ball stretcher

A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds.

Section 3: Parachute

A Parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and squeezing effects on the man’s testicles. Moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.

Section 4: Humbler

A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Section 5: Testicle cuff

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed. Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner. However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits: Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm."
19835,"You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as an insult by edgy twelve year olds. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sac religious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. We might as well never have formed the phantom thieves, because surely not any amount of rotten adults would be able to affect the world as negatively as you just did. The only reason I am not reporting you to the police as we speak is that I know for a fact that their weak, pathetic prisons will never be able to hold such an indescribable evil. No wonder your dad beat you when you were little, it turns out he was trying to guard the world from the colossal mistake he had created. Kamoshida had every right to break your leg, because he was only trying to immobilize the incredible failure that is you so that your terrible mistakes may not spread to innocent foreign countries all over the world. He has not succeeded though, because your indescribable failure was on such an incredibly ginormous scale, that not even the possible life forms at the edge of the universe could have been guarded from it. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. I may not be a human, but I will forever have more humanity than you, for you are truly a wretched, horrible, filthy, evil monster because of what you just did. No wonder society rejected you: you were eventually going to break it beyond recognition. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. The phantom thieves and the world would have been so much better of if you had never joined us. You say you want to help the world but then you destroy everything everyone has ever worked for to such an extreme extent immediately when you have the chance? You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. We could just have you replace Satanael, except even Satan is not that evil, and because of his high stats he at least lands a fucking attack! Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if there was a god, he would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror movies made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the viewer has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. In the future, YouTube videos will get demonetized for making a sound that even resembles your name, and social media posts will get flagged and taken down for daring to speak about a topic like you. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It’s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The nations of this world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world and the Milky Way, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you."

I'm not being superphobic or anything (I've even got a supersexual friend!), I just don't feel attracted to supersexuals. Online supersexual culture is too rapey for me. Not all supersexuals are bad ofc, but supersexual culture is out of hand. They seem to just think you can be a supersexual by saying you are. In the decades to come we will not look kindly upon those pushing supersexual ""treatments"" on kids who can't properly consent.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."
19842,HEWP!!!! My boyfwiend came in my boipussy whiwe I was boivuwating and made me boipwegnant. I don't want a boibowtion and I don't want to go thwough the pwocess of boibiwth what do I do?
19843,"my balls are so massive

i was diagnosed with tesitucularitis. It’s rare and affects about 0.1% of the population. It causes my balls to massively swell up.

I was diagnosed at 10. I didn’t affect me until about a few months after. My balls kept slipping out my underwear. Few months later it’s slipping through my shorts.

A year after, my balls reach the size of a baseball and are heavy. I had to quit my short lived sports career and focus 100% on keeping my balls in my pants.

At 12, I had to get homeschooled as my balls constantly got attention for my massive balls. My hairs started growing rapidly and my Pubic hairs became infested with crabs and lice. It welted up and at the beginning of 2020 I had to get surgery because of my massive football sized balls.

During quarantine they increased in size and weight like it was going through puberty. They went from football sized to bowling balls sized, to basketballs sized, to beach balls sized, then to Boulder sized in the span of 10 months. Each months it increased 10 pounds. Each day was torturous as I wake up in agony as my balls contracted into my gooch.

I’m 13 and I need a wheelbarrow to get around with my massive balls. I don’t know how long I can do this."

19856,"Okay, bub. Just stop. Stop. Listen and learn. I have had it with your bullshit and I don’t want to hear another word from such a moronic simpleton as you. You’re filth and I will treat you as such. I will fuck you. Do you understand, bucko? I will. When I say this I mean it in the most literal sense possible. I will fuck you not once, but thrice. I will fuck you hardly, I will fuck you softly, and I will fuck you upside down, left, right, and I will fuck you invert. Not only that, but I will physically grab you by your skinny tweenage necky wecky and drag you out into the street and **fuck you**. I’ll fuck you at your grandmother’s funeral, I’ll fuck you in the back of a 2002 Ford Taurus station wagon, white in color. I will fuck you in all the places you didn’t lose your virginity at, and guess what? That’s everywhere. I will fuck you in your nephew’s kitchen while his pet gold fish watches as I push your head into the fridge and you choke on mustard, your stupid dark mascara tears gleaming down your sobbing and pathetic crying face as I force myself into you. Not only will I be fucking you, but you will be getting fucked. By me. And you just wait - uh uh, boy - if I haven’t made this clear yet I will fuck you until you attain a rare form of pancreatic cancer and your spleen busts open."

19861,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

Man + man = giving/receiving anal penetration

Woman + woman = I’m not really sure. I wouldn’t count oral or fingering as losing virginity but I don’t know if I’d say a strap-on is necessary. I’m straight so I don’t really have much of an opinion on that I guess.

This is just my opinion on it."

19923,Oof yeah i think hating conflict is a big part of it for me
19924,Yep. I hate drama.
19925,"Nah, if I say I accept your apology I usually mean it"
19926,nope if someone wrongs me i usually don’t accept the apology unless i genuinely want to and not so i can please someone else
19927,Teach me this power
19928,I respect the fuck out of that
19929,Damn that’s manipulative asf I’m sorry u had to go through that
19930,No
19931,"Yeah, but just when my mom does it"
19932,Yeah...
19933,I either tell the truth or I accept the apology passive-aggressively so they know they’re on thin ice
19934,No.  If they’re in the wrong; screw them.  I won’t accept your apology unless I genuinely want to.
19935,"Depends on the person, if it’s a friend I’ll make fun of him and we’ll call it even otherwise fuck em"
19936,"Yeah. Now I feel like it's to late for me to go back and say ""you know what. Fuck your apology I hate you."" Because that would make me look attention seeking"
19937,i do that a lot
19938,"Yeah a lot of times 

I’ve had times where they tricked me into apologizing instead as well..."
19939,All the time. I just dont want any useless drama and wasting time over not apologizing is just stupid.
19940,I do it all the time as well I'm being good girl in school meanwhile inside I'm fukin dead
19941,"Minor screwed-ups : U good, try to do better next time.
Major screwed-ups: You're dead as hell boi.

Other than that I am very forgiving."
19942,Most of the times no. I know we are friking humans and we are dumb and clumsy. ╮(＾▽＾)╭
19943,"learn to put yourself before others, your living *your* life, not theirs, and you gotta focus on yourself before making other people happy :)"
19944,I try to make it clear I don’t forgive them completely like ‘hey look I understand but I don’t agree with your actions and can’t completely forgive you’ or something similar
19945,"Yeah, accepting an apology and forgiving are two different things. I think accepting a (proper and true) apology is a very good thing, it means that you are  mature enough to look past it and either start over, or let the person compensate over time. It’s kind of like «I dont forgive you YET».

This is only the right if the person is genuinely sorry, and if YOU actually want the person in your life. 

In the case of abusive and manipulative situations, you should always stand up for yourself."
19946,I usually do this when people apologize
19947,"good advice but speaking from experience I've heard that all the time and it never really kicked in until I actually had enough and said ""No"" to someone. So if you're wondering what to do, start from there. Just say ""No"" if you don't wanna do something."

19950,Yes. Every single time but I don’t feel bad about it. It’s more important or me to move on instead of just dwelling with the drama or situation. I’d rather not deal with things 99% of the time. “Apology accepted”

20035,"One of the most hated is Kaj van der Ree. He was an influencer, made very inappropriate videos in the beginning of his YT career. Then he got to TV and on radio. He has made multiple racist comments and has even (and that was a big thing) threatened to out a trans person (Nikkietutorials, also Dutch and one of the biggest make-up channels) and she decided to take matters into own hands. Then he turned out to have pressured girls (all of them were teens) into nudes, using his influencer status to pressure them. He made contact with them, it was really bad. Now he can’t get any work in the entertainment industry, and I’m very happy with that."
20036,People just got annoyed at him as he made unhealthy food pricier I think by stopping 2 for 1 deals on bad food or something along those lines. It makes sense to be honest to make healthier food cheaper and bad food more expensive. People were not happy though.

20061,"Guy here with a legitimate  life saving tip (my ma is a cosmetologist)

you’re going to make two face masks, ima call em mask-A and mask-B. 

Mask-A: 1 tablespoon of manuka honey + 1 teaspoon of fine salt (you can buy manuka honey in a pharmacy and it’s pretty pricey but it lasts for a long time)

Mask-B: 1 egg white + 1 tablespoon of oatmeal (pretty simple but feels kinda gross)

Start with the Mask-A for 30 minutes, it works as a deep cleanse and exfoliant. Then wash it off with warm water and apply the Mask-B for 30 minutes. Mask-B tightens and moisturizes the skin. remember to wash your face with cold water when finished to completely protect your pores.

Believe me, this will drastically reduce your acne. It will also give you the softest baby butt face, not even replicable by god.

Enjoy"

The bacteria from your face is on your pillow case for at least 5 hours a day and it stays there for as long as the pillow case is there. Remember to wash your face. Wether it be the morning, afternoon, or at night. Especially after you workout. Try not to touch your face regularly unless you’re cleaning your face.

20072,"If you get convicted of a crime but are innocent, then if you are in jail you can be released. It sucks, but at least you still have some life outside. If you're dead you're dead, you can't undo that so it might lead to innocent deaths."
20073,It would be better if they had to rot in jail for the rest of their lives imo
20074,"Never though I'd say this- ""Every country should follow the precedence of North Korea on this matter"""
20075,4% of people on death row are innocent. Which is rare but still very high for what it’s worth.
20076,Justice system still fails sometimes tho
20077,I support that
20078,yeah people should understand that lifetime jail is a worse punishment than death penalty
20079,"I never thought I'd agree with North Korea but here we are

Being serious though I don't really like the idea of a death penalty. I'd much rather them rot in prison forever"
20080,You like the death penalty?
20081,Yessir
20082,it’s an excellent law
20083,"Yes if they were truly guilty. North Korea seems shady af, someone high up could claim a person raped their child and now an innocent is dead."
20084,"I think that they should be held in a holding cell until the accusation is proven, then they can be released if innocent or punished by death if they’re 100% guilty"
20085,Yeah definitely. Execution is too easy for any rapist let alone a child rapist
20086,"Yes, but more than likely if it's a female accuser, then it's more likely that they aren't going to look for a lot of evidence, because most people believe that men cannot be raped. Even though I know men who have been raped."
20087,"That’s a really bad way to handle things like that. The US jailing system is awful because it exactly operates like that. People can literally end up waiting years for their trial to even begin in some really backed up justice systems. Imagine having to wait years just to end up proving your innocence on any crime, let alone rape."
20088,He is French
20089,I'm willing to bet it would get to them eventually. If nothing else the constant harassment from other prisoners for what they did would grade on them.
20090,nah i think life sentence is a more effective punishment
20091,"I'm against the death penalty, so no."
20092,I feel that rape should be punishable by death especially when it is done to a child but at the same time the prison system should be based on rehabilitation and second chances and if we want to have that we cant have the death penalty in the first place but honestly i dont really support north korea at all in the first place due to the human rights violations.
20093,"Often yes. But I think someone who rapes a child is never going to feel remorse or anything, and they're likely to not actually care about being in jail"
20094,"That’s not going to hold up in court though man.

I know what you mean but usually the only people who do that are crazy bitches and everyone already knows that so they act accordingly."
20095,"Rape of anyone or anything being punishable by death is an unspeakably bad idea. It makes it pay to kill the rape victim in order to eliminate a witness, because the killing cannot lead to any harsher punishment."
20096,"Yeah but I've heard of too many people who were accused of rape by someone they met once, and this one woman who was accusing my friend's dad of rape went into a lot of untrue details, and the court sent him to jail for I think 3 years. Anyway they didn't look for any evidence because of how much detail the woman had even though my friend's dad had a solid alibi for where he was at the time. This was 2 years ago before Covid hit."
20097,firing squad is one of the best ways to be executed
20098,"You’re right, I didn’t think of how long they’d be there. And the US jailing system isn’t great, there’s definitely a better solution to this"
20099,No death penalty because of false accusations and government control but jail for life is not a bad idea.
20100,Many people do crimes way worse than a simple firing squad
20101,"Ok. Would you like to falsely acused, killed, and then a year later realized to be innocent?"
20102,"Yeah it's cool and all of you can find the one, I'll definitely want to get married in the future

20104,At this point in my life I would definitely not want a wedding I hate too much attention lol. But what do you think about being married?
20105,i don’t mind it? i think as a concept it’s stupid but societal pressure makes it uncomfy to be having a family with a boyfriend if i want one. i think i’ll have to wait until later to really know
20106,Someone most definitely will bro
20107,"Yeah same here my parents marriage(s) were pretty tough. I don’t want to get married, partially because of the same reasons but also because that’s time I can be spending on better things for my work or the world."

20122,"Not just the process, but being married would mean that I would have invest time and energy making sure my partner is being treated respectfully and everything else. It wouldn’t be fair to either of us if I got married without putting in my time."

20191,How do you know it isn’t literal poop
20192,"No, it sucks but you gotta be cautious. I'd be afraid of a gun owner but I don't believe all gun owners are horrible. My Dad and uncle used to own guns and they would never do anything to kill.

Besides I normally avoid women and children on the chance that I get mistaken for a creep yet I don't do that to guys. Doesn't mean I hate women or believe that I'll get a false accusation from every women, I'm being cautious of the 0.1% chance."
20193,"It's not saying that men have inherently less value than women, it's just a valid concern."
20194,"LMAO “shut up sexist sjw libtard.” 10 bucks that dude thinks he’s smart because he uses 4chan. my answer is no, definitely not. especially at night."
20195,"No. It's definitly prejudice, but not sexism unless you act upon the prejudice. It's also not a bad thing in that example.

Like if the same situation presented happened except it was a black person and a white person and I said I was afraid of the black person more, that's definitely prejudice.

The difference is that you are actually far more likely to be attacked by a random guy than a random girl, whereas the differences in the likelyness of being attacked by a black vs. white person are practically nonexistent, so that fear of guys is kinda justified."
20196,"Feeling a certain way about ALL members is a very high and arguably unreasonable bar for prejudice(racism, sexism, etc).

I'd argue that even the most extreme Neo-Nazi or KKK member wouldn't believe that ALL black people are violent/dumb/etc. There are so many examples to the contrary. Just enough of them for them to feel they are justified hating black people as a whole. 

If someone tells a black guy that they're ""one of the good ones"" is that not racist?

> If you're just trying to make sure your past experiences don't repeat then no.

This is a similar to arguments for profiling Muslims in the wake of 9/11."
20197,You're also making the women that aren't the 0.1% chance feel more secure
20198,">I am a young female alone at night. Is it sexist for me to be more afraid if I saw a man than a women?

This context and scenario is important. Even a guy would be more afraid of a man compared to a woman in this situation. 

I'd be afraid of any stranger if I'm alone somewhere at night, it's called being cautious."
20199,"Ok but this isn't sexist, only being sketched out if it was a man and not if it was a woman is tho.

I would be sketched out if I was walking alone at night and I saw anyone too, black or white."
20200,Yep. Easy trade off.
20201,"These scenarios may seem similar but they are not. There are no major inherent differences in physical strength between races, yet there are major physical differences between sexes. There’s nothing to show that black people would specifically target white people, yet there is a history of men specifically targeting women due them generally being easier targets. I’m sure anyone would be more cautious walking through a low income area, wether it’s mostly black, white, hispanic, whatever, cause low income correlates to higher crime rates."
20202,A man is inherently stronger then a woman therefore leaving him at an advantage. It is a valid fear.
20203,"It's really kind of you, have a nice day!"
20204,"Not really sexist per se, but still a big assumption. Not an unjust one though.

I mean, men are in general more attracted to women than women are to other women. This means that in general, a male would be more likely to jump a female. That being said, men are biologically designed to be hunters, whereas women are biologically designed to be nurturers. Both of these indicate that you are more likely to be jumped by a man than a women.

Statistics also back up your fears. Men tend to be the attackers more often than women are, and there is plenty of evidence out there to prove it.

While it's a horrible thing to say, you are absolutely more likely to be jumped by a man instead of a woman. You are right to be more afraid of men than women, although you should be always be cautious.

PS: I don't mean any sort of ""defending"" of those terrible people that would jump a teenage girl when I am saying these biological facts. I'm just saying it as it is, and I believe that anybody that allow any such urged to take over is a horrible person."
20205,"prejudice:an unfair and unreasonable opinion or feeling, especially when formed without enough thought or knowledge

this doesn’t apply to what op said, so it’s not prejudice. I agree with the rest though"
20206,Not really. Even as a guy I've seen and heard of some shit (both irl and online) that guys do or say to girls so often and I honestly don't blame y'all for being afraid of men or even outright avoiding them as much as possible.
20207,"definitely not lmao. realistically, men are more dangerous to women, esp at night. ive never been catcalled by a woman. i’ve never been groped by a woman. i’ve never been followed home by a woman. but i have with men. if i dont use fear as my first defense then i might get hurt. if thats sexist then... idk man. i guess i’m sexist. but i kinda feel like i have a right to feel this way.

i’m not saying i would cross the street if i saw a man at night, but if i was walking on the same street as a man for an extended period of time, i might pretend to call someone or stop in a shop."
20208,"if it’s circumstantial then i wouldn’t necessarily say so, and since it’s more out of valid concern then i wouldn’t say so either but it’s still not good to generalize all men as that obviously. Like it’s good and fine to be cautious, but just be aware that not every man is a threat at night although some very well are"
20209,"No because it’s a very valid concern that women have to consider nearly every time they’re by themselves in public.  Not to mention, statistically, on average, men are stronger than women so it’s not comparable to women on women or men on men crime because there’s an inherent disadvantage if you don’t have anything to defend yourself with.  If you asked any woman who’s above like 25 this they’d 100% say that what you’re saying is reasonable."
20210,"Your male friends are idiots. It's just math, women are much more likely to be assaulted by men than men are (even more so at night). You're being very reasonable. Being scared of all men period is probably something to seek help about because it seems like a sign of trauma resultant from bad experiences, but in your given scenario (and in most others) women are significantly more likely to be the victim and so it only makes sense for them to be afraid."
20211,"[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/hp5mzx/is_it_sexist_to_be_afraid_of_men/fxp54le/), you’re weirdly obsessed with black people"
20212,"Afraid of men at all times? Yes, it is sexist

Afraid of men during nighttime or when you're alone? No, that fear is totally reasonable given your experiences and knowledge of other people's experiences.

I have to say it would be sad if I was walking on the curb and a woman in front of me starts walking a bit faster, but I guess it's better to be safe than sorry."
20213,13/50 isn’t a real stat.
20214,Men are also stronger then women. There's no significant difference in race but there is in sex.
20215,This dude's got a major obsession with black people.
20216,"These stats are from 1980 to 2008...

I’ll get back to you once I check out this source, as well."
20217,"Nah, it's just being cautious. As long as you don't discriminate against them it's not sexist. And men do tend to be more dangerous because they're physically stronger. You should always prioritize your own safety over people's feelings, being a bit rude is fine if you have a gut feeling that something might go wrong."
20218,"Statistically, black people are just as likely to commit violent crimes as any other race. The same is not true for men, who form a majority of convicted rapists and homicidal people.

Edit: nah, black people are 3× more likely to commit violent crimes than the rest of the races."
20219,"lol it’s not a question ab race tho so it doesn’t make sense to bring that up. no one is saying all men are scary and bad or anything, but if you think logically men are biologically stronger than women so they could overpower you easily. it’s not horrible to be more cautious around strange men while alone and vulnerable at night. as i said, i’d be cautious around strange women too because it’s not like they’re never a threat themselves."
20220,"Judging by the edit, you believe in 13/50, huh?"
20221,"Yeah, that’s how decades work. Either way, in regards to OP, it’s not sexist. After all, men commit 80% of crimes.

I’m not an academic, I haven’t studied these stats. I’ll link a vid to somebody who has the info soon."

20274,"Those comments are the worst, usually I'm just looking for other people who heard the same things in the song that I did but instead I'll find ""who's here from ___"", with ""here in (select year)"" in a close yet solid second"
20275,"Yep, found a good song earlier and went to the comments to see if people talked about other songs by the same artist to see what to listen to next. ""Like if you came from tiktok"" ""like if you were here before tiktok"" ""can everyone stop talking about tiktok"" I swear sometimes the comments talking about other comments are more annoying than the original comments."

20285,"You’re missing the part where you stop crying, think you’re over it, you’re about to go to bed when the tears re emerge from the various coves they once were hidden in. And 20 years someone will start preaching something about how abortion is murder and you’ll tell them your story and not change his mind but it’ll feel good knowing you don’t have anything to hide. And then you’ll be an old woman and you’ll be on you apartment patio when you realize that you’ve had a good life and although it is a life that was taken it was not a life that you could sustain emotionally of financially and you will get over your guilt you’ve fell over the past 60 years and realize 13 years old was not your age. But one year does not define a life’s and then you’ll meditate on life and realize desire is not a good thing so you give up all desires and there you meditate continuosly for 30 years and at the age of 103 you become a Buddha and are also immortal and continue to be your best self with no humanly desire. And then you’ll realize that immortality is not the best thing so you will use the next 1000 years trying to find a cure to the disease of immortality but to no avail. That is when you will unite the world with the great ways of understanding and abolishing indifference and injustice. But the nation will split, for there is a new immortal being and their name is jake he’ll rise vast waves that will destroy your kingdom and history will repeat itself your immortality will be repealed and your kingdom will be left to legend as the nation of Atlantis. Now I’d like the 500$ or 500£ or 500€ or 50000¥ for your reading of your life. Now pay up or I’ll send the mob after you."

20374,I live in the UK and it's been so hot today (28C). I hate it. I can't do any exercise because I get too hot so it messed up some of my plans. I also just generally feel ill and light headed when it's this hot.

20382,"Nope. That’s me, I’m people. 

Rain is moretime shit. Walking home from school in the rain are some of my worst school experiences. Lugging the big ass umbrella which is the only that won’t break in the wind, along with my full school bag, with the holes in the back of the sole of school shoes that happens, with the spire things on the umbrella dripping onto my hair and clothes, the bus being super full or delayed and having to stand outside for longer and getting splashed by cars is shite."

Oh wait, this comment is about to get removed. Serious question though, it seemed as if more people voted to remove rule C. What made you decide to override that?"

How is this fair?"
20412,"Nice. Also, just to add, it isn't a big deal whether askteenboys mirrors the rules or not. I mean, technically the subs are different. What matters is that you guys create a healthy environment over here.

One more addition to the rule I would have liked is that there should be a rule about **no gendered slurs**, You see a lot of guys calling other girls ""crazy bitch"" etc. It's just unhealthy. Be respectful to everyone should be rule as well."
20413,Unfortunately we do not police people's language use unless it contains severe incivility or otherwise breaks sitewide rules
20414,casual sexism
20415,Username checks out
20416,"Sorry, you're incorrect. I don't care what gender you are. It's not your space, and you're doing nothing more but pulling out the gender card right now."
20417,"That’s actually pretty god awful. First, the reasoning behind making the rule was off a screenshot with 50% M/F comments, and a third  of the male comments were made on meme posts, not legitimate responses. Now, that it’s been effectively voted to be removed, you gave more voting rights to the people who agree with you. Time to find a new sub then 🤷🏼‍♂️. Most of the people came here from r/teenagers when those mods went to shit making their own rules. Honestly pisses me off that you never put the way voting would be counted before it was tallied, AND gave mods yet even more power if it happens to be that yet again we show the rule isn’t popular. Just because we follow the rule doesn’t mean it’s working well. People get less responses overall because no one bothers responding to the automod, OP doesn’t see them, and some questions are best answered by people who fall in a demographic other than female. If OP only wants female responses make it a tag, not a BS rule. Off to find a new sub"
20418,I've read all the replies to this thread and my conclusion is that these mods are fucking stupid.
20419,"Hey guys, lets have a vote. Party 1 vs. Party 2. Except Party 1 only gets to vote, where as party two gets to insert their full opinion, feelings, and then gets to make the overall decision regardless of votes about who gets elected. Oh boy, what a shocker, Party 2 won the election. Sure glad we held that vote so Party 1 would be fairly represented, right guys?


(For clarification, I agree with the rule. I *don't* agree with how the mods ran the poll.)"
20420,it’s ok. i am english and still have never heard that phrase before
20421,"I agree with rule C, feel free do downvote me butthurt guys, but it’s ask teen *girls* not ask teen girls but get guy responses."
20422,Well the option with most votes didn't take it all so what's the point
20423,Well then I disagree with that too.
20424,"???

That's literally what I did in the second one, after doing the multiplication and adding it all together, Remove rule won with 31 points, followed by keep rule with 25, and compromise with 23.

>Remove: 31  
>  
>Keep: 25  
>  
>Compromise: 23

If you consider that Compromise is an in-between of the other 2 options, the distribution looks like this:

25-----------------23-------------------31  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
\-\^-------------------\^--------------------\^  
Keep------Compromise------Remove

If you subtract the 2 opposite points (for simplicity), you get this:

\-0------------------23-------------------6  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
\-\^-------------------\^--------------------\^  
Keep------Compromise--------Remove

looking at this, the general consensus seems to be somewhere around here:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
\--\^-------------------\^--------------------\^  
Keep------Compromise--------Remove

People are clearly in favour of moving away from what we have, so how exactly is your conclusion in any way fair?"
20425,Well also 17 people disagree with that
20426,"I don't care about the context, the system that you used is by definition - sexist. Using gender to dictate the significance of someone's free speech."

this is a legitimate question

edit: wording"
20433,i don’t ever notice anything ever
20434,Me when a girl gives me hints
20435,"What's a ""good ass"" to girls? Or is that dependent on the girl?"
20436,If ur behind then how will they see
20437,"Its probably like us, theres some everyone agrees are awesome and then its personal preference. I'm guessing it's like that. Any girl correct me if I'm wrong"
20438,"If we are turned around, we can't tell."
20439,I’m not gay but ass is ass
20440,Oh definitely.
20441,I’m a boy and people look at my ass
20442,Timmy Thick.
20443,Your back eyes... duh!
20444,"There definitely are some that do. They're probably not as common, but they exist"
20445,yes
20446,Hol' up
20447,What makes a boys ass good?
20448,"Sadly, that doesn’t fit my personality, so my friends would probably be very confused/suspicious if I said something like that."
20449,ive never noticed it. Maybe my ass not good enough haha
20450,An ass that belongs to someone you like— so dependent on the girl
20451,Everyone**
20452,ask a friend in a joking way or say something like ugh I have no ass and see what happens.
20453,Socks?
20454,"Yes, they’re pretty far away from my face"
20455,How do I know if I have a good ass?
20456,"Thought so. I would think that it's like dudes with like ""oh i only like small tits with a big ass"" or something"
20457,I've seen some that looked at mine but they were thots
20458,I mean I look at my bfs ass all the time and he’s got a small but adorable ass
20459,im a girl
20460,"what if it’s only a quick glance? Assuming you are b, and I look from a to c and make a quick stop at your boobs, would you notice?

`a b c`"
20461,How about when we glance at your boobs?
20462,"I personally wouldn't practice complete nudity, but me and my brother walk around in just boxers sometimes. I think oversexualization of the human body is a problem, but I don't know if nudism would solve that without serious social change outside of it. If that's your thing and you do it privately though, feel free to go for it"
20463,"I dont like my body, so much that I dont even wear tight clothes, also I have a lot of body hair so I would be really uncomfortable"
20464,Clothes are fun and useful
20465,"the rape rate would shoot through the roof ngl 

and pedos would have a much easier job 

besides that i wouldnt have any pockets so no knife to go and save some girl or something like that 

nah everyone nude in public is just dumb in my opinion

but in general im ok with it as long as i dont have to do it"
20466,"Yes of course and that would be in a perfect world, but we dont live in a world like that unfortunately, so people have insecurities, and because of that I wouldn't be comfortable being a nudist. Nothing wrong with it, just not for me."
20467,"Social change to move towards less sexualization of the human body would definitely be a good thing, but nudism probably won't be the thing to drive that change"
20468,I wouldn't be one and seeing other people naked makes me uncomfortable lol
20469,"Why are you saying it's normal? Its normal for you, but obviously not for other people. You seem quite defensive"
20470,"I have to agree with you, society has way over sexualized the human body. It's almost disgusting. Although I think it's too late for everyone to go nude. There will always be those creeps."
20471,The number of times in a day I get hard randomly you’d think I have a crush on everyone.
20472,Yeah shes def emitting small pp energy
20473,Why not?
20474,"I've always been sort of modest so ig that's why, I draw so seeing ppl in underwear and such for references is not a big deal to me but completely naked idk it's just not my thing lol"
20475,I would be extremely uncomfortable regardless of the human body being sexualized. It’s my body and only me and extremely trusted people are going to look at it. Not even with my family.
20476,Why couldn't u be?
20477,"I would disagree. If being nude was the norm, seeing someone naked would hardly be sexualised. If you compare western countries to places in Asia like Japan where in their society its sort of looked down upon to have sex at a young age and sex in general is sort of taboo, there are more people desperate for sex and therefore will be more likely to rape.

Its going to be dumb from our point of views bc we're so used to wearing clothes"
20478,That’s like going to an anorexic person and saying just eat. Like that doesn’t solve the problem. Keep your unnecessary comments to yourself. If she’s insecure about her body hair that’s valid.
20479,"uh i like my privacy and i find it uncomfortable already if i see someone else naked that isn't directly related to me (if its my mom or dad less uncomfortable but weird for sure.

i mean you do you but for me i would not like to ditch my clothes i like the colors and fabrics."
20480,Personally I wouldn’t be up for it for one main reason: unwanted erections.
20481,"Don't you think other people feel the same way/also have body hair? If people didn't hide behind clothes, all of that would become normalized."
20482,"I don't even like wearing shorts sleeves in public unless it's necessary lol and also feel more comfortable being clothed when alone. I don't have body image issues or anything, just don't like the exposed feeling of showing skin.

I guess if you're doing it at home it's no big deal, but I really wouldn't like seeing full nudity in public, I'm sorry :("
20483,I'm aware thx
20484,You should be if you're going out in public. Not everyone wants to see naked people in public
20485,I don't think a lot of people want to see a lot of other people's genitals
20486,"Bro you’ve obviously never shaved a coochie before. It fucking sucks. Razor bumps, ingrown hairs, spikes, itches, 🤢 it’s not something that’s easy to do every day. 

Also it’s not really your problem to solve if she is insecure"
20487,I enjoy clothes but to each their own
20488,Maybe the social change could be a good thing?
20489,It’s funny how most of the guys on here seem to be up for it and most of the girls aren’t.
20490,"You may be used to it. But you really can't see why people who grew up in non nudist families might feel differently?

You're used to nudism because you grew up with it. 
Others get uncomfortable because they grew up without it.

Add in how our society objectified women's bodies, and you get a lot of shame and discomfort around it.

Go to PornHub, and you'll see how most people think of nudity."
20491,Do you not know what peripheral vision is?
20492,"I agree, but as a senior I'm long past caring about stuff like that by now. I'm just ready to be out of here now"
20493,"Literally all I’m getting at the end of the year is a yearbook and a hoodie (which is nice because it’s mainly an American thing we don’t get here) but still. I’ll be looking through that thing thinking about what I *could’ve* done with the little time I had left if not for Covid, not what I *did*."
20494,I’m a sophomore but I agree 100 percent.
20495,Yeah fuck it. I’m giving myself senioritis. Just fuck this year in general.
20496,"ugh fr, i’m sorry you’re missing out and if it makes you feel better you’re not alone, i think all the seniors are having a shitty year :/"
20497,Oof my last comment sounded spiteful. Eh tbh I can't say either year has gotten the deserved treatment at all in the UK. We've been getting sympathy from some places but nothing really helps enough due to the sheer level of bullshit some people are going through. You could probably write an entire politics dissertation on that shit
20498,The end of the year test in computer science got shrunk down so much you could have missed all the classes in one of the two subjects and ace it.
20499,"I agree. Im a junior, but I dont think the virus will go away next year."
20500,I was a senior last year and I was happy because I was able to finish out my sports seasons so I feel extra bad for seniors this year who won’t have an opportunity to have a good final year with their athletics
20501,My senioritis is all-in right now
20502,"same here, it’s hard to be motivated at all tbh"
20503,i’m class of 2021 and i appreciate that someone actually cares ab us hahaha thank you :)
20504,"Lol that’s capitalism, happy wage slaving."
20505,"I’m the equivalent in the UK, and the same thing is happening here"
20506,I’m a junior and I agree 110% I feel so bad for the class of 2021 I feel as if they even had it worse than class of 2020. Especially in my country majority or half of the kids are all online so you can’t even go to school. Last years graduates were celebrated immensely and no one even cares about class of 2021 which makes me sad for them.
20507,"I remember making jokes about senior class of 20 having to graduate on an online meeting (I didn’t think it would actually happen 😭) and now it came to bite me back. I don’t mind it too much though because I don’t really interact with people like that anyways. Only bad sides, for me personally, are missed snowdays and my grades. 

Just saying, if people want to be that cool senior that badly, you can always stay a senior for another year. /s"
20508,alexa play *we’re all in this together* 🎶
20509,"see, idk what seniors are and so on as it doesn't work like that here

but I'm fustrated that I'm in year 11 (grade 10, I think in the US) and that nobody seems to care about missing prom or just being able to see eachother before the end of the year ):"
20510,"I was senior last year. The real killer wasnt ending high school in a pandemic, it was starting college in the pandemic. We pay full price college for a 1/4th of the experience others had. No socializing no initiations no nothing and an entirely different method of teaching and things to learn and we have to adapt to all of it online. At least you guys have a chance to make it to college physically next year."
20511,hopefully it won’t be as bad so maybe you can have at least some of the senior experience :/
20512,"senior year is the last grade of high school, i’m not sure how to explain it LOL but afterwards they’d be going to college/university 

hopefully things will be better next year and prom will actually happen for y’all :("
20513,I luckily got into college recently so it’s extremely hard to feel like I need to do physics when I have literally been accepted into college to do something I actually care about. Senioritis is in full effect.
20514,Crossing my fingers. Did not got through fucking high school to miss out on this lol
20515,"LOL well then!! I'm in my last year of secondary school either than I have college (16-18) and then there's optional uni

and I hope the same for you ): ☁"
20516,"Yes a little, but I also feel like a lot adults are beginning to feel for us because we’re the ones who are mostly affected by this."
20517,"Austrian here checking in. The government here acts like the want to help us by making the finals easier and the making the presentation of our final project optional. Well, that's what they tell the media, in reality they don't care about most of our school types and only about one particular type of high school, which means effectively they are the only one getting the reliefs.
Concerning events, our teachers do show sympathy that we miss out on so much but that doesn't stop them from giving us more exercises than usual."
20518,"Yea, but at least we'll actually probably get a prom."
20519,"Yeah, because your school year hasn’t ended yet... lmao nobody’s going to get anything until graduation rolls around, simple as that"
20520,"I was a senior last year and I didn't get any special treatment as far as I know.. but I agree, this years seniors are fucked with everything goin' on rn"
20521,"To the class of 2020 and class of 2021: I feel so bad for each and every one of you. You guys have been fucked over the most out of every one. You guys missed out on all of your social events, your friends and relationships, and your education. It isn't fair, and it isn't right to you guys. I'm class of 2023, so I still have Junior and Senior year, but the class of 2021 had it worst, you missed out on both of those. 

Fuck whoever mandated schools to be closed."

20591,It's Nerf or nothing
20592,"Expressing my opinion and an officer heard it. We don't have freedom of speech here. And if they were able to arrest me, that would probably be the reason."
20593,Honestly I dont think it'd suprise anyone
20594,Same!
20595,"Egypt, I don't think they can find my reddit, bc if so, dad would have been in jail a long tine ago."
20596,Vote manipulation
20597,"Just out of curiosity, what country? (Assuming you can say)"
20598,Theft
20599,"Same here. The only thing that I can think of would be drinking what I thought was water, but it was really vodka."
20600,Based
20601,I would assume illegal firearm for sure
20602,Same
20603,عند السواحل  بتاعة البحر المتوسط كده
20604,Probably stole something
20605,i’m egyptian as well! where in egypt are you from?
20606,My friends will assume I killed someone and my parents will believe I did nothing
20607,"Nothing, the cops like to harass black people"
20608,They would 100% think I got into a fight
20609,"If not believing I was wrongfully arrested, then they’d probably assume I stole a cat."
20610,Murder
20611,"Okay, to be fair, if I was arrested with no explanation, my best friend would think I published something awful that we wrote, my boyfriend would think I pushed someone off a cliff, and my parents would assume I was getting drunk (even though I'm far to young)"
20612,I love how this implies that youve been thinking a lot from the perspective of an animal aw haha
20613,"> hair protect you?""

idk the way you said that 🥺️🥺️🥺️😭😭😭"
20614,"hehe

lowkey humans are so cute tho like we invite other humans to our dens and have parties or just hang out together when we're bored 🥺"
20615,Weak ass stomach ass having ass smart ass monkey ass humans
20616,"Alcohol. Animals are just like ""Imma drink my mom's tit juice or slurp some fokin water and that's it."""
20617,"Why do we need so much space, like animals way larger than us have way smaller homes or beds"
20618,"“Y tf u humans wear clothes and cut hair? Just don’t cut hair smh”

- Animals"
20619,"actually some animals eat fermented fruits which gives them the “drunk” effect, and dolphins play with pufferfish to absorb their toxins to get a high so some animals are pretty much on the same page with us for that"
20620,Thats so adorable vfdgndv
20621,"Cleanliness maybe, like shaving and stuff. I understand that animals clean themselves but they don’t go to the extent of using tools to remove fur or feathers or anything like that"
20622,"Consuming milk into adulthood, and from a different species"
20623,"The reason we all like grass in our places is, back hundreds of years ago in order to seem wealthy and powerful people wouldn’t grow crops in their lawns and instead just grass. They were like, haha, I can take this lack of resource because I’m cooler than you plebeians."
20624,"Actually we have very strong stomach acid. Even strong enough to rapidly corrode metal! https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9283866/

And many foods we can eat raw, if we got to them freshly killed before bacteria developed a bunch, and even then you can still eat things like steak and some fishes raw."
20625,We keep other animals in our dens just to be friends with. And we decorate ourselves with colored powders and polishes and other people’s hair bc it makes us happy
20626,My mother
20627,books. u stare at a piece of wood and hallucinate?
20628,Waving hands. I see people waving to dogs and cats and I'm always wondering what they might think because it's so stupid
20629,They'd probably think our babies are pretty pathetic
20630,Oh dang I didn't know that was actually true haha I'm going to have to research that a bit because I thought that was just a joke or something
20631,"I get sad when I go to the zoo bc I feel like the animals should be free, but I love the aquarium (NOT SEAWORLD) bc it’s fish, which are way less intelligent than some animals, and also they seem to be having a good time"
20632,That we care/dgaf about the environment
20633,"pretty strange huh, zoos get hella weird and depressing once you start thinking about them"
20634,"fr that's wackkk 

imagine being a human"
20635,"Animals dont use ""homes"" in the way we do, they mostly just sleep in them. We live in them and therefore need more space."
20636,what did Finland do
20637,"So what you’re saying is, if I barf on a metal bar, it could melt."
20638,"That we become fat for no apparent reason. It is practically impossible for a wild animal to get fat, apart from certain animals like seals who need their blubber to keep warm. The concept of actually gaining weight would be completely alien to animals. If an animal needs to be fat, it just is fat. If there is no reason to be fat, then animals stay super fit with all the work they have to do to simply stay alive. So the idea that humans become fat without needing to would be very stupid to a wild animal."
20639,"Books. Like, there's no communication aspect, it's not productive, and if you get too absorbed you don't notice anything around you making you vulnerable."
20640,"It’s even worse when you remember one of our ancestors had to figure out drinking cow milk tastes good, and I doubt they knew how to milk a cow"
20641,tv lol
20642,fr i'm so used to seeing them around that once i bent down to an ACTUAL SPIDER and that mf got hella speedy but i've got more speed cuz fuck spiders are scary
20643,"BRUHH 😭 i see bugs all the time and just assume it’s a hairball, then shit starts moving like djsdhshsh"
20644,One time I thought it was a spider then I was like oh no it’s just hair and tried to pick it up and it was a spider.
20645,mhm yum yum yum
20646,them mfs really stickbugging us 😭😭😭
20647,fr those creepy crawlies always tryna trick us
20648,"I just shoot them, murica style"
20649,"Yep, my hair basically sheds like a dog so there's hair balls all over that combined with my bad eyesight there's been many times I thought there was a huge ass spider on the floor"
20650,"i don't, but if it actually was a spider i'd still pick it up, as spiders are cool."
20651,"the folks in Australia shouldnt risk it being a spider. If it looks like a spider from 10 meters, better burn the house down"
20652,yes yes yes yes yes
20653,"yeah we def coughin those up too, females are a whole ass diff species"
20654,"it also happened backwards to me, worst part is I tried to grab it aaaaahhhhhhh"
20655,"Yea, and also the knots in wooden floors give me a heart attack every time."
20656,"Yeah, usually when I brush my hair"
20657,No cuz if I think it's a spider I run away
20658,Yup. I have long hair.
20659,This happens all the time at the dance studio.
20660,"lmaoo once it was actually the opposite, i didn't have my glasses on and i saw a big clump of something and i thought it was a hairball but i ran to get my glasses to check and it was actually a bigass hairy spider 🤡🤡"
20661,No
20662,"lol it just somehow gathers in the dryers, sticks onto clothing, falls off of clothing onto the floor, and scares the shit out of me"
20663,"Ohhhh that makes a lot more sense, I thought you meant like a cat hairball and I was scared"

20667,"They have made us sing it since birth. Not since birth, since we joined school. We have known the Anthem earlier than alphabets"
20668,"Huh?, its God save the queen for england mate"
20669,"only for england, not the uk"
20670,"Yep

20672,"I though GSTQ was the UK? Then England has Jerusalem (confusing), N Ireland has Londonderry Air, Scotland has Flower of Scotland (Or Scotland the Brave) and Wales has Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"
20673,Not complaining tho

God save our gracious Queen (..Gracious? is that it?)

God save our noble Queen

God save the Queen

Happy and glooooorious

Long may she ruule O-ver us..

Go-od save the Queen

(There's a second verse but I don't know it)"
20675,"Yeah, it felt so patriotic and energetic when the whole school sang together"
20676,I love the Star Spangled Banner!
20677,Yes. I know the Soviet Anthem 😎
20678,"Oi maamme, Suomi, synnyinmaa, soi sana kultainen! 

Ei laaksoa, ei kukkulaa, ei vettä rantaa rakkaampaa kuin kotimaa tää pohjoinen, maa kallis isien!


Sun kukoistukses kuorestaan kerrankin puhkeaa 

Viel lempemme saa nousemaan sun toivos, riemus loistossaan, ja kerran, laulus synnyinmaa korkeemman kaiun saa"
20679,I think the second verse is something related to hitting Scots with a hammer.
20680,Me too haha :)
20681,"GAVE PROOF THROUGH THE NIGHT 

THAT THE FLAG WAS STILL THERE"
20682,"UK's anthem is God save the queen, some of the devolved regions have set their own anthems that apply to those regions. England doesn't have an official anthem."

20685,Oh alright. Sorry bout that
20686,AND THE ROCKET'S RED GLARE
20687,The bombs bursting in ayaire (*cool riff)
20688,"only the chorus

*god save the queeen*"
20689,"no, UK doesn't have it's own anthem cos it's sometimes treated as 4 different countries (which it is) and sometimes treated as 1"
20690,"its fine, it happens a lot lol"
20691,they made you sing that in school? we literally did it once
20692,[deleted]
20693,"Well my anthem is the longest of world, so I can’t. I can somewhat sing the 3 first but the whole rest I haven’t even heard. 
It’s like this: the verse’s first letter makes the name of the first ‘king’ (he wasn’t but you know it’s the most clear) and his name was Wilhelmus van Nassouwe. So quite a few verses 😂"
20694,"Yeah, perfectly. We all should."
20695,Isn’t it Sweet Caroline? 😂
20696,I’m my own biggest dream crusher 😎
20697,"Um, sometimes they have to be.

I wanted to be a pilot in the military when I was like 10, but my parents told me I couldn't because of my vision (which is 100% true)

But in general, I'm my biggest dream crusher"
20698,"this right here, best to be supportive of realistic goals"
20699,"Yeah i agree

Also dont understand why the hell parents often are happy when their children want to become doctors or lawyers or shit, these honestly arent even that good professions and are very risky"
20700,"Yeah, being a SFX makeup person is a good gig. I don’t see what issue they’d have with it. It’s not like you said you wanted to be a secret agent or a firefighter or something typically juvenile like that. Also I wouldn’t become a doctor just because they want to you. The stress in medical schools is ridiculous, I don’t think it’s worth it solely because of pressure from your family."
20701,"I agree with this but some parents force it upon their children to choose an ultimatum

Commonly speaking, either be a doctor or you don't get college paid for

That's just bullshit"
20702,It’s such a dumb desire for parents. As if other professions are not necessary in our society...
20703,"Fuck no. My parents like encouraging me towards certain career paths, but that’s just because they want the best for me. I wanted to be a writer for so long and my mum always bought me books and encouraged me to write. She still does. 

My dad got me my first piano, and always reminds me to practise. My parents only want the best for me when they tell me to get good grades or say they want me to do a certain profession, but I know they’ll always support me.

I’m actually the dream crusher. I always feel like I’m not good enough or that so many people are better than me, and that needs to stop :("
20704,I feel like it is often the case that parents will try to make up for their own failures through their kids. Parents who never put in enough effort to get into medical school will force their kids to fill their own emptiness. Pretty sad tbh
20705,"Definitely yes

As an example my mother stopped me from doing baseball as she said I'm slow and would suck.

I still signed up and she still told that I would almost never play.

I then had a near perfect batting record and won state."
20706,"I have a friend who wanted to study city planning or whatever its called. His parents literally complained to him that he shouldve chosen medical school. Like wtf city planning is more desirable and more profitable and way less risky

I dont understand"
20707,"depends on the parents, my parents are very supportive of me"
20708,"Yup. This whole time my parents told me they were going to support whatever I choose and never tell me to do a certain profession. A few months ago I told them I wanted to be an animator while being excited because they were going to support me, right? **Lmao ofc not.**

At first they didn't take me seriously, then realized I really wanted to do it. So they tried to change my mind, we had multiple fights, put me on extra school classes even though I said I didn't want to and currently they're trying to make me change schools.

I feel like shit, I want to cry everytime I try to draw something and I'm losing weight. But I'm fucking gonna do what I love even if I have to take the art exams secretly and be on my own. I never felt happy when I listened them, so I won't do it anymore."
20709,"Yeah I think parents have a lot of influence on whether their children will be happy or not. Of course it’s important for parents to be realistic, but they shouldn’t decide what you want to become. The whole ‘my kid has to become a doctor or lawyer’ thing around parents is so fucking stupid. Do whatever you want."
20710,My parents are willing to pay $600 a week for me to go to university but aren’t willing to pay $100 a month for better internet so I can pursue my dream of been a content creator. So I basically have to finish my degree first which btw is a double degree in advanced computing and physics. Because they don’t believe that someone “as smart as [me]” should waste their time on content creation instead of getting a degree.
20711,"Yes, even when they say they arent"
20712,It depends on your parents mine always encourage me to do things I want and find a way to support me
20713,"Like sometimes. They tend to think that the child can succeed better if they choose studies over other curriculum activities as a career. 

Now I can't say that for all the parents, but it is the fact with those mine and few friends of mine"
20714,^
20715,"Wow, your parents suck but your drive is amazing."
20716,My parents have always supported even my pipe dreams and encourage me not to let society or bad luck scare me off because they also encouraged me to have a solid plan b. I’ve felt more pressure from other older people than from my parents but everyone’s parents are different so they definitely can be but they don’t have to be.
20717,"Sometimes, yes.

I want to be a professional boxer, martial artist, or police when I’m older. 

I love MMA, BJJ, Boxing and Muay Thai. I love it and dedicate 5 hours a week to it (just not now cause Corona)

My parents don’t want me to be a fighter and say it’s too dangerous.

My dad wants me to go into business, which I’m not interested in.

I probably won’t end up being a boxer in the future, so might as well work for my dad’s company when I’m older. 

It sucks but that’s probably what’s going to happen if I’m being realistic :("
20718,Wow you sound like a mix of my best friend and I! I believe in you. Please don’t let obstacles tear you down!
20719,Thank you :)
20720,"Ah that sucks but as I've said if your mum gives you other things to aim for such as being an aeronautical engineer (so you're working with planes) maybe not in the military I think it's not so bad. But just being like ""no you can't do that"" I think is very demoralising for a child."

20731,YAY SOMEONE ELSE HAS TRIED IT!

20756,I mean yeah... we cant control when the egg goes through the cycle and it's often off like I'm prepared if it comes 2 weeks early or 2 weeks late... and shit thanks for reminding me. It can happen at any moment too; it can start during math class or you wake up at 2am with red stained sheets (both happened to me).... So ye.
20757,Ok but please describe it as this from now on
20758,Sometimes you can be at school walking around minding your own business when Satan decides to mess with you by making you bleed during lunch when the line to the girl’s bathroom is ridiculously long.
20759,I mean sorta.
20760,I’m lucky because that usually doesn’t happen to me. Thank you for your mercy Satan
20761,I don’t like this description
20762,Yes. Especially when you stand up after laying/sitting down for a while. Waterfalls.
20763,I wish I was more intune with the moon. All I have is morning wood intune with the sun
20764,No problem 😉
20765,Si. Every 28 days
20766,"Clits get lil boner when they’re aroused, and a lot of girls are aroused when they wake up"

20768,yes but i doubt a vampire would feast upon my uterus’ dead leftovers
20769,Username checks out
20770,Something like that. It's starts off like a tiny stream then evolves into a river for the next couple of days and backs back off into a stream until it eventually dies out.
20771,r/beeteljuicing
20772,Same
20773,Lmao I think girls might also have their version of morning wood too
20774,"yes, blood flow increased to the clit when someone w a vagina is turned on, leading to it getting bigger. In the womb, the clit grows and turns into a penis, so biology wise it actually makes sense. the vagina also expands(it’s called tenting) to make room for something to penetrate it. pro tip: don’t ever tell anyone “your vagina is so tight” as a compliment to then bc all you’re doing is insulting yourself bc you can’t turn them on"
20775,I mean... when I was like 12 I woke up in a pool of blood and my sheets were completely soaked so yeah...something like that.
20776,Some people chose to sell their souls to satan in exchange for being beautiful and some kept their souls. And that’s how gender was made.
20777,Yes. Sometimes you can catch it in time..other times you are not as lucky.
20778,"Yeah pretty much, although i often get cramping a day or two before as a “warning”"
20779,Wait what?
20780,Oh....
20781,Yep.
20782,"I mean, it's not lien you're chilling one second and then the floodgates just...open. It's usually just a gradual, icky, dripping feeling. Kind of like how guys get that drop of piss in their underwear no matter how much they shake off their dick, only it keeps happening. If you're lucky, you can tell it's going to happen a couple days in advance because of PMS symptoms. Or, you'll just be wiping normally after going to the bathroom and there'll be a bit of red, so you'll know it's starting up without the icky dripping and potential to ruin your underwear. Also something a bit taboo that girls don't really like to talk about: a couple days before your period starts, a lot of people start smelling a bit... different...down there... Not bad, just different.

Of course, it also depends on how heavy your flow is (how much and how fast you bleed). If you have a really heavy flow and get unlucky, you may wake up to a Japanese flag in your sheets."
20783,i mean that’s pretty fucking accurate. i mean it just sux that’s all u should know
20784,I hate how accurate this sounds
20785,Yeah but like you feel like your getting stabbed before the blood flows.
20786,I can 100% guarantee this will work
20787,Hopefully the girl has a heart and will give you a chance. Just when you get alone time with her just be like “hey if you’re ever interested would you maybe want to go out sometime?” And if you’re lucky which I bet you will be she’ll say yes.
20788,"From a guy I whould say to wait until you lose more weight to have a better chance.

I have no idea how much 200pounds are or 15pound but it sounds like a lot.

Lose the weight,she will see the progress and when she will compare that to the ""fat""you she will be amazed,good luck!"

20817,Yeah this is prolly the main reason. You just don’t wanna be another drop of water in the bucket lol
20818,[deleted]
20819,What if I were popular tho
20820,you can’t date bots /s
20821,Popular and better are all concepts that are made up in this case. Words you give value to for seemingly unknown reasons. I'm sure you have allot to offer and comparing yourself to others is not going to help that. If you have a crush on someone go for it man.
20822,Aristotle been real quiet since you said this 😫😫😂😂 nah jk thank you for the advice
20823,same a lot of them ( popular boys ) just aren’t that interesting but the popular girls are so gorg
20824,Cool
20825,Yes indeed
20826,are you 2 like e-dating or something
20827,Agreed
20828,"Eh I wouldn't really recommend thinking that way. I am ""popular"" by your definition but the last people I would want to date are my followers lol"
20829,"I wouldn't say ""not good enough"", but defenetly not interested"
20830,"Lmaoooo, no problem my guy. Take care."
20831,i currently have a massive crush on a somewhat popular guy in my class. he’s known to be super extroverted and always causing hilarious chaos in the classrooms yet he doesn’t seem to use social media as much (less followers/no posts etc) and theres me who has 0 social skills and a low social media profile. honestly i don’t really mind it with his status but i agree 100% with OP’s opinion. someone who has a super high social platform is no go for me lol it’s best not to waste your time
20832,"Don't chase. Talk to her and let her come to you. If she doesn't, she isn't good enough for you."
20833,"Its not really like that. I mean if you can then try to talk to the girl you like as much as possible, get to know her. Most of the times it isn't about the looks, it is more about your personality. And if the girl is falling for you over your looks then the chances of you being in a long term relationship are low. So my advice would be to get to know her and just be yourself. If she doesn't fall for you, no problems, you can always get someone else and don't feel disappointed kf you don't get one in the first try. It is a game of pure chances where it only depends on the chance of a double coincidence where both the boy and the girl like each other. But that's the beauty of it. Meeting new people, and potentially finding someone who likes you back. Noone really is out of anyone's league, anyone can fall for anyone. Its just a matter of timing, personality and how both people feel like when they're with each other.

So slide into her DMs, talk with her if possible, and see if she matches with you. Because getting a girlfriend who just looks hot but is toxic isn't a good thing as the relationship is very volatile in that case. So talk to her, get to know her, make friends with her, and then think about making a move follow your gut in this case."
20834,Why's that?
20835,"yeah, I do that too."
20836,"Yeah, always. I don't even bother trying if they're like popular or anything."
20837,Really depends... if im crushing on her from online yeah I’ll give up but if I’m in person I would go for it lol
20838,I don’t chase but I don’t care how many followers you got if I know you irl i’m shooting my shot. If you never talked to them irl then don’t hit them up bruh your gonna look funny.
20839,"Do it anyways!!! I was I'm the same boat, decided to send it. She's my gf :)"
20840,They like me for superficial reasons
20841,LOL
20842,Yes. I’m more inclined to not chase bait people
20843,"Same, Gold Rush by Taylor Swift moment😩"
20844,"I've had 10 crushes and only one was popular, but all that did was stop me from asking her out. However, I became great friends with her."
20845,"Chances are, they do have better options than you."
20846,when they just like stand in your doorway or walk over to your desk and start looking at your things oh em gee
20847,This is so relatable
20848,"yeah i hate them being in my room, the energy is just not nice"
20849,me explained in a post:
20850,My parents only come to my room if it’s bad news or I’m in trouble so yeah when they come in and do nothing then leave again its always a relief.
20851,"Yes, so I can go back to fapping."
20852,My bigest fear is them seeing the hentai i draw
20853,More like when my family leaves the house bc my room is small af and I'd like to move around without anyone seeing or hearing me
20854,yessss lmao I always feel like I need to hide what I’m doing
20855,"Yes, it’s just so uncomfortable and I don’t know why"
20856,"Super relatable, but add verbally abuse to the after lecture part for me"
20857,very so i can continue texting my guy friends without her intruding .-.
20858,"Yeah. Like please, just respect my privacy for one godsdamn second."
20859,You guys are actually allowed in your room during the day?! I'm not even allowed upstairs without being yelled at or asked where tf im going...:(
20860,especially when you can notice them trying to glance at your phone/electronic device
20861,I don't have an issue with it

20867,"I feel for you bro, if I drew hentai and my parents found out they would bury me alive"
20868,not what i meant but get it i guess 🤨😏
20869,yeah. my room is my space and i dont like people being in here too much
20870,"i'm not exactly against them being in the room (if anything, i sometimes enjoy showing off the shit i make in games like minecraft or terraria), but it's more so a privacy thing. i don't like them snooping in on my voice chats, like they sometimes do, so that's about where i draw the line."
20871,I feel the same. I feel strange just typing on my computer or something when my mom is in my room because I don't like explaining whatever I'm doing.

20906,">I love wearing them even if its blazing hot outside.

Umm ... how are you still alive. 

Sincerely: someone who overheats easily"
20907,I have 4 hoodies from my ex lmao. They fit nicely to him but to me they are oversized af but I prefer them this way. I think it looks more cute (and people that are insecure abt their body can hide it)
20908,"Like somebody once said, they're the nonbinary way to hiding my shameful body (so of course I wear them literally 24/7/365)"
20909,I just roll up my sleeves and stand in the shade or something
20910,I'd wear a hoodie to my own funeral
20911,"oh nonono, I'm not calling your body shameful, I'm only talking about mine,"
20912,I think they look pretty cool tbh
20913,"i do the same lol (half of mine are insulated or some shit idk how I don't get hot, I have about 15 hoodies btw)"
20914,"Look at this duuudde, looking at herself IN A HEALTHY WAY."
20915,Not as cool as you 👉😎👉
20916,ur body is incredible shut up 😡
20917,"I probably wouldn't call my body shamefull, but ehh you do you"
20918,Ill wear a hoodie at ur funeral too so u dont feel lonely
20919,"I have three right now, a grey one from Richer Poorer, a school one, and a black one from WTAPS. I like them for comfort but they are kinda boring and hard to layer."
20920,I feel like wearing a hoodie (especially the ones with the big pocket in the middle) can make u come across as insecure as it encourages u to just hide ur hands away and look a lil bit awkward (speaking from experience btw as I used to do exactly that and only noticed when I saw someone else doing it). They're great at home tho or a cold day under a coat. Wearing them under a gilet or something like that can look very fashionable aswell. I've found sweatshirt/jumpers to be alot more suitable for going out.
20921,Oh I still keep my hoodie on even if I'm sweating bullets
20922,"I love hoodies and I wear them wherever I want, idc. I have like 8."
20923,Did you not see their username? they just gonna turn that around and deflect it
20924,I'm not really a huge fan. I barely ever wear them.
20925,Hoodies are 🥰 I love them
20926,They are all I wear
20927,I think the same way :'
20928,"Yes, they are cute. Really cute!"
20929,A true bro
20930,"No fuck off, I'm hot as fuck 😤😤😤"
20931,"It used to be like I was insecure about my body, but now I'm just too lazy to take it off (if it's like 100 Fahrenheit or above though I probably will, but it never get that hot where I live)"
20932,"I like them and wear them a lot

And no time is a bad time to wear a hoodie"
20933,I love them and the fact that they’re baggy. I buy them oversized because I can make a cute outfit with them but also be very comfortable.
20934,I've never heard about daily paper. What makes them so special?
20935,They’re comfy I guess? I like the hood?
20936,"Yeah I share too, but it's big enough we kinda have our own space. My sister is little neater than me, but as long as my stuff stays on my side she doesn't complain"
20937,Lol my brother moves my shit around every single time and its so annoying so I've given up trying to keep my room tidy.
20938,Is it possible to learn this power?
20939,Hehe no
20940,No beat down when he moves your stuff??!?
20941,"Sometimes lol but mostly no, I leave it alone"
20942,not really i’m a pretty messy person
20943,I like to do lists. But being organized doesn't extend past that.
20944,"Actually no, I'm organised with more lists and stuff. My room is a tip."
20945,Ig lil bit but i pretty much mess it up after few days but when i'm cooking food then I'M A NEAT AND VERY ORGANIZED PERSON.
20946,I’ll clean up every once in a while but it doesn’t stay organized and I’ve pretty much accepted that lmao
20947,Yes! I am a complete neat freak!
20948,"Very.

Or my mom gets mad (she's a healthcare worker and  she doesn't allow dirty shit)"
20949,🥰🥰
20950,Do you try?
20951,💙
20952,Is your room clean too?
20953,So how many lists do you have and how do you decide which stuff goes on which list?
20954,"Mostly about school. I like to keep track of when stuff is coming up. That test next Friday? I'm putting it on my list so I have the important stuff all in one place in front of me. Usually separated by class.

Also if we are traveling I'll have a list of stuff to pack so I don't forget"
20955,"I wanna have the right swim suits, right day and evening clothing, etc. Can't just wear 1 pair of cargo shorts all week lol"
20956, Not at all. I always want to be organised but I get too tired or have too much schoolwork to do
20957,I try not to have dirty stuff like plates or bowls. Mostly clothes on the floor.
20958,"Ah, a man of culture"
20959,"Oh yeah I don't have a single folder, just dump it straight into documents"
20960,"I make an effort, but not as often as I'd like to. It's hard to keep things neat when your unmotivated, so when Im in the mood I do a great job; like organise my clothes in rainbow order or re-fold my clothes. It makes me happy for a few days before it ascends into chaos and I'm not bothered to recover the mess."
20961,Lol
20962,I just throw a lot of stuff in a bag and hope that I have everything I need for the trip :) what exactly do people take along? Fun fact:- I once took 1 flip-flop along with me for a 4 day trip....just one :)) the other one stayed at home
20963,Yes
20964,nope
20965,"I'm the definition of messy, I lose something almost everyday"
20966,My entire life I've wrapped myself around like a worm under the covers

20973,"*hides that's its 3am here* 

Totally yea I'm not allowed either"
20974,It always stuffy under the covers I try to but can't for longer than 20 mins
20975,"no if my parents come in 😃🔫

plus i’m not allowed to have my phone in my room from whenever i sleep until 9am"
20976,And your sure your 16?
20977,Jokes on you my pc can sit on my lap if I try hard enough
20978,I do that at night a lot so my mom will think I’m asleep lmao
20979,I feel that
20980,"Nah lol i use my laptop on my bed so I can watch YT and twitch and stuff but bigger

Also type faster ig"
20981,"like once a year lmao. i always go on my phone above the covers, ya feel."
20982,Never
20983,"Well, I can, or could, but only once"
20984,Not under the covers
20985,No it's too hot under my covers
20986,Haha no. I can't stand feeling my own breathe bounce back on me. Because of this I never sleep facing the wall or on my stomach most of the time.
20987,I like doing it but after a few minutes I feel like I'm drowning and the air pocket I'm in gets uncomfortably warm
20988,Can you sit on your laptops lap tho?
20989,"Dam, now that's some power"
20990,"Depends on how you sit, i think. Would you consider it sitting on someones lap, if there was a pillow?
If yes, then ya might have found a new seat here!
If no, you're correct and I'm emberassing myself lmao"
20991,I now feel obligated to try it
20992,For science! You're a felllw nerd after all
20993,"My experiments have been carried out

My laptop is, in fact, a fairly comfortable seat"
20994,Impressive! Now that we have this info.. is it also possible to use it as a seat multiple times?
20995,"Unfortunately, the seat seems like it may only be used 3-4 times before it becomes uncomfortable"
20996,"Here's the meaning:

lol: help


lmao: me


haha: im


ahah: in


hehe: pain"
20997,"Ahah is not really a thing unless it's a bit longer, it's considered an evil laugh among my friends and we often do it as a joke, hehehe is when you did something flirty or sexual."
20998,"lol and lmao are just stuff you say when you have nothing else to say, haha is more awkward in my opinion but it's more natural too so I use it more. ahah is just weird"
20999,it's more devious or mischevious imo like it doesn't fit everywhere like haha
21000,From canada and i exclusively use ahaha because i find hahaha too fake for some reason??? idk i just think it looks better lol. (i will also keyboard smash a lot like this fkdkhsjsjd)
21001,What about “hehe”
21002,"It is where I live, people use it a lot!! 

Yes hehe is flirty"
21003,Lol 😂
21004,no seriously send he-
21005,I always use either heh or heheh purely because I refuse to use the others.
21006,Yeah true haha. It’s kinda flirty sometimes too
21007,"I just use ""lmao"" and ""lol"" after every sentence, I idk y, even it's not funny or wtv I just them lmao

I rarely use haha or ahah it just feels weird it's the same thing as saying ""lmao""

Hehe is kinda weird idk. I haven't used it or seen it many times"
21008,Oh why
21009,Yeah I use ahaha more than hahah
21010,"lol - something I add when I wanna come off as friendly or when I don't know what to say 

lmao - when I'm annoyed?? occasionally when something is actually funny 

haha - when I'm being polite but awkward 

ahah - when I'm being polite but it's funny 

hehe - when I'm michael jackson"

lmao-due to laughing, you lose your ass

haha-just casual laugh

ahah-hgual lausac tsuj OR you had an asthma attack before you laughed

Your getting mugged? You don’t have to worry about the knife. Active shooter? You can afford to take a bullet. 

Even for more daily things: Burned yourself? Forget about it. Broke a bone? Give it a day or two. Accidentally cut yourself? Go take a nap."
21088,Imma teleport myself into the sun ☀️
21089,Shape shifting is a kewl power and it's definitely not because I want to turn myself into a cat girl.
21090,"Yeah, but how would it work?

I thought cancer originates from your body always trying to regenerate"
21091,"I don’t know. How does telekinesis work? This is hypothetical.

In reality, somebody with increased regeneration would be at high risk for cancer."
21092,"from what I understand, no.

Telekinesis is more of controlling objects with your mind, while telepathy is of reading minds"
21093,Telekinesis is the right answer
21094,Make foreskin into a cocoon and then you may sleep well
21095,"It also lets you do every other power

^def ^don't ^want ^to ^be ^cat ^boy"
21096,r/cursedcomments
21097,Cat Bois do be cute tho
21098,Why not just Omnipotency?
21099,smart thinking 🧐🧐
21100,You just brutally murdered that man
21101,Teleportation so I can see my girl every night
21102,"If I shapeshift into an animal, do I get the same strength as that animal?"
21103,Invisibility so I can steal AirPods
21104,Is that the same as telepathy?
21105,"Bruh, I could shapeshift my hand into a big titty Goth gf, shapeshift her so she's only still attached to my hand on a very small point of contact, carefully disconnect her, and boom, universe has been hacked and I gave myself God mode."
21106,Why AirPods specifically lol
21107,"Shapeshifting is better than regeneration

injured because your bone is broken? Shapeshift into yourself without the broken bone

Got a deep cut on your arm? Shapeshift into yourself without that cut

It can cure cancer, disease, and even sunburn"
21108,awesome
21109,i wanna shapeshift into a man please
21110,Because who wouldn’t choose that
21111,"yes, of course"
21112,"Well I can see how most of the other ones would work, like telekinesis would be an ability to read subtle brain waves, teleportation would be deconstructing and reconstructing yourself, etc.

But regeneration is the only one with real world examples of it not working, and the only way I can see it work is if it can just reform yourself to a previous state, which means either literal invincibility, or cancer.

I think the options of never dying and immediate death are equally as bad"
21113,"1) Make the super regeneration a conscious process rather than a passive one and it solves the cancer process, more or less
2) Telekinesis means lifting stuff with your brain, not mind reading"
21114,Shape shift into a teleporter
21115,Damn right
21116,😔😔
21117,shit sucks  😔  😔
21118,The redesign is actually kinda cool ngl
21119,"Same, and it also makes them make more sense with the piglins."
21120,I don’t engage with minecraft anymore but I think those are kind of cute
21121,LMAO I LOVE THIS
21122,im devastated
21123,I’m still gonna call them pigmen
21124,"they were my favorite mob 😔

it’s actually so sad that they lowkey got ruined"
21125,They could've atleast had an option for veterans to download a resource pack or something to revert them back to the old model. Man I miss them
21126,Just wait till you see a baby Strider then .
21127,It makes more sense tbh but I’m still sad lol i dislike change
21128,"NO

not a fan"
21129,God why don't I have a fucking award to give away
21130,Dude I’m fuckin devastated. My friends and I found a stray pigman outside of our portal and put him in a boat and named him Charles. He is dead now because of the nether update
21131,F
21132,Eh the old ones were nostalgic but imo the new ones look better
21133,Whyyyy. There’s no reason to do that.
21134,"D,:

Shoutouts to zombie pigmen, keeping it real since 1.2.0

You will be missed"
21135,"RIP Charles

He will be missed."
21136,THERES ONLY ONE THATS WORSE
21137,Wtf is that monstrosity?!
21138,"The design I can get behind, but the fact there are now piglins and zombie piglins that act pretty much the same is a little weird"
21139,I don't like the new minecraft as much in general. There is just too much to keep up now...
21140,"I mean not really, it'd be way worse if the skull side had an ear"
21141,Doesn't programmer art change them?
21142,"I never played Minecraft before yesterday, so I'm not sure what to think."
21143,Eh I'm alright with it and Minecrafts not my favourite
21144,*ear
21145,You can still have one if you had one for example in your oveworld and then you updated
21146,"•I once peed on my dad's leg at a bowling alley

•Begged my dad to let me drive my sister's brand new car, immediately almost hit a parked car (thank GOD he was in the front seat, he pulled the parking break)

•Vomited and pooped myself while sick (once when I was little, once when I was...not) 

•Peed myself as my mom pulled into a Sam's Club (so I could use the bathroom, I'd had a full bladder almost 2 hours)

•Cursed in front of my mom and sisters

There's probably more I'm forgetting tbh :/"
21147,"No offense, but if a guy gets pissed at your for not sending shit... Drop them like the sack they are..."

21150,"Wrote ""trans rights"" on the board while the rest of the class was at lunch. Didn't notice the teacher was still in the room. She saw."
21151,F
21152,...sounds like that was the right time tbh
21153,Happy cake day to you too :)
21154,I had an ear infection so I could barely hear anything and on top of that I had an earbud in that had music on almost full volume so when she asked me a question I could barely hear so I thought she said “do you have someone to sit with at lunch” and I said no and a minute after she walked away I realized she said “do you want to sit with me at lunch.” Felt like a dumbass.

21156,"I took my foster greyhound for a walk to the beach by myself. I decided I'd do a loop and once I got about 10 minutes away from being home, she froze up. I tried to walk back the way we came with her but she froze up that way too. I had to sit down with her for a while and call my dad to pick us up."
21157,"Me and my bf were sending nudes today. He asked for a vid of me jerking off, I did this vid and when I tried to send it, it didn't work. Meanwhile I was deleting stuff from my gallery cuz it was full. But I acidentally deleted the nude and didn't find it in the trash can. So now my bf is pretty angry and I'm so stressed, bc he acted like it was my fault when actually it was totally by accident! 

Very annoyed. Atlest we had a good night. And I had to tell this to someone"
21158,"It has been two years 😀 I wanna do it at some point I just gotta find the right time :,)"
21159,F
21160,the teacher told us to write our names on a paper and prop it up because she wanted to “attach our names to our faces”. i thought it would be funny to stick a post it note with my name on my face. she didn’t.
21161,"Tbh, reevaluate that whole situation. No guy should get mad at you for not sending. No guy that deserves your pics anyway. Tell him to cut the hiss fit out."
21162,I see no problem here
21163,I third this
21164,I performed in a school musical and afterwards as everyone was leaving everyone was telling people “well done” and I said it to all the cast and then my headteacher went to me “well done” and I went “you too”
21165,How’d you pee on your dad’s leg? 🤔
21166,Lol once I had 2 guys saved on my phone w/ the same name and I told the wrong one I liked him.
21167,F
21168,How?????
21169,"I was (3?4?) and I really had to pee, but we were bowling. I think I said something, but I was too scared to insist, about going to the bathroom, but we kept going. My dad put me in his lap while my mom bowled and I peed EVERYWHERE-myself, the floor, him. We got some towels from somewhere and cleaned it up, and I think I had on two outfits for some reason, so my mom switched them. I'm pretty sure we left and my dad just had to keep wearing the pants until we got home. To this day, I have no idea how they had three kids after me because JEEZ I wasn't bright sometimes."
21170,How is that a fuck up?
21171,Ah F bro
21172,"Eh idk I kinda couldn’t cuz I would wanna do it just between the two of us and not in front like any friends. That’s what I mean by right moment but you’re lowkey right :,("

21176,"honestly, i would be a little self-conscious to think my boyfriend also thinks random guys on the street are cute. but i wouldn't not date someone i liked just because they were bi. i also wouldn't think they'd be more likely to cheat cus i don't think it works like that."
21177,so we could gush over boys together lol and uhhhh ^pegging
21178,I prefer bi boys ahaha
21179,not at all
21180,Could you explain why? Just want to know
21181,Couldn't the same be true of random girls on the street as well even if they were straight?
21182,Not at all. I’m a bi girl so it wouldn’t make much sense lol
21183,Nope. I would treat it as a normal relationship.
21184,bruh
21185,"I don't think that's even a bi thing tho. I've heard of straight guys that like anal stimulation as long as they're doin it themselves or with a girl..

I mean the biology down there is the same, if gay men feel pleasure by stimulating the prostate gland through the anus, I don't see why straight men won't. It's just that not a lotta straight dudes would really go in that direction lol"
21186,"No, as long as we are in a happy/healthy relationship that's all I care about."
21187,First girl that knows what pegging is (and I guess wouldn't mind doing). Hi
21188,Oh so you're bipedal?
21189,no why the hell would it
21190,"not at all! i’d actually love to date a bisexual guy i think i’d feel a lot more comfortable dating someone who’s also bisexual as they’d be a lot more accepting and understanding of what being bisexual is, and also less likely to sexualize it and make it into a weird fetish thing and they would actually see it as a valid sexuality."
21191,"No. Unless he acts traditionally ""feminine"""
21192,I think this is just a type-thingy and she doesn't find feminine boys as attractive as masculine boys.
21193,She's homophobic and doesn't want them to date men /s
21194,"exactly. Straight dudes take notes. 'tis time to get fucked....***anally***.

^no ^homo ^tho.

And I mean it. It's not homo to explore your body and see what you like. It's not like you're suddenly gonna start liking dudes just cus you shoved a finger up your arse lol"
21195,"yea, I'm aware of that. It's just that pretty much all bi men are into it which makes it easier for me and, yea, most straight dudes really wouldn't be into it."
21196,Nope not at all. I’d love dating one ngl
21197,"No. I'm probably not straight either and even if I was I wouldn't mind. And no, he's not more likely to cheat, that's ridiculous"
21198,"Interested in hearing why you think this, if you don't mind obv"
21199,What do you mean by this?
21200,"Take my upvote, and get out."
21201,bi guys are attractive to me but i know a lot of girls who are disgusted by the idea of it
21202,Im bi myself so no it doesnt put me off
21203,"No, I'd be a hypocrite if it bothered me, I'm also Bisexual, so it wouldn't bother me at all."
21204,Ah shit you got me
21205,"Fair enough, but if it's a guy dating you then they aren't really showing a 'gay' side are they"
21206,Bruh. I wish I could attain this level someday.
21207,"If it makes you feel any better, I once said ""tree"" instead of ""three"" in maths."
21208,That's the spirit
21209,No i usually think “wow i wish i was that pretty” lol
21210,"If it makes you feel any better I regularly say tree instead of three.

Nothing like bringing back the forest."
21211,Cant say that’s ever happened to me before
21212,I’m pretty good socially and irl it’s online that I suck at.
21213,Why the fuck am I in your selfies folder?!?!?
21214,nah we always gotta shoot our shot
21215,My school is those people who’d be considered attractive and you wished you lived near em and it’s hella wack. No personality. Everybody is a mirror image of each other. And their whole meaning in life is party and drugs and if you screw up oh well I have daddy’s money to solve my problems
21216,I suck at both...
21217,"Even if you did have bad social skills, why would someone attractive being close to you be for the worse?"
21218,Just putting on your best Irish accent aha
21219,y e s
21220,"If it makes you feel any better, I can’t say “three” and always say “tree” AND also sometimes pronounce “thirty” as “tiddy”. E v e r y other word is fine but fucking bet that whenever I’m around a new person, the first thing that my friends do is try to get me to say thirty three."
21221,"My social skills being compared to a loaf of bread is an insult to all bread

It's probably the main reason I stay away from instagram, all the people post 10/10 photos of themselves and sets an unrealistic world view and fucks with my standards

Then again that's just me"
21222,But what if said person is a baker?
21223,"I usually wish i looked like them, especially women, even if they're ugly women, at least they look like women"
21224,No?
21225,No because the only attractive person I know lives in my area already
21226,"No. Obviously I'm like the hottest guy in my school. Easily 12/10

^/s"
21227,Same.
21228,All the time
21229,"Talk about yourself , my social skills are good but no one good looking talks to me xD"
21230,Not really
21231,"yes, yes, yes, and yes."
21232,"I legit told an online friend of mine that I would not have to courage to go up and talk to her if I were to meet her irl for the first time lol, but the girl's stupid. She's so pretty, and yet she does not see herself that way"
21233,I just scroll through my snapchat memories :)
21234,every day
21235,"I have the social skills of a loaf of bread, and extremely attractive people already live near me (South Florida)"
21236,Yeah and its kinda annoying
21237,"yeah, not too often tho

~~I lowkey am tho~~"
21238,yea ig.. i’m 13 so it’s not like it’s not true
21239,"Lmao people think I’m a goody goody two shoes while that is true, I’m not afraid to be bad either!"
21240,Yupp. People who know me will tell you differently lmao
21241,From real though...I’m pretty wild and I start acting up once I’m in a comfortable position and circumstance!
21242,Lmao yeah. And parents seem to really love me. They think I’m such a great influence...heh
21243,Sometimes
21244,No people tell me I look 18 lol
21245,"Always. 

And then they get to know me."
21246,Yes.
21247,Lmao yeah I mean you have to show respect towards the parents otherwise they won’t allow their kids to be with you! It’s funny when my friends tell me their parents think highly of me when my parents be disappointed and unsatisfied with me!
21248,"Lmao same! I lost my sweet sweet innocence years ago thanks to unfiltered internet access and ever since then, I’ve been a freaky cat!"
21249,Yes. Because I look like a 14 year old.
21250,yeah in middle school bc i was Really quiet and didnt talk much. once in class i cursed and the girl next to me was surprised bcjhdbf but now im more confident and open so not really anymore
21251,"yeah, i hav glasses and braces so everyone says i look cUtE and iNnoCeNt smh. so i cut a bunch of my hair off, dyed it purple, started dressing different and got a nose ring to make myself look a bit less ✨childlike✨"
21252,"Yeah especially cuz I'm the goody-goody smart girl who's a teacher's pet, but I'm very much not innocent. However, I don't think I've ever shown anyone my true unfiltered ""wild""/dirty side. Lmao everyone would be so surprised what really goes on in my mind"
21253,"yeah, all the time because i’m quiet and soft spoken so people get really surprises when i start
to talk to them"
21254,"99% of the people I’ve known assumed I was innocent and didn’t really know anything, probably because I don’t curse and look like a 12 year lmao. Some people who know every part of me still think I’m innocent so maybe it’s a little true, but definitely not completely true. I know the basics like everyone else does"
21255,Yeah
21256,"yeah, i look pretty young and i’m also short"
21257,"Yes aha, all the time. They’re wrong✨"
21258,Not really anymore. Mostly cause I changed how I dress
21259,"All the time

But tbh, I am kinda innocent. Lol, I would like to think so at least"
21260,"This!! I felt this lol and people keep saying that I am so sweet and nice when in reality, I am most definitely not, lmao. You just haven't see the real me yet"
21261,Yeah
21262,"Oh definitely. I think my classmates and school in general would be shocked of they learnt about my sexual endeavors.

People assume I am way more innocent than I am."
21263,All the time. Ooohhh boy they are wrong.
21264,All the time and it just makes everyone more shocked if I swear or something
21265,Yups
21266,Your exactly right I don't understand why people are so evil and I feel you I rlly hate all of the shitty circumstances but there's not much we can do
21267,"I'm a tiny, insignificant mortal man, what can I even do to fix these sort of things?"
21268,Try to not get mad over stuff you can not influence. Analise the situation and try to get the best results out of it. It sound like boomer advice but it really helped me.
21269,"I just ignore it all because I don't have the power to change that shit. Instead I focus on the things I can change and improve, and do my best to do so."
21270,"If you’re tired of all these things, actually do something to fight them. Don’t be a slacktivist"

21272,[deleted]
21273,"I hate it. I work in a pub and I therefore have to work some very late shifts, like ending at midnight and stuff. I also go and see my girlfriend, and I have to take public transport home which takes 3 hours, so leaving at 8pm gets me home at 11pm. 

This means I walk behind girls at night. I’m a very fast Walker. I also wear blue jeans and a puffer jacket (UK, I look kinda suspicious), and I notice that girls I walk behind start to walk faster if they look back, or suddenly pick up their phone. 

I have to cross the street to overtake them, and then cross back over when I’m far enough ahead. I absolutely hate it. There is one person in my life who I would hurt willingly in a negative way, and that woman has abused me for the last 8 years. My girlfriend wants me to slap her face during sex, and I struggle to do that. I could never hurt another person in any way, it hurts me inside, it leaves me genuinely sad and upset, and it’s a horrible thing to do. 

I just wish I could shout “I’m not going to hurt you, I’m just a fast walker”. But the fact I have to even think about that in the first place is absolutely disgusting. I hate men who abuse and sexually assault and everything. It ruins lives for the rest of us. It makes it nigh on impossible for us to just enjoy a night out. It makes it incredibly difficult for us to approach women we find attractive and want to get to know. It’s a self perpetuating cycle. 

Women don’t trust us, because they’re paranoid we’re going to hurt them. 80% of us won’t, hell, I’ll go so far as to say probably 90-95% of us won’t. But it‘s that 5-20% who make the rest of us look like shit."
21274,You would make great friends with Diogenes the Cynic
21275,"I understand so much about life sucks, and it's so easy to jump to the negatives about everything but it helps to think about the positives a little. In no way am I saying the government and laws are great but you've got to appreciate that the laws are doing quite a lot of good. Without both those things, you'd fear for your life every single day.

Once you've calmed down a little It's always quite good to take a step back and view things as a whole. Imo it helps me appreciate everything in my life and not take things for granted. It might help to imagine what life would be like if we didn't have such laws, government, capitalism. (poor country run by dictatorship, restricted access to Internet e.g perhaps?) 

As with the others things like societal norms, yeah those suck ass I 100% agree with you. Fuck those."
21276,"I don't even seek out news about the world, it is just forced upon me, everywhere I go I just see more fucked up shit and more news about how the world is fucked."
21277,"Yeah, it's just all bad, I just ignore it if it comes in front of me tbh, rn I need to worry about my future, I dont really have the energy to think about all the stuff that are wrong in the world at this point"
21278,"You can do alot of stuff to help, won't be highly impactful but would be great in the long run"
21279,"Yeah it’s exactly what the other guy said. I try not to get mad over things that most likely I can’t control. I can see how fucked this world is and I’ve almost kind of, given up. Sounds dumb and reckless and maybe a little selfish but it’s pretty much my solution. You can’t get upset or disappointed at the world when you’ve already given up on it"
21280,"What a shit take.

The general sentiment of “don’t get too worked up about things you can’t change” is fair enough, but saying not to care about “things that don’t affect them”? And then going on to say “you can feel empathy” and immediately after saying “just forget about it”- that’s a literal oxymoron. 

The only way things like this change are if people talk about it, and if people bring attention to it. What you’re suggesting would be eliminating this discussion, because it makes people unhappy. 

“But there is literally nothing I can do”- Not true, as discussed earlier just talking about an issue and bringing into the discussion and the limelight can cause social change, either by toxic attitudes changing or governmental changes sparked by a shift in attitudes. Not to mention voting of course, which will make a great difference once you can legally do it. 

The last sentence is possibly the worst part of this comment- “just relax and accept that’s how the world works”? Is that a joke? According to that logic we will *never* bother to progress society, because society is what it is, and there’s no point changing what is."
21281,I get that but lately I feel like I can't state my own opinion. I usually then get frustrated with myself and everything around me and sometimes it's so freaking hard to deal with that feeling.
21282,Forgot to add communism
21283,"Im not a girl and this might be insensitive but I really don't care, I just don't think about it"
21284,"I also hate how feminism is seen as a political issue. Trying to get by every day by taking precaution so me and my friends don’t get assaulted isn’t political. It’s my fucking life. I want to be liberated and live my life without fear, and that desire is always made out to be political. I really hate it here, and I’m glad gen z is getting angry because I can’t live like this for the rest of my life"
21285,"I like to think about how far we've come. From total animals who'd be cannibals to stay alive to our society today with opportunities for education funded by the government so we can choose what career path we want to go down. We are animals after all, and it's quite nice that we've done all this and improved so much over the centuries. 

There's people in poor countries who'd do anything for an education and I'd feel horrible if I didn't take the time to appreciate what a lucky life I'm living."
21286,"Ah, but you see, many tiny insignificant mortal men can change the world"
21287,The man just wanted to rant
21288,"Government is required to not have anarchy, that one place in Seattle shows that ppl CANNOT govern themselves. So.......*Fuck the CURRENT government

School is also required to know how to do stuff but I think it should be less generalized."
21289,"honestly, theres this stereotype that ""feminists are ugly, and always angry""

first, like bish you ever seen Emma Watson? you ever seen me? ;)

second, ofc feminists and other social activists are angrier. we know whats going on. like ignorance is bliss an shit? well, that's really true.

anyone who cares, even a little bit, about how shit is going? will definitely be angrier. let gen z be the angrier generation. if it brings peace, if it brings equality, its worth it, dont you think?

let those assholes know that we arent the generation that gets offended by everything, we're the generation that dares to take a stand.

now, let me just go to some other sub. find me some assholic gen Zers and lose all hope"
21290,"I conclude that it has been worse and that we are actually making progress even if it's slow af. Like the world is much better and safer today compared to like 100 years ago. Sure it depends on the country but like in general human development, well being and equality have increased while poverty, inequality and crime has decreased. Several countries have managed to solve a majority of their worst issues and are actively taking steps to becoming better in varying speed."
21291,"i dont know how to change it so i just vibe and try to be nice to my friends and people in general

hopefully i can do more when i'm older but for now i'm just gonna watch the world burn while i practice anatomy"
21292,i think this all the time when i see gore/snuff/abuse/animal cruelty on the internet.
21293,"So for me personally, I am very sexualized but I don’t mind it too much, I’m just flattered. Everyone in my life sexualizes me (yes even my parents) and I have been sexually harassed. I’ve had an unwanted hand down my pants, countless people have lifted up my shirt, and a few more things. I’m not too phased by it though, it’s just kinda normal for me I guess and I just walk it off.

I also ask myself “what compels these people to do these things” and try to be as non-judgmental as I can, because you never know what’s happened to someone or what they’ve gone through or even if they have a disability of some kind. 

So in short, I just deal with it and move on (this is a personal thing I’m not giving general advice)"
