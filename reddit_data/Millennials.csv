80,"Basically what the title says. I‚Äôm 36F and my first social media was of course MySpace, then Reddit (not this account haha) then Facebook and Instagram. 

Now I can‚Äôt stand Facebook and even Instagram is doing my head in. 

I‚Äôve come off Facebook and created another account so I can still access certain groups.

I can‚Äôt stand how fake our society is becoming and I don‚Äôt care what my sister or a girl I went to school with had for tea nor do I give a shit about elf on the fucking shelf. 

Am I alone in these thoughts!? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôà

EDIT TO ADD

Wow!! üòØ what a wonderful response. Thank you for your engagement. The comments have been a wonderful insight into the minds of others, which I love. Plus makes me know that I‚Äôm not alone in my dislike for SM these days. 

However these comments have also shown me why Reddit remains one of the places I do enjoy. Thanks for the awards too whomever they where from. Appreciate it!"

114,"My husband and I (both in our 30s) feel like we are being squeezed tighter and tighter financially as the days go by. We don't have children, would love to have them, but I do not see how we could possibly afford a child right now or if ever. We just signed a rent renewal with a $100/month increase, our health insurance premium shot up by around $400/month (with even LESS coverage), we're spending double if not triple on groceries than we were a few months ago, I have $32K in student loan debt, both of our vehicles take no less than $70 to fill up, and neither one of us have received any kind of raise in the past year. By the time our bills are paid (rent, power, internet, phones, groceries, car note, etc.) we have virtually ZERO money until next payday. We have to borrow money from our parents, which feels absolutely despicable.

I know our situation is not isolated, but a very typical one for people our age. What are any of us supposed to do about this? It makes me so angry and bitter to think how just a generation ago people were in a much better position than we are in now. I know I am preaching to the choir here, but I am feeling suffocated by our situation more and more every day. It depresses me to high heaven if I really sit and think about how criminally millennials have been treated and the hand we have been dealt. It makes me absolutely sick. No other group of people in the world have ever been financially screwed like American millennials have. We are all working 40+ hours per week and are still poor. We can't side hustle our way out of this. The only solution I can really see is to either move away from this piece of shit country or go off the grid.

Does anyone else feel as hopeless and stressed as I do?"

117,"I just turned old last weekend, and I‚Äôve been having what feels like a mid life crisis. 

I miss flip phones. I miss T9. I miss iPods. I miss rolling down windows. I miss just being stupid teens not having to worry about it ending up all over the world. 
I miss warped tour. Fuck I miss those pants from hot topic with the chains and loops all over them. I miss when malls were the place to be on a Friday. 

I honestly do miss blockbuster and Hollywood video. I miss when online games were only on computer, and you had to actually have someone come over to beat a 2 player game of the PS2. 

I miss staying out with all the neighborhood kids until the street lights came on doing whatever we wanted to do. 

Life was just easier. And I fucking miss it so bad. 

I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs already 2022. I‚Äôm not a fan of the future I tried so hard to get too. Adulting sucks and I wanna go back."

137,"I feel like I'm slowly losing my sanity. I don't need to explain the why's. We've all lived different variations of the same timeline (based on privilege). I am burnt out beyond belief. Nothing means anything anymore. 

I don't particularly care about worldly things. I don't care for a career (the lie). A fancy house (material things?). A car (more material things??). I wont be having children. To have kids you need resources, and I don't have those. Not to mention, have kids for what? so they can deal with climate change, and a failing economy, and work as a capitalist slave till the day they die, like me? After everything, the pandemic really was the cherry on the cake. I just want to stop. I want to wake up when I want to wake up and not when I need to start work. I want to be able to have time to cook. I want a small clean house I can decorate with things I made. I want to be able to sleep when I want. I want to be able to be outside during the day and enjoy the sun. Not be stuck infront of my computer screen all day, whiling away every precious second of the remainder of my youth. I want to grow plants and make friends and genuinely enjoy whatever few years I have left on this planet. What have we done? what is this ridiculous hell we've created for ourselves? 

I've done the depression cycle. I've done the therapy. I've been on the meds. I have a job that pays okay. I am miserable. The only happiness in my life is the 2 hours after work where I can just lay on my couch, get lit and watch trash TV. That's all I have energy for. The weekend is for recuperating from the week. Sunday is to brace for Monday. 

I started with dreams, and passion, and fire. I worked out 5 days a week, ate healthy meals, spent hours of my life working or studying. Didn't drink, didn't smoke, didn't do anything 'bad'...for this? This is the reward. No house. no car. no kids. no family. no future. Everyday I wish I wasn't smart. It's a curse to be smart in this day and age. I would have been a happier person If I wasn't...

I can't even take solace in my ignorance. I'm hyper aware of everything. Constantly consuming information that only reaffirms my thought processes. Everyone in power is either a complete moron or completely selfish and short sighted. 

This never stops. I don't stop. In the blink of an eye I'm going to be in my sixties, unable to retire, still working, wishing I could just pass away in my sleep - and that would be a kindness. God forbid I live past 60 and get to be a senior citizen in this system."

180,"I‚Äôm on the local chamber board and we hosted a member dinner last weekend. People were mostly sitting with other strangers and my table was no different, with the exception of my wife. Table talk was mostly cheesy, stale, fake laughter - you know‚Ä¶ networking. At one point this older real estate guy started talking serious shit about millennials. We don‚Äôt want to work, we live with our parents, we‚Äôre too entitled, and so on. I decided to ignore it but as he rambled on I looked around and realized‚Ä¶ he was the only non-millennial at the table!! All eight of us just silently stared at him for about 10 seconds and I think he had a mini-heart attack when he finally noticed. My wife very pointedly changed the topic and he stfu for the rest of the night, which was nice, but you could clearly tell he was mortified. 

Anyway, do these people even know who we are, or are they just on repeat with the same nonsense for eternity? I don‚Äôt necessarily let it bother me. We just don‚Äôt deserve it."

199,"The internet today has been noticeably bad for a few years. It‚Äôs kinda sad that the younger generations didn‚Äôt get to experience new and peak internet. 

I saw a post the other day about this website that will show you how many Reddit posts are removed by Mods, and not for doing anything wrong. Many of them have hundreds of upvotes and comments. I‚Äôve been considering leaving Reddit recently since it takes up a lot of my time and feels like it has become more toxic and negative. I really enjoyed traditional forums and they‚Äôve pretty much disappeared. There‚Äôs 4Chan, but‚Ä¶ 4Chan. 

So much of the internet has been ruined by algorithms. You never find any new content anymore. Nothing creative or original. YouTube used to be about creativity but now it‚Äôs overwhelmingly monetized. If you watch some videos on a topic that‚Äôs the only topic YouTube will start showing you on your feed so it‚Äôs hard to find anything new. 

Search engine optimization has ruined google. Trying to find anything is exhausting now. Need a new vacuum cleaner? You can‚Äôt find real recommendations anymore. It‚Äôs just an endless scroll of paid sites with the same bs list redirecting to Amazon products. I started appending ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù to my searches a couple years ago just to see real reviews and recommendations and even that‚Äôs getting bad now. 

A year ago I remember seeing some article about how Gen Z doesn‚Äôt use google to search and instead searches on Instagram and TikTok. That was absurd to me at the time. Like ‚ÄúReally? These younger Gen Zs and Gen Alphas don‚Äôt know how to use google?‚Äù That‚Äôs basically how the article framed it. But now I do it. Yesterday I needed to know how to take apart an appliance and after a frustrating five minute search on google I just went to TikTok and found what I needed in 30 seconds in a fast, to the point video. 

I just miss the old internet. It wasn‚Äôt addictive like it can be today. There was only so much to see at a time. But it was a wide world out there with weird and interesting websites to come across. MySpace was customizable. There was more knowledge sharing on forums. You weren‚Äôt siloed by algorithms. There was more creativity. There was more anonymity. You didn‚Äôt need companies having all of your data to participate. 

I kinda want to disengage from it all because I feel like the new internet has stolen a lot of my focus and ability to do other things I wish I had the motivation to do like read, learn languages, learn programming, etc. But it‚Äôs so pervasive now you can‚Äôt completely disengage. To do most things you need the ability to look up how to do things or access resources. So idk. I just hate it. I feel like we‚Äôve been on the decline of the internet for a while now and it will never be how it was, but I miss it."

203,"The 90's was the peak of western civilization according to 1999 documentary, The Matrix. The period between the end of the cold war and 911 at it's time was called The End Of History as The West was now in control of the entire world order with no competition, and truly believed they had solved all the world's problems and things could only get better. This lead to an explosion of global trade and the highest standard of living working people had and still have ever seen. Race and religious tensions were at a low point (compared to earlier and later decades) and the biggest political drama was the president getting a BJ

911 was the event that shattered this illusion. In fact enemies of the free world did exist and they could attack anywhere at anytime. The battlefield became everywhere with anyone being a potential terrorist. This was the vibe shift that has continued and spiraled downwards until today.

Unlike older generations Millenials did not process this fear as we were too young to fully understand what had happened or it's implications. Instead what we saw was the adults around us enter a state of fear, 1984 style electronic surveillance, racism, nationalism and islamaphobia, and the begining of the forever-wars in the middle east and forever-money printing to finance it.

By the time we were old enough to understand this situation the math to us is simple, you are FAR more likely die from literally anything else than a terrorist attack and from our perspective these ""protective"" measures seem nothing more than a cynical power grab by the people in charge yet no one will listen to this argument because it is intellectual in nature and the decisions made after 911 were emotionally based. We were not old enough to be fully part of the delusion of the end of history so we were not emotionally invested in its ego death.

What we are old enough to remember is a world in decline as our standard of living, health, education, personal freedom and opportunities have collapsed around us with us until recently not old enough to do anything about it. This instills the generation with a sense of urgency and anxiety that drastic action needs to happen very soon to turn this ship before it hits the iceburg.

Gen Z do not have this experience because they were born into a post 911 that was already fucked and don't have a childhood utopia to compare it to. it's too soon to know what the implications of this will be.

You can see this in the different humor styles of the generations with Millennials famous for ironic humor as opposed to nihilistic humor of Gen Z  


Edit: People saying this is a US centered view you very well may be right. I am Australian and because 911 had such a big impact here (not US) I assumed it did around the world too. "

210,"The fact that I'm only getting older saddens me. I was happier in my 20's. I felt more fulfilled. I had friendships and relationships. 

I'm in my 30's and the only part of my life that has improved has been my finances. But I'm more sad. More confused. More lonely. I have more aches and pains. More people have died. My hair is turning gray. My weight isn't budging. And I feel less certain about my life and its direction than I did 10 years ago.

I bought into the hype about your 30's being better, but I'm halfway through and I'm not seeing the better. Only the older."

218,"I don't get it. I used to be very social, and I loved and looked forward to going to parties/concerts/events. I don't even know when this switched happened. Now I dread leaving the house? 

I force myself to make plans and then when they come I don't want to go. The entire time I am out doing things, the only thing I can think of is how much longer I have to wait until I get to go home. I went to Vegas a couple months ago for a few days and hated it the entire time because I missed being home. Tonight I'm going to a show at a bar with some good friends and this used to be peak fun for me and now I've been dreading it all week and have massive anxiety over it and don't want to go.  My peak happy place is now lounging on my couch under my cozy blanket watching TV/playing games/etc. Its not like I even have kids or anything. Is this a side effect of barely leaving the house for over a year during covid shutdowns? Is it because I'm now over 30?"

Gen Z largely shares the same struggles we do and even more have come of age.  It is time that we turn out in elections and take control of them.  In 2022 we need to get over our disappointment of Biden as President, even though he did amazing as not being Trump as a President with some degree of sanity, but we all know we need more.  Our time has finally come and we would be fools to not turn out.  Our future and Gen Z's future depends on it.  Gen Z is our ally in shared interests but still needs our help and they deserve it.  And of course, we deserve better ourselves."

I'm not gonna look like a dad, have kids, change my clothing style ,grow a beard,  go  bald, go grey, get fat,  get wrinkles, or become more jaded. All I can say is life hits you fast lol. It's funny how you think the things you won't become you actually do without realizing it. It just happens."

358,"This post is sort of an extended reaction to [this post](https://reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/pq8y70/denzel_says_some_good_stuff_but_this_was/) featuring a tweet from Denzel Washington. I know it applies to every generation, but I think millennials experienced this on another level. 

The internet changed *everything*.  It changed the world. It changed how we interact, even how we think. Boomers and older Gen X'rs made the internet, they developed the architecture and it sort of took off in a way nobody anticipated.  (The final leap was probably when the smartphone was widely
available.)

This isn't a unique statement, I think everybody agrees that we're in a new era, even if we can't totally see the big picture yet. I don't think older generations know that we understand the impact of this, and probably understand it more intimately because of how it changed the trajectory of our development. 

We were right in the middle of it, thrust into it right along with everyone else. But unlike our parents, we were still trying to figure out the world we were born into. We aren't ""digital natives"", despite our familiarity with modern tech. But we weren't fully formed adults, either. 

It feels like this is something that happened to us, without our conscious awareness. And I'm not even saying this is a bad thing - I love the internet. I love how much there is to explore, how much access we have to information and art and each other. But it was so sudden, and such a contrast to our childhoods.  I do feel a sort of longing for what was lost, and it's not just an empty nostalgia. The place we were born is our homeland, and we can never go home again. 

If childhood is supposed to be the time where we learn about the world, what does it mean to be a child in a world that no longer exists? 

It's hard to explain to anyone who didn't experience it - hell, it's hard to put into words myself. I guess that's why I'm posting here. I want to know what you guys think. 

I'm also curious if there's a difference between older millennials and younger ones. The older millennials I know seem slightly more enthusiastic about the internet/social media, while those my age seem more cynical or at least more critical. Not that we're luddites, we still use and feel comfortable with our current tech. But there's some sort of dark awareness at play. This might just be my friend group though, so.. again, I'd love to see what others think."

372,"I read a post by someone on another sub a few weeks back about how weird it is that Gen Z has no real connection to the 20th century, specifically our grandparents generation, but mostly in context to the war. I don‚Äôt exactly understand why, but lately I‚Äôve been dwelling on how weird it feels to have moved on from the 20th century into 21st century, while simultaneously moving into a broader digital age that really started to materialize during my young teen years. I have so many memories of my boomer parents, and of my grandparents that sort of made the entire 20th century a relic for me to admire, I suppose, while experiencing it to the very end. 


I remember my father being younger than I am now just belting ELO (among other 70‚Äôs rock bands) while driving down the road. I remember playing with my uncle‚Äôs childhood toys in my grandmother‚Äôs attic that were made entirely of wood and metal, as well as going through magazines, baseball cards, and so forth. I used to wear my grandfather‚Äôs military uniform from Korea, or push my other grandfather to talk about the war(even though he only ever told me fluff, really. I was too young and too fascinated, so he always politely sidestepped around it). I would watch old sitcoms from the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs. It all seemed so much closer, because it obviously was. 

But I think the most strange aspect of moving on is how our grandparents generation is almost gone. They were like living statues. A generation that was raised through the depression then forced
to live through and fight a world war. While me and my parents understood nothing but a society of relative peace and abundance, their stories of the depression and general war time were like listening to stories of a different planet. 

It feels like the very beginning of my life was saying good bye to a different era, while my young adult years was bringing in the new era of internet and technology. It sort of feels hollow being in my 30‚Äôs and having all the remnants of the old era evaporate while social media and a popular culture I no longer fully understand, or even feels like my own, absorb that void.

Maybe I‚Äôm being too sentimental 

Edit: I suppose every generation wakes up in their 30‚Äôs to a world they no longer understand. But, I feel like we are a unique generation, as we didn‚Äôt adapt to a new age of information, our formative years was simply in one period while our pubescent and teen years was in another that‚Äôs still ongoing. We never had to adapt, but merely were forced to say goodbye to the former."

393,"Making money is cool and necessary but who really wants to work.

I ran into this nice older woman. Something came up about the holidays and how theres so many '' now hiring'' signs out.

She brought up how the young people don't like working. I didnt say the title as I didnt want to sound like a dick to this older lady(60+-70s). However I was thinking why would I want to waste my adult life working 40 hours a week. She litterally moments earlier said she HAD to at her current age to pay bills. I was like cmon, wouldnt you rather be home w/ family and doing your hobbies.

The older generation seems to think working is something to be proud of over freedom to live the way you want.

I just don't understand the reason why it matters to older people and why its so bad if someone prefers to not be on the hamster wheel."
394,"One day it  just hits you and you  realize you're not cool as you used to be and you become old news. All the musicians, actors, athletes we grew up with all seem to disappear after 30, the clothes we wore when we were younger aren't hip anymore, we aren't as young as we used to look, and times have changed. 

A lot of trends seem geared towards the youth and I don't have anything in common with today's youth. Sure I'll still listen to someone like Billie Eilish but I don't have the same connection compared to someone like Britney Spears.

I've grown and matured into a different person, I don't care about trends as much as I used to.  I'm a better person today at 35 than I was at 25 but it's crazy how quickly you become irrelevant once you're not real young anymore. I didn't see this day coming if that makes sense. I thought our generation was gonna be cool forever but it's really a short window just like any other generation."

445,"We grew up in a time when global interconnectivity and a stable internet grid were a thing of the future. For many of us a ""normal"" childhood was a given, before we slowly got introduced to the first marvels of human ingenuity and technology that changed rapidly every year. We slowly grew accustomed to more better functioning devices and more capable computers, but whenever something became obsolete we probably locked it away for a few years, unable to really part with it until the time was right. I still have fond memories of old devices, dial-up internet, the first home computers and the big, heavy TVs that needed two people to carry it safely.

It's funny to see how something that had a proper use, like portable cd players, that required batteries, be replaced by smaller mp3 players and then by our phones entirely, maybe even the new sleek touch phones that were eventually released onto the market. It's even funnier to remember  buying a GPU for your PC and then a few months later a much better model was already replacing it for the same price, making you internally curse yourself for buying one in the first place. Device overheating was something I am too familiar with and batteries dying on me, while riding the bus home listening to my favorite song.

I think these circumstances have shaped many of us into the very people we are. We appreciate a simpler life, simpler technologies and understand how they made our lives easier and how they are making our lives worse at the same time. I'm not even going to dwelve into A.I., but it will probably be a part of our reality sooner than we might think. It's easy to fall into nostalgia, we have all the tools we need to find and archive our favorite shows, songs, games and books from our early childhood. It's easier than ever to connect to another being and it's becoming even harder to stay off the grid. Our upbringing  helps us in our daily lives, at home and especially at work, being the middleground between our older and very old co-workers and being a help to newer generations who had to grow up in a chaotic environtment, where the greatest and most disgusting content available to humanity can be called upon with the click of a mouse button or swipe with a finger.  How can we not feel lost, when all our lives we had to not only adapt but be efficient at facing extreme changes that were brought upon rapidly evolving technologies in a very short amount of time? You get used to something only to realize that it's not even needed anymore. There is no real stability, no constants. We jump between joy of remembering good times and feel sad at the same time because those memories are shelved just like our VCRs and button phones.

I very much understand when older people ask me to help them out, to them we might seem like wizards or geniuses, even if we just google how to fix something most of the time. But that is the main trait of this generation, the ability to adapt to oncoming problems and at the same time being able to let go when something becomes obsolete. We have emotional attachments to old things, because they remind us of simpler times yet know when to let go. Modernity and global connectivity means one thing for us, more required adaptability and more complex technology that we usually grasp easily, because everything before that already shaped our minds for that.

To a lot of us, the internet is our playground in that regard and our personal devices are there to help us balance our daily lives and are our gateways to our nostalgia. How easy it is to just boot up emulators, that in some cases work better than whatever original device ran our favorite games. They even look better than we remember them to. At the same time I sometimes have days where nostlagia turns into sadness, when you boot something up that should bring you joy, instead makes you feel out of place and bitter. It's almost looking at something through a filter.

For fear of sounding like a cliche, I am not going to quote Fight Club, but I am going to talk about ""middle children of history"". Generations before us also had to deal with their own versions of advancements, the difference will always be the Internet. A generation that gew up without the internet and one that grew up with it, will never be able to truly understand one another. Imagine the statue of ATLAS holding the globe and you get an idea of what it is like to have the weight of internet access pressing down on you, for most of your life if not all your life.

We should always remember that even when the world is getting crazier and times are dire, we humans are all very much fighters. We endure, we adapt and we find a solution or make one if needed. Our very nature is one of fight or flight, but we never run away too long and whatever the future might bring, eventually we will shelf those things away too."

&#x200B;

It used to be, not long ago, that people would sometimes pop by because they're ""in the neighborhood"" and there legitimately wasn't a way to tell the person beforehand.  We would also answer the phone with no clue who was on the other line.  Hence, ""hello?"" as a question.

It's honestly kind of staggering to think about how much the world has changed in my life, and it's only been 40 years.  As a child we had a rotary phone on the wall with one of those extremely long curly lines that people would take all over the house, under doors, etc.  But I digress.

For the topic at hand though, I really do not like anyone to come by unannounced.  Like, it actually makes me angry.  I don't want to invite people in when I haven't had a chance to straighten up and at least have our place looking halfway presentable.  That's not to mention the fact that AT HOME people often are not presentable to outsiders.  We're in our pjs, maybe no bra, hair going everywhere, possibly need a shower.  Like, it's MY SPACE.  You're not supposed to be here.

I'm not antisocial either, and I don't think a lot of millennials really are.  We just, a lot of us, like plans.  We like preparation.  It seems weird to type that, but when I think about it, that's really what it is.  I think our generation does waaaaaaaaay less of the ""spontaneous"" visits and outings.  We still like to see people and do things.  We just want to plan it in advance, because frankly it's so easy to do so... with all of the technology we have."

531,"I'm now in my mid 30s. I lived independently for a few years but due to health problems and the high cost of housing I've been living with my parents for a number of years now. They are getting older and less physically able and I do provide some care for them, plus I do my own cooking, laundry etc. My parents bought a house just before prices shot up in the late 90s and they're not badly off. I know I'm lucky to be able to live with them as many people don't have that option. I'm also lucky that they live in a city where there are jobs. Some of my friends had to move away from their families to find work. 

I feel like I'm not able to live like an adult. I feel left out when my friends talk about things they've bought to decorate their homes. I feel like I've been left behind. I have chronic health problems which mean I'm not able to work full time hours but even if I was, I'd need to clone myself several times to earn enough to get a mortgage. I've been saving money since I graduated but house prices have gone up so far that my savings are worth less every day. Yet I keep hearing that millennials just need to forgo some ""luxuries"" to save for a deposit and that's the only reason we can't get on the ""property ladder"". 

I am struggling with depression because things feel so hopeless and I feel so bad about myself. I've had lots of therapy and I'm on antidepressants but I can't shake these feelings of shame and inadequacy about not living like an adult.

This is an American problem, not a world problem. People are being shot to death. *Kids* are being shot to death. Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland, UVALDE. Those parents that lost their child yesterday, the grief they must feel. It's not okay. Change needs to happen. & it won't, just like it hasn't.

For any Millennial that has been voting Republican, take a good look at who you're voting for. Democrats have their own faults, which I say as a Democrat, but they have been pushing for gun control for years. ""People will just get guns illegally, gun control doesn't matter!"" It matters. Look at other countries, look at the countries that had a mass shooting & took swift action (one example is Australia). & if you still choose to vote for someone that has the NRA's dick in their mouth, shame on you.

I'm exhausted. Rallies for gun control seem to mean nothing, they seem to change nothing. We need people in office that give a shit about human beings, rather than power &/or money.

Guns have changed, the law should too.

617,"**tl;dr: I used to enjoy social media for feeling like I've found niche spaces for myself but now it feels like it's becoming fast and mindless content and has made organic interactions worse. Can anybody else relate?**

I used to love social media-I'm somebody who struggled with social anxiety and awkardness when talking in person. I know that I'm a person who is inherently an extrovert even though I come off as an introvert, who loves meeting people from all walks of life and making new friends. I'm passionate about learning new things, about different cultures and having my views challenged. At first, social media catered to ALL these interests. I moved a lot throughout my life and one thing I realized is that people in my immediate circle-most of them were like a product of their environment and never really cared about my interests or thinking. I also am a minority and have been in places where there isn't as much diversity that made things really challenging for me in various points of my life.

So Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at first enabled me to feel like I've found a place to share who I really am and feel appreciated for it. I made friends all over the country (US) and world. I have a unique sense of humor, plenty of hobbies and built a decent following on Twitter from that.

Over time, everything slowly seems to have a digital component now. Some of it is good, don't get me wrong-I like the convenience of doing many things through my phone. But there's a part of me that feels like everything that had some opportunity for organic development-like friendship, relationships, etc. are so much more rarer without a screen medium. And honestly-I don't really love that. The content of social media has evolved to become faster, more reactive and boring rather than interesting and thought-provoking. I never wanted to join dating apps, but I have and I hate it. I always thought maybe I'd find somebody with whom I share something with-a connection, interests, like we could finish each others sentences. But on the apps, I feel hopeless. Turning myself into a ""profile"" makes me feel like I'm not a real person but a pokemon on a card. lol. I've tried to share interesting/funny things about myself but I honestly feel like on a screen medium, majority of people are not reading my prompts but just looking at my pictures and swiping left. Even though I consider myself decent looking I'd say-I think my personality, hobbies and interests speak more about me than my looks (I'm a straight woman, for reference). But with a platform where everything is premised on swiping and quickness, I feel like all the things I like about myself are overlooked and it's just about how I look. I talked to a friend who mentioned the paradox of choice and I can't stop thinking about it-it's like with the swiping and all, people feel like they can go for *something better* and it's just an infinite loop of too much choice leading to not picking a single choice.

Over the course of time, I've been feeling too like the friendships I developed online *haven't been real.* I've had a chance to talk to cool people, but over time either they leave bc there is a community fulfilling them outside of social media and their focus is directed towards that or they stay but it's just like we throw our thoughts into the void, passively like it and just wheneve we show up on the timeline again it's that interaction that keeps us going. I took a long break off social media last year-Instagram and Twitter, and while that helped immensely remove the impulse to post that I felt was coming of a place of searching for community, it eventually made me a little too isolated. Nobody even asked me where I was when I was offline. I don't have very many friends offline because I never really belonged anywhere moving so much. I made a few friends through grad school 5 years ago, but I feel forgotten by almost everybody. I was first the one checking in on friends but if I wasn't doing that, majority of them won't keep up with me unless they need to ask me a question for something *they* need.

I live in a big city and the thing that fulfills me is just taking walks, immersing myself in hobbies and trying to go to every event possible. When I have an opportunity to meet people, I take every advantage of it. But it feels like making new friends is just super hard at this stage of life. Everybody I meet seems to already have something fulfilling them and some people even straight up say ""I don't want to make new friends"". Has it always been like this? My parents immigrated to America in the 80s and I grew up having a fulfilling community of potluck dinners, get togethers at different people's houses and just fun time spent with family friends. I'd see families helping people out in times of need. We don't have that community anymore b/c my family moved and eventually people over time have moved too. But what's so crazy to me that in a time where *there was more barriers to communication*\-when my parents relied on landlines, calling cards and had to find friends pre-internet days, they actually made it work and made it work *well.* Now we have 5 diff ways to communicate with people and yet it feels so easy to be a forgotten entity with nobody checking in on you. I've done my part-joined bff apps, text friends when I feel sad or bored, initiate conversations, efforts, etc. But it never feels the energy is reciprocated. There's this very heavy feeling like it's easy to feel forgotten or abandoned at this stage of life. Do others feel this too? It has been really overwhelming, especially as I entered my thirties."

I'm sad I won't ever experience those things in the same way I did the first time I discovered so many of my interests.

Mine was Britney Spears in 1998 or 99. I was 7 or 8 at the time. My mom drove me 2 hours from our home town, on a school night, for me to experience my first concert. We didn‚Äôt have tickets to the sold out show so we had to scout them out in the parking lot. We got one fairly quickly from the music being too loud for them, and my mom bought it for $20 cash. I vividly remember these small details. We waited until we could get one more so we could go in together. The concert was about to start and I was anxiously waiting to get in. One way or another my mom connected with a woman who was in charge of collecting the tickets to get into the concert and told her about our situation. She had 3 grandchildren around my age inside the concert that she was checking up on every so often and offered to let me go stand with them and keep an eye out on me until my mom could get a ticket. My mom agreed, so I was brought into a concert with a complete stranger.. at 7/8 years old. There were no cellphones to text to let each other know we were safe. Not long after my mom joined me, but holy crap. There is just not that level of trust in people these days and I think there would be a lot of parent-shaming around this. I mean, that is if they share it with the world through social media to welcome unsolicited opinions. Granted I grew up in Vermont, small state, small towns, great people, but still!

I don't know about high schoolers right now, but I've never seen someone my age pick on Millennials (or any generation for that matter). We grew up listen to your music, a lot of the same shows, seen you guys become our favourite athletes, and learned a lot of our values from you guys in general. I truly appreciate what you guys did during the 2000s and 2010s , you guys (and Gen X obviously) raised us in a lot of ways. Those kids on TikTok don't even speak for the rest of us.

For example, dating constantly on tinder, but not finding someone who wants to settle down. Recently deleted those apps, and want to find people who are happy with just living, not materials.

Our generation never had a choice, but we gave so much to that war. I had a friend join the Marines right before 9/11. The rest of us unknowingly gave so much financially. For instance, maybe the 2008 recession maybe wouldn't have happened.

I recently turned 31 and I am NOT OKAY. It's weird because I didn't feel like this at 29 or 30. I even started going gray a lot at around 26, I kinda laughed it off then. But now at 31, I am freaking the eff out. I look in the mirror, it's like overnight I feel I look old. Inside I feel the same as always, but this past year I have realized how much I do not have in common with younger people. I don't like the top pops in music (even though I did only a few years ago) or sometimes I don't know who they are at all. I don't like the new popular actors or actresses. I don't rent an apartment anymore. I miss getting invited to hang out at parties or bars with people my age and just goofing off. 

There are other things going on in my life that may be contributing, like recently I got married, and also my mom is in the hospital. I also think it doesn't help that I went back to school, and even though it's online, still most of my classmates are normal college age. So when COVID hit, I didn't mind being isolated at all and there were a lot of things in my life that actually went really well during that time. But I've stayed at home online & isolated ever since (so far almost 3 years now for me), and I think now it is finally getting to me. It's only now that I feel I'm experiencing what everyone else has been saying in the past years - that part of my youth was stolen away from me by COVID and I can't get it back. Concerts, parties, bars...those are things I associate with my early-mid twenties, then they disappeared overnight. I also lost my friends. 

On the other hand, I feel silly. My husband and I are childfree, so really we can just live however we want, do whatever we want. So I \*shouldn't\* be feeling this way, but I am. My husband doesn't feel this way at all. He feels young and great and happy. He doesn't understand why I'm going through this. 

It's not even just feeling bad about it, I've actually been having panic attacks for like a week straight now. Is this normal or should I go see a therapist? (I'm not insured yet.) Has anyone else felt like this? Have you gotten over it? It feels like I'll never feel young or carefree again. Please tell me I'm wrong and I can get over it!"

732,"I went to college. Got a bachelors in IT. Graduated without debt. A local company laid of 100 employees in my field the week that I was handed my diploma. It took 2 years to find a job in my field locally instead of driving 2 hours every day for work. Got the job. Boss low balled me (but still more then I was making without the job). Boss quits, new boss gives me a hefty raise (up to $26 an hour). I start saving for a house, house prices went up faster then I can save.

Still at $26 an hour. The last time I did a calculation for moving out of my moms place I ended up with $400 to spare at the end of the month. That was again, before prices for everything went up. 

Now I feel like I need a better job if Im peaked in my role. I could advance in the company but thats salary and technically on call 24/7 if things go wrong. Something that doesn't fit with a work life balance. 

That leaves me being 36 and trying to figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life, like in junior high, but this time I have the added pressure of working from 8:30 to 5:30 every day rather then going to school every day from 8:30 to 3:30 every day. That means studying in a few hours a night. By the time I get home and make dinner its 7pm. 

Im annoyed that part of the reason Im sticking with my current job so long is that it offers health and dental care. Im super pissed that over 21 years the U.S. government has continued to not have single payer unlike other civilized countries but they always have money for war and defense. 

I love the area I live in but the cost of living has gone up enough that I dont think its sustainable both finically or mental health wise to dream about having my own place here. I want to travel. I think about what other countries have free/single payer health care and most of those would require learning another language on top of me learning another job currently. 

And it all feels so overwhelming which makes me feel not good enough.

For reference, it took me two years to find a job that utilized my communications degree (which feels like enough of a mistake). I managed to keep that job for nearly five years before being let go and ended up working in a customer service call center when I couldn‚Äôt get hired in another editorial role or anything related. It sucked but we were a small department so my boss didn‚Äôt focus a ton on metrics and stats like most call centers. After that I worked in a small law firm as a receptionist/assistant for almost two years, got into another editorial role at a different company, and went to another law firm as a talent acquisition coordinator. I finally thought getting the TA coordinator role would give me the career potential I had craved. My boss was supportive, we clicked well, and I was excited to grow my skills and make a career. But after only four months, I was laid off due to the firm‚Äôs financial issues and couldn‚Äôt get another recruiting coordinator job. So guess where I am now? Yep. Another call center position. The job pays OK and has good benefits but they track tons of stats and I just didn‚Äôt want to do customer support again. I thought I had earned my way out of it and now I am stuck in it again. 

People around me are trying to encourage me and are saying they‚Äôre proud of me but I know I probably won‚Äôt stick with this employer long-term unless I get promoted off of frontline customer service. I already miss the freedom of more project-based work, listening to music and podcasts and choosing my own lunchtime. Now my lunch will be selected for me and I will be micromanaged.

Having to scroll through those posts is so draining. Everyone is so plastically positive. Don't get me wrong, I understand the game; you need to hype up your wins and window dress your failures to be competitive in today's job market, but it's just so annoying to read.

It started out with over the top celebrations for actual achievements. The dopamine boost had to be replicated but you didn't achieve something as impressive so you over sell it. Then you run out of achievements. In an effort to not seem out of touch, then you see the posts about accepting your failures etc etc. But you can't do that too often as to not seem like failure is so common so you just pad the time with soppy motivational crap.

I saw a joke once somewhere along the lines of 'I was on my way to an interview but on the way I saw a dog starving on the street. I had to stop and get it food and shelter. This caused me to be late and miss the interview. I called and begged to reschedule they denied. I was sad but knee I did the right thing. The next day I get a call, it's the CEO of the company, he wants me to start today, turns out he was the dog I saved on the street. Moral of the story is stay true to your moral conviction, people notice and it will pay off""

This honestly feels like a SLIGHTLY exaggerated version of actual posts.

BARF!"

These days it seems like almost everyone in our age group is achieving all of these amazing things, making tons of money ($200k is the new $100k these days), having it all, etc. Maybe I‚Äôm just in a bubble, but from my observations it just seems that there are very few people who are content with just being ‚Äúaverage‚Äù in our generation.

I haven‚Äôt achieved anywhere near that level of success (yet), and I just feel so far behind."

The constant loneliness and very little social interaction I have has destroyed my self esteem and confidence. What really hurts though is how I can never meet people my age online no matter where I go. They are always overwhelmingly under 25 age.

It feels like millennial people are just purposely falling in line for their age. As in ""I am 25! Time to no longer be on the internet!"" and like duh I know they exist online, but for some reason they never use discord and only use the toxic waste dumps such as fakebook or the tweeter! Basically after age 25, they refuse to try anything new and I don't know why!

This fall marks 20 years since I started 9th grade when loneliness began for me.

I feel for them. I know Millennials got the short end of the stick to a lot of front, but Gen Z is really getting screwed. In the case of my sib, she had several periods during her junior/senior years of high school in which the whole town was evacuated due to wildfires for weeks...and this happened *twice.*

Then she didnt get to go to uni because classes were at home due to covid.  now she's transferring. So in essence, her junior year of high school through junior year of college was one calamity after another, forcing her to miss such critical milestones. no prom, no dorms, and kinda all your high school friends just kinda going their own ways after a while of unexpectedly getting cut off. 

She's overall well adjusted, but I just feel like Gen Z is already being shortchanged even compared to Millennials. And I kinda wish we could do something about it, maybe improve their situation and prospects a bit, but we're all here living paycheck to paycheck which makes it pretty hard to do anything. 

I dunno, I just hope something good happens for them soon. Once we get some political power, we should focus on building them up. it'll pay off for us in the long run and we can do better than what was done for us, which I think is something we can feel good about."

The greatest generation set up the party and decorated for it.

Boomers went to the party and partied all night long.

Millennials didn‚Äôt go to the party, but were handed the bill.

For Gen Z, the party is over, but they think parties are stupid anyway."
815,"Lately, I've been noticing an increase of Gen-Z users to this subreddit. In some respects, I don't mind because I would assume they are genuinely curious. However, I've also noticed that they like to make antagonizing threads and leave stupid, inflammatory comments.

Why? I have yet to visit a Gen-Z subreddit and I have no interest in doing so. If I want to learn more about Gen-Z, I'll read an article or a research study about them instead of bothering them with silly, condescending questions and comments. 

Is Gen-Z going to be a thorn in our side and the bane of our existence like the Boomers have been? Why not start paying attention to Gen-X (who have been slipping in here from time to time to crap on us Millennials as well)?

At this point, I think we might need a Millennial coalition because everybody hates Millennials it seems. üòï

We struggle financially due to student loan debt and the incredible costs associated with having poor credit.

The part that works is a marriage based on trust and understanding.  ""Common goals make allies of us all""  and all that.  It's so much easier to make it through tough times when you and your partner are reading from the same game plan.

To my fellow millenials, we all know we didn't grow up with advanced technology or high speed internet. It was dial up in the 90s. Also everyone didn't have cell phones as a kid and you had to call house phones. Then with jobs, we were taught to go to college and go into debt. Then when we got out of college there were not a lot of jobs. Also cost of living is a lot higher so we either have to make around 6 figures to live comfortably or be married or live with a roommate if you don't. As far as job hopping, employers aren't loyal like they use to be. For a lot of jobs there is no career growth or we hit the limit for salary so we have to leave to advance. We were the last generation before social media but get lumped into it lol."

The further we get away the more of the population that is alive does not know the 90s. Things have not gone the way I think a lot of us thought it would. Most of us where feeling so positive about the future then just less than 1 year later the horrible day of 9/11 that changed this country(USA) & has not been the same since. 9/11 & social media are big reasons for the division in this country.

And although I didn‚Äôt count, I think they shared about equal time singing. Some songs are just Tom, some are just Mark, and some are both.

The only other act I can think of that does something similar is Linkin Park, but even still, and no disrespect to them, but I think it‚Äôs safe to say that aside from ‚ÄúIn the End‚Äù, Mike Shinoda was clear second fiddle to Chester Benington doing lead vocals.

Another contender might be Alice In Chains, but what they did was a bit different. I wouldn‚Äôt really consider them having two co-equal lead singers, rather Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell did some of music‚Äôs best harmonizing.

So yeah, Blink-182 really did pull off something that not many other bands are able to do.

All we've known is being young and the thought of not being so anymore might be scary to some. We aren't old by any means but it's probably the first time for many Millennials to actually feel like aging is starting to hit.

At 34, I'm wondering how many more years I got left till I see a noticeable difference in my appearance. I know I got many years of life ahead of me but my youth? That is coming to an end sooner than later."

856,"I grew up in California, so this might make a difference, here. 

Jonah Hill made a pretty accurate drama called mid90s, and it was essentially an accurate representation of the social pressure 90's kids had to face, without the rose-colored glasses that the internet often focuses on. I recommend people see it. I had a friend that was just like the kid depicted in that movie, basically willing to commit crimes and do bad things to his family just to change himself to fit in.

The bottom line is this: while the 90's had great music, the best video game scene and some awesome entertainment, these things were popular because they were our escape. Escape from the social pressures that most of GenZ probably won't understand.

The typical zoomer likes anime, believes in equality to an extreme degree, plays tons of video games, lacks social skills and has anxiety and depression. The typical genZer would have been ridiculed and bullied by the entire school.

In the early 90's, it was established that everyone act black, talk black, and love rap. What if you were like me and you were white and that scene just didn't appeal to who you were? You were branded a nerd. You weren't suppose to care about ""who you are"". There was rock scenes, but they became popular because they seemed like counterculture to what had been established.

In high school, I was into rock, video games, vikings, and the Simpsons. All things that are so normal now, but people rolled their eyes in 2000 when I did my senior project on Norse Mythology. A friend did his on anime, and they *hated* him.

So who was welcomed in the 90's? Jocks? I remember people even making fun of skaters in middle school. 

Can't imagine what it would have been like to be gay or LGBTQ in the intolerant 90's. Wow.

Don't know why anyone would want to go back."

Guys.

Don't let the boomers make you feel bad about the inherited mess, and don't let the Gen Z children make you feel old and irrelevant. We've never had it easy, regardless of people saying we were all given awards and grew up as entitled brats. 

Despite it all, we've taken the rubble of our beginnings and distinguished ourselves from previous generations by:
- being more educated (based on #s of associates, bachelor's, and masters degrees)
- marrying later (which means less likely to divorce)
- spending more money on _experiences_ rather than _material_ things
- openly talking about our mental health and wellness
- are more involved in social activism (women, minority, lgbtqia rights, and climate change)

We are not a generation of scapegoats, we are GOLD
