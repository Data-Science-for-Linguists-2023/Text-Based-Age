Physically active, non-hermit friends who like to play and have fun and be silly. And not just on a rare, scheduled basis. The type of friends who will drop what they’re doing to go out and play kick the can, toss a frisbee around, or just ride bikes. 

I miss playing outside until we reached total physical exhaustion, going in for snacks and some chill time, then heading straight back out for more.

EDIT: Let’s all be friends and do stuff outside together!
