             Cara- the pics on his website reminded me of Layne Staley from Alice In Chains (before he died of course)- but Marsh doesn't usually wear those sunglass things- or the mesh shirts- that was a photo from a goth club he went to a few years ago. He actually dresses pretty normal.  I think it would be VERY hard to fill a toilet in one sitting....But then again- ya'll know my bladder.  Ok..interesting thought for the day- provoked by a very-religious co worker. If you believe that humans are born with a soul, and that that soul is provided by God (our creator- in this belief system)- does that mean that cloned children would be born soulless? and if so- does that mean that they wouldn't know the difference between right and wrong from a basic moral standpoint (if you believe that your soul is the source of these things)......  I just thought it was an interesting deep thought....
