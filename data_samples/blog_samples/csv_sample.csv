He actually dresses pretty normal.  I think it would be VERY hard to fill a toilet in one sitting....But then again- ya'll know my bladder.  Ok..interesting thought for the day- provoked by a very-religious co worker. If you believe that humans are born with a soul, and that that soul is provided by God (our creator- in this belief system)- does that mean that cloned children would be born soulless? and if so- does that mean that they wouldn't know the difference between right and wrong from a basic moral standpoint (if you believe that your soul is the source of these things)......  I just thought it was an interesting deep thought....         "

We only have 18 ordered, and we need to get more or else you wont be getting them.   Now, today was an ok day. Not too exciting. We're starting to do stage makeup in drama. So, that'll be fun. We also had to register for classes for next year. It's kind of scary thinking of being a senior. Yes, it will be fun, but it will be a little scary to know that it's your last year of high school. However, we need a minimum of 6 classes a semester. Unfortunately, I am taking 7 1st semester. I really dont want to, but I'm in band, and that makes 7 classes.          "

I have tried to find a book that is popular, and I would just like to find a book that is peer-approved. So any suggestions would help. Thanks, ~hillary         "

Could she just not stay away?   I fade more and more from IRC. Miss it, but far less than I ever thought I would. Why play? Why be around? There is nobody but a handful that even notice or want to do more than sit and stare at a screen. I'm restless. I want ......something.         "

The best I will be able to do is date them according to when they were scanned in.  Blogger's posting options don't go much farther back than that anyway.  So if you'd like to see the oldies but goodies, just visit the 'attic', below and to your right.         "
