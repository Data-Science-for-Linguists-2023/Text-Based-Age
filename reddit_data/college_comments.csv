0,"I honestly teared up a bit reading this letter. I am so sorry to hear about your mom. My father passed away when I was a young child and I can't imagine going through it during college. 

You have a really genuine, caring professor and that is something that can be quite rare these days. 

Best wishes to you, OP."
1,Yup. There's almost nothing better than a professor who genuinely cares about his/her students and their education and takes the extra effort to connect and reach out. 
2,"My mom died Nov 11, just a few weeks ago. I am 49 and still cry."
3,"That‚Äôs so touching that your professor cares so much. I can only hope I‚Äôm lucky enough to get one like yours someday.

I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. I hope you‚Äôre doing ok."
4,"I fucking can‚Äôt. My mom died two years ago from complications of a super massive heart attack. I‚Äôm a 23 year old man that makes glass tile and works with metal forming, I am a US Marine, and I‚Äôve been independent since age 18.  Needless to say I‚Äôve grown up quick.

This has me crying at work. I don‚Äôt think I understood how much I missed my mom until I read this... I‚Äôve had to be so strong for so long that I don‚Äôt think I was able to properly mourn her... thank you OP, "
5,"I'm only a sophomore in college but it was only the English professor I had freshman year that gave a shit about the students. Asked us how are day was and spoke with us and not to us. All my other classes the professor seems to hate teaching, hate the students, and hate life. Makes you not want to go to class. "
6,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I am incredibly grateful I have him as a professor, being far away from home right so soon after everything happened can be rough. Best wishes to you too. "
7,"So, so sweet. This is a man in the right profession. 

Hey OP, I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. I believe everything your prof wrote you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
8,"I'm so sorry for your loss. It's a horrendous thing to go through, no matter the age."
9,"Thank you. I just bought a new washer/dryer for my house, and I caught myself thinking ""Oh I must call mom and tell her...oh right..."""
10,"That's the worst part of it all. Not being able to share all of life's little moments. My mom was my best friend and I used to talk to her 24/7. It definitely takes some getting used to, but try and find someone else you can tell, it helps."
11,I lost my mom a week ago. She was 54 and I'm 24. These literally have been the worse days of my life. And I still struggle horribly bad. Today I cried for about 20 minutes in my work truck driving to a customer site. And found myself writing mom a message on Facebook telling her how much I loved and missed her. And how sorry I am for not telling her these things more often. And that I wished I was more there for her in her medical decline that started three years ago. My brother picked up her remains today. It was just a bad day. 
12,Thank you. I'm doing the best I can. I want to make my mom proud. 
13,My greatest regret is she will never meet my wife and kids. I'm not married yet.
14,Teachers can be heroes at these times. When my dad died during my senior year of high school all my teachers were super supportive with extensions and some even got me gifts and wrote me wonderful letters that still make me cry after almost 20 years. 
15,"I was the same way. I was so busy distracting myself that I didn't realize how much I missed her until I read this letter. I'm so sorry for your loss, I completely empathize with you. I hope you get healing and peace in your heart.  "
16,This got me to cry for the first time in a while. I lost my mom 8 years ago when I was a kid and this hit me instantly. If you ever need to talk feel free to PM me.
17,"Jesus christ, why are my eyes wet."
18,"Sorry to hear about your mom OP. I lost my Dad to cancer 5 months ago. It still feels like yesterday.


We're way too young for this to happen. PM me if you want to talk."
19,"It gets better. I lost my dad about a year ago to lung cancer. I was 14 at the time. The only advice I can give you is take a few days to rest, and dont be afraid to cry. 3 hour cry sessions were sort of what got me through that. Also, after you've recovered enough, get busy and find something you love. Marching band came at the right time for me, and without it I have no idea what I would have done.

I'm so sorry about what happened. You can get through this."
20,Thank you. I truly appreciate it 
21,"My high school teachers were the same way, since the death of my mom happened right at the end of senior year. Coming to college very far away was hard because I didn't have the same kind of support since nobody knows about it, but this professor is a light in the dark."
22,I go to a large public state university :)
23,"This hits too close to home. My dad passed away a year ago, and while it was heartbreaking enough filling out family info on college and scholarship apps, now that I'm a first-year in college, I miss having someone to confide in more than ever. Especially when things are tough, which is pretty much every day. Sigh, I miss you, Dad."
24,"Out of genuine curiosity, do you go to a Catholic school? I went to a secular state school and it's hard to imagine getting a letter like this from any of my professors."
25,I don‚Äôt know you but I can‚Äôt imagine any mother not being proud in this situation. My heart would absolutely melt.  
26,That really bums me out. I'm sorry you're having that experience. Are you at a big school? I feel like that's more common in bigger schools.
27,"Yeah it's a big school. Only reason I'm ok with the sucky teachers and sucky program is because I'm in a co-op program so next semester I'll be working and I'll come out of college with experience under my belt.

I feel it's definitely a big school thing, my best friend goes to a smaller school and he tells me my classes are nothing like his"
28,"When my mom died it was my second year of college and in the middle of fall semester. She died on a Friday and I had a test due the next Wednesday. I went to class Monday bc idk I wanted to be out of the house I guess??? But anyway I set my backpack down and go up to my teacher to tell him I can't finish the take home exam. This guy was an army vet and was also very intimidating-didn't put up with stupidity and bullshit. So I tried to keep my composure as I told him that I couldn't complete the test in time. He turned to me and asked why? And I bursted into tears saying my mom died. 

His response was ""why the fuck are you here? Don't worry about the fucking test, go home and don't come back for at least 2 weeks. Just take the test, don't worry about the score, and relax but go home"" 

... Not expecting that response I go wide eyed for a sec, said thank you, and left. Didn't come back to school until I had everything settled since mom didn't have a will and I was next of kin but I will never forget that response. I appreciated him caring and helping me out when I did return to school but did not expect that response. üòÇ"

30,"I can understand that. But wouldn‚Äôt you expect to have that same type of exhaustion during the summer in HS then too? Only because the structure is gone. (Assuming that individual isn‚Äôt working, going to camp, etc)."
31,"I genuinely feel like I‚Äôve aged physically since high school tbh. I can no longer do a lot of the things/eat a lot of the foods that I used to be able to tolerate as a teenager. 

Example: In high school my friends and I would regularly climb/sit on the edges of a raised concrete planter and just hop off. If I tried to do that now I would probably break my ankle."
32,"I think part of the missing structure is also that there is no one time block taken out of your day. Your classes have a differemt schedule for each day of the week which makes it hard to say ""Ok, I'll wake up at 8. Have breakfast. Go to class for four fours. Have lunch. Do homework for four hours. Make dinner. And then free time until 11 when I need to go to bed."" For example, you might have a 8 AM class and a class that ends at 9 PM on the same day with another class in the afternoon. It makes scheduling difficult because you have no consistent time for when you do schoolwork vs househd chores vs free time vs sleep."
33,"Idk if this is universal, I was exhausted in high school too. Drank a ton of energy drinks so I could get up at 6 am and stay awake, and when I got home I almost always took a nap right away. 

To be fair, a big part of that was probably untreated depression but I think starting your day at 6 in the morning Monday though Friday would be difficult for just about anyone"
34,"As for the psychology, I couldn't tell you why it feels like exhaustion snowballs when there is no structure to your day. 

Why is it easier to do anything after running a mile, going to 6 hours of class, then going to wrestling practice. I wonder the same thing. It feels like constant adrenaline/minor anxiety that keeps you alert and alive. Where if you just lay down all day it's easy to become emotionless and exhausted."
35,‚ÄúObjects in motion stay in motion‚Äù LOL
36,"My theory is as such: in high school I could dedicate like 95% of my time to school and school-adjacent activities. Yeah, I had to do my laundry and cook on off-days, but usually my parents dealt with the vast majority of things that peripherally concerned me. In college? I have to decide for myself when I want to eat, what I want to eat, stick to a schedule of sorts, hit the gym when I can, do my own laundry, and basically fend for myself for the entire day. It's not like I can switch off that part of myself when I get back into my dorm the same way I can switch off everything else and focus on work when I came home after school. That's the reason that I have, at least."
37,I feel that. In highschool I did marching band so that was my exercise. There's no longer a blocked time of day when I exercise in college so it's been a struggle. Also absolutely hate working out anyway. To combat that I just walk everywhere.
38,"I've definitely worked harder in high school than I did in college. But it's also burnout. I don't want to repeat another 4 years of waking up at 6:30 and sleeping at 2:30 every day. Shit fucking sucks. I have a much better balance now, and I'm taking classes that are actually interesting and useful to me."
39,and that‚Äôs on stacking your classes
40,"Person could be oversleeping and disturbinh their sleep cycle. They may have actually not have enough iron in their diet, or lack it in their body which makes you feel extremely tired. Biologically their could be a ton of things wrong but this is probably a joke and the person questionably has a bad sleep cycle."
41,The weird part for me is that I work out way more in college than in HS but I‚Äôm still significantly weaker/more easily fatigued than I was back then. Guess it‚Äôs just all downhill from here health wise
42,"Same here, I was always exhausted after school and would ditch the rest of my activities for a nap. I had heavy brain fog everyday and literally can‚Äôt remember shit from those days. I was also depressed during those years so I think that was the main cause."
43,Easier said than done
44,You've cracked the code
45,I think it's more because you have a lot more responsibility and stress which leads to exhaustion
46,"Granted, the OP of the tweet may have those issues, but my entire circle of friends and classmates relate to this. While yes, low iron, low B12, hormonal changes, sleep changes etc can influence these things, it seems to be a large part of college culture that somehow we are all exhausted."
47,The real answer is this post forgets the 3 hours after lunch at school that you can barely stay awake
48,"I have no idea about the psychology behind I have thought about this alot lately as I saw it happen to me my freshman year of college. First of all, the naps. Let's be honest, many college students don't have regular sleeping schedules and on top of that, as growing people we do need lots of rest. Now to my theory.

One reason it's so hard to carry the same perceived workload in college as in highschool is the accountability. It's alot easier to do homework when your mom won't let you play with your friends until it's done. This along with the structure of highschool life is why I think I was able to do it. 

The easiest way to get alot done is to be busy, and I know that sounds stupid but hear me out. The more things you have taking up time in your day, the less free time you have to slack off. If you start slacking off, you won't be able to make up the time. But if you have virtually unlimited free time, you can always justify doing it later. You can't do it later if you have work or practice later. 

Another reason I think is called the paradox of choice. The more options you have regarding something, the more it will wear on you. In highschool, you don't have a choice in much of your schedule but in college, you get to define your schedule almost entirely. Having more choices creates more stress, thus deciding what to do with your time may cause anxiety leading to you making no choice at all and just letting the time pass.

These are only theories I have been thinking up. I haven't totally researched this shit"

50,"Although I wouldn't directly credit depression, I had a fairly similar experience. School started at 7:30, so I had to wake up super early every day (often when the sun was not yet out) and get everything together, including homework I had pushed off to the last minute. Just because nights felt like they lasted forever and gave me some freedom, I would stay up until 3:00 routinely and had a generally terrible sleep schedule of taking long naps (in the several hour range) as soon as I came home. I was just ready to be done with it all, and although I cared for some of my classes a lot, others felt unnecessary. My memories are iffy, having a lot of anxiety and just kind of moving forward a lot of the time."
51,"The reverse happened to me. In high school, I was always drained constantly from having the same exact schedule. Waking up really early, having the same exact classes everyday, homework in almost all of them at once, and having to keep up with after school stuff? I got burnout so quickly. 

In college, having block scheduling really changed the game for me. Some days I could wake up later, take classes I choose, and have more time in between? Made my overall happiness so much better. This is definitely reflected on my academics too. Although I was never a bad student, my high school gpa was always around 3.5-3.6. I‚Äôve maintained a 4.0 thus far in college. I‚Äôm a rising junior."

58,"oh god that sucks :( thankfully I was able to get all my classes stacked 10-4 M W F, woo!"

That's all the explanation you need."
60,"The point is needless cruelty in order to appease Trump's base, they can fully understand all of this and it doesn't change the logic."
61,"Not only this, but time zones and online classes don‚Äôt mix well. Got a class at 12 USA time? Wake up at 3 am. 

Plus students who don‚Äôt have WiFi at home country or have shitty WiFi can‚Äôt do anything about it."
62,"Does ICE understand that foreign students bring in money to the US?  There's about one million foreign students in the US, one million people buying food, clothes, consumer goods, rents, etc. I mean a bunch of college towns would collapse even further without some students there spending money especially the towns housing markets because they'd be some of the only students staying and they would be hard to get money from if they did break a lease to return home."

64,"Universities aren't doing this out of some sense of morality.  For the last few decades, international students have been cash cows for universities.  This is about protecting their revenue."
65,Sometimes you can do the right thing for the wrong reasons. It doesn't invalidate the action.
66,love to see it üëè it is ridiculous they thought it was appropriate to release guidelines to deport students in the middle of a pandemic
67,"It‚Äôs more of ‚Äúwhy do we need to remove them‚Äù??? A lot of them are here already or are working here, or have leases/internships/activities lined up for the year. Being told a month before school to leave the country is unnecessary and dumb. I can see maybe saying that new students shouldnt COME now but there‚Äôs absolutely no reason for existing students to leave."
68,I was taking online classes in India and my class meeting times were literally in the middle of the night/early morning
69,"No, its completely logical.  You want malicious people to vote for you, be cruel to the people those malicious people don't like.  Just because its evil doesn't mean its not logical."
70,"People were saying that these kids were well off (some are ngl) and their internet is top notch at their homes. I have 100 mbps with spectrum and my shit still fails me. For example, I was taking an exam and all of a sudden my computer notifies me that, ""Connected, No Internet."""
71,"ICE is doing this precisely to get the most money out of foreign students. They are forcing universities to adopt an on-campus or at least  partially on-campus curriculum so that international students will have to move here and pay full tuition. Otherwise, they can just stay in their home countries and pay a fraction of the full price."
72,"Of course they understand all that, it‚Äôs all being done to appease Trump‚Äôs base I guess under the guise of xenophobia and America first or whatever BS"
73,This whole thing is fucking stupid. You‚Äôre removing students who pay international student tuition which is more expensive and pay money to live here which puts money back into the economy. I don‚Äôt understand why they would even do this? There‚Äôs not reason to do this ICE is fucking stupid
74,"it also proves that the rhetoric about ""we only want *skilled* immigrants"" is bullshit too.   All these students are skilled, educated individuals, but they still want an excuse to keep them from entering the country - even if its just for higher education.   
  
its about xenophobia, nothing else. And to use the pandemic as an excuse  for it is despicable"
75,Yeah i don't think ICE gives a shit about a petition.
76,Great to see universities fighting the decision.
77,99.9% of universities are still charging full tuition for the online classes. The reason the schools are panicking about this is because many students would rather just drop out and continue their studies in their home countries instead of paying full tuition for online school while not even being able to network in the US.
78,"Internationals make up a large portion of many universities, particularly our elite ones. By forcing international students to choose between in person attendance and deportation would mean two things. 

Firstly, universities like Harvard that opted for an online only semester cannot do so without a large portion of its student body (1 out of every 5 students) being declared illegal, and all the legal issues that are caused. This is very much an issue of not only money being loss, but talent, research, all that.

Therefore, this pressures universities to adopt something other than online only, such as reopening. Physical reopenings would serve as an example for the administration to gesture to, saying that the pandemic is ‚Äúover‚Äù or that ‚Äúthe worst is over‚Äù. 

Secondly, if universities refuse, the administration can then deport foreign internationals out of xenophobia."
79,"> Is ICE seriously trying to remove the one group of immigrants who are paying north of $70k+ a year to be here.

More like they're trying to force universities to reopen."
80,"Most of trumps base is uneducated, and hates the Chinese and the educational system. Since over a million of the students affected will be Chinese (according to PBS), this is like a trump fans home run."
81,"It's more that they're already here and it's impossible logistically to try to ship people out of the country on short notice.  There's money issues involved with plane tickets and people's stuff as well as other things.  

International students are pretty close to Americans if you think of many of them joining the work force with a high-end job and really being the example of what the American dream is, so if we were to reform immigration at all the immigrants going to college to make the country look better are not the ones we would want to target"
82,"> These guidelines for international students make literally no fucking sense. 

They make sense given they are written by people who want to make life hell for immigrants and foreigners."
83,I think you mean to say ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt change the lack of logic‚Äù
84,That's insane. Good luck man. I hope it all works out for you and the government stops trying to make it unnecessarily difficult
85,"Some might be rich, but some international students would have mortgaged their parents‚Äô house for a one way plane ticket and tuition. Or they might have gotten a scholarship that just covers tuition and have to rely on loans for everything else. We had an international student ‚Äòhouse‚Äô that we maintain and rent out during the summers to students who can‚Äôt afford to fly home. Usually there‚Äôre 5-6 people in a 2 bedroom house. No one I know flies home at all. They work on campus during the school year and work full time during the summers to survive. This ruling would sink them. They already got kicked out of affordable on-campus housing in the spring, and arbitrarily forcing them to fly back and forth at elevated flight prices is just cruel at this point.

A lot of kids will see their American Dream die if this holds up in court."
86,"The intention of this new government policy is probably to encourage universities to allow students back on campus in the fall, to help revive local economies and to reduce unemployment."
87,"God I hope they win. I'm hoping that universities loophole their way around this at a minimum. You know, \*technically\* offer things in-person so that their classes, on paper, aren't all online.

Or just abolish ICE, that works too."
88,"Yes, because it was never about ‚Äúmuh jobs‚Äù or ‚Äúmuh resources‚Äù.

It‚Äôs pure tribalism - the drank the foul kool aid and now they‚Äôre thralls, devoid of any semblance of independent thought."
89,"Yeah, I get its a joke, but people shouldn't go around believing that its just buffoonery when its logical.  If it were funny enough to laugh at I wouldn't have explained anything."
90,Hes trying to get as many people as possible to request a new roommate so he ends up in a single. 
91,"Roommate who claims to have ocd and demand cleanliness is bring a ferret, one of the messiest and stinkiest animals? (Ferrets are adorable though). Bit shady if you ask me. "
92,That was my first thought! The exaggerated tone feels like too much to be real.
93,"The insistence that the lights be on all night and that the room be spotless at all times would be enough that you should be able to request an immediate change from Housing.

I guarantee this person would bring High Drama into the life of any roommate."
94,"Man, this is a great tactic to get a dorm room to yourself..."
95,"Its his emotional support animal.

Edit: I'm not mocking Emotional support animals here, I'm mocking the idea of a ferret being anything but a ball of fur and chaos."
96,Schizo > OCD 
97,"Yeah, that's a **strong no**. Ferrets are high maintenance, finicky, and bitey. If you're not a huge fan of them, you do not want to be living with one. 

Also, the *demand* that you make all the effort to accommodate their OCD is not acceptable. A disability will require some accommodation, but it has to go both ways. If they dump all of that work onto you, then that isn't their disability, it's just them being irresponsible and refusing to take ownership of the space and of their behaviour. They'll continually refuse to make any concessions to you that they don't already agree with, no matter how minor, and every tiny crumb that they blow up over will always be blamed on you. 

Drop them like a hot potato. 

And if the university asks why you need to switch, don't feel bad about (tactfully) telling them the truth. If they have a ferret, they'll need permission to bring it. If they have OCD that bad, they really should have notified the college so that accommodations could be made and expectations laid out. Absolutely anyone who dorms with that person is going to have problems, and it won't be fair on them. "
98,omg OP please do this

100,"Sounds more like an overdramatic weirdo rather than someone with severe OCD. 

I have fairly bad OCD and it is true that some people with it can not stand anything out of place or for anything to be dirty but people like that usually wont even own dogs bc they are so dirty.

But the fact that he has a ferret is throwing up red flags to me. Ferrets usually smell god awful and they defecate alll day. So he can clean ferret shit all day but will have a panic attack if there are crumbs? 

&#x200B;

Is there any way you can get a different roommate? "
101,Holy fuck I should've done this lmaooo
102,"I think that‚Äôs what happened with the person I was supposed to room with. He mentioned all sorts of things that were ‚Äúrequired‚Äù of me if we were going to share a room. Mandatory bedtime, no dust anywhere, he even demanded to be the only person allowed to touch the thermostat, because he apparently needed the room to be as cold as possible when he slept. I got in contact with the university to arrange for a different roommate, and I found out that he had already been paired with 3 other guys that swapped. In the end, he decided that living in a single worked best for him, and it was so close to the start of the semester that I just wound up on my own in a double room."
103,"But he says that requires extreme cleanliness, no?"
104,This seems very fake. Either they are messing with you or you should seriously consider doing everything in your power to get out of rooming with them. When rooming with someone even the smallest things can get annoying and they have far too many annoying preferences 
105,"Also, your cum box and poop knife."
106,"Bring the printer, but keep the paper and ink separate since i assume they will make you bring your own rice for the rice cooker."
107,"hahaha Wow, I am just now realizing the irony of owning a ferret while claiming to have crippling OCD. That‚Äôs hilarious. 

"
108,Dude the roommate literally says they have ocd and the room needs to be cleaned at all times or they'll have a panic attack. Did you even read it?
109,"Yeah, OP, get a new roommate.  I doubt that this person actually suffers from OCD.  It's more likely that he's an overdramatic whiner, and that's going to take a toll if you're living with him.  It's one thing to enjoy control (and even that can become a problem); it's another to be rude and demanding.  This person expects you to conform to his every need without even scant regard for yours.  He even expects you to foot the bill for a microwave, printer, *and* fridge?  And the way he says he doesn't need to know anything about you -- in his first response, no less -- comes off as presumptuous and dismissive.

But even if he does genuinely have OCD, that doesn't change anything.  He's still being a rude prick.  Disorder doesn't shield asshole-ery.  Email your R.A."
110,Win for you too. Fuck yeah 
111,this comment thread needs to be clean at all times or I will have a panic attack.
112,"Respond: ""I have OCD too! If crumbs aren't left out and clothes scattered all over the floor I will literally DIE. My other compulsion is touching other people's stuff and moving it out of place. If you try to stop me, I start getting stabby.

I keep a pet emu that hasn't yet been potty trained. You will have to pick up it's droppings as I am a germophobe and can't do that.

I don't mind keeping the lights on but you should know I have a c-pap machine that makes extremely loud noises at night and I can only sleep while hardcore metal is blasting over speakers. Headphones won't work because I can't stand things on my ears.

I have severe social anxiety and can't talk to people on the phone so if you have a panic attack and need to be hospitalized you have call the ambulance on your own.

I haven't found anything that can print microwaves, but I will keep a lookout."""

114,"well, it would support a certain emotion if the dude actually has OCD, just not in a positive way."
115,"Compulsive cleaning and obsessions are, however, nobody is suggesting this is the sole definition of the disorder. Nobody has suggested it is called Obsessive Cleanliness Disorder; in part because it is grammatically incorrect. Relax."
116,"I can‚Äôt for the life of me remember, but I read the most fucked up story once about a poop knife. Basically this guy‚Äôs family kept a wooden-handled steak knife in a bucket in their laundry room, which was adjacent to the bathroom. Whenever someone had a huge turd, they would cut it in half to flush. 

One time he went to a friends house, took a shit, and asked his friend, ‚ÄúCould you grab me the poop knife?‚Äù.

117,That's the most likely. If he actually had OCD he could get a single if he gets documentation.

129,"I got downvoted to oblivion *and* permabanned for making one (1) post commenting on how negative and hateful towards students that entire sub seems to be after lurking for months. They hate when they are emailed or contacted by the student in any way, they regularly recommend ccing/contacting the student's advisor over any petty dispute but absolutely lose their shit (in this sub as well) at the mere suggestion of a student contacting the dean or dept chair in the same manner when a professor does the exact same things, and I've seen numerous profs there suggest referring students to disability services over personal disputes or as a clear attack on them, which is really gross and specifically what I commented for when I got banned.

Like if you really loathe your job and the customers paying literally thousands to be there and resent even having to answer an email, just quit. You don't have to do this career lol like damn."
130,"My office hours are on Teams and it was slow to connect one day‚Ä¶.It was week 14/16, no one had ever attended my office hours which are at 12.  I was joining AT 12 instead of my usual 11:50 and I heard ‚Äúthat bitch better be here or I‚Äôll be so annoyed‚Äù‚Ä¶.so I asked, ‚Äúwho needs to be here and why are we annoyed?‚Äù   And he actually thought he covered with ‚Äúoh I meant a friend‚Äù.  Uh huh."
131,That sub is toxic af

133,this has such a sad undertone lol

139,"No - I‚Äôm a professor at a large regional R1 with a diverse population of (mostly) working students, and none of them have ever said anything like that to me. I think you‚Äôre thinking of someone else."
140,LMAO that‚Äôs so sad
141,No more toxic than this sub. Don't be hypocritical.
142,"Exactly, teachers set such unrealistic expectations. Why can't they allow you to submit assignments with no penalty 2 weeks after they are due? Then I would get another 13 days and 19 hours to think about starting."
143,It's literally all grad students or people who have been teaching for less than two years.
144,"I legit set some due dates in one of my classes a day before I want the assignments actually turned in so I get them ""on time"". It works *uncomfortably* well lol."

146,Proof is left as an exercise to the reader
147,Nah it always get the busiest within 2-3 days before the exams or assignment due
148,"Students: ""but I've been confused on the homework for three weeks!"""
149,I think it really depends on the professor. Some can‚Äôt wait for you to leave and then others are happy to help as long as you aren‚Äôt asking them to hold your hand basically.
150,Thank you so much. I wish you strangers knew just how much your comments mean to me.
151,Thank you so very much. He did give the best hugs.

180,"I remember doing that once in calc 1.  I had no idea what I was doing, came in, thought the exam got rescheduled when it wasn't.  When I heard that it was test day I walked out.  It'd been a pretty shit day beforehand so I just couldn't take it.  I did manage getting a good grade overall.. after you do that, you never want to miss a test again!"
181,"This is why you need to have a good relationship with the professor, people! "
182,Reading these comments and feeling blessed that my university doesn‚Äôt make us buy scantrons lol 
183,What college makes you buy scantrons?
184,He dropped one test and curved the hell out of everything else.  [Evil laughter]
185,"> University makes you pay for them, we have to buy them at our text bookstore on campus. 

Just when I thought universities figured out how to squeeze every possible fucking dime out of students"
186,"Wow wtf. With the cost of tuition, these schools should easily cover that cost on their own. Absolutely sad."
187,What do you mean brings a scantron? Doesn‚Äôt your professor just hand them out to you?
188,"How in the world do you get a good grade after missing an exam in a weedout like Calc 1? I'd assume the best you'd be able to get is like a 2.8 assuming you did perfect on everything else

"
189,might of been a genuine good student that just made a silly mistake.
190,"There was a student who showed up to the third midterm and saw everyone studying in the hallway, and asked in a panic if there was an exam that day. When we said yes, she freaked and told her friend that she hadn't shown up at all ever since the second midterm because she didn't think there was another exam. I always wonder how she did. Lol "
191,"No my University makes you pay for them, we have to buy them at our text bookstore on campus. I always brought extras to give to kids who didn't have any, other kids would see the opportunity and would charge $2 per Scantron and we could buy it for $0.25 at the store. A guy said he would buy me coffee when I gave him a Scantron but I told him was no big deal because it was only $0.25 to me. "
192,"UC Davis student here, all my classes require that I buy them myself."
193,At some schools you have to provide and bring your own scantron
194,"And I bet this student is going to write a shitty review on RateMyProfessor letting everyone know how terribly their instructor treated them. 

Reminds me of a student I had (I‚Äôm a prof) who pulled out a cell phone during a midterm. I called this student out (since I it is considered cheating to do so), gave them a warning, then I let them continue their exam. Was this student grateful? No. They complained to my chair about how badly I treated them. I should have taken their test and given them a zero on it (as the campus academic honesty policy allows me to do).  "
195,[deleted]
196,[deleted]
197,Highest score being 70/100 but average was 55/100 they got IIRC 62/100. The class was heavily curved. 30 multiple choice 2 points each....4 written/graph/analyzing questions 10 pts each. The student ended up forgetting about the next exam as well and they asked the professor what would be a University approved excuse for a make up exam and the professor told em to leave class haha. 
198,"Same, didn't know Scantrons were such a valuable currency."
199,"I once knew a guy like this. It was a senior level course in inorganic chemistry, crystal structures, and its applications to ceramic engineering. This guy was a ghost for most of the semester. We had a group project on beta silicon nitride and he showed up the day of the presentation ready to wing it. We fucked up hard needless to say. Please take a minute and look up Si3N4 crystal structures and you‚Äôll see what a shit show that was. 

Anyway, the final exam rolls around and my truck broke down! I couldn‚Äôt get to class on time! No worry, I had a motorcycle. I got on and rode like hell through a snow flurry and got to my exam 30 minutes late. It‚Äôs okay, though. We get 2 hours to complete this final and I‚Äôm pretty competent. As I‚Äôm scribbling away equations with 15 minutes to go, I put my final touches on my exam and prepare to turn it in. When all of a sudden, I hear the door open. 

It‚Äôs the ghost. Sprinting in to take a serious exam for his college career with 15 minutes on the clock. Everyone in the class was in disbelief. It was as if we all knew right then and there that his life was just a series of moments much like this. Always ghosting others and shirking responsibility until the last 15 minutes. 

I turned in my exam, left the room and paid my respects to a dead man walking on my way out. 

He repeated that course and had the same attitude from what I heard. I think he may flunk out, but who knows. "
200,office hours aren't just for going when you need help with work. talk to your professor outside of class if you ever see them around. let them get to know you.
201,That's incredibly generous. 
202,"Can confirm. Had to buy our own scantrons at my University as well.

Pro tip: I bought a pack of 100 on Amazon for the same price as the University sold packs of 10. Brought the whole pack to class every exam period and offered them up for $1 each on exam day. I got my money back and then some. "
203,So... a syllabus
204,"There was a girl in one of my policy classes that did this exact thing. Exam was on the last day of class, she hadn't been coming for weeks and was bugging out saying she almost didn't come that day but figured she should since it was the last day.

We were allowed one page of notes and the professor very kindly said that if someone had an extra they were willing to give her she could use it. She had been such a smug bitch over the course of the semester though that there was a veryyyy long pregnant pause before someone felt guilty enough to throw her a bone ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
205,"That conversation (between student and chair) was private but my chair did suggest I not give a warning next time. I should just walk over and quietly explain to the student why they are getting a zero. (Rather than what I did which was to announce, ‚Äúhey so-and-so, you will receive a zero on this exam if you don‚Äôt put your phone away.‚Äù )

This way I‚Äôm informing college policies, with tact, and leaving little room for complaints. "
206,Sit in the front of class and always look like you‚Äôre paying attention and interested in what they‚Äôre saying.  Ask engaging questions.
207,I had a public speaking class and I showed up not knowing I had to do an eight minute speech. Everyone heard me panic and there were slight chuckles as I asked the teacher when the talk was due only to find out it was right then and there. I did an on-the-spot talk about the importance of preparing for exams and good study habits people can adapt to be ready for test day. I did fine on the talk but still lost a lot of points because I didn't have a written outline with me.
208,">I once showed up to the last day of class in philosophy without my paper lol, it wasn‚Äôt even finished. I wasn‚Äôt used to summer schedule being over so soon. When I saw everyone else with their papers on their desk, I literally felt like running away since I always considered myself one of the most passionate students in the class. I decided to just stay and sat through class in shock. I talked to the prof afterwards and he said my work throughout the semester was so good he knew it was an accident and not just laziness. He let me turn it in through email two days later and trust me I went hard on that paper. He said it was a wonderful paper and gave me 100/100.

but how to do that? "
209,"Ding ding ding. Professors are human and want to feel appreciated and valued. If you give them your full attention and actively engage with their teaching, they will like you more. If they like you more, you have more leeway.

By the way.. this protip works with coworkers and bosses too."
210,truly a gem among professors
211,wish my profs were like this
212,haha yeah she does that too. she drops the two lowest quizzes and offered this. she‚Äôs really nice
213,"same here, lol just had one take 15% off a quiz because I submitted it 10 minutes late... which was only because he made us do the quiz on loose leaf and I had to scan it..."
214,"Like everyone has said... but we NEED more professors like this, not just for COVID times, but \*all\* the time..."
215,you should tell her how much this means to you im sure she‚Äôd appreciate hearing it
216,"I have a professor who told us if we miss or are 5 minutes late to 3 classes, we immediately fail the entire class. It‚Äôs an online class and my campus wifi is notoriously horrible, & we aren‚Äôt even allowed to bring our own wifi router to our dorms/apartments, & internet connection issues aren‚Äôt an ‚Äúacceptable excuse‚Äù for missing or being late to class!!! It irritates me soooo much!!! I‚Äôve already used all my data for this month bc the wifi is so unreliable & I can‚Äôt miss any classes."
217,"profs at my school try to make you feel like they care like this but they dont actually. so theyre always saying ""oooh you can let me know if somethings up and we'll work it out"" but then theyre so inflexible and unforgiving"
218,i plan to email her and thank her. i haven‚Äôt really had trouble with her assignment but i know it‚Äôs been hard on a lot of people.
219,[deleted]
220,"god they sound terrible lmfaooo. how can you be so unsympathetic, especially RIGHT NOW when you don‚Äôt know a students situation. is there anything you can do about that professor like switching instructors ?"
221,"unsurprisingly, my female professors have been extremely understanding and actually helpful. but in general i‚Äôve only had one asshat professor (he told me drive 2 hours after a devastating hurricane, when there was no gas, so that i would have wifi to do assignments)"
222,"i emailed my professor that my computer is not usable (fried motherboard) and asked for a few days extension on an essay so i can get my computer repaired. his response was that if i have the means to email him, i have the means to write the essay, and also that i should have done it ahead of time bc ""expect the unexpected"""
223,"Taking macro econ for a second time (withdrew first time). First time professor was horrible. Absolute ""IDGAF about you or anything that happened to you"" guy. Second one is a really nice guy, but is trying to be like the first one because he is the head of the econ department. Sad to see an amazing professor look up to a superior and think his methods are the best."
224,"Professor here. I strongly discourage my students from doing class readings or any course work on a phone. If I ever ask anyone to write an essay on a phone, then please take me out back and shoot me. 

About 2 years ago I stopped enforcing most deadlines and things have never been better for everyone involved. I don't understand the rigidness of colleagues"
225,i‚Äôm sure your students really appreciate that. professors that boast a 50% average are weird
226,I know for some majors an 80% is well above the average grade for a quiz but I just couldn‚Äôt imagine if you needed the mental health break and then you use that pass just to bring your total grade down
227,Report him to the university. This is abhorrent behavior and unlikely to be substantiated if you apply any sort of pressure. Make sure that you cite the specific part where he mentions only a few minutes late = failure.
228,the economics of labor
229,it‚Äôs better than a 0. we have quizzes every week so if you‚Äôre doing well everywhere else it‚Äôs not gonna go down too much
230,"i know right!!! & unfortunately no:( it was so hard to even get into that class as is. & i actually really do like that professor,  it just annoys me that he'd have such rigid & unforgiving rules when everything is so chaotic & weird rn"
231,[deleted]
232,this is awesome
233,What class is this?
234,"I mean yeah smartphones exist but it‚Äôs still pretty impossible to write an essay and upload it, with all the correct formatting and styling, entirely on a smartphone."
235,"You‚Äôd be surprised. I was. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to encounter people who belittle and dismiss those who are dealing with mental health problems, and see those who suffer from it as ‚Äúweak‚Äù. When in fact, they are the ones who are strong! They continue to try, despite the suffering no one can see or understand. They endure more to do the same things healthier minded people do, and still get looked down on and stigmatized. 

My mom taught me something one day that I‚Äôll never forget.

‚ÄúYou never know what someone is going though.‚Äù 

She taught me compassion for others."
236,world needs more of this
237,As a STEM major I find most exams are unforgiving üòÇ
238,that‚Äôs really disheartening. my marco econ prof. was soooo nice. we experienced a rlly bad hurricane that semester and ended the class with only 3 people in it. she would bring us hot meals and coffee bc none of us had power and she was staying at a hotel out of town. No one got below B- because that was the cutoff for our majors. i know that that probably wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúright‚Äù for a professor but i will never forget her bc of it.
239,"they aren‚Äôt helpful, even if they‚Äôre not teaching well they still think they‚Äôre gods, they think students are at their beck and call, things like that"
240,A prof that does NOT give an extension for a grandparent's death is an ass. Has this actually happened to anyone?
241,Bravo to that department head
242,"It was the English department, and a class she had taught before. 

There was no going back for me with the professor, she basically said after I told her she was disrespectful that she wasn't comfortable having me as a student in her class. However, the class was required for me to graduate, and the professor doing that would of forced me to put off my graduation by a whole semester. She knew that, which I think was the icing on the cake for her. Department head was having none of that petty bullshit, however."
243,Thank you. Honestly it was a bit shocking with the timing. She's been in hospice a few weeks and when we got the call she passed I couldn't wrap my mind around it. I thought she'd be here a little bit longer.
244,"Wow, that's ridiculous. Seems like an odd solution on the part of the dept head, though."
245,Yeah I also wouldn't trust that prof to grade fairly after that kind of interaction.
246,I‚Äôm sorry for your loss
247,Tenured professors act like this. They‚Äôre such assholes sometimes
248,"She was a tenured professor, and technically my telling her to get fucked was also grounds for disciplinary action. So I guess they saw not punishing either of us as more fair than both or one over the other."
249,I wanna give your professor a hug... wow.
250,We are all so sorry for your loss. Sending love to you and your family. ‚ù§Ô∏è
251,"I got an Incomplete because my professor died, does that count? I was going to miss finals because I had to get surgery, but all my professors were cool with it and let me take the finals a few days after. However, one of them didn't put the grade in the system. I asked, he said he would, then he went on sabbatical, came back, retired and then died. I had to retake the class, but I feel bad being pissed about it, because I liked the guy and he fucking died."
252,"I provided the funeral program, proof of travel, and even offered to provide a copy of the death certificate. 

That being said, most professors don't take any excused absences seriously if they have to do with my fiancee, despite our living together, being together for over 4 years, and our finances honestly being completely intertwined. We're waiting until after school (we're starting graduate school together now) to get married because we would both lose out on financial aid otherwise. All of that being said, I've had 2 professors straight up tell me to ""stop playing house and focus on college, I can find a girlfriend when I'm done."" She had to go to the hospital once and I took the unexcused absence instead of explaining the situation because they'd already told me absences related to my significant other ""don't count."" 

I thought it being a funeral would mean that professors would be more understanding but nopeeee. 

And the department head is fantastic and I've got the utmost respect for her. I learned more in that one on one class than I have learned in almost any other course. It was challenging, and took up a lot more time than a regular class, but it was totally worth it."
253,Thank you.
254,Sorry for your loss. That prof is an angel
255,Wow she got pissed off over missing the first day of class? How dare you not come in to get a copy of the syllabus you‚Äôve probably already printed at home.
256,Did she not get a disciplinary or something?
257,I guess that makes sense. Pretty ridiculous situation though!
258,Yeah I thought about that. He actually follows no religion and is spiritual from what I gather. But sad thats even a thought that comes to our minds. :(
259,"Yeah, that's not right. Did you talk to the department chair?"
260,"It was the Perfect Storm of incompetence. Our college was in the process of being merged into another (Applied Sciences -> Engineering), so we didn't have a department head, and the new one wouldn't help because the merge wasn't finished. They also kept canceling all the core-classes me and the other few remaining people in my program needed. Combine that with my 4th Academic Advisor in 4 years, as they kept quitting, and it was just a complete shit show. I was so fed up with the University that I didn't even go to my graduation. I appreciate what I learned there, but screw academia.  
  
Oh, and I reordered a physical copy of my degree since I never got one in the mail (to be honest, I moved 3 times in college), and when the degree came, it has my graduation date AS THE DATE THAT I ORDERED THE DEGREE ON! 6 fucking years after graduation. All I could do is laugh the tears away. I have completely washed my hands of that University."
261,I had to move to take a new job right before graduating. All my professors let me take my exams a few days early except for one professor. Said he would fail me if i didn't show up for my final and would not let me take it early. I went to the dean who said tough shit so I had to fly round trip the same day and my professor made me take it in the airport because he didn't want me to leak the exam early online.
262,"You provided the documentation and she still kicked you out?  I too have a first class attendence requirement and will remove students if there are students on the waitlist.  However, if provided documentation I make exceptions.  I need the documentation to support a student on the waitlist from filing a grievance for not following the stated policy.

However, a student providing me a plane ticket as they will not be back for the first day of the semester, that was not appropriate reason so documentation was irrelevant.

Kudos to the department head as that is alot of additional work for them."
263,"Thank you. He really is. He's also my advisor and mentor too, so I feel so thankful he's in my life!"
264,The last line was beautiful.
265,"Kings of tiny hills who get paid less than a fresh-out-of-bootcamp Software Engineer -- of course they tend to be bullies, power's all that job offers them."
266,"As a personally agnostic/atheist person, I see no problem with the professor offering their prayers for OP and OPs family. It‚Äôs normal and kind for someone to offer prayers especially when others are going through hard times, and by no means are they forcing religion on other people. 
On the other hand, your comment is made just to be inflammatory, when in reality, there‚Äôs not been a single person who‚Äôs attacked the prof for being religious/spiritual. Just keep that in mind, please..."
267,"That's ridiculous. It's one thing to ask to take it late, but to refuse to let you take early?"
268,"It is one of the top 5 Universities in the state. I don't want to point them out because they'd probably sue. That surgery i mentioned? Turned out that the student health insurance didn't cover it (even though I went to the student health center, and they drove me to that hospital).  4-5 years later I was sued for the hospital bill and had to pay $12k out of pocket to stop them from garnishing my wages, which they won the court case for as uncontested because no one informed me there WAS a court case."
269,"If you sue a University, there's a chance that they'll rescind your degree, and I need that.  At the very least, they'll TRY to, and they have much more money to throw at lawyers than I have.
  
As for the hospital, the original amount was ~$24k, but I got a lawyer (~$4k) who told me that there was nothing I could do about the court case since the judge already ruled, but he could get it knocked down because the Hospital's lawyer worked a few doors down from him, and he could work directly with him. 
  
I have my dream job now, and I live in Hawaii. I try to let it be like water off a duck's back, but every now and then it comes up and I get spittin' mad."

272,"Just got an 80 on a final project. 

Professor‚Äôs feedback: ‚ÄúIt seems like you included content you learned from another class.‚Äù

Oh, I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt realize education was one-dimensional?"
273,I got the highest grade in the class on a paper that I wrote the night before it was due. It took me about 3 hours to write (not counting the breaks I took playing FIFA). I didn‚Äôt even bother with a rough draft. The professor asked me to share my process with the class and I just lied and said I spent days revising and editing
274,No. It comes off as pretentious and honestly with 6 hours you can write a pretty good paper. Just be glad your professor liked it.
275,28 pages

284,It would be funny if the Professor was being sarcastic lol
285,"Haha those night-before deadlines really do light a fire under your ass, nice job."
286,"I had a history professor in undergrad who assigned nothing but 600-800 word papers. This was a strict limit. You had to be able to express your idea in no more than 800 words. His reasoning was that for years he assigned 5+ page papers and they all go tedious and shitty with undergrads trying to fill space, so he starting pairing them back. He believed that 800 was a good upper limit.

And honestly, the papers I wrote for his class were some of my best because I didn‚Äôt have to wax poetic about bullshit to make a word count. As an English Major I‚Äôd been trained to write and write and expound on nothing. His class forced me to be concise and cut straight to the point and in some ways were way harder than anything else I wrote in undergrad."
287,"I brain dump the body of the paper, then I write the into and conclusion, then I rearrange the paragraphs and move quotes around so that it sounds more coherent. Then I switch intro and conclusion because my intros always read more like a conclusion and I never know how to conclude a paper and it ends up sounding much more thesis-like than I‚Äôm able to come up with by trying to think of a thesis. And I‚Äôve always made an A-/A on my papers this year."
288,"Gotta disagree on that. Just because you didn‚Äôt write it over the span of weeks or days doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not top quality. If you know how to write about the topic, support your viewpoints, and answer any questions the prompt gives, you can easily write top quality work in a short amount of time.

Now I‚Äôm not saying this applies to something like writing a 20+ page thesis from scratch in a few hours, but your average college essay you can. Also it depends on person to person."
289,"My high school was regarded as one of the best liberal arts/humanities high schools in the city. My friend, who isn't a particularly strong essay writer, wrote a personal essay literally 2 hours before it was due, skipping classes to write it in the library.


He got an A+ on the essay and was told by our teacher that it was one of the best personal essays he's ever had the pleasure of reading, and he'd love to keep it to use as an example for future classes. Did I mention our teacher was also the head of the English department?


It's amazing what stuff you can poop out under a few hours of time pressure."
290,Dont say anything and email them if you need a letter of recommendation
291,Undergraduate. History.
292,Yay for interdisciplinary!!
293,"I wrote my entire final paper in a span of 9 hours (the first 3 of which were writing the code I was supposed to have been working on for the previous month), from ~1-10 am, then turned it in at 10:55, 5 minutes before it was due. He said he might post grades today, if he does I'll update this comment."
294,"I had a teacher tell me in high school she knew I BS-ed every bit of it but it was one Hell of an argument.  I did it all last minute too.  Sometimes, you just let the magic live as long as it needs to."
295,"It hardly seems like criticism? At the end of the day they're only being graded based on the curriculum, any content beyond what is needed is frankly, unnecessary, and the teacher was informing them of this."

300,Unprofessional? The professor sounds drunk lol
301,"Serious question, how many people actually look at canvas a month before the class starts?? 

I wouldn‚Äôt want to start assignments that early in case something changed by the start date."
302,"Jesus, I know we're all burnt out, but the Prof could just post a rant on the professors subreddit like the rest of us."
303,"It's just downright unprofessional, there would've been no tolerance for it the other way around.

Also, who tf is gonna look at, and work on assignments even a single day before class starts? Screw that."
304,Highly unprofessional wtf
305,Bro what fucking college is this?? Holy hell this is worst than my highschool man lmao
306,At my institution Canvas only goes live 2 days prior.
307,This might seriously be what is going on here. Lol
308,What the hell lol
309,The worst part is that he thinks you would begin working on the course meterial 1.5 months before the course started.
310,"They're allowed to send messages like this, but if we send an actual professional email to them and forget something small like calling them professor or wrong punctuation then they throw a hissy fit. The double standards are strong. SMFH..."

312,"......wow! wow wow...... 

Lol drunk indeed"
313,Yep!
314,"Yeah burnt out - I believe you. Last semester I asked my writing & revision prof how she was doing. ""Very badly"" was the reply that I got. Ouch. 

I do notice that my profs are more stressed now after 2 years of administration bullshit. As are my friends."
315,"> Also, who tf is gonna look at, and work on assignments even a single day before class starts? Screw that.

I would because I liked to get ahead of things. Made for a more relaxing semester. But I don't think it's something that should be required for students taking the course. And this was definitely unprofessional."
316,‚Ä¶.wow‚Ä¶.wow‚Ä¶.. this Professor needs to take a communications class and reconsider his passions in life because ‚Ä¶..wow‚Ä¶. Education is definitely not it.
317,"1. A book every two weeks is a lot when you have other classes.
2. In no way are you required or even encouraged to start homework before the class has even started. Will I be getting extra credits for starting 5 weeks earlier? 
3. Super unprofessional and honestly disgusting behavior."

319,Yeah it‚Äôs like a week at most usually
320,I think Iowa State
321,"Ours doesn‚Äôt even go up until the first day of classes. It‚Äôs so frustrating not being able to see the syllabus until classes start, I have no clue why they did it like that"
322,Vast majority don‚Äôt look at a single thing before the first day of class
323,wow
324,lolll i think they might have been a little mad‚Ä¶
325,I would tell the department head about this tbh
326,wow wow....
327,"IMO, yes, that‚Äôs unprofessional. No student is required to do work during winter break, even if the Prof opened up Canvas a month before classes even started. It‚Äôs only optional and I think most people would want to enjoy their break. I‚Äôd drop that class lol"
328,"Why not? 

I'm not saying the humanities are useless, and I don't think that's what the original person you're replying to is suggesting either. But, consider how busy the average college student is. Art History is an elective 95% of the time. If I'm going to work ahead in classes before they even start and spend my precious little time doing so, it ain't gonna be on an elective. This professor has lost sight of what it is they're actually providing to the vast, vast majority of their students."
329,"Drunk? *voww* 

Apparently being a little casual is ""rude"" with a college student now *voww* *voww* *voww*

I'm embarrassed for you..

Edit: I meant to mock the professor. Clearly I've failed."
330,"Lmfao - The yoga part got me!

Bill ""5G"" Gates!  -> Perfection!

Sadly, this is the truth in some Universities. It's a very bad idea to bring back the student body - I don't know where the fuck you've been, who you've been in contact with for the past so many months, and let's face it - most of the kids in college are so fucking disgusting.

All of this is common sense - but common sense isn't so common unfortunately."

345,"Yeah I don't understand why people are so in love with their college and walk around with so much branded shit. Has nobody even read their bill? I'm at my school to get a degree so I can get a good, stable job and that's it. Fuck this racket their running to shake me down."
346,"if universities went online for the semester and had select few classes/labs on campus for those who are able to commute, then our spring semester and lives wouldn‚Äôt be in jeopardy"
347,"Ahhhh shit, this is too real. I work for campus security and they'd promised us extra masks as well as a few bottles of hand sanitizer since we have to walk around and pull on doors and still interact with people who come to campus. Three weeks after that they gave us all 3 masks that were too small and one box of gloves to share among the whole crew. Not long after that, they announced that, because of the slumping economy and these unforeseen circumstances, nobody on campus was getting raises, not even to match inflation, all because the pandemic was making the financial situation ""difficult"".

The only thing they did to show us that we were ""valued"" as essential workers? They gave us a water bottle from the college bookstore and a coupon for 1 free donut from a local shop that, when we received it, would expire in 2 weeks."

351,"Like OP said, a lot of this revolves around money. Unfortunately, many University administrations don't have common sense when making these types of decisions."
352,Please report back with the outcome.
353,I am so glad my university is going online for the fall. But I will say they were trying their damnest to have us on campus. I miss being at school in person. But i like not being sick and not being forced to wear a mask the moment I step out of my room more.
354,Lmao
355,Thank you. You can probably tell I‚Äôm working through some things right now.

359,"This was pure gold and hilariously accurate. Surprised you didn‚Äôt mention schools literally building tents to host socially distanced classes in.

391,This is why a lot of students are campaigning for pass/fail options and suing schools for their tuition back. This whole semester has been a hastily put together experience imho and most of my teachers have not lived up to the promises UML gave us
392,"I have a 0 for a paragraph-length quiz we took in one of my classes because I joined like 3 minutes late due to internet problems and I didn‚Äôt realize until 20 minutes or so in that there was a quiz. I did it and gave a pretty decent response I think, but still a 0. I emailed her yesterday about it so we‚Äôll see lmao"
393,"Regarding the point that students know what to expect now, it's also true that the situation in certain respects has worsened since spring 2020. For example there was (some of) a stimulus then, but the money has dried up now, and folks‚Äîincluding plenty of students and their families‚Äîare struggling to pay bills. It's likely to get worse, not better, especially since winter will contribute to a higher case rate.

The declining economic situation might suggest that some kind of slack is due."
394,"I think every professor will tell you that our perception of the situation is diametrically opposed to yours.  We have been urged repeatedly by our administrations to be as lenient as possible WHILE maintaining the same academic standards (WUT??); in my institution, not to take attendance; to allow students who have not attended class to nonetheless evaluate us, which effects our job applications and opportunities for tenure/promotion; to decrease the amount of work students are responsible for; to be prepared to ""pivot"" from one mode of instruction to another, as needed, without warning; to retool classes we've taught successfully in person for years or decades to an online format; and finally to do the ""emotional labor"" of being strong and positive in front of students when many of us have childcare obligations, elderly parents to care for, etc.  Students can miss one or several class meetings without question or reprisal; we cannot. I can't speak for all of professordom, but I personally am feeling very squeezed by the demand to deliver high-quality instruction, each day, in an unfamiliar format, while it ever more difficult to demand anything of students due to the administration's fear that they'll jump ship and we'll lose much-needed revenue (insultingly little of which, by the way, goes into our pockets).  I also think it's worth mentioning that many of your instructors likely spent their summers, as I did, in endless ""professional development"" ""opportunities"" instructing us on how to teach you better online, time that we diverted from our scholarship (which is also vital to our advancement).  In my case, at least, these ""opportunities"" were expected but not compensated - i.e., I worked a job for free all summer to improve my students' experience in the fall.  So the idea that professors are being cut any slack, particularly as students who are dissatisfied in any way for in any reason (whether the fault of the instructor or not)  are able to head over to RMP to make their dissatisfaction very personal and very public, is not one I can agree with.

I do sympathize with your situation, however, and I have several students in the same boat, three of whom Zoom into my class at 4:30 a.m. their time.  They are among my best students and it blows my mind how awesome they are. There is no denying how difficult this is, and actually it's my response when my local students complain about having to the work - if my student in Indonesia hasn't seen sunlight in months and is crushing it, then you can bring yourself to turn something in, Abigail.  I admire your resolve, and I hope you can push yourself through. It sucks.

One thing we can all agree on, though, is that administrators can get fucked."
395,"My professor literally told us ""I honestly do not care about your feelings"" when some classmates and I were begging her for more assistance and a little slack.
The same professor didn't upload her lecture until 11pm due to an emergency, which kinda fucked everyone over.
Why they get slack and not us? Who knows"
396,"On the other hand, the ability to teach well shouldn‚Äôt be gated by technology itself. Especially when it‚Äôs constantly changing and you cannot keep up. That‚Äôs how companies get control over industries as an unnecessary middle man."
397,Oh good lord.
398,He's right though. People need to stop getting sick so this pandemic can just end.
399,"I have a couple professors that are bending over backwards to help us get through the material in spite of the shit we‚Äôre going through and others that are just kinda meh. It‚Äôs difficult though when we clearly have less say over how things play out.

Be sure to communicate with your professors. I have f***ed up a couple of times and my professors have really worked with me to set me straight. I missed two labs that I won‚Äôt get a make up for, but my professor sat with me for 4 or 5 hours over a couple days to make sure I learned to work the software and knew the material. Another one consistently adjusts due dates and adds extra bonus assignments to help us understand things. 

Over the summer I tutored a few kids from a professor that was absolute shit. No online lectures, no explanations. He told them to go to the tutoring center if they needed help and didn‚Äôt respond to emails at all. I gave them the email address to the department head and encouraged them and their frustrated friends to email her about his class, and this semester he‚Äôs improved significantly. 

Complain on Reddit, I‚Äôll totally validate your feelings on this. But also don‚Äôt limit your complaining to here."
400,"I have covid and was unable to get out of bed for 2 days, and then had an additional 2 days where I was being shuffled between short-term and long-term quarantine housing on my campus. i had to BEG my one prof for a single day extension on an assignment. i shouldn‚Äôt have to beg to not be stressed and allow my self to rest and get better"
401,"My Professor has told us he doesn‚Äôt know how to use Canvas..... just in general the entire website. However he will get mad if we have actual technical issues (WiFi going out, computer is too slow) and tells us to get better hardware. How can a grown ass man with a doctorate degree not understand how ridiculous that is?"

404,"Not really for me. For my chem class, we have tests that you need to start in a certain time window and if you can't due to technical difficulties, you're fucked."
405,"That's outrageous. I'd legitimately consider contacting the ombudsman or something if she doesn't reconsider. Professors that take tardiness as some unforgivable personal insult are the worst. College is hectic, and internet or software problems are uncontrollable and inevitable now, things are gonna go wrong. At most you can knock a point or two off but a complete 0? No, don't stand for that. You showed up, you did the work, you (presumably) understood the material, that's all that should matter. All that professor is teaching is that some people in authority are control freaks and you shouldn't tolerate them."
406,[deleted]
407,Oh that‚Äôs a good point I didn‚Äôt even think about the stimulus checks being gone. I do think teachers should be more understanding as long as the students are putting in the effort (and a lot of teachers are). It‚Äôs just we all need to keep moving forward bc at this rate most students won‚Äôt even get to be on campus in the spring
408,Some of my professors said on the syllabus ‚Äúno makeup exams. No extended time on assignments for any reason.‚Äù I had a mental break down yesterday about an assignment because I knew it would take forever and I started it late so I just never submitted it. My ADHD is getting worse and I had no health insurance so I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôd rather take the F than tell my professor I‚Äôm genuinely struggling in hopes that she would give me another day to do assignment I don‚Äôt understand.
409,Dude you should report that professor wtf.
410,"I always thought it was dumb that colleges want to act like a business,  you're the customer,  but yet nothing is in the ""customer's"" favor. Its a pretty messed up business model but imagine if it was super easy to transfer and you could go to college anywhere, just like choosing a place to shop. Colleges would be a lot better with customer service because they'd lose money if they weren't."
411,Did i mention anything about turning things in? No i said nothing about turning things in. Some of us live in rural areas and aren't graced with high speed internet that frequently has connection issues and our parent aren't willing to pay for better services. What exactly am i supposed to do when my zoom connection freezes during lecture because of internet connectivity issues luckily it hasn't happened during a test but when taking online tests I genenrally get less time per question because it takes ages to load each question. I wasn't going to delay a college education because of some shitty internet so I make do. My original comment had nothing to do with what you're talking about.
412,"I think I may have been thinking about the situation in a very student oriented manner. Yes, definitely teachers are also going through problems and having to deal with the pandemic as well, and believe me, I personally was very open in my thinking to give teachers the benefit of the doubt when any problems came up or just to cut some slack, and I still am, just to a lesser extent. The reason is because I expected students to get some slack too in the first month or so of the semester but I saw very very little forthcoming. I know it isn't a perfect society but I would've been more willing to cut some slack to teachers if we got the same in return. At this point it's just frustrating that I have to attend college in a pandemic as if these are normal times.
I also am pissed at those students who are using the pandemic as an excuse for their laziness and hate for college. I know I can't judge not knowing the full picture but there are definitely some out there who're doing this, ruining the experience for others.

And yes. Admin can get fucked."
413,"Yeah, also people should stop being hungry to solve world hunger, and people should stop fighting so that there's no more war.

Wow, that was easy."
414,What a coincident! I am supposed to take a quiz in an hour and internet has been out all day. And guess what I can‚Äôt even make it up! So all the comments defending profs and blaming it all on the students are utter bullshit.
415,"University of Phoenix isn‚Äôt just bad because it‚Äôs online. It‚Äôs bad because it hires under qualified faculty, doesn‚Äôt provide the resources they need, doesn‚Äôt foster innovative curriculum, and incentivizes faculty to structure their courses and programs into something resembling a diploma mill. 

The Art Institute isn‚Äôt online-only but also has earned the same bad reputation."
416,"That and work study is mostly out at my school. Normally, I'd have some money for basic necessities from work study plus other odd jobs. But since everything is online, almost everyone I know was either made redundant from their work study job or was not even placed into one because there are almost no remote jobs. The worst part is I don't have it the worst at all. I know some classmates who work for really crappy companies with no choice over their schedules who work night shifts, double shifts, insecurity over hours, etc., plus have to manage a full time workload or they will lose financial aid. And then you have these professors who get so offended that a student cannot come to their ""non-mandatory"" synchronous class or because a student cannot complete a busy work assignment that was hidden on Canvas, never discussed, and added with a day to spare! It is ridiculous, these professors need to have a heart."
417,I'm a grad student at UML and have been surprised at how well this semester has been put together. It's not the shit show I expected.
418,Hey i think you need to report that professor. That's harassment and also the professor is assuming your social class and background.
419,"There is more than just typical flu type things though.

There‚Äôs all sorts of shit that can happen where someone could use a few days off."
420,It depends. I've found that professors who only do research are some of the most uptight.

422,I‚Äôve had profs I have never seen in my life but apparently I took their class. They just let ththeir assistants do everything lol

426,F for the international students
427,That actually happens at a lot of these Ivies and T100. The professors focus is on research not necessarily teaching that‚Äôs why the TAs are so important.

Professors have a responsibility to organize the course, provide some feedback, suggest some assignments/readings, meet with you during office hours, but if you really want a top-notch education, then do more on your own. I bet if you ask any professor for advice on resources to learn more, they will give you plenty. 

A major part of earning a PhD is learning that you have so much more to learn, and being able to direct your own learning while getting paid for it."
444,Ohhh and the awkwardness ufff. Help theeeem hahhaa
445,Lol I make the same as a high school teacher.
446,no the reason he said he makes those type of questions is so that people actually pay attention when reading the question or something like that because then he stated things can be very obvious in college but he wanted us to be attentive or somewhere in that context. but don't worry because he only gave like a few of those type of questions on the tests
447,Lol my humanities professor freshman year posted a link on moodle to a video we were supposed to watch and it was that song
448,"As a professor, you‚Äôve described my motives perfectly. I tell people all the time I love my job because I get paid to talk about my passion all day long to people who came to be there. 

My husband is also glad I do what I do or I would be constantly jabbering on to him about some cool bug I found or a mushroom growing in my yard. Now I just take pictures and bring it to work to show my class who is excited as I am most of the time."
449,It's bc most professor just happen to be teaching or do it on the side along side other things.

452,"Oh I would go to the department chair, the dean, the university president or whatever it takes. That's straight bullshit. "
453,"Yeah, doing it during a campus tour would be the only thing they'd remotely care about."
454,not to defend the prof but letting in people late for a lecture is different than a letting people in late for a test or quiz. my programming prof lets people show up 15 min late for normal class before closing the door but on exams he only has the door open for maybe 5 min since he spends those minutes giving instructions since the tests might have a weird format or open ended segment. after that you are shit out of luck and have to find some way to retake a different version of the test.
455,"Don‚Äôt give a s***, I‚Äôm a senior about to graduate and really dislike this guy "
456,"Depends, how do you feel about dead rats nailed to your door?"
457,"He locked you out for being a couple seconds late? 

 Excuse my language but he is an asshole. Plain and simple. Speak to the director of the program. Hopefully he/she will fix it. "
458,Hahaha sure they can kick you out. You can also go talk to a lawyer right after they do that and have the media blast the school then transfer someplace else 
459,"Don't be petty. It will not help your case, even if you are in the right. Don't emulate your professor's attitude. "
460,Should I CC the professor in my email to the department chair?
461,I would not CC him. You don't want him to retaliate before you've talked to the higher ups
462,"Yeah, let‚Äôs wager this guys life. Fuck a college degree when that‚Äôs clearly what he wants! Take it all the way man! You got this!"
463,"Have you had any problems with this professor before? Have any of the classmates that you trust had a problem with the professor before?

If the professor has caused problems with many students in the class or has exhibited similar behavior to you or others, go straight to the department chair with this. No need to deal with the nonsense if it is continuous.

If you haven't had problems before with this professor,  *and* you don't know of anyone else who has a similar experience with the professor, don't go directly to the department chair or higher up person. Instead, *email* the professor to set up a time to meet to discuss what happened. One of four things will probably happen:

1. The professor will realize that they were unreasonable and will apologize.
2. The professor will not apologize, but will acknowledge the time line of events and will try to not have you go to the department chair over such a stupid act (by the professor) that can affect his career.
3. The professor will acknowledge the chain of events without apologizing, which you then use when you talk to the department chair.
4. The professor sends a response worthy of going to the department chair by itself, which you then use to go to the department chair.

Bad days by professors shouldn't effect our students. If it is a bad day, the professor should make it right. If it's a symptom of being a bad professional, then the higher up professionals should help rectify this. "
464,"Since you're a senior about to graduate,  how much time and effort do you want to put into this?  If you are going on to your master's, you probably already have placement, and if this is it for you,  you probably have pretty terrific grades.  (Or you wouldn't be so concerned).
If I could give myself one do-over from college,  it would have been too put just slightly less pressure on myself.  Remind myself that companies recruit from the #7 school in the country as well as #1-6, and that they don't mind B plus students. 
It doesn't make what your teacher did fair,  but school is stressful enough.  Choose your battles. Life only gets harder. 
"
465,This guys ego is really out of control. I‚Äôm an ECN major and this is a sociology stats class. Who thought it was going to be sociology giving me all the problems 
466,"Can that have any repercussions for you, like getting kicked out?"
467,"I think that we both agree that what happened to him sucks and that his professor is a total dick. But honestly, life is full of dicks. And while I would never advocate to just accept a shitty situation, you gotta be practical and pick you battles. He should definitely take this to the department head, presenting his case in the most level headed way. But if they don‚Äôt do anything, which is definitely possible, then you really have to ask yourself: ‚Äúis my college degree worth a long drawn out fight over this‚Äù

Reddit always advocates for the extreme because they have nothing at stake and they‚Äôre not around for the mess afterwards. They romanticize fighting for yourself tooth and nail when life is all about compromise."
468,Dept chair responded saying she will talk to professor X and get back to me on the matter
469,Professors like this need to get lost.  College is expensive and the fact that some teachers put such a high value on their ego instead of fair grading is such a fraud.  The good thing is most professors are better than this.
470,"So don‚Äôt CC him? Email is straightforward. Don‚Äôt mean to be petty, I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôll come across it eventually"
471,"> he only has the door open for maybe 5 min 

OP showed up at literally the start time though."
472,"Tons of commenters spews all the real world ‚Äúif you‚Äôre on time you‚Äôre late‚Äù bullshit. In my entire professional experience, if a call is scheduled at 8:00 AM it starts at 8:00 AM and nobody shows up a moment earlier. No call scheduled at 8:00 AM EVER started at 7:55. Entire career. "
473,Remember you‚Äôre paying them. Take it up higher and tell them this is unacceptable. 
474,"Relevant perspective. I tend to be stubborn and this might not be worth the exhaustion, time and effort."
475,"I was bitching outside the door and he came out, shut the door, was clearly furious and was like what did you just say to me? I felt super uncomfortable (like my dad yelling at me as a child) so I just apologized and waited to talk to him after class. He was more mellow then but still unreasonable (8am is not considered on time, show up earlier next time, etc)"
476,"I also know of professors who will do this on quiz/exam days and consider the start of class to be the start of the assessment. 

However, these people usually make this distinction clear to students pretty early on in the course or in the syllabus. "
477,"Well... Honestly... Every single sociology teacher I've had (three of them so far) have given me similar treatment, especially in terms of favoritism and extremely unfair and strict punishments such as this.

I had one that split the class into two sections, one being the ""smart"" side, and the other being the ""dumb"" side, and then began to load the ""smart"" side with extra things to do if we wanted to pass the class. Another one was prejudiced and failed my assignments despite being nearly identical to my classmate, who had high grades in the class. And then another tried to publicly shame me for using electronics in the classroom when I need them to help with a handwriting disability (I walked out when he blatantly ignored/interrupted my reasoning).

Is there something with sociology that teaches that this stuff is okay?"
478,I would‚Äôve absolutely just knocked until they let me in. Making a scene like ‚Äúhey let me in I was on time and I need to take this quiz‚Äù
479,"No point in attending a school with goals of obtaining a degree, when you cant take tests and quizzes for a single class you need, even when you show up on time. "
480,"I am personally a half assed procrastinator. I'll put things off, but when they start piling up too high, I'll get anxious and do em all at once. Ends up meaning that I do all of my homework in one dedicated day of the week. It works, and I've got As this way before."
481,May I know your set up if that's ok? I want to do something atleast similar but I'm still getting a hang of setting up a new organizational system that works for me
482,Same. Saves loads of time because my instructor talks kinda slow.
483,google calendar is super helpful! you can set up repeating events for classes and also consistent study times
484,"I don't attend classes, honestly it's the same as reading the PowerPoint presentation or just looking up for info on the internet, I can't for the love of God enjoy online classes :/"
485,"As a slow-talking professor who listens to pods at 1.5x speed, I completely approve. I have to talk slow to avoid bad verbal tics and make the work easier for the captioner, but I support students watching videos sped up."
486,"Consistency is key. I use google calendars personally. First thing to do is make time for all of your lectures, both live and videos. Try to make them around the same times everyday to maintain consistency. Then look at your schedule and try working in set times everyday to do classwork/study. I prefer to alternate days between lecture and work days so I engage with the material everyday and don‚Äôt get overloaded/bored with one subject. Then, cruise through your syllabuses and try to throw due dates into your calendar ideally 24 hrs before the actual due date to give yourself wiggle room. Hope this helps!"
487,"My grades have never been higher but it's literally from doing this. Looking stuff up, skimming confusing parts of the lecture notes' lecture video, and googling stuff is all I do and it is not fun or engaging at all. Pretty much all my major classes are in my last two years of school of which I've only gotten to have one semester in person"
488,"Personally, I find anything faster than 1.75/2x hard to follow, especially if I'm taking notes or whatever"
489,Definitely me. I will put things off until I can‚Äôt anymore. Then it‚Äôs ‚Äúcrunch‚Äù time for me.
490,"If you've been doing this in college and its working for you, have at it. If you're just getting into college, this is likely a very bad idea. I was very much a ""didnt need to try and could coast"" person in high-school. But man, I fucked up hard in college by assuming the same strategies would work in a much less structured environment."
491,Hey man I did that last term and it went great üëç
492,Lol I'm currently procrastinating on watching a lecture.
493,"I use a weekly/monthly paper planner so I can see anything at a glance. My pref is the Hobonichi Weeks planner, but any *that you will use* will do.

I prefer paper to electronic because I can easily jot more notes about a thing right there and see it plainly, rather than having to click into something.

That said... i do put the most important deadlines in GCal (like when homework is due) because I live and die by notifications."
494,"This isn't ""coasting"". During that one day of the week I actually work, it's rigorous and I emerge from my office with a thousand yard stare. The real skill is in knowing how much work will be too much when it's piling up.

Edit: I prefer to work in bursts anyway."
495,"I've done this for years and it works until something happens and it screws your plan for getting everything done up and then you miss a lot at once.

For me, it's totally an ADHD thing and I still slip into it unless I try to force myself not to. About screwed myself up in my first week this semester because my mother-in-law died and we ended up spending time with the family and planning a funeral during the two days I had set aside to do all my studying and work."
496,"Most of of my ‚Äúlectures‚Äù are asynchronous‚Ä¶and by that I mean that professors hand-write the textbook verbatim, upload it as PDF, record themselves reading the document and that‚Äôs it. We video call 3x a week for 10 minutes to check an assistance box and that‚Äôs the class. For context, it‚Äôs Differential Equations. 

This semester fucking sucks :)"
497,I didn‚Äôt expect to be personally attacked .2 seconds after opening Reddit today.
498,"It's easier to form one habit than 10 habits. Whether you decide to use a calendar app, a paper calendar, or something else, find a way to make USING the system the habit you are forming, not the details of the system.

For example if you set up a calendar app, your habit is ""when my phone chimes, I do what it says."" That's it. One habit, responding to your phone. You can help build this habit by adding silly/dummy tasks like get a drink of water or do 5 jumping jacks, as long as you *don't ignore the alert no matter what.* This makes it easier to follow the alert when it's something you don't really want to do.

If you use a paper calendar, your habit is checking that calendar every time you are bored, your mind wanders, or you are thinking ""what's next.""

It is much easier to change your lifestyle this way than trying to teach yourself ""every morning I watch my lecture, every evening I work my problem sets. MWF I do this class, TR I do these..."" because you are splitting it into a hundred new tasks to learn."
499,"Absolutely. My classes feel worthless and way too costly (money wise) as it's Google + out of class notes that are making the courses. My in-person classes were amazing due to the discussions and things . . . Welp, least I'm a senior."

504,"Yep. I know my students will watch it faster, so it frees me up to go my own (deliberate) pace. I find that in person, I go faster because of the perception I am limited in time."
505,"Prof here and I swear I'm not tryna be AC creeper, but lurking this sub is really helpful for how I design my courses. So thanks!

All my colleagues are like RECORD YOUR LECTURES but I'm like First, that's creepy, and second who's really going to watch them? I'd rather motivate students to come to my Zoom class (I cut it to once a week, 1.5 hrs) and then post asynch versions of our in-class activities online in case anyone is absent so you don't miss out on content, just the social interaction.

I see no point of recording lectures honestly. I see no point in lectures, period. Why be a talking text book? I prefer to create value by facilitating and coaching my students through their own engagement with the material and each other, which you can't record or put in a PPT."
506,"Google Calendar helps a LOT, especially now. However, if you decide to use it make sure to schedule buffer time between your tasks so that you don‚Äôt feel guilty if you don‚Äôt start on the dot."
507,If it makes you feel better this was my exact experience with differential equations in person years ago except that instead of a PDF we had a blackboard that my professor wrote on so lightly that we couldn‚Äôt even read it.
508,Same here. I even do this on certain podcasts. My favorite podcaster speaks really slowly and tends to pause a lot and this helps.

601,"I would honestly report that, even if it happened a while back. 

When I attempted suicide a year ago, i told all of my teachers, because my faculty is small and we all know each other from multiple semesters, this teacher included. She acted so worried, so understanding. Only for her to reveal my attempt to the entire class when I dared to leave her class FIFTEEN MINUTES before it ended because i was in pain, dizzy and nauseous and needed to eat something. She just straight up said it in front of the class. I ended up leaving anyway lol"

606,I hope you reported her!?
607,"Reminds me of the time that I was taking a notoriously difficult CS class where the professor dropped the lowest grade. He apparently only took submissions for written assignments in PDF form and he only mentioned that in the syllabus, not in the assignment description or in class. Well, I of course submitted it as a word file, as well as a decent chunk of the class, which resulted in no credit. I spent literally 3-4 hours on the assignment and dude didn‚Äôt even grade it. When I asked him if I could just resubmit it as a pdf, he said ‚Äúno, it won‚Äôt affect your grade since I drop the lowest grade anyway.‚Äù Fuck that dude"
608,"Uh, sometimes it *absolutely* hurts to try.

Having one bad stint isn't the problem. Most students aren't like this. Most of them are asking for extra credit or to make up work from weeks ago because they're about to fail and haven't put in a single ounce of effort beforehand. Those are the worst students, and typically the ones who make these sorts of requests."
609,"It hurts to try if you're that kind of student that asks for extensions, doesn't actually use them, uses excuses, and generally doesn't make an effort. Even then, it only hurts your integrity in the eyes of that professor. 

Unless a professor is truly awful, they're not going to rip into an otherwise good student for a mistake like that. It's okay to ask for help. Just make that effort."
610,Uh no
611,"I just sent one today to my professor, I have a 97 between lecture and lab, but for the exams she insists that we take them ON campus, even tho it‚Äôs an online class(proctortrack). so she only schedules it available 8-5pm between 3 days. I work full time and going to school taking 20 credit hours. 
I have 4 exams between Monday and Tuesday, but the other 3 are open Monday 8am to Tuesday 11pm so I have the evening to take them. 
I am praying she extends it Tuesday to 7pm. I could bust my ass and take it early Tuesday (my only day off) but I‚Äôm honestly afraid I‚Äôll sleep in or something will happen and I need the wiggle room to be safe. 

Here‚Äôs hopin she obliges."

617,"Is that even allowed?? If she declines your request, it might be worth reaching out to your dean to see if she‚Äôs allowed to force students to take a final in person for an online class."

623,"OP is most likely a student among many. Many of which probably also send emails like that, requesting an extension or extra credit. I mean I have, and if you have a valid excuse or reasoning, I don't get why it's an issue. Professors are used to it, I'm sure."
624,That's kind of the point though. The professor in this email even mentioned they checked and saw nothing else had been submitted late. I had to do this one time (and in fairness it was at the beginning of our covid lockdown) the professor knew I hadn't flaked before.
625,it like you didnt even read the post
626,Make sure to reach out to your professors when possible! Recently I experienced a severe relapse in my mental condition and missed about eight assignments in one class in the span of a week. I reached out to my professor and he allowed me to make up all of it for full credit. It is always worth a shot to ask!
627,"Also this is an extremely well written email, which isn't typical. It's not just the sentiment."
628,"Yes this is how I survived remote classes. I missed a big assignment my first semester online, but I was honest with the professor about it and she accepted it late. I always like to say, I don‚Äôt make excuses, I make decisions and I live with the consequences. Even though some of those decisions aren‚Äôt fully my fault, I still like to own up to what happened. And some professors are willing to give you a chance, especially if you‚Äôve shown that you typically are a diligent and mindful student."
629,">Uh, sometimes it absolutely hurts to try.

Yea but now you're taking it out of OP's context, which is ""It doesn't hurt to try to ask to make up an assignment when you have turned all, or mostly all, of the previous assignment in on time. I.E you were a good student.""

You took that and put it in the context of ""It hurts to try to ask to make up an assignments when you were a shit student all year and didn't put any effort in and NOWWWW you're freaking out realizing you're going to fail.....because you didn't put in any work...""


You cant take something out of one context and put it in another and then act like it's the same thing.....that's just moronic....."

635,"When I was in college, we had to teach some of the international students how to shower. They asked for the help because girls would say they stunk and they couldnt figure out why because they were showering every day and wearing deodorant, they said. We had them show us their routine, and they went in the bathroom with a bar of soap and washed their hands and forearms as their ‚Äúshower‚Äù. We were dumbfounded. They didnt even know what a real shower was. I threw on some swim trunks and hopped in the shower and showed them how to do a proper, full body and hair shower. They were incredulous. They just couldnt believe that people were doing that every single day. But they really wanted some white girl booty so they accepted it and did what had to be done."

648,"wow, wish I had gone there, I can't imagine how good their computer labs must smell.

Smell bothered other students? That's disruptive.

655,"I mean, yeah there's kids who are depressed or don't have access to good hygiene products, but I also know many more people who just ""forget"" to shower or don't care because mom is not there nagging them to do it and other people are usually too polite to say anything, so they think it's fine. "
656,I wish my college did this. One time I walked into a classroom and it REEKED of B.O. from the previous class. It was disgusting and made it hard to focus.

658,I remain unsniffed. Unless they were super stealthy about it. Can't speak for the other 8 test locations though.

720,"Two semesters ago I was in a class of 25. The first day the professor asked which of us were taking the class because we'd failed his class the first time around. 18 people raised their hand. 

It was the most intense semester of my life."
721,"‚ÄúHow many of you know I as a professor suck?‚Äù

All kidding aside, I took Calculus III one summer and the class started out with 45 people and ended with 11. We had a semester long group project, 6 in a group. I was the only one left in the group to do the project. Professor was like sucks to be you doing 6 people‚Äôs work but what ya gonna do? Cheat, cheat the hell out of that class was my response. Once I had all the answers for tests and homework I could focus on that dang ‚Äúgroup‚Äù project."
722,"If an instructor brags about this I drop their class.

Edit: who knew choosing to go to an instructor that isn't hostile would be so triggering?! "
723,why the hell would that be a bragging point.. that makes them look bad
724,"Unless you don't have a choice, that's really the best way to go. If you pass, you end up with a grade thats worse than other people got with different instructors and if you fail, your gpa is shot until you retake the class"
725,"Ha, college. Would love to go back to that cakewalk. I took the hardest professors and did 17 hours of home work per hour. Worked 3 jobs. Got a perfect GPA. "
726,"This reminds me of my favorite college professor, who is now a very close friend years later. He has usually had one of the highest pass-rates of any English professor at the universities where he has taught, and ironically it's been a serious hindrance to his career. His classes aren't easy by any means; his pass-rates are high because he works damn hard to make sure every student can understand and relate to the subject matter and so is prepared for the exams.

Watching someone so dedicated, so talented, go through hell just because he is actually a good teacher is the reason I decided not to go into academia."
727,"Making a class rigorous (""difficult"") is something to celebrate *if* it means students are meeting the learning goals. Making a class difficult solely so you can fail people is assinine. Making a class so difficult that large percentages of people fail and then *keeping* it that way over time is simply irresponsible. As a department chair I monitor the overall GPAs assigned by my colleagues...if I had one who was routinely failing large numbers of students we'd be having a serious conversation about her/his course design, pedagogy, and suitability for teaching in our department.  If you intentionally design and deliver a class your students cannot succeed in you have no business being a teacher. Yes, they must earn the credit and yes, there should be a significant distribution of grades...but bragging about failing students is, in my experience, more a sign of a failed professor.

In my department we try to calibrate our courses so that on average we're awarding 10% A grades (because officially A=""excellent""). We also seek to fail no student who does the minimum that we ask, i.e. if they pass all the assignments and attend the class they will likely earn a D. Intentionally designing a class that large numbers of students cannot pass is the academic equivalent of malpractice."
728,Damn bro I have been living a similar life like yours the college keeps f*cking you everyday 
729,"While I don't agree with bragging about a class being difficult- I think in recent years there has been a push to increase students grades. No longer is a 3.0 gpa really considered that impressive because in lots of majors- course averages are a B+ or A-. 


Grade inflation is a real problem and students tend to complain about their grades when they don't get an A on every single assignment. It's only getting worse as the years go on. Maybe you interpreted it as bragging, but I've had professors in the past who made it clear that they don't just hand out A's and that it's okay to get lower marks on assignment because of the difficult nature of the material. 

Professor might be a dick for bragging about how they grade lower- but I don't think the tests are unfair or he's doing something wrong just because they are stricter on grading. If anything- the teachers that basically hand out A's are the ones in the wrong, in my opinion. "
730,"professors don‚Äôt want to be at the end of the spectrum in which a professor is known for easy exams and essentially an easy A, so instead of choosing the middle they decide to go to the opposite end of the spectrum where they boast about ‚Äúhow hard they make their students work for their grade‚Äù.

733,"I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep."
734,"It had to do with proofs. Each group had to research a different proof and answer a bunch of questions about it like it was our own proof. I think mine had to do something with a triple integral and how it was associated with the area of the shadow of an expanding sphere over a bumpy plane.

Essentially come up with the equation to answer some crazy concept question and back it up with lots of maths. 

Edit: it happened in 2006 so I‚Äôm a bit fuzzy on all the details."
735,I've often seen that professors try to increase the difficulty of a class by just testing on content not taught or giving less time for tests. If a professor tries to increase the difficulty of his class/tests without increasing the complexity of thought required.... Then that professor is pathetic imo. There's a difference between making tests/classes harder or making them unfair. 
736,"I agree with your point on grade inflation, I think what is considered a normal GPA has gotten out of hand. However, a lot of majors have higher gpa requirements than the rest of UT. These reqs would need to lower slightly with the standard GPA. Until this these professors essentially put you at higher risk. "
737,"One of my new favorite tweets something along the lines of:

professor: rarely anyone gets As in this course

me: weird flex but ok"
738,"Disclosure: I am currently a mathematics professor.

In general, and I can only speak for the colleagues I know well, we hate our low pass rates. While unreasonable, we enter into every semester with the optimistic delusion that this semester ‚Äòeveryone will get it‚Äô. Everyone will put in the work. Everyone will approach the class as if they were there on purpose. Yet, as the weeks pass and the attrition begins, we are left to face a sad reality where we lose half or more of the bright faces and eager minds we began with.

What I have observed in my career can perhaps be explained by a difference of goals. As a professor, I want each and every student to learn all (and I do mean all) of the material for the course. I consider it a personal failure when a student doesn‚Äôt. But I would consider it an ethical violation if a student were to pass without learning the material. This is, I feel, where the disconnect lies. If you give the typical student a choice between learning the material and passing the course, they will choose passing the course every time. Students now attend college not to learn, but to get a degree, as if they are purchasing a license to enter the workforce (as a side note, I believe personally that we are requiring college degrees for far too many entry level positions today).

This difference of view creates a contentious relationship where professors are seen as barriers to getting a job instead of useful resources to improve ones mental abilities. I don‚Äôt have a solution to this, sadly. 

But I can leave all students reading this with some advice: Go talk to your professors. Go to class. Do all of your assignments. At least pretend to take an interest in your classes. Because at the end of the day, our greatest joy is seeing a spark of joy from a small student success become an insatiable hunger for knowledge.

I apologize for the long post, thank you for reading."
739,"The counterpoint is something like an engineering or medical course where the subject matter is inherently difficult, and if students pass without internalizing the course then people might die. Yeah the prof should be trying real hard to get every student to learn the material, but sometimes the subject matter is hard, and scaring people with the pass rate in the first lecture might get them to take the course a bit more seriously."

wut is this sorcery you speak of?"
741,"My last few semesters, I started signing up for extra classes so I had my pick of the litter for which professor/s I drop.

It made for a stressful first week or two where I had to show up to a ton of classes and decide which ones I wasn't going to continue with but it was totally worth it when it saved me from awful teachers.

My last semester all the classes were fine so I dropped a professor 100% because she was a mouth breather who wheazed slightly when she exhaled.

Idc how interesting your class is, I'm not sitting through 3 months of that."
742,"I was failing my Calc 2 class going into the finals, but my teachers policy is that he'll allow you to opt in to making the score you get on the comprehensive final the score you get in the class.

Most stressful test I've ever taken. A gnarly 5 option multiple choice with tons of traps and 100 questions in 2.5 hours. Needed to pass it to complete my IGETC and transfer to a 4 year college. If I failed I'd be stuck in CC for another year until the next transfer period.

It persists, though we no longer should filter students, because its an easier way to get your education check; give a multiple choice test, grade it on a curve, and youre done.  Teach for a piece of paper and your students will also chase paper.  There is a movement to teach for learning but its fighting years of tradition. "

811,"Even with systems that monitor your computer, you could always use a VM  to get around it. I feel like that's why it's essential to make online tests open-note because if it's not, you'll have people who cheated get higher grades than people who are trying to be ethical.  
\*NOTE\*  
Do ***NOT*** use a VM to get around these systems. Even if you **can**, it doesn't mean you *should.* Seriously, when you cheat, all you do is cheapen that degree you(and the people in your life who care about you), paid a lot of money for."
812,Webcams now are so expensive.
813,[deleted]
814,Is it as expensive as taking another semester of university tho? ü§î
815,Lol my medical school for our practical is making us take the test via webcams. First off I have shitty spotty internet which sucks ass but at least I have a webcam. But they say oh you have to do it with a partner. What about those of us who don't have roommates or whose rommates are out of town or don't want to be on a fucking webcam in a sportsbra for a medical exam? Oh just use a teddy bear they said. A FUCKING TEDDYBEAR. Who the fuck owns a teddy bear?
816,"Definitely. That's what my math teacher did and I'm glad.

Open notes and a few hours to complete it, no webcam."
817,Steak and mashed potatoes with a little vino
818,Congratulations! Now you'll never have to deal with professors like that ever again.
819,"If I'm being honest, I own a teddy bear..."
820,"In case anyone is desperate, you can buy a wyze cam for $20, flash from firmware from the actual wyze dev team and covert it into a 1080p Webcam. Its fish eye lens, but oh well."
821,"I had the same issue, my professor than required that  I FaceTime him personally for my test. When  I didn‚Äôt get on at exactly 8am, I received 4 different emails asking me what I was doing, why I wasn‚Äôt on, and threatening that if I wasn‚Äôt online in the next 10 minutes, he‚Äôd just give me a zero instead."
822,"> Even with systems that monitor your computer you could always use a VM to get around it.

Or another computer, or your phone, or a goddamn book. Like you said, just make it open book"
823,"-can't buy webcam
-uses Gopro Hero 8 instead"
824,"And in very short supply as all the work from home types have just bought out the supply.

The only webcams I could find last week were shipping from Hong Kong ""soon"" or $500+ super professional webcams."
825,who the fuck doesnt own a teddy bear?
826,"What is wrong with people?

My professor made our exams open note, but put a timer on it. Essentially, if you don‚Äôt know your stuff then the notes are useless because of the timeframe."
827,That teacher isn‚Äôt very good at his job
828,"Am I the only one who thinks you should‚Äôve been there at 8 AM, especially for a final as well as the fact you didn‚Äôt have to travel."
829,"So can most malware, but there are ways around that as well. It's a game of cat and mouse."
830,"Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't suggest going out and buying a gopro, but if you already have one..."
831,Some people are just sick
832,Bahaha now that I checked my girlfriends stuffed animals there is indead a bear there but certainly too small to practice a head to toe physical exam on!
833,"This is all true, but I‚Äôd like to point out that Respondus can apparently(never personally tested this) detect if it‚Äôs in a VM."
834,"sorry, I'm stupid I guess.  
 
but how is this different than if you showed up late to class for a regular test?"
835,"He also made sure to send out entire class a bolded email stating that if the webcam (in my case him FaceTiming me) registered any loud sound at all, our exam would be flagged and our webcam recording would be looked over by a TA to analyze us for cheating."

837,"He‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs weird to me that 8 o‚Äôclock must mean something different to you than it does to me.

863,All of them!
864,Looks like I‚Äôm about to drop out and come back later lmao.  These have been the hardest months of my life... around this time last year I lost two close family members and a horse I rescued... but I still feel like the stress I‚Äôve had this year still doesn‚Äôt compare.  So what makes it easier?  I assumed before that adults in college might not feel so pressured to get the best grades because they don‚Äôt have anyone but themselves to impress or have other responsibilities that prevent you from getting hyper focused on your studies.  Maybe that‚Äôs stupid but even without my mother being able to see my grades I still have that fear that my mother is going to be disappointed in me for getting a B.  I feel like with my current track I‚Äôm not going to accomplish my dreams and there will be nothing left for me to do.  Why did I even start talking about this.  I don‚Äôt know.  I‚Äôm stressed.  Have a nice evening.

870,Good shit man 4.0 gpa activities only üòé
871,"I'm going to be very blunt here, but as a student that recieved this email from a prof, I literally almost fainted from joy and pride"
872,"curious, is an A- a 4.0 for you? At my university its a 3.7"
873,"Same, it's a 3.7 at my school as well."
874,You should be proud as fuck.
875,Ayy congrats man! That‚Äôs awesome üôåü•≥
876,"The paper was an A. By grade in the class prior to this paper was a B, but since this paper was worth 30% of my grade, it pushed me to a very high B+. The prof then decided to push me over the grade line slightly because I was so close to the A- in the class."
877,THATS WHATS UPPP
878,No what i meant was 4.0 vibes only like good vibes only
879,Can we also take a moment to think about why the example paper isn't a full A paper?
880,We like it lol
881,"Hey dude that‚Äôs fantastic, keep it up üëå"
882,PLEASE do it in the future!! Mine was used without my knowledge (obviously a huge compliment) but the only way I found out is because I was helping a friend with the same class and saw my old paper as the example. When I got my grade back the previous semester I got zero feedback and I crave the academic validation
883,"An A- is a 4.0 at my university because we don‚Äôt have A+, A- etc. only A, B, C etc."
884,Congratulations!  As for sharing it -- my university has a number of small awards for student papers (either at the department or school level).  You might consider submitting for one of those.
885,"Haha sometimes I feel like emotes are sometimes more appropriate? in different circumstances. Like I usually use emojis in abundance with lighthearted, goofy, or just more enthusiastic messages or posts. I feel like I use the :) just for encouraging, more serious or wholesome messages and whatnot"
886,"My school does no minuses, either 3 for a B or 4 for an A."
887,"Nobody's perfect man, just congratulate the man for doing so well on the paper. No need to think too deep and try to bring out the negatives."
888,Awww this is awesome!! I can relate in how good it feels when a professor gives you that kind of feedback. You should feel so proud  :)
889,"I used to teach a 5-week writing course with 1-2 short assignments due each week. After assessing the work, I'd actually ask 2-4 students every week if I could show off their work to the rest of the class as a demonstration of something it did well.

After... 30-something sections of this class?... I never had a student decline.

I like to think they were all fainting with joy and pride on the inside."
890,"Great job!!! That‚Äôs so amazing, OP!

This happened to me once‚Äîa presentation on water rights in an environmental science class.  5 years later, and graduated, I still talk about it."
891,Honestly would love to see a copy to see if it could help my writing or sources any.
892,"Same, I have mixed feelings about it because it feels great to get a 90 but terrible to get an 88 or 89."
893,"I definitely will! I always give feedback anyway, but the honor on top of that would be extra validation for sure."
894,"Ask that you be referenced in the bibliography of the coursework or sumn, idk.

Even a footnote would be good."
895,And I'm always extra hesitant to ask about showing to current class. But I'll do this going forward! Especially in large classes. The small upper-division courses are trickier if the student wishes to remain anonymous.
896,"Dude, I am SO PROUD OF YOU!!!  Seriously, awesome job!!

897,"WOOOOOOO

being asked if your work can be an example is the BEST feeling, good work!"
898,Congrats comrade
899,How is it so good that it‚Äôs going to be used as an example but not an A? What am I missing that this doesn‚Äôt get full marks?
900,If you were allowed to look at the old quizzes then you did nothing wrong
901,"If the professor is using quizzes in your current class that everyone had access to, there is no chance that this will be considered academic dishonesty. If they were quizzes from past years, it might get a bit more complicated."
902,"You‚Äôd have to be explicitly told to not look at quiz material for studying. In most situations, quizzes are materially used as studying material"
903,"Some institutions do require profs to discuss AI issues with students before filing official complaints. Either way, the prof is likely full of it, lol."
904,"Yeah, he literally did what he‚Äôs supposed to do - review the material provided during the class. Fuck that professor."
905,"Professor here: 

Even if he makes good on his threat and drags you into the Dean's office, all you will need to say in your defense is that the professor used the exact same questions twice in one semester. Point out that they were even in chronological order. Ask the dean to have the professor provide copies of the quizzes and the tests as proof. First, insist that the professor made no significant effort to ensure the academic integrity of his test because he reused the same questions word for word. Second, point out that by doing so, the professor himself essentially provided you a test question bank. Then ask how you can be held responsible for academic dishonesty when you were using a question bank provided by the professor.

The arguments made by the professor have no merit. 

Also, record the meeting (and tell them you are doing so for everyone's protection. )"
906,"10 mins for a 50 question test is extremely quick. That was a mistake on your part. 

I would challenge the academic dishonesty. State you studied extremely hard, reviewed your notes, readings, and previous exams as you were borderline a B/A. It is not a exam bank, as you just wanted to study using the information provided. 

I wouldn‚Äôt mention that you studied only the quizzes if it is taken further. But honestly that isn‚Äôt uncommon for students to look back on the quizzes for guidance on what may possibly be on the exam. 

It would be massively different if you had a C or D."
907,"see what happens but you may wish to get all your study materials together and the course syllabus and escalate it yourself to the dean of students or another person in student affairs - not the academic department.  the department chair and the dean MIGHT see your side, or they MIGHT try to protect their employee.  I'd have a documented formal complaint on file with all your evidence - here's the syllabus which doesn't say anything about using old quizzes to study by, here's the quizzes, they were what I studied, and sure enough the final was just the quizzes so of course it was easy.  

then talk to your prof and ask him what his plan is.  you studied what he gave you, and he inadvertently made the final very easy for you by just re-using quiz questions.  that's not your fault - the material was readily available to you and at no point were you disallowed from using the previous quizzes to study from.  

&#x200B;

this professor was lazy af and is trying to make that a you problem."
908,"Did you study off of the quizzes he gave in class (and presumably handed back to you)? Or did you seek out a test bank of questions on your own (that the prof did not provide)? 

&#x200B;

If the former, no way that's an academic integrity violation. You reviewed previous assessments -- that's studying 101 for a cumulative final. If it's the later, that's likely a AI violation."
909,Are past papers not a thing in the US (assuming it's US)?
910,"Yeah it seems like he‚Äôs mostly angry that OP exposed his laziness, via a calculated gamble. 

His claim of ‚Äòacademic dishonesty‚Äô seems more like projection of his own ‚Äòacademic laziness‚Äô.

I bet that the professor will:
- Review the footage, and find no wrongdoing
- Realise he has a weak argument for ‚Äòdishonesty‚Äô
- Worry that elevating it will expose *him* further
- Take it no further (partly because lazy)
- *Maybe* get smarter with crafting exams

Edit: As others have said: Collate copies of the quizzes and your study material in case it goes further. 

I would then sit tight until he does anything. Lazy people won‚Äôt spend time on stuff unless they have something to gain - and at this point he has more to lose than gain."
911,"This is not cheating. You studied the material from quizzes in the class, you have nothing to hide and this is not academic dishonesty. 

Really if he didn‚Äôt want students to do this then he could‚Äôve not given back quizzes (or collect them after students have had a look in class), you can also give quizzes via the LMS and set them so students don‚Äôt have access to them after a certain point."
912,Our past tests are on uni websites because they're good study material
913,"I see no reason not to just say I memorized the old quizzes. Theyre effectively practice tests, itd be pretty dumb not to study them so hard you can recite them by rote. Several of my physics and math classes would use the same style question with changed numbers, so I would memorize how the question flowed to the answer and then just plug in new numbers. Hell if I was allowed a ""cheat sheet"" id write down questions, not even bother with formulas and constants.

OP definitely hit the ""what to study"" bullseye, I see no reason to beat around that bush."
914,"I‚Äôm at a loss as to why this guy isn‚Äôt taking it as a chance to make his own metrics look better. 

‚ÄúI taught that class so well I had a kid ace my exam in a matter of minutes.‚Äù"
915,Yeah I should correct that. At my college professors I think can discuss it with them but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre allowed to flat out tell a student they without a doubt cheated before it being looked into**
916,"It depends, if you had siblings or friends that took the test and they told you to be careful of a question asking about certain points I see no way it could be considered cheating. It can be in a grey area if you had other students final exams but like I see this like I see the first scenario if the teacher is worth his salt he will atleast change values to give different answers throughout the years."
917,"Basically this. And if they try to double down, seek legal counsel. This happened to a friend of a friend. Prof reused an old exam, and then tried to get the student on cheating. ~~Admin backed down to the threat of a lawsuit.~~

Jk I just followed up on this. The school didn‚Äôt back down, they lost the case, and had to pay the legal fees plus 10k to the student and give him an A. Bless"
918,It sounds like the former.
919,"OP should go over professors head and contact the dean and explain the situation. OP did nothing wrong here and the professor bullying them is completely unprofessional, along with the laziness of the test questions. Imho, the professor needs to be the one punished and the punishment needs to be being fired."
920,I love that format! Makes studying far more efficient
921,"What a dumb person, it's not your fault he reused questions. ffs."
922,"Tell the higher ups what you told us. The camera footage will most certainly back you up if what you said was true. Professor‚Äôs the lazy one for straight up using old quiz questions for the final. I feel sorry because after you win this, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll make up his own questions in later classes. 
Idk what he was thinking. Its common sense to use old material to study for the final"
923,">10 mins for a 50 question test is extremely quick. That was a mistake on your part. 

When you study quiz questions like OP did its pretty easy to tell what the answer is before you even finish reading the question. That comes out to 12 seconds a question which is pretty reasonable. OP memorized the answers, Im sure you could finish a 50 question test in less than 10 minutes that is all answers that you know.

OP didnt make a mistake. OP was smart, recognized a pattern, put in the effort to study, and it paid off."
924,"This has received quite a few upvotes, but I would personally recommend against this. 

Upstaging a professor and filing a formal complaint has serious risk of repercussions later, especially if you ever take another course in this discipline.

What you did was NOT cheating, and I don‚Äôt think anything is going to come of this. 

Gather all of your documentation? Absolutely. But just hang onto it. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll need it."
925,Correct. This just seems like...studying? What is the issue?
926,"If a test doesn‚Äôt require understanding to be aced, then it‚Äôs the fault and the responsibility of the people behind such education practices"
927,"These types of teachers WANT their students to fail. I believe it's a power-thing. ""If my students fail, that means my material is good! I'm a great teacher!"" These are also typically the types of teachers that will grade kids who do well harder than the kids who don't. Oh, you got a 49/50 on your essay but don't know why bc there's no markings or reasoning? it's because they can't fucking stand giving 100% on their stellar assignment. go fuck yourself"
928,TBH he is only pointing out how much of a shitbag professor he is and that his position at the school should be reconsidered.
929,"They are, the problem is they aren't always accessible to students. If the professor says you shouldn't look at them then using them would usually be in violation of academic integrity. There's also the ethics of the advantage of only a few being able to access past questions through personal connections whereas people without them are at a disadvantage in the face of the curve."
930,"Number 3 is also pretty offensive to working class people, saying that they‚Äôre too uneducated to know their worth."
931,"doesn‚Äôt free college mean income tax increases drastically? college fees ain‚Äôt cheap to fund.

EDIT: y‚Äôall can have intellectual debates below but pls don‚Äôt @ me with individual state programs,,, i‚Äôm not american but imo the easiest way to get MORE money consistently (instead of redistribution of govt spending) is to increase income taxes, which was why i said this. 
that being said, american colleges are really bloody expensive."
932,"The people supporting free college tend to also be the people who support dramatically increased taxes on the 1%, which is another reason for them to fight against the idea."
933,"It's about exploitation. Think about how replaceable someone who works at target is-- look at how people prior to the pandemic were so easily replaceable.  But now during a pandemic they're ""essential""? They were important before but we didn't view them as such because of their ease of replace-ability"
934,"You‚Äôre a special kind of naive if you really think the ‚Äúwealthy elite‚Äù are coordinating with the military... 

Also #2 just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Try bringing it up with an economics professor on your campus and see how hard they laugh at you. 

Our economic and education system, while certainly flawed, wasn‚Äôt designed by a secret society of lizard people  determined to make life miserable."
935,it‚Äôs talking more about class consciousness than intelligence
936,The best way to solve the student debt crisis is to stop telling kids that the only way that they can be successful is to go to college. I have buddies that went to a 2 year trade school and is making more than my wife and I combined and we both went to the same university.
937,"On top of this, there‚Äôs been a bunch of studies showing how pre-K to 12 education is so much more important because of its role in development, so we should really be focusing on accessible and good education at an early age for everyone"
938,"They already do that now. The Panama Papers pretty much explicitly said ‚Äúhey a metric ton of rich people are keeping money in various tax havens to avoid taxes.‚Äù

There‚Äôs no way we can compete with countries with tax rates far lower than ours. Our public services and infrastructure are already sorely antiquated due to insufficient funding. And when our already-underfunded safety nets are the only barrier between adequate food and housing and utter destitution for an alarming portion of America, to try and compete with tax havens for the top 1%‚Äôs money would very likely bring about one of the greatest crises in American history.

So we can either submit ourselves to the whims of the ultra-wealthy to the detriment of the rest of society, or we can get aggressive by raising their taxes and imposing sanctions on tax havens, among other punitive measures. If higher taxes aren‚Äôt their best option, we simply haven‚Äôt done enough.

I mean, come on. It‚Äôs impossible to deny how important education is for future success. So why are our public schools funded by local property taxes? Why are so many colleges prohibitively expensive? It‚Äôs because the wealthy don‚Äôt want to compete with the poor on an equal playing field. Are the wealthy really so untouchable that we have no choice but to leave poor kids behind? I sure as hell don‚Äôt think so.

/end rant"
939,This is what I was about to. All these ‚Äúwoke‚Äù millennials go off on twitter on all this nonsense
940,If college becomes completely free won‚Äôt the value of my bachelors degree plummet?
941,I mean not in terms of intrinsic self-worth but financial worth.
942,what if the 1% move their money or just leave
943,"Ridiculous claims. They talk about the military like it is a job nobody wants. The fact is that you need to be a college graduate to be an officer, and there are huge incentives to join the military these days. It is insulting to our forces to say that they only joined the military because they were not smart or rich enough to go to college. There are many high-paying jobs that do not require a college degree. Is there any evidence of number 3? I mean actual papers that have studied this phenomenon? 

Half of the kids in this subreddit are only going to college to have sex and get wasted. I already think that many colleges in the U.S. have dropped their standards tremendously, particularly with grade inflation, affirmative action and the left-wing indoctrination that is going on in many classrooms. If we only weeded out these students in the first place, perhaps college would be more affordable (only perhaps). There is also this notion that anyone can go to college in Europe. In places like France, Germany and Scandinavia, not everyone can go to college. Admission to the best colleges is HIGHLY restricted.

Let's talk about number four. According to the NCES, the most conferred bachelor's degrees are (I quote): ""Business (381,000), health professions and related programs (238,000), social sciences and history (159,000), psychology (117,000), biological and biomedical sciences (117,000), engineering (116,000), communication, journalism, and related programs (94,000), and visual and performing arts (91,000)."" You see biology and engineering up there, but you also see a lot of degrees like communication and performing arts, which are not really contributing much to ""innovation"". Innovation comes from STEM. Very few people are studying that.

It's easy to say ""we should make X or Y free"", but no one ever comes up with a detailed analysis (or plan, for that matter), of the situation at hand. I simply do not see how allowing absolutely everyone into college would make our nation more competitive. I studied at a private college, and the highest class size I had was 80, and that was a huge class. Most classes had about 35 students. I see class sizes of hundreds of students in public universities. Can you imagine class sizes of thousands of students? Perhaps online education will achieve that.

P.S. I must say that my parents paid for my entire college education (About 60-70k)."

948,"People will complain about how worthless their degree was, how they self-taught themselves everything in college, how expensive the entire ordeal is, and then turn around and say that the government should provide ‚Äúfree‚Äù college. As if every American needs to waste inordinate amounts of time and money pursuing an education model from the 19th century."
949,People that don‚Äôt go to college shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for people that do. I was happy to go and take out some loans because I was confident that the degree would be worth the money in the long run.
950,"Yea cause if you send someone whos and idiot to college.... im sorry it wont help they need a good foundation being built during development, along with good academic habits."
951,"And things are already bad enough as it is with the over-minting of PhD‚Äôs, basically everyone on staff at your local podunk state school went to Harvard nowadays. 

Democratizing education further isn‚Äôt the solution. If anything too many people started going to college after we hit the point that employers started taking BA‚Äôs as IQ tests and they now get you what a high school diploma used to in the 50‚Äôs"
952,"Because why pay for something that not everyone needs, that‚Äôs stupid expensive and of questionable worth."
953,College wasn't invented to exploit people.  But the inflated cost of education in the US helps the government. By paying for military people's college they can avoid drafts because incentive for enlisting is high. Loans like the Sally-May loan also bring in money for the federal government. Education loans also make banks tons of money which helps the economy. So free college is not in the best interest of the federal US government. The rest of the post is just tumblr-y nonsense.

955,"My family is broke as hell dude lol. I‚Äôm not saying all wealth is achieved strictly due to hard work, but I don‚Äôt know a single wealthy person who completely lucked into it. They worked hard, consistently, and smartly. Less so if their parents were wealthy and being better looking or smarter surely helped too."
956,Or we could reallocate some fuckin money. Our military spending is fucking insane I‚Äôm not necessary for fully free college but I think we should put more money in accessible education and less into bombing kids in the Middle East or building billion dollar planes we crash into the sea.
957,"It really is fucked up. My high school had a revolving door of dipshit teachers, which ended up fucking me over when I went into college. I will say I had a couple decent teachers but the majority of them it was like how tf are you teaching?! Now my advisor in college is the literal worst. I‚Äôve been emailing him for around two months to get registered for classes. And I‚Äôm still not registered for any and classes start next week! I finally had to make a bunch of calls to have someone help me. So I‚Äôm getting registered today. 

And onto the financial part and putting yourself I debt. I had to pay $1,100 on a hold on my account before I could register for classes. I only had $1,400 saved. There‚Äôs a $225 fee for applying to the dorms. My paperwork was late so now I‚Äôm going to have to do a deferred payment for part of this semester and try and pull money out of my ass in the next couple of days. My high school literally didn‚Äôt educate us on scholarships or anything like that. And I was too young to even know what to do so loans sounded like a viable option. But whew after taking almost a year off from school and working at a grocery store I know how much that dollar is worth. And I‚Äôm looking at around $9000 in debt. It‚Äôs so fucking stupid."
958,"I‚Äôm a _‚Äùwoke‚Äù_ millennial. _‚Äùwoke‚Äù_ as in I understand there is no economic incentive for the wealthy elite to increase military recruitment numbers. Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill gates have no interest in more potential consumers dying in war. This is only profitable to PMC or politicians which are hardly _the wealthy elite_

Many members of the wealthy elite have actually called for a higher educated workforce.

I‚Äôm getting tired of the anti-capitalism narrative I hear from my generation. Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù by repeating the same half-baked ideas you read on Twitter."
959,"Pretty sure they get more and better employees when there are capable (educated) people to hire from, so the goal probably isn't to destroy their hiring pool via creating idiots

Additionally, more people on active military duty means fewer customers unless they're selling to the government itself

Now student debt? Yeah they're probably going to love employees with that as well as trapping broke college students with it

Edit: tl;dr Are the rich against education? No. Are the rich against *free* education (college level)? Yeah, probably

Edit 2: Also entrepreneurs are hardly a problem for a large, popular company and even if they were to come up with something or succeed then that same company could just buy them out or partner up"

962,"He says it‚Äôs only if you come from a family making less than $125,000 and you went to a public university. Also says it would apply to HBCU.

It kinda feels like a law like this would be challenged in the courts under the equal protection clause..."
963,X to Doubt
964,It is much easier for the government to get public universities to do what they want since they receive public funding. Also lowers the cost of such a plan since private universities tend to be more expensive. Forgiving all student debt across the board is *probably* not feasible.
965,"It's only if your family makes under $125,000, you went to a public university, and it's only federal loans which currently has an aggregate limit of $31,000 for undergrad. 

No indication it impacts private loans, PLUS loans, accrued interest, or graduate loans.

I don't know if I agree with that over expanding public service loan forgiveness and similar programs. I know Facebook software engineers who would qualify under those terms and teachers who went to private universities that won't qualify.

But I think it's possible to pass."
966,"as someone from a poor family going to a public university with <$30,000 loans, I‚Äôm ecstatic"
967,"I was lucky enough to graduate with no debt but I know a lot of people who have massive students debt and I feel bad for them, but I have to agree. It seems like one of those empty promises that politicians say to get votes and it makes me sad.

Edit: wow I didn't think this would be this popular. I think college tuition prices are way too high for some schools, but for people looking for some financial help with school search high and low scholarships. Some churchs, youth groups, local organizations exc. give scholarships. They may only be $1500 but thats still something you just have to look and they can add up. There are plenty of organizations that will help someone get an education."
968,"And screw those of you that went to a private university because your debt won't be forgiven.

Can anybody explain why?"
969,"Just empty promises that scream, vote for me please!"
970,I wouldnt mind voting for him so you could have that gone!
971,I had a full academic scholarship
972,How about fixing the system instead?
973,"I‚Äôm 100% for Biden but I doubt this will happen. He mentioned he‚Äôll slash 10K which I guess is more feasible as opposed to outright eliminating it. But a lot of people 10K is nothing on their student debt. 

Now why on earth is education is so stupidly expensive in the U.S especially when a bachelors is becoming more and more the base requirement in the world is beyond me but that‚Äôs a whole other conversation."
974,"Depends on what he means.  If he means that he's going to nullify all existing student loan debt, I'd say it's impossible.  If he means that he's going to dismantle the systems that create student loan debt and over inflated tuition, it's plausible.  If he wants to make loan repayment easier by eliminating student loan interest or creating incentives for employers to match student loan payments, then that could work.

A lot of anti-intellectuals on the right that sees anything that helps college students as a waste so I doubt he'll be able to push anything through."
975,"That isn't the point, the money has to come from somewhere.  It's a great idea in theory, who knows if it will work in practice or if they'll even have the funds for it"

979,"Thank you for your reply.

Once the money is loaned the university has nothing to do with the loan.

So it's okey to forgive $100,000 of debt for a state university student and nothing for a private university student with $50,000 of debt?

And it's okay to treat historically black private universities different than other private universities?"
980,"Yeah, even if it‚Äôs not ALL student debt this is super important and very good for people that aren‚Äôt very well off. I‚Äôm happy for you! I hope it happens!"
981,Because private colleges and universities don‚Äôt get public funding.
982,"Honestly, if you didn‚Äôt want debt maybe don‚Äôt go away to college for all 4 years? Even just 1 year at your local community college will save you over $20k. 

Community college is an option. I know it‚Äôs boring asf but I saved a whole lot of money that way. Plus I work. Now with the pandemic, college is cheaper because there‚Äôs no room & board. By the end of all this I won‚Äôt have much debt and I‚Äôll have some cash to start my life out with. 

Basically you have to chose. Do you want crippling debt or no fun in college."
983,Exactly this. It‚Äôll ‚Äòhappen‚Äô but you won‚Äôt actually have your debt forgiven.
984,"Nice details, now explain how you think he will do this?"
985,"I mean that you should expect a lot of talk, but not results. It‚Äôs a hallmark of American policy making."
986,Well we found out earlier this year that bloomberg couldn't buy the nomination with $1 billion. Now we'll see if biden can buy it with $1.6 trillion?

1000,thank you! [link for the lazy](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/j2mjs9/more_campus_feral_cats_for_those_who_asked_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
1001,"Holy shoot. I‚Äôm dumb. Were you trying to guess the name of my school? I, for some reason, thought you meant Australia as I‚Äôve seen people refer to Australia as AU. Goodness. Well hopefully someone gets a laugh out of my stupidity haha"
1002,Lol I love them but it can be difficult walking with a cat on your leg. This one is Bertha. She only recently started letting me pet her.
1003,"Hey, just so you know, feral is a behavior that means afraid of humans. Community cats are what you're describing, groups of cats who have been TNR'd and are cared for by humans. Cats can be both, but these cats like humans, so these cats aren't feral, but they are community cats!

Source: I worked in cat rescue for 5 years."
1004,"Should have brought the cat to class. You want pets, so you come with me for all the pets you could want."
1005,"My campus has cats too! Ours are nowhere near as friendly though! When they see people, they typically run the other way. One winter, my friend tried to sneak one of them into the dorm because it was a little kitten that looked like it wasn't doing so well from the temperature drop. It didn't go over too well, but she did manage to help it stay warm by insulating their sleeping area in the bushes with old towels and fabric she had laying around."
1006,"No. Sorry I‚Äôm not telling what school it is. Privacy reason, ya know?"
1007,Please stop trying to guess where OP goes to school. It is creepy and beyond inconsiderate.

1009,No thank you.
1010,Totally got you there on the privacy reasons. I once mentioned that on a post of mine and I was down voted to hell. Privacy is huge
1011,"They are ferals. They have been on campus for several years, breeding and breeding again. Their ancestors were on the campus for years. This unfortunately is the last batch of cats on campus. If you notice they have clipped ears. This means they were in the TNR program, Trap Neuter Return. Ears are clipped so that the cats aren‚Äôt caught again."
1012,"Quick update then it‚Äôs back to lab:

Thank you for all of the love. I didn‚Äôt think this post would get so many upvotes as it did. 

Side note, I have seen comments asking me to say what school it is. I do not wish to share the name of my school. It is for privacy purposes. I do not share my personal data if I can avoid it. Location is one I especially avoiding sharing. That‚Äôs all. 

Again thank you. I will look at comments and such later after my classes are over."
1013,Nope. USA.
1014,Friendly feral cats? Wouldn't they be strays?
1015,"Do you mean the number of cats? There‚Äôs like five. Bertha, Ghost BB, Friend, the grey boi, and the floofy boi."
1016,haha we have a ton of cats on my campus too so i was checking to see if that‚Äôs the same brick pattern we have (it‚Äôs not lol)
1017,You said they are ferrel. Normally they don't get to friendly with humans as far as I know. She seem to be well acquainted with you enough to play around with you.
1018,"Lol that‚Äôs good. Are they good kitties? Do they make the walk to class a little better? 

Also I‚Äôm not sharing the name of my school. I hope that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs mainly for my own privacy."

1023,*Cries in taking Calculus 2 as a senior in high school*
1024,He did say aced
1025,"LOL I almost failed precalc in high school and did really bad my second semester of algebra 2 sophomore year. Ended up with a A in calc 2 spring 2020 semester, the teacher didn't even have to round it up.

However the only reason why is because the teacher often grades tests out of 105-150 ish instead of 100 so silly mistakes are less costly. Did you ask the teacher to round it up? Can it be rounded up?

Great job for your achievement though"
1026,It's never too late. There are lots of free resources online
1027,"Also, to anyone that just wants to learn some math, don't learn calculus. Like, I find calculus super neat and and kind of fun, but it's mostly useless to just about everyone.

Statistics, on the other hand, can let you and evaluate things and understand things better in the real world on a daily basis.

When I went to high school they only had AP calculus, but these days they also have AP statistics, and the statistics one is the one that is more promoted, which I agree with.

edit: i'm not saying don't learn calculus or that calculus is dumb, just that if you are curious about math, study statistics before going to calculus, because statistics is much more likely to help you out in everyday life, whereas calculus is very interesting, but is going to help almost no one in everyday life.

like even as a programmer, the only time I think of calc is when I'm filling up a tub or unrolling some toilet paper."
1028,"Oh you think you‚Äôre hot and sick now? 
Well you are, good job!"
1029,"Our exam always has a bonus question worth 5 points. It's usually something really obscure like calculate the 42th derivative of cosx.

I probsbly got it right but lost 3 marks somewhere else."
1030,Yes yes yes!! Congrats! All your hard work paid off! This is inspirational.
1031,Same
1032,How did you get a 102?
1033,Statistics is great too but I find calculus to be useful for optimization problems
1034,What grades did you get in them?
1035,"Yes, 42 % 4 = 2. So basically it's asking to take the second derivative."
1036,"Learning calculus makes thinking about rates of change much more intuitive, which really comes in handy when reading the news on Covid infection rates and trends.

Honestly if more people had exposure to this kinda thinking, we likely would have handled things better."
1037,"dude, no it doesn't. people at home aren't running integrals and derivatives trying to figure this shit out on their own.

I took 3d calc in college, and calc has not helped me understand the pandemic whatsoever. if anything, statistics, again, is more important in understanding the pandemic.

learning rates of change is also important, but one can learn about rates of change without learning about calculus. you don't need to know the specific calculus equations about rates, you just need to know the general idea about rates, and that can be taught in many subjects that are more necessary than calculus.

edit: I used to be like you and think calculus was important to how we think about things, likely because I was more or less forced to take it throughout high school and college and subconsciously felt the need to defend it. 

But later in life I realized it was actually mostly useless, and my stats classes ended up actually making the real difference in day to day thinking and viewing of things like the news.

tl;dr

me: statistics is a much more practical skill to teach than calculus

reddit: actually, I use calculus for [this very specific thing that almost no one does]

me: sure, that's fine, but it's still more practical to teach the masses statistics over calculus.

reddit: no, and I hate you for even suggesting it

me: ok. fine, I give up"
1038,"Calc 2 is tough. Flex all you want, that‚Äôs great! Congratulations!"
1039,Nice but calc 2 is not an advanced math class. Most stem majors have to take some sort of calc 2 (applicational for bio etc or pure math based for CS or engineers). The upper level math class I had to take for my secondary math major (primary being CS) were almost not even numbers anymore... take abstract algebra and you‚Äôll understand what I mean
1040,"Yes. again. almost zero normal people are going to be able to actually use that in meaningful ways. especially people learning it in their adult life for ""fun."" almost no random office worker or retail worker is going to benefit from calculus. it's basically all theoretical for 99.99999999% of people. unlike stats, which can help you make better sense of daily news reports and basic shit that comes up in the real world.

and if you are someone that wants to go into a field that uses calculus, then by all means, please learn calculus, but I'm mostly taking about for the majority of people that aren't actually using high level math as a main part of their job (the vast vast vast majority of high school students), and just want to supplement their knowledge and give them a better view/understanding of the world."
1041,"You're not getting it. 99.999999999999999% of people are never going to be using neural networks (and don't come back with ""actually neural networks are all over"" because then I will come back with ""people use microwaves every day yet don't understand how they work""

And if you plan to be in some job that uses calculus, then learn calculus. I'm not saying not to learn calculus. But for your average high school student, or middle aged person that wants to learn some math, calculus is pointless.

And they are much better off learning statistics. I'm just saying that someone that doesn't plan on doing crazy math stuff, it makes a billion times more sense to study statistics rather than calculus. And if you want to study calculus after statistics, go ahead and do it.

I'm not saying not to study calculus, just that statistics is more important for the vast vast vast majority of people, and if they want to go on to study calculus, they can.

Just do statistics first."
1042,"ughhh, this is so tiring. fucking checkmate. sure. fuck this. you win. happy?"

1044,"Flex on my friend!!!!

Love it when students talk dirty like this!!!!!!


Seriously, congratulations and thank you for posting as encouragement for other students!!!!!"
1045,That would be -cosx right?
1046,"Nah, there's really no reason to learn stats first. Stats isn't a prerequisite for calculus, stats doesn't help you understand calculus, stats is like a completely subject. 

Tbh I really don't understand your obsession with stats. The applications of statistics are so less, it's really only useful to data scientists, which makes up a negligible percentage of people."
1047,"Were you actually told that by ""total strangers"" about class planning, or are you implying teens shouldn't listen to their guidance counselors?"
1048,"If I‚Äôm a straight-A student, I‚Äôll look at a B and be disappointed. If I‚Äôm a barely-passing student, I‚Äôll look at a B and be ecstatic. Grade comparisons are how you create a toxic learning environment, putting down those who are struggling. I saw it all the time in high school, and I see it occasionally in college too, maliciously or not. We don‚Äôt need another A2C here."
1049,"I‚Äôll rephrase it in more of a CS major way (I‚Äôm one too). 

It‚Äôs easy to just look at the raw data and say that an A is better than a B. And sure, it is. But that‚Äôs not the point here. The point is that OC is proud of how well they did. It shouldn‚Äôt matter how good you or I think their accomplishment is, because it‚Äôs *their* accomplishment. 

If they decide to tell their grade, and others tell them that they shouldn‚Äôt be proud of that, that hurts. You don‚Äôt know what work went into it, so it‚Äôs not your place to judge. I know you mean well in asking, but please try and refrain from it. Congratulate them! Be encouraging! That‚Äôs how you make a great learning environment, and it‚Äôs necessary for a support sub like this one."

ChemE is hard enough for me. Congrats"
1079,"A double major is when you take the courses for both majors but do not meet the credit requirements for 2 degrees. So only one major is printed on your diploma. 

Double degree is when you take the courses for both majors but you meet the credit requirements (at my uni it's 120 for standard 1 degree, 150 for double degree). So you get 2 diplomas since you completed enough credits for more than one degree. 

Note: these can be in any subject. Biochemistry and Genetics or biochemistry and journalism. The BS and BA don't really matter, that's just the title of the degree."

1135,I remember in high school I was on the bus one early morning and saw a wifi named ‚ÄúFBI Surveillance Van‚Äù and I tried to look out the window for it.
1136,"Mine was ""Pretty fly for a wi-fi""  


I feel old now, thanks reddit."
1137,"My brother's are ""NSA"" and ""ComcastSucks"" ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ he's a software engineer and works in tech which makes it even funnier"
1138,"Mime and my roommates is ""2 girls 1 router"" and I still laugh every time I see it"
1139,"Ah, we don't have dogs at our place. You might just be talking about my roommates tho"
1140,Congrats!  Great job!  I can understand how difficult it was for you.
1141,Thank you so much!
1142,Thanks! It's only going to get more challenging from here of course lol. I'm just glad to finally be pushing to better myself.
1143,PBSC is the shid
1144,"me too- still dealing with the repercussions.

BUT, I graduated with a 3.9 and am now a grad student.

Keep looking up! Congratulations on your achievements thus far- more await."
1145,Yeah because the concentration and dedication skills they must have learned to get a 4.0 combined with the class material they clearly aced and the benefits a high GPA have on applying for jobs out of college definitely don't matter at all.
1146,"Hell yeah man, thanks for that. We made mistakes but we still got this. Let's goooo"
1147,"I understand the sentiment. This means a lot more to me than the academic achievement though. No hard feelings, I totally understand what your trying to say. Different things are valuable to different people in different ways. In 10 years I hope to look back on this piece of paper and remember when I took action in my life. Cheers man."
1148,"This actually blew up more than I thought it would lol. So if I miss a post and can't say thank you personally, just know you guys made me tear up. This meant more to me than you know. Y'all are awesome, and thank you so much for the support."
1149,"Haha I like it so far. Do you still go there? I'm hoping to get a transfer to UF pulled off. Got accepted to honors, so going to see if I can work some magic that way."
1150,"Honestly I liked PBSC better. FAU has strong political leanings (depending on what you lean towards it may be better for you). Also, it felt too huge at times. That is, at PBSC I felt more one on one attention than I did at FAU. 

All in all not a bad school, but tbh if PBSC offered more BA programs I would just stick with them. 

What are your long term goals?"
1151,Congratulations!!! That‚Äôs amazing!
1152,Are you kidding? How many people do you know achieve a 4.0 GPA?
1153,No I graduated and then went on to FAU for my BA
1154,I recently graduated in my 30s with a 3.9 GPA after never even attending high school. Had to work through a GED on my own and then 6 years for a BS because of mental health and family struggles. I understand what you mean... what the grade means money-value wise isn't at all related to what it means to earn it against hard odds. A sincere congratulations! You have proven to yourself that you *can* do whatever you put your mind to and that is honestly one of the most valuable lessons to learn. Keep going and know the path doesn't matter as much as the journey.
1155,"That was actually something I was worried about with a larger university. PBSC has been great in that regard I'm able to get feedback and communication easily, SLC is great with tutoring and paper reviews. Way better then I originally expected. 

I'm going to pursue an computer engineering B.S, as far as career options Ive looked at the market and haven't really settled on anything in particular. I'm sure I'll have more options in the future and plan on doing some internships if I can, so that might help me get a better picture."
1156,"I cant imagine how difficult this journey must have been so far for you Erick, you should be immensely proud of how far you've come and hopefully excited about the possibilities of the future. You've got this, and even if you ever feel like you cant I believe that you can do it!"
1157,This means more to me than you even know. Thank you so much!
1158,"What exactly makes you think OP defines their life by financial success? Maybe they value the knowledge earned by that intense study, or maybe they're working toward a graduate degree in which GPA most definitely matters.

Also, if you want to take your perspective to its extreme, someone could just as easily say, ""Hey dude, your F50 company job doesn't matter because you're going to die eventually. Finances and company job mean nothing in the end."""
1159,"That's exactly how I feel. This shows me I'm still worth it and I can still make my dreams come true if I work for it. Sincere congrats to you as well for pushing through it, your an inspiration. Hopefully in a few years I can write you back and say I made it!"
1160,Congratulations!üéâüéâ
1161,Thanks!!
1162,With honors? I'm so proud of you!
1163,Thanks! I figured might as well push it as hard as I can and try to get int o a good school and honors seemed the best way to get admission or maybe a honors scholarship if I'm lucky. Don't know unless you try!
1164,Anecdotal evidence... Very reliable.
1165,"Hey Erick. I‚Äôm proud of you üëè 


Now go change the world in your own way."
1166,"People in grad school and jobs that require a graduate degree, that's one.

Don't hate. It's a point of pride and it can get you places."
1167,"So happy for you. Im 32, similar history and halfway thru a degree right now. I needed this because the last couple months have been tough. Thanks for sharing your success"
1168,Bert Reynolds alma mater.
1169,I dropped out in 2013 with a 1.48 and severe depression and in the subsequent years got locked up a few times in a psychiatric hospital. Came back in 2020 and got a 3.51 for the year. Congrats!
1170," Yes. I graduated last year with a Bachelors in IT.....feels like I never went to college. 

I can say in the IT world there are certain concepts and words I‚Äôm familiar with but actually remembering what I learned in my management class or business law class?....not a chance"
1171,"Applies to everything I'm aware of.

Absolutely sure it applies to mechanical engineering."
1172,Does this also apply to mech eng?
1173,"Isn't a big part of education learning how to access and utilise information, not necessarily just regurgitate it?"
1174,"It‚Äôs the memory dump! I get good grades too, but there are so many things I just flush out as soon as it‚Äôs over. 

Thankfully, all hope is not lost! When it comes to studying for finals, you won‚Äôt have to fully relearn the information since the connects will already be there in the background. I completely understand that fear associated with feeling like you don‚Äôt know the material, but once you start to look over it again, it will all start to come back even stronger."
1175,As someone getting a degree in IT right now.... You have no idea how much this comment helps lol.  I thought it was just me.
1176,"Yup, it‚Äôs a little phenomenon known as the forgetting curve."
1177,F
1178,You don't have to rub it in...
1179,"This was told to me by some one my freshman year and it has held true ever since. College thought me how to find information (research), how to organize that information and how to present it. Regardless of your degree, unless you are in a super specialized field like Medicine or law, most of us will not use what we learn in school, but the skills that got us by is what we tend to remember.  Hell in some fields the information in school is so outdated you need training before starting any actual job."
1180,"Most things IT related that I‚Äôve learned that actually help me in my job I‚Äôve learned from studying for certifications and on the job training. 

But like I said some concepts I was already familiar with from school that my job was just starting to get into. Like SCRUM. And the Agile method and things like that. 

But yea I can‚Äôt even tell you how to solve a calculus  problem  now and I got a B in the class when I took it. üòÇüòÇ"
1181,"Engineer here who was worried about taking the FE exam three years out of school for this very reason. But it's not about remembering every little detail, it's about knowing how to relearn it quickly. This was explained by nearly ever instructor I had.

I use knowledge from maybe 9 of the 130 credits I took on a daily basis but every now and then something pops up and I know where to find it. I could not solve a Laplace transform or partial differential equation from memory to save my life right now, I forget Ohm's law sometimes because there is so much in my head... But I know that I can recall that information from a text or my old notes (keep these) and solve a problem with confidence."
1182,"I honestly feel that this is just the aim right now for me this semester. Just pass the exams, don't remember anything after cause I need room for the other stuff for my other exams.

But usually yeah, it gets pushed to some small recess in the back of my mind to come out at the weirdest situations where that bit of knowledge isn't even useful."
1183,"Yes, I learned in psychology that there's a forgetting curve basically. The gist of it says that we forget 90% of what doesn't get stored in our long-term memory after about 3 months. So when we graduate we actually retain about 10% of what we learned over 4 years. Food for thought."
1184,"Very very much so. Mechanical engineering could be like, ten different degrees. Mechanics, Fluids, Thermodynamics, Hydraulics, Heat Transfer, Stress Analysis.... Pick one or two that make the most conceptual sense to you, or which ones you'd like to apply in the workforce and focus most on understanding those."
1185,[deleted]
1186,"The assistant broadcast engineer I worked with taught me ""it doesn't matter what you know, what matters is that you know where to look up the answers quickly"". Always stuck with me, applies to all engineering fields basically."
1187,What a lovely Reddit account.
1188,"Honestly, I've started to come to terms with this. How much of what you ""learn"" is useful? Just pass and be happy for the degree you get. I understand wanting to remember stuff, but our brains are good at filtering useless stuff, or what we perceive as useless. The fact that you forget what you've learned, probably means that you don't see the use for it, so even though you're consciously unaware of it, your brain helps you out. However, the stuff you do remember is the stuff that most likely intrigues you and which you perhaps even want to apply in your life or your career. Focus on that stuff."

1191,"*Doctor doing open heart surgery*

1192,"Yup, but as my friend once said: ""5% is about what you learn, 95% is what you do on the job."". If it's not a trade, your best bet is to just learn the concepts and laws/regulations, then really learn everything else on the job, especially because all companies are somewhat different in how they do things. This is coming from an Accounting and Finance major who felt like he didn't LEARN much."
1193,Good grades? Yes. Have I learned anything useful? No.
1194,"This needs to be higher in the comments. A prof I respected once told me that college is about 'learning to learn, not learning to memorize'. If you know how to learn, then you can pick up anything when you need it. If you learn to memorize, you are going to be in for a bad time."
1195,The best thing I've been told is that college is just a test to see how much BS you can put up with. You'll learn almost everything on the job.
1196,I‚Äôm not even done with my comp sci degree and I‚Äôve already forgotten calc ü§£
1197,"Best way for me to learn is office hours, not the lecture videos or anything like that. I can‚Äôt even drag myself to office hours for one class because I don‚Äôt know what to ask. The course is poorly paced by making us watch one PPoint weekly. I hate online learning."
1198,My brethren
1199,"I feel like that's the fate of 90% of the classes we're forced to take. It's not for purpose, just to get out money to complete a degree that really only needs a handful of classes."
1200,I‚Äôve never heard a yellow yolk referred to as ‚Äúred‚Äù.
1201,"Not that it‚Äôs bad for you, just that it‚Äôs a large about of simple carbs for most pastas. This meal is just carbs, fat, and cheese. 

That being said, a childhood favorite of mine and one of the easiest tasty meals to make!"
1202,"Lol you're actually italian, that gives your pasta more credibility."
1203,"Ahaha I guess, but the word yolk didn't come to mind and here we call it ""rosso dell'uovo"", or ""red part of the egg"", but I don't know why because we have its own word to call the yolk so..."
1204,"Heard it in this thread, but all the people here in Italy eat it and I've always eaten it too. BTW, not people with eating disorders but athletes and healthy people. It's a staple in our diet since God knows when, and it's considered an ealthy option"
1205,"I usually use only the red of the egg, the white doesn't feel good with pasta, and I usually add it after.
But yeah, that's good too, I just don't need more substance because parmigiano gives the protein and I70 grams of pasta are enough substance for an average guy like me"
1206,Bruh how is that healthy lol
1207,"For those saying it‚Äôs unhealthy ‚Äî it‚Äôs not the healthiest meal, but it‚Äôs unprocessed Whole Foods for the most part. As long as it‚Äôs paired with some vegetables and something with a little more protein, it can totally be considered healthy. If anything, it‚Äôs so much better than many other cheap/easy options that college students often turn to."
1208,"Where I'm from, the yolk is called the red part of the egg, while it's obviously Yellow, and I thought it was the same in English. Turns out I'm wrong"
1209,[deleted]
1210,"LOL, it's *healthier* and cheaper than Chicken McNuggets. But, yeah, it's not healthy."
1211,You should post this in FoodPorn. The pretentious snobs here must eat oats and leaves and wash it down with almond milk
1212,"Oil, cheese, and refined white pasta are not whole foods lmaoo"
1213,"Carbs are fine, simple refined carbs like this pasta is not cool."
1214,"Homegrown eggs in Europe often have yolks that are a dark orange colour. 

The colour orange didn't actually have a name until quite recently in history. It was actually named after the fruit, rather than the other way around, but the colour itself was known as red or yellow-red before."
1215,And a hearty bone apple teeth from me.
1216,"Compared to a Big Mac? Sure.

Compared to actual healthy food? Nope."
1217,"This guy: it‚Äôs fairly healthy

r/college: is that fucking CARBS I see????! Are you trying to get yourself killed? I only eat uncooked organic asparagus with no seasoning and frankly I am repulsed.

Seriously though, this is a gourmet ass meal compared to the hot pockets and fast food that make up the average college diet. I eat it myself about once a week, and it‚Äôs not the healthiest thing in my diet but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a cheat meal either. God bless Italy for aglio e olio."
1218,"OP, that looks really great!! Have you considered using a crockpot to cook stuff? I usually [make this when I don't have a lot of energy to cook](https://www.wellplated.com/crock-pot-mexican-casserole/) or usually try to get creative with whatever I have. I love using my crockpot since I can just put stuff in and not have to worry about cooking a lot. Hope you have a great day!!"
1219,It's not toxic to say a bowl of spaghetti isn't a healthy meal any more than it's toxic to say licking batteries isnt safe

1221,Alright listen Mr. Namaste not all of us eat organic yak yogurt while washing it down with gluten free rattlesnake piss while meditating in the mountains.
1222,Add two or three drops of sesame oil to the egg before adding to the pasta.
1223,Refined white pasta just ain‚Äôt it
1224,"Chad thinkin garlic is the veggies. üòÇ this post and people actually advocating that a bowl of pasta, oil, and cheese is healthy is actually blowing my mind. Are people that far off from basic nutritional knowledge?"
1225,That's what I thought. I didn't eat only that but a salad and some other cheese (an expecually good goat cheese that I know it's rich in protein ^and also fats but shhhhhh)
1226,We make this all the time and it literally tastes like something you buy at a restaurant only 100x cheaper
1227,"If you pair it with healthy stuff it does become more healthy, correct"
1228,"I'm vegetarian, but I don't understand this comment nonetheless. It's a dish that's popular here where I live and met eaters too eat it, when people need a fast and tasty meal"
1229,"Definitely does. I'd suggest not chopping the garlic, but simply squash a clover then let it rest in the oil while the pasta cooks, then take it out, if you like a milder garlic taste"

1259,You should do a stat for how many times the annoying extrovert asked everyone to turn their cameras on for no good reason.
1260,"Only 3 missing submissions? Are you even real?? 

(But other than that, nailed it!)"
1261,You can tell it‚Äôs probably the same class every time too. 16 meetings weekly twice a week = 32
1262,">cameras on for no good reason.

Maybe they wanted their professor to fell like they were talking to human beings instead of blank screens? That doesn't like ""no good reason"" to me. It's a bit hypocritical how students ask for sympathy and empathy from professors, while rarely offering it themselves."
1263,‚ÄúAssignments submitted between 11:55-12 am‚Äù damn that hit close ü•≤
1264,"For those who do turn on the cameras, it helps us get to know each other better and figure out who we can get along with and relate to. When we finally went back to school in person, I felt like I knew all the camera-on people and was good friends with them, whereas I barely recognized the non-camera people, didn't know their names and had no idea how to talk with them. So I didn't bother. I've got a pretty strong friend group now and it's mostly the camera-on folks. We help each other with assignments, go out to dinner together, hook each other up with part-time jobs, etc. The others, I still barely know them. The folks in that group seem disengaged from school, don't do as well on the group assignments, aren't included in study groups, and so on.

If you don't care about having friends I guess there's not as much to be gained for you."
1265,how did i never figure out that breakout rooms were a golden opportunity to ditch??
1266,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a webcam‚Äù

1268,I mean...so far it's only 3. But 2 more weeks to go lol.
1269,Serious question: why? What's the point?
1270,"It'll depend on the class, I think. Some professors visit each breakout room, to see what kind of discussion is being had. Others will end all rooms, returning everyone to the main room."
1271,I just left it on my bed with the camera off cause no one ever turned there camera on
1272,I liked it for interaction and for the people feel. And because I imagine it feels bad for the teacher. But it got annoying trying to look decent all the time
1273,You're missing the Chegg portion
1274,32 is rookie numbers
1275,Sorry about that lmao it was me
1276,"I can definitely say that looking up answers to help understand homework should not be considered cheating. And those that copy aren‚Äôt going to pass the tests anyway. In the case of online tests, if your test includes problems finable on chegg that‚Äôs on you for not putting in the time to at least change the numbers on stock problems."
1277,Cool took you a whole year to make it.
1278,Got to be careful not to overheat your laptop resting it on a soft surface.  Airflow is important.
1279,Instructors can also monitor and see if anyone disconnects from the breakout rooms from the section they use to assign them.
1280,Less than a week for me. Just gotta pass bio on Tuesday
1281,Body language and visual cues enhance communication.
1282,I can appreciate this post
1283,Team Blackboard all the way!
1284,I probably have more than that. That‚Äôs probably the time when I submit all my assignments.
1285,I do this at least three times a week. Because that‚Äôs how many assignments I have in a week on average (due at that time anyways‚Äîhave one weird professor who thinks 12pm on a Monday is a good time to turn in all assignments)
1286,"I made this last December and shared it on Facebook, working full time now but seeing times haven't changed so much, thought this sub would appreciate it"
1287,We have been doing in-person school for months now. I know who they are. We just aren't close.
1288,Take that to the DRC and the Academic ombud
1289,"Get used to it OP. Colleges are pushing for this to be the ""new normal"" so they can keep raking in tuitions and pumping out degrees for a fraction of their usual overhead. All we can do is keep loudly vocalizing our dissatisfaction with the deteriorating quality of education being sold to us at the cost of a house. We have all purchased an outrageously expensive product with certain expectations that aren't being met. 

Imagine if you bought a luxury car and come to find out you can only drive it 30 miles an hour because the transmission won't go past third gear. You would probably expect them to replace the car or refund your money right? So why do we expect anything less from our universities? Why don't they back up the product they are selling? In my opinion, students are WAY too complacent with their situation right now. We absolutely cannot allow this to become the new normal."
1290,Also a bio major and I can't remember anything. I recognize that it's familiar and I have learned it just can't place it. That is making 300-500 lvl classes that much harder
1291,"> he went on a full rant in our zoom about how we‚Äôre too babied and mental health isn‚Äôt an excuse.

yooooo why aren't you bringing this up to your dean?"
1292,Tbh this is how it feels for me even when I learn in person lol
1293,Yeah man I feel the same way. If it helps just think about how we have to do this for 2-3 more months at best. Time goes by fast when you have assignments due.
1294,"I actually love the fact that the exam was open notes. I think all tests should be open book/note and that students should be encouraged to collaborate and take them together. Guessing for an answer is not rewarded or valued in the workplace. Figuring something out with the tools available to you is. 

The best online class I took was a history class and the teacher put a ton of effort into designing it so we used free online resources and didn‚Äôt have to buy a book. 

Every week we had to watch a video, read some chapters from a free digital textbook and maybe got it a few other websites. To prove we actually did this stuff we had to answer around 20 questions and create footnotes that showed where in the materials we found our answers. We were allowed to use these on tests so it was great to have a footnote right there showing us where we found the answer and get more information.

Students HATED this class. They wrote terrible reviews on rate my professor and complained the whole time that it was way too much work. I did all of the work for the week on Sunday afternoon and it usually only took a couple of hours. Everything was due Mondays at 8. 

It has been YEARS since I took this class and I still remember so much stuff from it because of how it was designed. We had no Zoom meetings, very few discussion posts, no quizzes, just easy work and people still didn‚Äôt want to do it."

1296,"My grades are definitely gonna go up, but my knowledge is gonna do down."
1297,"Stigmatizing mental health, especially right now, is a serious problem. It‚Äôs not about babying people, it‚Äôs about respecting that not all individuals are neurotypical and recognizing that the mental health of many students is suffering due to the pandemic."
1298,I think it depends on the college. My college has really tried to get students back on campus and a lot of professors had the option to have in person classes. Maybe that's smaller colleges vs bigger colleges.
1299,Our university did this too and now we have Covid cases through the roof. Rip
1300,I definitely feel this and it sucks because my classes are getting harder. I‚Äôm definitely gonna try to do in person classes next semester.
1301,Bio major here as well. I took Orgo 2 last semester and I find it crazy how I‚Äôm still able to explain topics that we learn in person but when it came to learning the other half online I was just completely lost
1302,"> Tbh the two times I‚Äôve emailed my dean because of something a professor said/did, I got a ‚Äúwe‚Äôll look into this,‚Äù then nothing happens.

bro you gotta be persistent and push. The administrators and deans for the most part aren't going to move a muscle unless you force them to. If they don't respond/can't bother to look into it, you escalate the issue and go to the board."

1308,I feel like this is me both in person and online loo
1309,"Everyday... Especially in electrical engineering, these professors have a ""figure it out on your own"" type of attitude, that's why my classes have made a discord for each class so we can help each other out especially when the professor won't respond right away or it's late at night. It's been so helpful and keeping us sane I encourage everyone to do it, you won't be alone."
1310,"Using your platform as a professor to publicly shame those who may have little or no control over how their brain functions is not just stigmatizing, but is just plain mean. Not in a boo boo I‚Äôm gonna cry myself to sleep kind of way, but in such that it‚Äôs dehumanizing and cruel to be a dick like that TO ANYONE. We should have higher standards than that. The standards of conduct do not need to be changed to suit those who may have a brain disorder, and a professor needs not be so unprofessional and disrespectful towards their students when they are frustrated. If a professor feels that students are being lazy, there are many better options for dealing with them."
1311,"Right now, that‚Äôs all that matters bro."
1312,This is me right now. I'm just trying to pass lol. Settling for the bare minimum
1313,The professors aren't being paid more to do all that work.
1314,"Interesting. Bio major here too currently attending Arizona State University SOL program. So far the program has been great with lecture videos, self check quizzes and actual graded quizzes. I have pretty much retained a lot of the information at least for now. You guys are speaking my fear though which is not retaining information as I get into even higher level courses. Granted I study before the quiz and exam and don‚Äôt use my notes for the quizzes. The exams are proctored so no notes there either. If you want to ensure you‚Äôre retaining, I would suggest forcing yourself to study and not rely on open notes and book. Good luck!"
1315,It was so good. She really worked hard to force us to absorb information in the online modules
1316,"I‚Äôm a teacher and I have colleagues who are freaking out because ‚Äústudents can easily cheat on exams over Zoom!‚Äù I teach English, that‚Äôs never going to be a concern for me. Absolutely use your notes! I think it‚Äôs so much more important for my students to learn how to analyze writing and create their own work than memorize character names."
1317,"I'm not OP but also an instructor and I think it's because learning things on modules or in a Zoom meeting just isn't as immersive an experience as in-person learning. 

The knowledge is linked to fewer other memories and therefore is easier to ""misplace"" in one's brain.

It's sort of the reverse of the phenomenon where students score higher on the final exam if they take it under the same conditions as they experienced in the class (room, time of day, etc.)."
1318,Lucky! My professor saw no one finished more than 80% of our first exam so he made the next one even longer üò¢
1319,this kind of stuff makes the online classes much more bearable.
1320,"I totally agree. I didn‚Äôt do well on the tests (82, 77, 84 on the final) but the weight was mostly on homework (100 lol) so my grade was an 89 before the three point bump! I think that prof was very generous and I hope I learned enough for the next course"
1321,One of my finals last semester literally only had one question and it was easy. Some professors are just angels from heaven
1322,"I wish more professors were like this, instead one of my professors gave us our fourth exam today and on Thursday we‚Äôll have our final :‚Äô)"
1323,Exactly! My professor is a currently doing his PhD and he understands what‚Äôs we‚Äôre going through so that‚Äôs why he gave us free 10 points lol
1324,"Modern Physics, but close."
1325,Lol sounds like bio
1326,That‚Äôs awesome. I love it when they give you a little participation bump because it shows me that effort and attitude counts. This semester one of my Profs entered a B+ in the grade book even though my grade in canvas shows only 84... I‚Äôm not about to question it lol.
1327,"My probability theory professor handed out an extra 10% bonus on each homework if you submitted them more than 24 hours early and even included a bonus question worth up to 10% of the total score on every exam.

That was awesome."
1328,"My aerospace propulsion professor had pre-lecture quizzes where the first question would always be ""do you want points for this?""
There was a yes and no option until some dumbass complained about accidently submitting the wrong answer. Now there's only a yes option."
1329,"Evaluations are required for my school and if you don‚Äôt complete them it locks us out of the system, I wish I got points"
1330,"I had a question on a bio quiz with these options: 

B. Not this one

C. Not this one either

D. You should probably pick ‚ÄòA‚Äô"
1331,I had this happened to me this semester except I knew about it and studied hard for it. It was a bittersweet feeling when I opened that quiz.
1332,Semeseter!!!
1333,My professor did this when everybody answered the exact same response at least once in class polls
1334,"It doesn't, he just doesn't care. Just found out he made our final double the time but triple the questions. Makes even less sense."
1335,This hits home. When I took micro two years ago MOST of the class finished the 70-minute test in the last five minutes. Pretty sure I recall four or five people (about 15% of the class) didn‚Äôt even finish the exam
1336,Meanwhile my ochem prof wouldn‚Äôt budge when the whole class was practically begging for a curve. Our class average was horrible and in the 60s smh
1337,Where th3 fuck does that even make sense??
1338,Haha same except mine was in biology terms
1339,"I wish I knew who clicked it, but there must be that one person who must‚Äôve said ‚Äúfalse‚Äù as a joke lol"
1340,Sounds like microeconomics lol
1341,now that's a cool prof.
1342,"oh, I hate blackboard"
1343,Anybody choose false?
1344,Hello blackboard my old friend
1345,I heck yeah. thanks for the answers m8
1346,Lol this got onto the r/Professors thread and they're listing reasons why not to do this...is it so hard to just be nice sometimes? Wow.
1347,One of my professors makes it a living hell. But my lab professor made everything so much better and bearable
1348,My uni was actually smart and mailed mine in a rigid cardboard envelope and between two thick commencement programs.
1349,4 years for a bent piece of a paper = Everyone‚Äôs dreams
1350,"That actually sounds like a really great way of getting rid of extra commencement books, to just forcefully give extras to graduates."
1351,Going to get a curved frame for that tho.
1352,It‚Äôs now 3D.
1353,"I spent $120,000 on a piece of paper that says I read a bunch of books I didn't actually read.....

Edit: So...Duffle bag full of fake cocaine?"
1354,Let's see what mine does. They said I'll get it in 6-8 weeks.... Seems too much time huh....
1355,In my dreams it was cheaper.
1356,Usps being usps
1357,I‚Äôm annoyed that it‚Äôs bent :/
1358,*5-D chess sweats*
1359,"The college is at fault here, not the postal service. ""Do not bend"" is not an official designation for letters and delivery services have no obligation to respect it. It's like trying to mail a popsicle and writing ""do not melt"" on the outside. They should have not cheaped out and put a rigid cardboard backing or paid for a rigid envelope."
1360,This is a sign to always grade on a curve-from all ur future students :)
1361,"When I did my adult upgrade program to get into college (I noped out of highschool) they also mailed me a certificate thing in this way. put inbetween two pieces of cardboard, with other documents padding it. You'd think actual college programs would have this as standard practice. I don't even know what I did with the certificate I got from the program."
1362,"My college mailed mine in a cover. An identical cover to the one we got at the commencement ceremony. Now I have an extra diploma cover and I have no idea what to do with it.

My brother‚Äôs degree will probably come in like that. His school was a dumpster fire; he graduated on the 8th and still hasn‚Äôt gotten it yet."
1363,[deleted]
1364,"my graduation was in early May, albeit several years ago. Got the diploma in late July or early August"
1365,"The employer won't care.
When they get their first interview 2 years from now.

Good lucküëç"
1366,"Maybe in your dream its bent .
In my dream its flat"
1367,"It's not just the envelope, it's the method it was shipped. I think it would need to be parcel or priority or something to prevent it from being shoved in the mailbox."
1368,FYI I graduated from there a couple years ago and while it might not help given your mailbox situation‚Ä¶ There should be a card in the envelope that has information about getting a replacement if this exact thing was to happen or at least there was with my degree.
1369,Oh shit we go to the same college. I'm genuinely shook because Reddit is a pretty big platform and UAkron is relatively small!
1370,"Just to be clear, college is at fault here, not the postal service. ""Do not bend"" is not an official designation for letters and delivery services have no obligation to respect it. It's like trying to mail a popsicle and writing ""do not melt"" on the outside. They should have not cheaped out and put a rigid cardboard backing or paid for a rigid envelope.

Sorry that happened to you, though."
1371,"The school probably doesn't care if the folders are expensive because around here they charge a large graduation fee, so effectively the student pays the cost of both folders."
1372,We must share the same dreams
1373,hey proud tho that‚Äôs definitely not something i have
1374,bruh
1375,"If you live near the school, you could probably just drop the extra cover off to the Registrar. Those things are expensive"
1376,"I lived six hours from campus and it took almost 12 weeks, 6-8 is actually pretty quick!"
1377,I work in a Registrars Office and we definitely care - haha! It comes out of our budget and we don‚Äôt charge a grad fee. Of course this varies. :)
1378,Retirement

1381,What's after that
1382,boy have I got some good news for you
1383,"There's a high school in DC that claimed all its students were accepted to a college. This got the attention of NPR, which wanted to do a story about it.

In their research they found that a third of those students didn't even qualify to graduate. It caused the FBI to launch a fraud investigation."
1384,I wish lol
1385,"Well, of course. Once you achieve something, it soon means nothing to you again. 

Just think about all of the things you've achieved in the past. Got a good grade on an exam 4 semesters ago? Got invited to a party in your first week? Whatever you can think of, if it happened more than maybe a month ago, I can almost guarantee that you don't really care about it anymore. Sure, you can still be proud of it, but you're not going to lie awake at night smiling over that assignment you did well in 3 years ago because it isn't a part of your current life. 

Same thing applies to SAT/ACT and university applications. The moment you submit them, you may as well burn them. You'll never need them again, literally no one gives a shit about what you did in HS, and you'll soon forget even what *classes* you did in your final year. 

The fact that you no longer care is a good sign. It means that you've moved on and found more important things to think about. The only people happily reminiscing on their HS stats and the application process are the people who peaked there and have since been a failure in whatever sense. If someone is failing university but did well in HS, you can be certain that they'll tell you all about their old GPA."
1386,"Getting trapped by a job you hate and in a dead bedroom marriage, plus two kids who you barely have time to interact with along with several thousand dollars in medical debt "
1387,"I guess that's sort of true. I always felt like I lowered my own standards by applying for state schools (in the form of lower entry scores on SAT and ACT) as opposed to other places. Regardless, it's alot more bang for your buck IMO then going elsewhere for a degree."
1388,"I went back to school at 26 to get my first bachelors, and worked my ass off in community college to get accepted to the school that denied me back when I was 17. Sure as shit feels like an accomplishment to me. 

I get it, though. In my classes I'm surrounded by kids who got into university right out of high school. These are kids who've always done well in classes, whose parents helped them with homework or applications or whatever else, who had access to SAT prep materials, who actually had people telling them they needed to study, maybe someone even took the time to show them *how* to study. If you've got all that stuff, I can see how it might not feel like you personally accomplished anything. It's more like you've just been following the path the adults set out for you.

But think about how things might have been if you didn't have any of that. What if your parents never helped you with anything school-related, never looked at applications with you, never cared what your grades were like? What if your family didn't have money for prep materials, or even food? What if your school didn't bother with college talk because they didn't think any of you would have a chance to go? What if, despite having no help whatsoever, you still managed to get accepted to a good school? Would it feel like an accomplishment then?

So, if you're feeling like getting into university wasn't that big a deal for you, well, maybe it wasn't. Maybe you were helped along so well by the adults in your life that university just feels like the next step in the boring slog you've been railroaded into since childhood. That's ok, it's fine to feel that way.

But, before you start talking to folks about how easy it was to get in and how being there feels like nothing, think about who's nearby. There's a good chance the person right next to you had to fight tooth and nail through an endless mire of bullshit just to get accepted anywhere, let alone this amazing school, and overhearing you talk about how getting accepted was no big deal might crush whatever glimmer of pride they were starting to feel about themselves. I've overheard that conversation far too many times, and while I'm usually good at remembering that the kids talking like that don't understand how lucky they were, it still hurts. I still end up feeling like all the work I put in was only necessary because I'm an idiot. Don't be the person who makes someone feel that way."
1389,"I'd disagree, while yes it might have been overblown. Getting into a top college requires fhst hard work for atleast 90% of people. And atleast going to one myself that name allows you to get your foot in the door much eaiser. "
1390,Louisana was the one faking application documents.
1391,Don‚Äôt forget that casual coke habit you developed in college that you haven‚Äôt kicked yet
1392,"I'm 27. Have 90~ college credits from 4 different institutions.  Never had to take the SAT or ACT.  Had to take a placement test when I first started at 22 though, but you arent supposed to study for those."
1393,"Honestly, I just winged the SAT tests.

Edit: Apparently, I got a 1600 out of 2400. Good times."
1394,you mean in Louisiana?
1395,"Right there with you. 

My mom dropped out at 16, she lived in a super small farm town and her family needed her to go to work so they could have food. My dad finished high school but he admits that the only reason he graduated was because he was good at football, he had severe undiagnosed dyslexia and absolutely hated school. He went directly to the army then to hard labor. 

My parents didnt care much about school, they never made me to do homework or study or anything like that. They always said ""just try to do your best."" 

Through all of high school I would just go hang out with friends, do my work, go home and chill. I never really even thought about the future until I was 18, 5 months after I had graduated.

After graduation I worked in a kitchen for two years and thought ""I dont want to do this."" Suddenly I was super motivated to learn.

The look on my moms face was priceless when I told her I wanted to go to college. 

Im in my junior year right now studying wildlife management.

 It took me till sophmore year to figure out what I wanted to do, youll get there too, just gotta hang in there!
"
1396,Pretty much the only thing we‚Äôre guaranteed at this point 
1397,I had the same feeling and experience. I never thought school was for me. None of my family ever finish high school (my mom got get very at the age of 45). I worked hard labor. Got tired of it. Said I‚Äôd try a class. It was a long road being out for almost 7 years. Now I‚Äôm transferring to cal state. Honestly never saw this in my future. I also think the reason I didn‚Äôt want to go is because I never knew what I wanted to do. Honestly I still don‚Äôt. But I picked something that I feel I‚Äôm good at. Also has the earning potential behind it

1404,"I think it's a lot different if you come from a family where your parents don't expect you to go to college, and never went to college themselves."
1405,"Oh god yes. They made it seem as if you might as well kill yourself if you didn't get exceptional grades and get into a top university. I burned out from the stress and got booted out of the (grade obsessed) school. I go to a nice, easy going new school, find everything's a breeze because they didn't lay the same expectations on so thick, get to uni and bam. I realise it was in no way as massive a deal as they made it out to be. In absolutely no way as big of a deal. The fuckers."

1407,"What's a ""job offer?"""
1408,"Trust me, nobody was going to get their grade rounded up in his class."

1411,"Btw we are all taking the same exam and there isn‚Äôt a curve...

Check out my cross post to r/ professors"
1412,"Lol I trust you and I‚Äôm not surprised. Seems like many professors think this semester is actually easier and, as a consequence, are making it impossible to get an A unless you either cheat or go into office hours every day and kiss their ass.

Edit: Changed every to many"
1413,Once I had to interview with the NSA because my friend was getting an internship there. It was like a character witness is-this-person-a-terrorist interview. But the guy told me that his own brother had created Rate my Professor. I thought it was really interesting. What a small world
1414,"What a dickhead. There's no reason a professor should prohibit calculators. I mean, the email was surprisingly civil too. Although aren't your exams online? So what's the point, they can hardly stop you from getting out your calculator when they can't see or hear you."
1415,"It doesn‚Äôt make sense, what do they gain by being asses to students? Dude is such a dickhead in class as well it‚Äôs unbelievable.

I wouldn‚Äôt say every professor is like this, I have a really understanding Econ professor."
1416,"Statistics professor here. I think the main worry is, if a real calculator is allowed, then the professor would have no way to tell if you‚Äôre using a calculator or your phone.

His email response is unprofessional though."
1417,Never post in professors as a student. I‚Äôve seen so many of them talk about how they hate their students and talk down towards students. I hate that sub so much.
1418,"We have to use respondus lockdown browser, so they can see and hear us while we take the exam."
1419,"""hey do you know who made Rate my Professor?"" ""Yeah my brother Todd did""  

Probably like that maybe"
1420,"When I first posted there I wanted some perspective because I thought I was missing something, I soon realized they‚Äôre a bunch of sad fucks. Scrolled through their sub and now I want to know why they even teach."
1421,"It locks your computer to just the test and it stores video and audio of you. I think it also live streams to a proctor, but not 100% sure on that. Also it tracks eye movement to make sure you don‚Äôt look at anything other than the screen. My section is the only section that has to use this program."
1422,"Especially if it's a standardized exam like that, your next step is to forward it to the dean of that college (possibly CCing whoever's in charge of protecting students' rights/etc too), asking them to intercede with the professor.  You've done what you can as a student, but there are people responsible for ensuring that those standardized tests *are* standardized."
1423,"At this point it‚Äôs time to write the Department Chair explaining that students are not being tested equitably between sections of the same course, that you‚Äôve brought it to your instructor‚Äôs attention, and that they‚Äôve refused to assess his classes fairly. Escalate to the Dean if you cannot find a resolution. Respondus tells me your instructor doesn‚Äôt trust his students. That‚Äôs his problem, and it‚Äôs not fair to penalize your section over his insecurities."
1424,The brother of the NSA guy created it? How did that come up in an interview like that haha
1425,I appreciate your input. You are the first professor to reply that didn‚Äôt whine about students being lazy etc.
1426,"I guess somebody's getting a bad review on ratemyprofessor

That's tough"
1427,"That's ridiculous! I can understand why certain things like that are necessary, but still. That would be unthinkable at my college.

It may even violate privacy rights."
1428,Yup and apparently it‚Äôs unthinkable in the other sections as well. We have to use a basic 4 function calculator while others can use a graphing calculator.
1429,"Lots of profs are great. Some really love teaching. Others are just really glad they got a tenure position and get a pretty solid paycheck every month while TAs and scan sheets do all the grading. 

My feeling has always been, and always will be: ‚Äúbitch, I pay *YOU*‚Äù when I get someone like that. Like seriously, are they just there to satisfy their need to tell people what to do?"
1430,"Unfortunately, many profs don‚Äôt want to teach. Many professors work at universities because they want to do research and only teach because they are required to. That‚Äôs how you end up with bad profs most of the time. Though some do like to teach and are bad regardless."
1431,professors flip the fuck out over students sending unprofessional emails then do this shit
1432,His rating is currently an outstanding 2.3 on ratemyprofessor
1433,I had a physics professor that had a low rating and yeah she was a little rough around the edges but she expected student to show up to lecture and do their homework. I see nothing wrong with expecting that.
1434,What the hell's that? We don't use anything like that. It's stupidly easy to cheat.
1435,"They don‚Äôt gain anything other than satisfaction from defeating the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fair they can get their degrees from the comfort of their own homes while I had to work so hard for mine‚Äù idea. 

And you right. Definitely not every professor. But a lot of them and definitely ever professor on /rprofessors. (Slightly joking)"
1436,"Yeah you really have to take ratings with a grain of salt. A lot of the bad reviews are just people who don't want to put in the work. And you will find people who will complain about literally everything. That said, I understand the bad reviews for professors that teach freshmen level courses as if they are graduate courses."
1437,"Your professor‚Äôs response is digusting, rude and unprofessional. This is very unfair and I don‚Äôt understand why some professors don‚Äôt have common sense. I saw your post in the professor subreddit and those professors have no common sense or have super inflated ego."
1438,"I.. use to be horrible with forgetting to put my periods AFTER my in text citations. I took two different writing courses and for some reason and it never stuck. 

I enrolled in a Psychology class, and I don't know HOW, but the professor finally got it into my head that I have to put the period AFTER my in text citations. 

Don't give up hope for us idiots."
1439,"I always check for comments - I crave and love them. Feedback not only helps me grow, but also provides much needed motivation."
1440,They used psychology on you
1441,I absolutely love and appreciate comments from professors. I also immensely appreciate when they take the time to meet and discuss topics I did not understand on an exam or ways I could improve. Professors who show they care about students succeeding make me want to work harder.
1442,"One of my sister‚Äôs professors this semester has been recording feedback as video responses and attaching it to the comments section, and she loves it!"
1443,Sometimes it hurts to see the criticism but it‚Äôs for the better ü•≤
1444,This is a very well thought-out comment.  It contains excellent use of punctuation and grammar. Keep up the good work!
1445,"The citation is part of the sentence. If you said ""According to So-and-So..."" that part is part of the sentence, isn't it? Citation is the same thing.

I know you've got it now, but for anyone else reading."
1446,Aww <3 this should really be the norm. Feedback is critical to learning but profs have too many students usually to do this. It's a shame. :/ all about that $
1447,"One of my professors does like 30 second to 5 minute video comments. (Usually about 2 min) He is just great at identifying issues and ending with a compliment or vise versa. Always both sides. It makes me feel like the work I do is appreciated. I always end up going a little further for his classes. Admittedly, I am in a less popular major, but that engagement is great."
1448,"Education isn‚Äôt an ‚ÄúStudents vs. Professors‚Äù we‚Äôre all in it together. They have a job to do, and we have something to learn."

1450,You‚Äôre welcome! I know lots of students never see it or read it but I‚Äôm glad to hear that some do.
1451,It really motivates me to do better :))
1452,I always wonder if my students notice or care that I spend countless hours leaving comments and feedback. Thanks üòä
1453,"YES! office hours, or any extra help is always appreciated."
1454,It‚Äôs the flair for me
1455,"I always tell my students that if the period is not after the parenthetical, then citation is out on its own, alone and cold. Put the period after so the citation can be included with its matching content."
1456,"It‚Äôs great for self esteem, thank you for doing this for us students. With online learning it has helped me and I‚Äôm sure others feel like we are engaged in that class with almost everything being remote learning nowadays"
1457,"This is what I'm planning to do this semester! I hear audio feedback can help students get a sense of what the professor is saying and how they're saying it through the tone. Sometimes that tone comes off cold over text, and I really don't want my students to feel like I'm scolding them hahaha"
1458,"I was Having a difficult time leaving detailed comments in writing, a friend suggested that I leave voice memos for my students and that‚Äôs what I do now. They‚Äôre about 3 to 5 minutes long, and they give very detailed feedback on their papers. There‚Äôs so much more information you can provide with a little bit more personal expression. Know what I suggest is for people who are just not very good at leaving excellent written comments."
1459,I always read all of my comments. And it makes my day when they‚Äôre positive :)
1460,I didn't try to ignore it! I just have trouble not repeating mistakes sometimes.
1461,That's a shame!
1462,[Here ya go](https://libguides.css.edu/c.php?g=41681&p=265025).
1463,"I love feedback on my work, it gives me so much motivation to succeed and let‚Äôs me know I‚Äôm improving on a subject I was so nervous about."
1464,I love love love reading comments from professors. It tells me what I need to improve on for my next assignment. My weaknesses and strengths.
1465,"Same‚Äî I always check my feedback & appreciate every comment. 
And as a student in college who‚Äôs aspiring to be a college professor, this post has also made me happy :)"
1466,"You want the second one, but with a period and a space after the p.:

> He replied, ""Here ya go"" (_The_Professor, p. 1).

(Also, technically, you would need the year.)"
1467,Seriously though. It almost feels like a real world assignment again when you get comments
1468,That day will be so bittersweet; I‚Äôll also be waiting to close the biggest tab of my life: student loans!
1469,Shutting my computer down overnight is the big one for me...poor baby is almost always in sleep mode. High school me shut her down EVERY night but college me always has things open.
1470,That awesome relief when you submit an assignment on canvas and it shows the little confetti
1471,"100% agree on the planner thing, I feel so relieved after"
1472,I'm also waiting to close the biggest tab of my life: my life.
1473,YES! I always close all my tabs one-by-one for maximum satisfaction.
1474,"Haha exactly, I do this too. Whenever I do let my laptop shut down, I feel  like I‚Äôm finally letting her rest"
1475,You okay bro?
1476,"Mine doesn‚Äôt show this, my uni has got some explanation to do"
1477,I think my laptop appreciates it more than I do. Those fans run HARD and then it's just silence.
1478,They deserve it! Zoom is 1000% decreasing her lifespan and it's upsetting.
1479,"[Wikipedia] ""Fuck you"", [Class Portal] ""Fuck you"", [Reddit] ""You're cool""."
1480,"I have a day to day planner, and every night I put a big curl through there. It almost feels like a pat on my back for all the stuff I did that day"
1481,"I use browser and it still shows, sometimes they show other stuff like balloons and ninjas"
1482,I'm still in high school but I usually have to have like 10 tabs open to do my calculus homework and it's so nice closing them all after
1483,"Kinda, but thanks for asking. How are you?"
1484,"idk if it's the same for other ppl but it only has confetti on the app, and not on browser!"
1485,pressing command q before shutting my laptop off is just....one of the best feelings.
1486,"Besides being swamped with schoolwork amidst a pandemic and a political climate that is more openly chaotic than ever, I‚Äôm doing well lol. Anyways, if you need a friend to talk to, just pm me!"
1487,Me after submitted my blackboard discussion posts.
1488,"Professors feel the same way! Grade that last paper or exam? Ahhhhhh!

P.S. ‚Äî Is there a difference between ""SAAAME"" and ""SAMEEE""? The former sounds to me like vehement agreement whereas the latter sounds like someone calling out [this guy](https://cdn.britannica.com/35/212035-050-FDD8580D/Sammy-Sosa-2001.jpg)."
1489,What?! I wish we had confetti on Moodle!
1490,"I'm in college but when I do my calc homework I usually end up with a tab of the website where I gotta submit the answers, two tabs of symbolab, a tab of desmos, a tab of me googling the volume of some shape, and sometimes a tab with the lecture/notes open lol"
1491,that's so cute omg
1492,"Dude I'm not in uni, yet I googled 1000's of uni's and closed 25+ tabs with no conclusion üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è"
1493,It's like the mental version of taking your bra off after a 16hr day
1494,I feel like there should be some sort of payment from university or the government for accelerated laptop depreciation
1495,"It's alright. It was just a dark joke after a couple of terrible weeks.

Thank you for asking. How are you?"
1496,IKR :D
1497,"I'm not certain this will work, but you can try adding ""?confetti=true"" (without the quotation marks) to the end of the submission page link to get the confetti!"
1498,That's a pretty odd move. I would think a professor would know that things like that got cancelled. Did they people to feel bad about themselves for not being able to have an internship?
1499,Queen shit
1500,"It was the weirdest thing. He‚Äôs my research advisor and club advisor. We get along pretty well, so I‚Äôm half convinced to bring it up at our next meeting. That being said, I‚Äôm pretty sure he realized halfway through what a shit idea it was because his face just kept dropping. Lol.

Edit: I‚Äôm not actually gonna bring it up to him, guys. Lol."
1501,"Our professor is having us do an icebreaker discussion including what fun things we did this summer. I‚Äôm legit going to say that my fun thing was not dying. Like BRUH our entire semester is online because of a pandemic, and campus closed because we‚Äôre getting smoked out by the state‚Äôs second largest wildfire in history. I have my shit packed to evacuate. What fun things do you think your students have been doing?"
1502,"that's not even an ice breaker, that's an ice creator!"
1503,Honestly though.
1504,Well at least it sounds like he realized his mistake. It would've been awkward to start and stop people.
1505,"I love how they just don‚Äôt address there is a pandemic as if we can just ignore that. ‚ÄúAny plans for the weekend?‚Äù Literally staying in and doing work you assigned me, Professor."
1506,"My professor is making us create an introduction slide about our hobbies and stuff. Luckily, we all know each other from previous classes, so it's not that bad."
1507,"I gotta share this ice-breaker story.  By far the worst one I've ever had.

Back ground first:  I've transferred a few times and for some reason most school hate the history credits from other schools.  So I'm taking ""History Survey: Ancient through Byzantine"" for the 3rd time.  Our ""professor"" teaches 3rd grade during the day.  We were his only college class.  He treated us like 10 year olds.  We went around the room reading the book aloud.  We drew pictures about the topics and had our classmate add onto them.  That was suppose to ""create a study guide"" for final exam.  That exam was 12 randomly selected essay questions from a pool of 30.  Each required 1/2 page answers.  Hand written during class.  And we drew pictures together to study for it.  For a freshman level class.  Now you know that kind of nonsense I was dealing with.  

For the ice breaker: He assigns a partner.  You stand face to face, maintaining eye contact.  Each of you does various hand gestures, stomps, etc and the partner is supposed to mimic them even though they could only see them through the their peripherals.  You don't say a word during this ""ice breaker"".  This went on for several minutes.  To make it more uncomfortable, the girl I was paired with had a very severe facial deformity.  You could tell she was mortified by this.  It affected the entire structure of her face and forehead. When I'm 3 feet away and meant to be staring this distraught stranger in the eye for several minutes, it was impossible not to glance at the rest of her face.  We both felt aweful at the end of it.

&#x200B;

So, yeah, if you're a professor trying to come up with ice breakers, don't even consider that one."
1508,"It definitely would‚Äôve. I kind of feel bad for him, ngl."
1509,It really is. You could tell some people were really annoyed or disheartened from the tone of their voice.
1510,"Really? That's the question they went with? Fun things you did this summer?

""WELL... I got sick, I lost my job, I was kicked out of my dorms, I had to wear a mask for months, I got quarantined and couldn't leave the house for weeks which caused a depression and nearly got me to fail my online classes and due to sever luck of motivation. I wanted to fly aboard for a vacation but all airports worldwide closed and all flights were canceled. I didn't get my money back on my burnt ticket. Oh, but I finally bought Minecraft! (with money I don't have cause... unemployed)""

I mean..maybe he/she is trying to lighten the mood by making you think of the positive things that happened? Idk."
1511,"I think our professor got it right by asking specific questions and then commenting. She asked us like whether we were ‚Äúmorning or night‚Äù people, hobbies, what we would have become if we didn‚Äôt pursue Medicine, and our preferred specialties (we‚Äôre in med school). There was no pressure to share our hobbies, but she was clearly happy when people posted things like their baking or their pets or their merchandise."
1512,"It probably didn‚Äôt matter that much in past years since you mentioned that for STEM seniors it‚Äôs quite common to have internships. 

Probably an honest mistake lol"
1513,Holy shit that‚Äôs the worst ice breaker I could think of. Like she thinks it‚Äôs easy to find an internship
1514,This is a bad icebreaker even if there wasn‚Äôt a pandemic. There‚Äôs always bound to be at least a couple people that didn‚Äôt get or lost them for some reason or another.
1515,"Oh dear god. That sounds so terrible. I hate icebreakers so much, tbh. I think anyone that benefits from icebreakers will naturally speak to people without icebreakers. You‚Äôre just putting everyone else on the spot."
1516,"It definitely was. lol. he's the nicest guy ever, which is why I'm half-tempted to joke about it with him, but I also don't wanna make him feel bad. I'm just throwing this out there for any potential lurking professors and to laugh (rant? lol) a little bit."
1517,"Yeah. That makes it easier. We know each other, but there‚Äôs a bit of tension which makes it awkward."
1518,"Lol that sounds like it may be a good idea for overactive 3rd graders, but NOT college students oof"
1519,"It‚Äôs always hard to find an internship, but it was even worse this past summer. I got a last minute lucky position. Otherwise, I totally would‚Äôve been without an internship as well. I have no idea why he thought that was a good idea at all."
1520,"Does everyone at your college need to have done at least one internship before taking that class?

And Jesus, I don't know why the professor thought it would have been a good idea. He/she must be very ignorant of what's going on around..."
1521,"If more people responded with this, maybe the professors would quit asking."
1522,"That's so uncomfortable, oh my gosh. I hope it was a wake-up call to the professor to see the challenges that students are facing right now since clearly he didn't think much about it before asking the question. I'm sure he didn't have bad intentions so hopefully he switches up the icebreaker for other sections he may teach. I think any questions asking about the past summer are just going to lead to awkward answers."
1523,"No. It‚Äôs not a requirement for our major, but it‚Äôs pretty much necessary to secure a job right out of college. Because of that, I understand why he mentioned it, but a lot of us aren‚Äôt going to get jobs right out of college anymore, internship or not."
1524,"I would prefer to just not do an ice breaker at all, my most hated thing about starting a new semester. So to answer your question no I wouldn't prefer them to ask about all the bad shit, I would prefer they just not ask at all."
1525,"Yeah. I honestly agree with this, but given how prevalent internships in our field, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever been super harmful before."
1526,No. He's super cool. He definitely just didn't think about it. He has about a million different projects and responsibilities going on at once; I think he genuinely just forgot that just because his summer wasn't any different doesn't mean ours weren't. haha.
1527,Oh ours were during our zoom lecture. I wish it would‚Äôve been a forum. That definitely sounds a lot better!
1528,"It looks like the old round sinks they used to have in bathrooms in the 80s. You held your hands under the water that was sprinkling out. Some had a bar that you pressed with your foot to turn the water on, some just ran all the time


https://images.app.goo.gl/VEgKZvHTMMaie3rLA"
1529,Looks like the hand washing station at my elementary school in the 60‚Äôs...
1530,"This is definitely an old style sink from the 80s. It's hilarious people think this is a urinal, or have been using it as a urinal. Not sure how tall it is from the photo, but these are very popular in kids elementary schools back in the day.

Also, that huge plastic reservoir looking thing at the top is for  liquid soap. Huge soap dispenser you could buy bulk soap for and fill."
1531,That looks like a sink. Are you sure?
1532,The middle thing looks like it‚Äôs from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets sooo I don‚Äôt trust like that....
1533,"Looks like the consensus decided this is a sink...
But I propose the following hypothetical question if this was actually a urinal:

Do you position yourself next to each other, testing personal space limitations? 
Or do you position yourself across from each other? More space between each other but a more vulnerable position sight-wise."
1534,"I thought so too, but the sink looks to be in the back wall with the soap dispensers above."
1535,"Same, except ours was a semicircle up against a wall, there was a bar at the bottom you had to step on to get the water to come out.  This was in the 80s."
1536,"If 4 people piss in it at the same time it opens a portal to hell, which is still just ucf"
1537,Some football stadiums have these type of urinals. They‚Äôre definitely a think. I had to pee in one as a kid and was weirded the fuck out.
1538,It's a [sink](https://www.sustainablesupply.com/bradley-wf2608-b-std-f-tma-lsd-washfountain-terrazzo-circular-54-b-drain-c1974754?CAWELAID=120205040001635435&CAGPSPN=pla&CAAGID=40502053439&CATCI=pla-485063617581&gclid=CjwKCAjwsO_4BRBBEiwAyagRTU4ngKpO7AEBBCGlhOdkpxrgxHGXdAxpWpCWWSno54S3_qJmbhkSXxoCgtEQAvD_BwE). Can't help that people are using it wrong.
1539,[Original post here](https://imgur.com/a/FJvcZ)
1540,Yeah but there can be multiple kids of sinks. And the thing at the top of the supposed urinal/sink looks like a soap dispenser
1541,"i go to ucf, they are both sinks. the urinals are uncomfortably close to each other to the bottom left/behind the pov of the picture. it's the kind of bathroom you go to once and then avoid at all cost after that though. 
 
that's not a soap dispenser unless they added one recently"
1542,"it's already bad enough without needing to lie. that's a sink, not a urinal. the sink obviously has a single foot pedal around the whole thing that shoots water out in a circle. so if more than 1 person steps on it, everyone is graciously soaked in the middle of the day because why not."
1543,"Definitely a sink.  My brother purchased an older industrial building that we fixed up a while back.  The bathroom had one of these and it was a sink.  If I recall correctly it even had a foot activated faucet so you didn't have to touch anything with oily hands.  

The real question is how many people at this college pissed in that sink."
1544,"A trough along a wall is pretty common. A circular one that makes you face the other dudes with their dicks out, now that's weird"
1545,Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs just a sink. Are you sure someone hasnt been pranking you?
1546,The men's bathroom at Nebraska's football stadium has a giant trough you pee in. It's a never ending river of piss on game days.
1547,This one might be but circular urinals do exist. This one is pretty tall to be a urinal but I‚Äôve used one that was in the ground
1548,Because they are national champions
1549,Dude just admitted to pissing in the sink. I wonder how many people who have given him looks while he just... pisses in the open.
1550,Why?
1551,"Had the same thing in one of my classrooms, this was in the 2010s"
1552,"I had one of these at my high school, except it was metal and in the middle of the bathroom so it was a full circle. We would trick the shadows into thinking the sink was sound activated by having them clap while someone stood behind the sink and turned it on. We loved that old thing but sadly they remodeled at the end of my freshman year and got rid of it."
1553,Also ucf person here. It's a sink. I really don't make much of it but I guess this bathroom at msb is more unique than others. Funny that of all things ucf this is posted here but yeah op is joking
1554,"According to [this](https://imgur.com/a/FJvcZ) in depth pictorial tour, it is a sink. Not that those urinals aren't hell, but that round thing in the OP picture is definitely a sink"
1555,"I can‚Äôt comment my hidden gem, because you‚Äôve already won I-"
1556,"Bruh the piss trough is everywhere, I've seen them in public park restrooms, Century Link field, etc etc."
1557,It's a sink. OP made the title up

1561,The granola bar part was hilarious.
1562,Haha I sometimes wish I had this level of depending on others and not giving a fuck üòÇ
1563,"I'd really like to see actual numbers for the number of freshman claiming to pursue challenging fields and then fail or switch to something easier.  Granted, this take place before most formally declare their major, but it feels like 90% of freshmen claim to want to be doctors, engineers or lawyers.  

Then reality hits them, they realize that they actually have to learn the material and can't rely on others.  

It's really not their fault either.  Not everyone has the aptitude for that.  I blame the advisors and guidance counselors for not being honest with them and steering them towards something that is a better fit. It just ends up wasting time and money when they inevitably change majors or worse, drop out."
1564,"Considering that the MCAT is scored between 472 (lowest possible score) and 528, I'm willing to bet they haven't taken the MCAT."
1565,Probably because *she's got horrendous grades
1566,"Did they just say they scored 316 on the MCAT and implemented that it was a good score? I really want to know what medical school they got accepted into with that score. Lol.

(Edit: Added the second sentence.)"
1567,"probably, connections and MONEY"
1568,"Ignorance is bliss.

In HR courses, you have to learn about individual productivity levels.  If you are a manager of Employee A and Employee B.  Each performs the same job at different levels, you have to reward them equally.

If Employee A works at 90% capacity everyday and then slacks off a bit to 85%, you are supposed to intervene.  If Employee B works at 30% capacity everyday and then bumps it up to 40%, you are supposed to reward them.

In theory, they are still doing less than half of the work of Employee A, but their individual productivity improved.  You are encouraging additional improvement.

In reality, Employee A is stuck doing the work of Employee B.  They are getting the shaft while you praise employee B, who is entirely dependent on Employee A and living in ignorance of it.

Side note, I am totally procrastinating writing an HR paper on this super simple topic."
1569,End of this sentan
1570,So my college has this whole behavioral intervention team now where students can report other students who might be mentally struggling or have issues. I would report this chick so fast. That is like level 10 nutty
1571,"I lost it at ""do we have a different working definition of Freshman?""

Top tier responses all the way through. Thanks for the laughs!"
1572,That's a weird as hell scoring range
1573,I don't know how but I somehow had a high enough math SAT score to get into gen chem and I was absolutely lost. My math SAT score was below average. I should have been in intro to chem and then maybe I would have understood gen chem. But it was too confusing and I switched to psychology.
1574,"SI not SL (capital i not lowercase L). Stands for supplemental instructor I think, it's basically a TA that holds review sessions."
1575,"Chem 1 and 2 can be gatekeepers to med school.  They are challenging, but a good professor goes a long way.  Mine had been teaching Chem for 43 years all over the world.  He honestly looked like Bill Nye and spoke like Christopher Walken.  

Even folks who excel at all academics can struggle with Chem.  I'm looking more towards freshmen taking College Algebra and already struggling or just not doing the work."

1580,It literally says it‚Äôs a girl in the top part.
1581,"Probably just money. There‚Äôs a ton of colleges that don‚Äôt care how good a student you are, they just want tuition."
1582,I get this sometimes. I don't want to feel the looming assignments I procrastinated on lol.
1583,"Respond with ""ask Joe"""

1585,"Pfft good luck with all that. Man I'm pissed if someone wants to copy my graphs or expects me to do all the calculations in lab. This person has the patience of a saint.

Premed my ass. Must be getting others to do all their work in groups so far. Hate this kind of person."
1586,"Yeah. I kind of guess they haven‚Äôt either. If they‚Äôre not even smart enough to google the scoring for the MCAT, then maybe they shouldn‚Äôt become a doctor. I hope this person gets a serious wake up call and changes themselves for the better because I doubt anyone would enjoy being their patient if they become a doctor."

1617,The online lab simulations should have prepared you better! It's just like the real thing.
1618,"Allowed? Sure. Appropriate? Hell no.

This professor had a bit of a meltdown and it spilled over into this email. And teaching 200 students a semester without a TA is not unheard of."
1619,"We are not supposed to make comments about evaluations to students, and evaluations are supposed to be protected so that professors can't develop an unfair bias against any students, or the class as a whole.  This is pretty unprofessional.

Second, 400 students without a TA is HARDLY unheard of.  Can it suck at times?  Yes.  But not the students' faults...And, yes, sometimes you pour your heart into everything, and there ends up being a lot of problems in class.  Sometimes students are unfairly biased against the professor.  If that is the case, as the professor, you should be documenting problems you've run into to show that you've tried everything.  If you haven't at least tried, that's on you.  

In most cases, departments would look at the evaluations and just tell you there are some things to work on.  No one is perfect, and it happens.  But THIS, if anything, will be what causes damage to your credibility."
1620,[deleted]
1621,"Sending out this e-mail is going to be ""hugely damaging to the prof and her future""."
1622,"> ""Please realize the impact your rating have on faculty""

You get the ratings you deserve"
1623,"that is super messed up. evaluations are supposed to be anonymous, to my knowledge. i thought it was this way at all institutions."
1624,"I'm in a class with 460-odd students and no TA, and my professor for it teaches two other 200 student classes without a TA, as well. Even with so many students, he's a wonderful teacher. Don't know how he manages, but it clearly isn't impossible."
1625,[deleted]
1626,"I was gonna say, a few of my profs have 300 students in just my class split between 2 sections, and they teach 2 other classes and do their own research. They do have a TA for each class, but still!"
1627,This email tells a lot about why she may have earned those poor reviews. I have no idea how you make it through your doctorate without being able to take criticism.
1628,"OP said it was sent to many former student, so the professor probably just sent mass email to all of his former students that semester."
1629,That isnt always true. A lot of students give bad reviews just because they get bad grades
1630,"OP gave a bad rating and still got an A. Not saying every student did, but it still goes to show that it‚Äôs probably not just that."
1631,The entire review is anonymous and they don‚Äôt even get to look at it until the semester is over and grades are submitted. Meaning she sent it to every single student.
1632,Sounds like the reviews were accurate.
1633,"Dude. 

It‚Äôs their *job* to teach me effectively. I pay thousands upon thousands of dollars *just* for them to teach me. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs okay to be cruel to professors, but if one of them fails to provide you with an organized, quality education, they should absolutely get the criticism."
1634,"true. still, this kind of conduct from an educator is disheartening. if you don't know which students left those evaluations, then you certainly should not send out a mass email dumping on them all. the whole point of evaluations is for educators to improve their teaching. if a lot of students had that bad of a time, maybe they aren't doing too well at their job. it would have faired better for this educator to accept the flack and improve their teaching based on the commentary of their students."
1635,"What the fuck? That is GROSSLY manipulative and totally unprofessional. Report them. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs allowed. 

Usually, at my community college, we do this too. However, it‚Äôs always anonymous. Is it like that? I assume so. Again, grossly unprofessional and you should definitely make a complaint. Make yourself anonymous though, so they doesn‚Äôt suspect it‚Äôs you.

Edit: I just saw you did exactly that. That‚Äôs great! Hopefully it gets resolved. + replaced a pronoun"
1636,"Havibg a TA means dumping grading on them, a big load off"
1637,"now that's cringe, holy shit"
1638,"Shouldn‚Äôt the review be anonymous to make sure everyone leaves a honest review?!?! 

Idk how all this went down, but my professors and teachers never knew who handed in the reviews and absolutely weren‚Äôt allowed to go over them with students, instead they had a meeting with their colleagues, including the head of the department/institute (whatever you wanna call it) and possibly the dean if it is REAL bad."
1639,One bad rating doesn‚Äôt rank you on rate my professor either...unless it‚Äôs a school survey about teaching. But those are private without names. Unless OP put a specific instance in the prof shouldn‚Äôt know who‚Äôs who
1640,It might not be possible long term. Burnout is a possibility
1641,That's a red flag.
1642,Oh lol. Yikes
1643,"""Please realize the impact your ratings have on the future of faculty""

Uh, that is kind of the whole point in having students rate their professors..."
1644,KU?  What a baby. That prof/instructor should not be in charge of anything important. Like young people‚Äôs minds.
1645,"Yeah, my macroeconomics section has 150 students alone. My professor teaches another big section, along with other classes. No TA."

That's why I'm willing to take any office job post-graduation since I'm interested in documentation and records. I don't understand how people think majoring in English means only writing books or being a teacher. 

Sorry, that might've gotten ranty."
1650,">Who designs the cars you drive, the table in your house, the magnet on your fridge.

And it's not as easy as you think. I pulled out of art in high school because my teachers did exactly that. It wasn't only about painting and drawing. For the senior project you had to design how a certain product will look, and not just one, like a whole line of them and while it could have been an incredibly fun thing to do (which I know regret a little about dropping) I was all like: ""Yeah I just wanted to draw, I'm too lazy to do all this, I'm not even that original about coming up with my own designs."""
1651,"May I ask what you‚Äôre majoring in? 

I completely agree with üíØ%. It‚Äôs not about the major, it‚Äôs about what you do with it, and the skills you obtain from it. You don‚Äôt need a STEM degree to be successful. You can major in the humanities, and still end up down a great path. 

I‚Äôve noticed on Reddit, a lot of people will ‚Äúwarn‚Äù you about humanities degrees, and basically almost scare people. They make it seem as if it‚Äôs horrendous to go for such a degree. Like your life is ruined if you do it. But that‚Äôs not the case at all.

You can major in STEM, and even end up without a job, so the degree doesn‚Äôt matter whatsoever. For instance, I plan on majoring in history/philosophy. And I‚Äôve heard of lots of people with these degrees going on to own businesses, becoming analysts, etc. Things not even related to them necessarily. They were able to get these jobs from the skills they gathered during college.

Humanities can also teach you useful skills too. You just have to make sure you have some kind of path in mind, and you should be good. Never study anything you don‚Äôt like/have a passion for because you‚Äôll dread every second of it. It‚Äôll also be way easier to learn during college.

Do what makes you happy, if you love history, Major in that. If you love science, then do that. Just don‚Äôt get into a degree you‚Äôll loathe. This is a mistake too many people make. Then, they end up regretting their major choice. Or anything around those lines."
1652,"but if your deathbed isnt surrounded by at least $100k of consumer goods why even live????? /s

Yeah, as someone who's been trying to get into STEM... honestly, I can't for the life of me imagine doing this stuff without having a passion for it. I've been strongly considering switching to social science/humanities (maybe Philosophy?) because honestly? Life doesn't have a price tag. I can't see how making yourself miserable is worth any salary outside of essentials. Of course, some people like STEM, and some people can do it as ""just a job."" That's great! But I REALLY doubt I could do STEM without hating my life. And that's not worth spending 4 of my ~50 remaining years to find out, IMO. Time is money."
1653,"This music major thanks you so much for this post.

I hate how some people claim some majors are harder than others so much.

Sure, I know how much work people have to do in STEM majors cause I‚Äôm even friends with a few STEM people. But this doesn‚Äôt mean what I do is easier than other majors. Every major has its own challenges for different people. I‚Äôd be miserable as an engineering major but I know that there are some people who would hate doing what I do.

1659,"It's good to see that other people understand. This post is my last ditch effort to try to sway some people who think certain majors are useless. It truly is about what you do with your degree, not what you study.

And in response to your question I am a biology major."

1661,"Yes!! I've noticed a big trend on this sub of people telling others that the only worthwhile majors are engineering/business/comp sci/the trades and that everything else is a waste of time and money. Those are all perfectly fine things to study if that's what you want to do, but it's not the only path. 

For me personally, I'm not good at math. I was barely able to get through Calc and I was miserable the entire time. I'm also bad at working with my hands or anything that requires good spacial skills (I'm on the spectrum and suspect that I might have dyspraxia as well). So that right there makes most of the ""valuable"" majors pretty bad choices for me. The only thing that might work is business which I never had much of an interest in (I took only one business/finance class in high school and absolutely hated it).

You know what I am good at? Reading and writing. I started reading at the age of two and was one of those kids who had a college reading level by middle school. However, I was weary of majoring in English because I heard it was ""worthless"" so I stuck with my STEM major for longer than I should've and graduated a year late. 

So yeah, TL;DR: Everyone has different skill sets and interests, and just because theirs is different that what you consider ""valuable"" doesn't mean that they or their field of study is worthless."
1662,"As an aspiring Classics major, thank you in advance"
1663,"Purely from a financial standpoint it does make numerical sense, but this is such an oversimplification of the situation, in my opinion.

Not everyone would rather have a short career doing something just bearable versus working their whole life in what they love. A STEM degree isn't a magic ticket to a high salary, and arts/'useless' degrees can lead to elite jobs as well. Early retirement is possible on most salaries. 

""Just major in compsci for the meal ticket"" has been really popular advice for the past 10 years or so, but it's produced a lot of miserable 'IT specialists' who make next to nothing and hate their daily lives."
1664,"People will tell you shit all the way through your degree no matter what it is. I majored in Biology, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd leave someone in STEM alone, but no, just because THEY don‚Äôt know what jobs you can get with a degree doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist.

Okay, so I get my BS in Bio and at my graduation party one of my dads friends tells me ‚Äúgood luck finding a job‚Äù I say ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm off to grad school next so I‚Äôve already got a teaching job in that department‚Äù and he basically just belittles me more and pats me on the head.

I graduate with an M.S. in Bio, again, same dude tells me ‚Äúnow you‚Äôre just going to be called overqualified for menial jobs‚Äù (yea, this dude is an asshole). I worked with a nonprofit, worked in government, worked private sector doing wetland declination, but realized I missed teaching. So I get a job at a CC as a professor. Next time I saw this mother fucked he tells me ‚Äúha! Well professors won‚Äôt be needed long thanks to online colleges taking over‚Äù (bitch, who the hell do you think runs those classes?!) 

Here we are, I‚Äôm now a well respected professor at my college with tenure, a big student org, one of the few tech savvy profs, and loving my job making great money. Where is he with his ‚Äúuseful‚Äù business degree? Unemployed and mad at the government for it. üôÑ

For real. Ignore the haters, live your life. You‚Äôll be fine."
1665,"STEM guy here and I really do agree with you. Here‚Äôs the problem, though:

What‚Äôs the first thing I hear whenever I talk to someone outside of STEM who asks me what my major is:

‚ÄúOh that sounds math heavy, I hate math I could never do it‚Äù

This sentence combined with the fact that math is a very useful skill and the ego of college undergraduates creates people who think they are geniuses for picking and succeeding in STEM and that those liberal arts people could never be as good as them.

It also snowballs on itself because then said STEM people brag about how ‚Äúhard‚Äù their homework is, discouraging people from STEM even more and complaining about math even more.

One thing I seriously enjoy about your post is that you emphasized *passion* because that is all that really matters. Don‚Äôt major in something you don‚Äôt like doing, but at the same time, cut the shit with being scared to do something that is conventionally difficult if it interests you. Unless you‚Äôre working a job too, college is going to be your priority for four or more years, and if your passion requires a lot of work, that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if it‚Äôs actually your passion. Plus, the work will more often than not make you appreciate the subject even more."

1667,"As an engineering major with a massive brain (/s) I really enjoy listening to music. I know that music is extremely difficult, that it‚Äôs long and grueling hours (I‚Äôve played violin for over a decade and a half). I also think that music makes the world a better place, that it‚Äôs a wonderful source of entertainment, emotion, etc. Just because music doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs any less an essential part of our everyday lives. 

I enjoy engineering because math, physics, etc. just ‚Äúclick‚Äù for me. It seems intuitive and I enjoy it. I‚Äôve read a bit about music theory, and while I know the circle of 5ths by heart and some other basics, I honestly have no clue how it works. I‚Äôm still so glad there‚Äôs people doing it though."
1668,"For me, I feel a Major is useless unless you have a plan: I‚Äôm a teaching major but I know what I what to study and what I want to do. You‚Äôll always need teachers. 

I get a lot of scorn for being a women and gender studies major but it is one of those majors where if you study it on your own, yeah you‚Äôll end up at McDonald‚Äôs but if you pair it with say, business or law or psych, you make a ton of money."

1671,"someone who works in animation here: nope, that's not the case. The neoptistic kids go on to be producers maybe, which is akin to ""middle management"" in every other field. Sometimes they'll call themselves directors but they're not and you can crosscheck them with IATSE (there's a director's guild branch and an animation guild branch). 

Most of us in animation, vizdev, and production for sure don't know or are related to anyone up top. These jobs are way too competitive and require as much skill in most cases as breaking into the olympics, and there's like 1 job per department anymore, maybe a few, but not as many people do these jobs professionally as you might think - and no exec is going to put their kid they know isn't up to par in any position above intern. Those internships are coveted but usually if you got it by nepotism you're not going any higher. 

What tends to happen with their kids is this (or...many, at least in games/animation, I used to date a celebrity's kid and they were like this and they're NOT the exception): the kid thinks they're hot shit, they go to a good school and might do well or ok but mostly just get pushed along for their money, even if they are good I've yet to meet one who takes what they do seriously. Then they get an internship at a decent but B tier studio pretty much only because they'll work for nothing and won't renegotiate (my ex was shocked to learn that I made more than quadruple what he made at a ""worse"" studio and as a student). They'll be laid off from that internship either immediately at the end of the contract period or they'll string them along for as long as they at least make themselves useful, but then lay them off the second they can in a way that isn't a firing technically. The kid then goes off in life thinking they left on good terms and not realizing they're fully blacklisted and will never find decent work again."
1672,"I‚Äôm a major in Modern Greek and Art, specifically glassblowing. The modern Greek taught me how to learn a language and look at a culture that‚Äôs different from my own but not to judge it. Plus a ton about how history shapes modern countries, governments, and people. I plan on finding a job in either 3D modeling or graphic design until I can find, find, and survive on a glassblowing job. My art degree can get me into a ton of entry level marketing, industrial product designs, game design, etc. Greek puts me into a position for translation (probably part time due to a lack of Greek translation needed) while I work on expanding my language skills. Im also minoring in creative writing and game studies so I have further entry in marketing and game design. Will it take time finding a job solely in one of my fields, probably yes. But there are so many interconnected fields that it‚Äôs laughable if I can‚Äôt find a job at all. Plus I have military experience so there is always that as a fallback plan."

You definitely want to make a good impression with your professors and be proactive because your professors will be the main ones who set you up for new opportunities. Other than that, there are a lot of different internships since history is pretty flexible. There's the aforementioned CIA internships, there's historic preservation which combines history and architecture, and there's of course the stereotypical working at a museum. It might just be because I'm a nerd, but working at the Met or the Smithsonian would be one of the coolest things ever.

1784,"I don't remember what kind of collars she used, I do remember everyone on campus calling her after she put the signs up telling her it was not her cat and that she needed to quit."
1785,We got a campus cat too! Hover it doesn‚Äôt like to be petted
1786,"AWWWW LOOK AT HIS LITTLE FEET I LOVE THEM SO MUCH

Something I enjoy about my school is the fact that one of the dining halls has really fucking good chocolate chip cookies! They looked perfectly normal yet somehow tasted amazing. I remember going to the dining hall and getting a box literally just filled with like 9 cookies and nothing else. I'm not on campus this semester and I miss them

edit: I meant the cat's feet, not the person's lol although they're nice too"
1787,"My campus has a really cute service dog named Merri. She‚Äôs a black lab.

And also my campus started putting up decorative string lights around the lampposts and at night it‚Äôs really pretty."
1788,"Obviously the best professor on campus.

EDIT: Just saw the plural ‚Äúdogs.‚Äù So, professors."
1789,I go to community college and I enjoy not having to socialize with my peers frequently
1790,...aaaaand that user goes to timeout for a day.
1791,Aw I love cats
1792,"Not on campus this year, but something that made me happy was the honors college building (it was dorms on the top floors, and classrooms and common areas on the lower floors). It was an old building with random rooms and twisting halls. There were some really comfy places to sit and replicas of old art and a couple pianos and even a billiards table strewn about. It took weeks of living there just to explore the whole place and figure out what cool areas were there. There were also puzzles, board games, knitting supplies, books, and some kid even brought in a massive tub of legos for everyone to play with. There was also a communal kitchen. It was great, you could almost always find a classmate to chat or play a game with just loitering around."
1793,"i enjoy seeing the fit squirrels doing squirrel things.

went to uc berkeley for a field trip once, their squirrels are fattened up. all chonky and tame."
1794,my school has cats too!!!
1795,We have a Great Pyrenees that has never seen a coat trim in his life. He is beautiful.
1796,My friends at school cheer me up. We like to giggle about cute girls and guys and make dirty jokes
1797,"I graduated years ago, but I always appreciated the fact that my college was in the middle of nowhere. It was always quiet (party weekends aside), and super easy to get away for some fresh air, go camping, day hiking or fishing. Or go deer hunting from the comfort of your dorm as at least one person a year did.

I did classes in the city for a year and a half and did absolutely miserably. Too much noise and too many things going on to really concentrate."
1798,"It's completely normal! I think this is one of the sadder parts about growing up, cause I feel the same way. I would try to keep in touch more with your family during the school year so you aren't only speaking to them at breaks and such. Hang in there!"
1799,Nothing worse then realizing your parents are actually getting old ...
1800,As a senior this hit hard. Fuck
1801,"YES OMG YES. I feel the same way, college allowed me to just be myself, I feel like I always have to wear a mask around my family "
1802,"I am in my senior year of highschool and starting to see how old my parents are getting too. My dad is 56 and my mom is 54. My dad works as a petroleum mechanic (works on large equipment, digger, cranes, ships) and it is very hard on his body. He comes home everyday absolutely exhausted. After he eats he watches a little tv and heads for bed, we barely talk anymore and that makes me sad. "
1803,I even stopped referring to my previous home as a home
1804,"Damn- for me it‚Äôs the opposite. I always felt like my family was more important, especially considering they‚Äôre with you your whole life as opposed to the finicky nature of friends. They‚Äôre the only people I truly open up to."
1805,"Yeah, I guess it just felt like life went by way too fast before college, especially when we as a family went through a lot when I was a teenager and all of a sudden I blink and the memories I thought I hated or just forgot about with my family are the ones i now cherish the most because of lost time...but I guess that‚Äôs just life "
1806,"That's one way I knew I was growing up. Once I got my apartment my junior year I started referring to ""home"" as my apartment and no longer my childhood home. That became my parents house. "
1807,"And he is dreaming of the day he doesn‚Äôt have to go and do that shit, he wants to talk to you and his family more than anything. 
"
1808,"I actually felt this same way when I came home today too. Didn't know how to put it in words but you got it. My house is rearranged w new furniture, stuff moved around my room, etc. Except my brothers are 4 and 6. My dad yells a lot more and my stepmom is nuts as always so I mean at least one thing is the same. Lol. Also found out I don't work at my job anymore because my boss doesn't like that I go to college. Petty. Oh well! Hope it gets better for ya"
1809,"Yeah. Completely normal unfortunately.  Found this browsing ""popular""

Wait until no one lives there anymore. Am 35. Everytime I go home to see parents, it's less and less home. Schools get torn town, old favs close, etc. It's surreal, and kinda sad."
1810,"Home is really a space in time



For the first 18-20 years is when you are making your ""home""



After that, you're just returning to the same place with a new face "
1811,[deleted]
1812,"Yeah, thank god my mom is just gracefully aging but my dad is starting to look pretty old now. Even though I‚Äôm happy that he‚Äôs become more calm and is more secure with work, i sort of miss those days of him waking up at 4am, working until 6pm and still having tons of energy when getting home, even if it was to yell at us for the dumbest reasons.  Little things like forgetting where he put his keys, or letting out a big sigh when he sits down makes me real sad. It‚Äôs like you blink and all of a sudden the whole world seemed to just move in fast forward. "
1813,"I‚Äôm glad you can have that type of relationship, it sounds lovely. Hold on to that mess. My perspective comes from a very... unfortunate background with my family. "
1814,[deleted]
1815,It helped me a lot to go to college. Never was the social type bc I was sheltered hard core by my single mother. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1816,"The odd thing is that for me right now, I feel like my home is truly the campus, not so much the people. Maybe that's just my introverted side.

I have my one table I *always* sit at in the dining hall, the same room to go back to every night for years now, the same radio station I volunteer DJ at every semester.
It's gotten very comfortable spacially, and I feel a real connection to the location and the city. I hope I can still feel some semblance of that as an alumnus one day by visiting some of the same specific spots."
1817,"Yeah, now it's my parents' house. Makes me kinda sad."
1818,Bottle this up and write the next catcher in the rye
1819,Yeah i noticed I‚Äôve been telling my friends I‚Äôm gonna go visit my parents over break instead of ‚Äúgoing back home‚Äù‚Äônow. 
1820,"To give you the flip side of what a lot of people are saying here, I still feel really connected to my old home. I talk to all my old friends there, and I'm making plans with them for when all of us are out of school, and that's great, but there's a consequence there too. I don't feel connected to my school. The place I'm going to be spending most of my time for the next 4 years doesn't feel like home to me. Maybe it'll be different when I transfer (I was optioned to a satellite campus in a tiny little town, my main campus which has my major at it is in a big city), but right now it just means that even though I have friends and a social life here, I just feel lonely and homesick all the time. What I'm saying is there's two sides to every coin. To agree with what most everyone else is saying, this is part of life. You'll be ok."
1821,"The first weekend I returned home from college, it had been about 6-7 weeks since I‚Äôd been home and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying, I guess because it just hit me that I don‚Äôt live here anymore, even though it is my home. It really hurts and I miss my old life a lot "
1822,"I recently had to go back to my old college for something, which meant making a six hour road trip that was really out of the way into the pine forests of east Texas. I love those pine forests, and for five years I felt like I would never want to leave. When I got to campus, I parked at my old student ministry building where I made the most friends and spent quite a lot of my time (even before I lived there as a resident). 

Walking into that building after so long felt equal parts overwhelmingly nostalgic and unnaturally foreign; every chair, tile, and kitchen utensil was in its place, but mixed in with the pictures on the wall that were taken while I was a student were all these new pictures of people I had never seen before in my life. Nobody I recognized. 

I then went across to the music building where the other half of my time was spent, and while the layout of the main building hadn‚Äôt changed, the people were all new, and seeing my old professors was great, but it didn‚Äôt have that same ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home‚Äù (or occasionally ‚Äúoh fuck there‚Äôs a test today‚Äù) feeling it had while I was in college. 

I like being my own person and having a job and my own hobbies as an adult now, but damn if I don‚Äôt miss college sometimes, or at the very least the notion of certain places feeling like home. "
1823,"It almost like loosing your childhood innocence and you finally realise you‚Äôve become an adult. And when you realise it, it hits you hard, home won‚Äôt be home anymore. That feeling unfortunately doesn‚Äôt come back. As  you grew older you will make your own home just like your parents did and hopefully you‚Äôll have new memories and feelings. 

It‚Äôs incredibly weird that feeling when your at dorms for a few weeks you go back home and everything has changed. Even your community has changed, you notice so much more and you realise how fast life is moving. "
1824,"LOL. I can relate to having a dad that yells a lot. He was always moody, and just super strict but even he changed too. All of sudden he‚Äôs really nice and understanding and makes stupid dad jokes and I‚Äôm just like, who tf are you and where‚Äôs my dad? ...sorry about your job, some bosses really suck. "
1825,"I didn't even realize I did this and now reading it, it makes me sad."
1826,"I‚Äôm with you there. I used to be a ski instructor part-time in high school and would be at the hill 3-4 times a week (both weekend days and some weeknights), and I would spend the summers mountain biking. I still try to get out to the mountains when I can but it‚Äôs just not the same anymore. I‚Äôm now in grad school and love what I do, but can‚Äôt help but miss my old life sometimes."
1827,I work for my university in the u.k in helping disadvantaged college students (16-18) apply for university and maaaaaan im just so jealous of them. They have a fantastic 3 or 4 years ahead of them and they aren't even excited. It's crazy! 
1828,That's a great plan! I'm getting degrees in business and journalism. I've worked with admissions at my university and we tell people to always get themselves involved in something they enjoy as a passion.
1829,"Woo! I'm finally graduating after 6 years pursuing 2 degrees (mechanical engineering and physics), let's celebrate together!"
1830,"That‚Äôs kinda what I did, and the fun one became what differentiates me from everyone else in my field! I‚Äôm a chemist who also learned how to communicate and it throws everyone for a loop"
1831,Thank you!
1832,Oh hey that's super cool! I feel that I am either a Journalism student who knows math and statistics or a business student who knows writing and communications haha
1833,I am getting two bachelor's degrees right now and this fall I start on a JD
1834,Woo! Congratulations! Those are incredible degrees!
1835,"I picked it up on Bricklink! It‚Äôs a collectible mini figure from series 5.

1837,Cool! Where can I get one? I love LEGO
1838,Nice I just hang mine dipolma where the zoom camera can pick up on it
1839,I start law school in the fall! The journalism degree really is useful for writing.
1840,Unique and awesome. Congratulations
1841,Cool! Congratulations!!
1842,"It's good to have a few positive posts once in a while. This post can ultimately motivate students to keep pushing forward. I myself am not in a good mental state, but with posts like these I feel better and more driven to finish my semester. If anything, it's overthinking about those who can't have the same opportunities that might lead to a miserable mental state, instead of focusing on self-success.

Now I can't speak for everyone here and certainly not everyone is a ""depressed college kid having mental breakdowns about not graduating"", in your words. But why would you mind their business when you've reached a milestone in your life?"
1843,Congratulations!!
1844,The other degree will be a valuable skill set to have regardless of which way you go.
1845,"I also got two degrees...geology and biology. People just don't understand the ""two degree"" vs. ""double major"" thing.

It was FUCKING hard!!!

Congrats!"
1846,"I got my degrees from completely different colleges within my university, whereas some people I know are graduating from two program within a single college,"
1847,Getting my electrical engineering and economics degree after 6yrs next week ;)

1885,Don't worry you have the rest of your life choices to cry about.
1886,I need this
1887,Just cried today. Sometimes I really question why I‚Äôm doing this.
1888,"Wait, what is this mysterious breed of cat that doesn‚Äôt sleep on top of the keyboard?"
1889,Who said it wasn't?
1890,"Fake news. Cat is obviously a paid actor, and not a very good one either. Everyone knows when you want to get work done, a cat will seek out the most optimal spot to inconvenience their human servant. There should be a furry butt planted on your laptop."
1891,i adopted another cat mid-semester and i can say it boosted my spirits
1892,"Awww, I adopted a kitten this week because I‚Äôm all alone at the dorm but she‚Äôs still so scared of me üò≠üò≠üò≠"

Since there were guys in our group and that seems like a pretty rapey atmosphere, we just went back to one persons house"
1922,At least you get invited to Halloween parties

1926,This is me‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even have time to go out to by some candy. I‚Äôm so done with this
1927,"Ah yes, I expected this response. I actually couldn't have, as my psych professor gave us 5 assignments to be completed between Friday afternoon and Sunday night. I also have other classes, and other responsibilities. I just wanted to point out the irony of the situation, and it wasn't from lack of planning on my part."
1928,"Almost all the parties my group goes to, we end up leaving early because our socializing batteries start to run out or because someone drank too much. But we always get pizza and play mario kart at someone's place afterwards so it's still a fun night out."
1929,"Oh believe me there were tears XD I barely got anything done unil like 9pm when I finally just managed ot focus on one at a time and submitted at like 11:55pm

None of them are great but they're done at least... they were all for the same class which honestly just made it worse, imo 3 papers for a midterm is a *bit* excessive"

1968,"That looks delicious, it blows me away how many peers I see who live off crap food.

1969,"If you both a) cared about the animals and b) were smart enough to find ways to help them, you would realize that blasting random people on the internet does nothing to further our cause.

This means you either don‚Äôt actually care about animals or you‚Äôre too shortsighted to realize how pointless your comment was. Or you‚Äôre a troll, which I honestly hope. People like you literally perpetuate factory farming by driving reasonable people away from meatless diets."

1998,"> Isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfirst month free‚Äù only if you sign a term contract for at least 3 months? If so, it‚Äôs like comparing ‚Äúbuy 2, get 1 free‚Äù with ‚Äúhere‚Äôs 1 free‚Äù.

> I don‚Äôt disagree that it‚Äôs promotional but let‚Äôs not discourage giveaways.

I think there's a misunderstanding.  The storage *industry* (not just U-Haul, though they are known to be one of the worst) is very disingenuous and cutthroat.  Deals like this are backed into the pricing structure.  You'll find, for example, that comparing a ""first month free"" (or half-off, or second month free, or however it's worded) plan is actually more expensive per month than other plans that are run at the same time but don't offer the first month free.  The break-even point is usually 2-4 months, at which point your monthly plan is now costing you more per year (or 4 months, or whatever) than it would have had you not taken the ""free"" first month.  Example: a monthly plan on a 10x15 might be $99/month in a particular area, but if you take it for one month, it's $129/month instead.  Fine if you're only there for 3 months, but somewhere between your fourth and fifth month you're spending more than you would have with your ""free"" month.  And, as /u/QuantumHoneybees has already pointed out, it's often hard to get back out of a storage unit.  Between the time, cost of truck rental, and making room in their new place, many people (not just students) find it difficult to make it happen.  They end up leaving their stuff in storage long-term, costing far more than they expected to have saved.

In short, ""deals"" like these are designed to look like it'll be an easy in-and-out.  And you know what?  Some people manage to do that.  Most don't.  This is why it's (intentionally) misleading to be made to think of it as a giveaway.  It isn't.  It's a carrot, designed to hook you into something that will be hard to get back out of.  Thus, my initial comment was to look carefully at the fine print and to consider alternatives because U-Haul is definitely not the only company doing it, and they're known for pretty nasty business practices.  (Example: renting their trucks at the 24 hour rate but requiring customers to have them back in just a few hours so they can double, triple, or even quadruple dip with multiple customers in the same day, but still charging the same 24-hour rate to each one.)"
1999,"Just wondering, aren't there any laws for sickdays in the US, you are there I presume? We get 1.5  days off every month"
2000,Exactly. What I find a little ridiculous about it is like okay they can put their stuff there but then what. Not that what‚Äôs u hauls problem to solve or they have anything to provide there but when I first read this quickly it sounds like they‚Äôre telling people to stay in them
2001,"The storage is definitely a really good deal. Be aware of renting a U-Haul truck though, the prices may seem cheap at first glance but it really adds up. A one way trip with one from Tuscaloosa, AL to Louisville, KY (~420 miles) for instance is $300 for the 10-foot truck. That doesn‚Äôt include fuel cost either."
2002,"Not federally, but it varies by state. For example, in Maryland, you have to give 5 days per year if your business has more than 15 employees. 

Even then though, if you're an independent contractor (a 1099 worker), you have no right to such benefits."
2003,Someone in my res hall floor groupme sent this (we arent being forced to move out but we dont have to come back yet) and in the little notification window all I saw was the part about Uhaul offering free 30 day storage and thought they were kicking us out.

2010,I turned my first accounting homework assignment in done in excel. Saved me so much time. The professor was glad that I did what I did but wanted me to go forward doing it by hand as the final was not going to be on excel. That alone tripled the amount of time it took me to do the homework

You didn't even just fuck over other people, you fucked over yourself too! Bro reread that email"
2035,"The ‚ÄúI was a little surprised by the amount of information there seemed to be on the document‚Äù makes it seem to me more like a professor saying ‚Äúyou can bring one notecard to use on your exam‚Äù and someone showing up with a 3‚Äô X 5‚Äô full of every note from the class instead of a 3‚Äù by 5‚Äù with a few formulas.

OP most likely won‚Äôt get in any trouble, but the prof will definitely be tightening up the rules for future classes."
2036,"It‚Äôs not. All of our exams are open notes/book and we are encouraged to work together. We do have one project in another class (Professor is department director) that explicitly states we cannot work together on, so we haven‚Äôt been. And the school doesn‚Äôt have specifications on what excel functions can and cannot be used."
2037,"Nah. If cheat sheets are allowed, there's nothing wrong with sharing it. What's a problem is if cheat sheets aren't allowed, and you make one. In my finance class, there are a decent amount of formulas we need to memorize. We're also allowed a calculator on exams. If I were to program all the formulas into my calculator so I didn't have to remember them, that would be cheating -- whether I did it for classmates or not."

2041,"""Colleges and students in the U.S. are engaged in a game of chicken as the fall semester approaches with no end in sight for the coronavirus crisis. The outcome could radically change the way Americans think about and value a higher education.

On one side, institutions want students to sign up and pay tuition deposits, which are coming due. [Most](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626) are pretending they can open like normal, with in-person classes. [Some](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-major-us-colleges-plan-reopen-for-fall-2020-semester-2020-5#amherst-college-4) are keeping people largely in the dark about what the semester will look like.

On the other, students and their families are wondering whether it‚Äôs worth shelling out tens of thousands of dollars for an experience that might be largely online. Many are delaying decisions, thinking it might be wiser to take a semester or a year off.

Who will swerve? I‚Äôm thinking that colleges are going to have to make the bigger adjustment, which means students could emerge as the winners."""
2042,The quality of education for a lot of majors/programs gets drastically reduced with an online education. How are you going to teach lab skills online? By dissecting a virtual frog?

2043,"I think the California State University system just announced that they‚Äôre gonna mostly be online this fall, that‚Äôs like twenty-three campuses. Harvard‚Äôs already said that things won‚Äôt be normal until 2022 so I guess now we wait for that announcement"

2049,"Hmm, this is highly worrying. Im an OOS student, and even w/ my scholarships, Im paying quite a bit.

If these universities are delaying their decisions to rake in board and room payments, they ought to change their approach ASAP. I hope they aren't this greedy, though."
2050,"I just finished up a microbiology class that was very lab intensive and switching to online halfway through the semester was a joke. I understand it needed to happen and I fully support it.

2052,Yea but the experience just isn‚Äôt there. And for some colleges when you pay tuition you pay for so much more then just the classes. Online is more convenient at times but you miss out on a whole lot of other things the college would offer if it was in person
2053,That is correct. The CSU system will be mostly online in the fall.
2054,"I‚Äôd really like to see them make an effort. I‚Äôm paying a lot of money to be given vague power points and prerecorded video lectures of the professor reading off the power points word for word.

2056,That‚Äôs ridiculous. You shouldn‚Äôt be charged for something you‚Äôre not using.
2057,"That is actually how online learning should be. The best online courses I‚Äôve taken over the last several years were modules that opened on Sunday,  all work due 8 days later (Monday of the next week). Or modules open Friday, two weeks to complete the work. 

The key to a good online learning experience is the material teachers decide to include. If a teacher takes the time to build good modules you can come away having learned a lot. 

But I agree it is no replacement for a total education. Online classes should be mixed with in person classes and and active campus life."
2058,"It's a fallacy that online classes are cheaper. Well designed online classes (not the slapstick courses from the pandemic) cost a lot of money to make... Somewhere between $50,000-$250,000 per course. This is the cost to have professional curriculum developers and instructional designers along with SMEs (subject matter experts) develop meaningful assessments that align with the course outcomes. Plus there needs to be course maintenance and technology staff to keep the course functioning. Usually online courses are revised significantly every 3-5 years to either update the content, redesign the assessments that were previously ineffective, etc.

The only way online classes become less expensive is if they can successfully scale it up. And for some schools, this is not their goal with online education. There are only a few universities with the resources to make that investment and that's why you see the online market dominated by a few major players.

I'm just pointing this out because people associate online/technology advancements as a way to reduce costs, but it's a major misconception from those who have no idea how good online programs work. 

Source: I worked for a major online university (non-profit)"
2059,Online classes suck as a Marketing major I need to be in person and work alongside others for my projects.
2060,Yes there will be.  Maybe people will realize how much we‚Äôre paying for bloated administrative departments and new buildings and then colleges will be forced to take austerity measures which will help students in lowered tuition.
2061,"Won‚Äôt you be refunded for your room and board if you can‚Äôt use it? My college refunded us the remainder of our dorm and meal plan after sending us home in the spring, and they waived all online fees for summer session tuition, so people will be paying the same or less than they would‚Äôve payed."
2062,Online classes cost more at my school than in person so no thank you lol

2064,"tbf, it‚Äôs not like college admins are more in-the-know than most other people. their decisions could literally be life or death for some people and potentially catastrophic for finances and the like. I‚Äôd like to think that they‚Äôre trying to make the best decision for their respective schools"
2065,Most my professors just defaulted to having us watch Youtube when we went online.
2066,Yeah we still have to pay our $300 fees for the new rec center because someone agreed to pay the bank 10 years ago for building it.
2067,"The whole point of college is for the 'experience.' 

Social connections and networking with employers are the main reason anyone goes to college. At my university, all the major investment banks and consulting firms go onto campus, where students can network with current employees who went to our university.

2072,I made a chemistry pun on an exam before and got -2 points
2073,Pretty sure I just failed my first chemistry exam. 50 questions. When the teacher said there was only 30 minutes left and I was still on question 24...I knew it was over.
2074,"The best thing you can do to maintain that positive relationship is go in during their office hours and get help. It shows you're invested in learning the material. I've never encountered a teacher who thought a student was an idiot for bombing a test. It happens to almost everyone. It's probably happened to your teacher. It's what you do with your situation that matters and strongly informs what the professor thinks about you. 

Don't go into his office and say, ""I don't get it. Tell me how to do it."" Instead, say what you're having trouble with, why you think you're having trouble with it, and what you've tried to fix it. This shows you've taken the initiative to solving your problem.

I'd argue that even if you only come out with a B-, he'll have more respect for you than if you bombed the first test and got an A in the end. One shows him a student willing to do what it takes to improve, the other situation just shows him a student that got over confident and shaped up after that. Which do you want him to think you are?"

2133,Man you never told me you were a redditor
2134,"Listen, my man walked in on his roommate suckin his own dick, and didn‚Äôt say nothin. He‚Äôs the one roommate we all want but never get"
2135,Smart. I will attempt to eat my own ass
2136,Make it so that he walks in on you trying to suck your own dick so that way it is embarrassing all around
2137,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Oh man that‚Äôs just...tragic and hilarious
2138,I think the only option is to break a bottle over your head and hope for some kind of amneisa
2139,As a non dick owner I am very intrigued by this cause up till now I thought it was just a myth/joke. 
2140,"I wouldnt wanna taste my dick, do you have any idea where that's been?"
2141,"If it were me, I'd probably want to forget it ever happened. If you were to say something, I'd probably just apologize for not knocking and let them know you plan to be more diligent about knocking in the future. Then it puts the focus on you instead of him. "
2142,It once touched a public toilet seat
2143,Gotta give credit where credit is due. 
2144,"The real truth. Tbh ur lying if u say u haven‚Äôt tried to, just out of curiosity "
2145,"Pssh, we get 30 advice threads on professors and life daily. This is the shit we need"
2146,Ever? 
2147,Honestly might be good to shoot him a text and say it‚Äôs whatever/acknowledge the awkwardness. He‚Äôs probably thinking the worst.
2148,">...not a word was uttered from either of us...

Well, your room mates mouth was occupied with his own cock so he wasn't able to utter a word."
2149,Idk I‚Äôm too scarred for this point for simple tricks like that
2150,I can't wait til ya'll are 40 years old and friends forever because of this bonding experience. 
2151,"That‚Äôs exactly how I imagined it, where he was sitting on the bed cross legged and his head all the way down, then the door creaks open and he hops right off the bed like a lil cricket and scurries away fast. "
2152,"Don't tell him you're impressed, that sounds like your hitting on him. Just say, ""We're good,"" and never speak of it again. "
2153,My advice to you is to start drinking heavily 
2154,"I had heard of autofellatio before, but I didn‚Äôt know real normal people actually did it until now"
2155,Lmao just text him and be like ‚Äúdamn dude. You have no idea how bad I wish I could do that‚Äù 
2156,horror movie material lmao
2157,I just sent him a text saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got nothing to be embarrased about bro. Sorry for not knocking‚Äù and I got a ‚Äúthanks‚Äù back
2158,Congrats!!! üéâ That's awesome and posts like this are so encouraging to me. I started back in 2011 and I'm due to graduate 2022 so it will be 11 years for me by the time I'm done. No regrets. üòÖ

2161,"Yeah, it's getting to be a pretty hot field."
2162,Congrats!! Can I ask why it took you so long? Did you only take a class or two at a time? Was it a continuous 8 years or did you take breaks?
2163,that sounds like such an interesting degree. congrats!
2164,You got this! I graduate next summer and I started fall of 2009!!
2165,My dad used to teach classes for an online college that went towards that degree and a Fire Safety degree. They're very interesting classes but a lot were pretty upper-level.

2189,I make tons of quizlets using my own study materials and notes but college has made me so paranoid about being accused of cheating that I keep it all private.
2190,"I haven't thought about that... but now that you mention it, definitely. I go fuckin hard with the flashcards. Hundreds and hundreds of them for biology and chemistry, even managed to make flashcards for pre-calc and trig stuff. I'm actually making a set right now lol. I feel like I'm sitting on a goldmine of knowledge. Luckily I finish my associate's degree this May, so."
2191,Honestly. It‚Äôs helped me so much
2192,I‚Äôd like to softly kiss the forehead of these legends
2193,There‚Äôs a special place in hell for professors who create those
2194,"Wait, there are people who don‚Äôt make their quizlets public?!? Why?"
2195,Rate the quizlets
2196,Legend
2197,And those who do so always find dollars in their coat pockets
2198,"And even if you think the content of the quizlet is too ‚Äúniche‚Äù for anyone to get use out of it, still post it!!! Because there usually aren‚Äôt many resources for that niche content otherwise"
2199,"intro to excel and database management spring class of 2017

I published a quizlet I found that had the list of all definitions frol that book. Then I posted the quizlet on canvas. Guess who improved the class average from 30 to 60?"
2200,"Wait‚Ä¶ they do that???

That‚Äôs seriously messed up. I don‚Äôt even use quizlets for hw or quizzes; I use them for reviewing before/after so all that misinformation‚Ä¶ some profs care more about that ‚Äúgotcha!‚Äù Moment than actually cheating smh"
2201,That makes a lot sense! Do you think you'll make your quizlets public after graduation then?
2202,If you make quizlets and give the wrong answers... I hate you and I hope your pillow harbors lice.
2203,Thank u
2204,Oh congrats! I'm sure future students will be grateful for newly opened goldmine come May üòÇ
2205,Do I call you ‚ÄúMy Lord‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour Grace‚Äù?üëë
2206,"Right, fuck those people."
2207,I usually make them private out of anxiety (I feel like the questions/answers are meh). Thanks to this post and all the comments I will start to make them all public!
2208,Honestly quizlet is going to be at least 60% responsible for my degree
2209,"No doubt, public flashcards are lifesaver. However, if I would you, I would invest in making my own cards instead of consuming others'. You would spend much higher cognitive effort in the process of making those flashcards, giving information a big chance to get well encoded in your brain and actually ""stick"".

Hope you all the best!"
2210,Hopefully!
2211,I fell for that trap got a 10/60 :D
2212,"It‚Äôs a free flash card system. People usually upload their course material flash cards on them. You do a google search on a question for example and it might be there with answers for everything else. A lot of times, they are based on textbook quizzes, test banks, and homework assignments. Some people also make their own original ones too. You can also link your school with it and students there might make relevant flash cards based on courses there. I like quizlet but there definitely is a line between cheating/studying. A lot of people use it to study but a lot of people just use it to search answers for online hw or quiz/exams."
2213,The ones would make a Quizlets and purposely make all the answers wrong are straight up menaces
2214,had a friend who did this. truly a lifesaver for studying during finals last semester. i hope she is getting the best grades!
2215,Quizlet hero‚Äôs have helped me so much with doing IT coursework. Thank you
2216,"Right? Like maybe if you signed some sort NDA about classroom materials I could understand, but aside from that it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me."
2217,literally saved me last semester
2218,What the fuck...
2219,Time to use a second laptop for zoom then lmao
2220,"You didn't know that? FYI in any chat room no matter which if there is a moderater or owner or whatever they can see all. Your PM's, your rooms you make, etc."
2221,Power move: actually be taking notes and share your screen.
2222,[deleted]
2223,this is the best answer to this tbfh
2224,LOL gonna send this to my friend who is trying to get close to this guy she likes by talking in zoom lecture
2225,"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre allowed to know. Like there was a rumor that with Canvas teachers could see everything you did while you were taking a test, if you went a looked up answers and stuff, but imagine if you went to a tab containing bank account or medical information. They can only see data on their tab/program."
2226,Power move: screen share hentai
2227,[deleted]
2228,I had zoom open on my 2nd monitor and was browsing reddit on my primary. Does this count as being on another website if zoom was still open nevertheless?
2229,Does it just say we‚Äôre on a different app or does it say what that different app is?
2230,Yes because your using one computer and it looks at primary application open
2231,Then they ask u to share your screen and show them lol!
2232,I doubt professors will really care. Personally I‚Äôm planning to have zoom on one monitor and my notes on the other
2233,F for your friend.
2234,[deleted]
2235,My idea exactly lol
2236,"This is absolutely false. As a Slack admin, the only way I can see someone's DMs is to contact Slack, provide legal reasoning and consent from all affected users, and then they can provide a one-time export of all data, including DMs and private channels.

ETA: to be clear ""consent"" could be as simple as an employment agreement or ToS but they have to have something before they approve a corporate export application for a workspace. Those exports are also limited to Plus workspaces or higher.

Also, users are notified anytime such an export is made."
2237,It‚Äôs called Attendee attendance tracking. ‚ÄúHosts can see an indicator in the participant panel of the meeting if an attendee doesn‚Äôt have Zoom in focus for more than 30 seconds. In focus means the user has the Zoom meeting in view and is open and active.‚Äù
2238,"I mean, you can just use another app..."
2239,you can host your own meeting and check it out
2240,What?? How do y‚Äôall know this
2241,same wait what i‚Äôm screwed then
2242,"Jesus laptop for zoom, phone for chat. Always use two separate devices just like in the work world"
2243,But Canvas is in the browser while Zoom is a downloadable software. But I doubt Zoom would without saying in the terms or whatever.
2244,"Contacted their customer support again and they confirmed hosts can't read PM's. I also  just tested it and hosted a meeting with other people in it. I can't see their private messages lol.  I was also using my school email.  Overall, I'm pretty sure hosts can't read PM's."
2245,Pretend you can‚Äôt work out how to do that
2246,Wait what? Does this apply to their breakout rooms too? My prof broke us out into rooms and I private messaged them the link to the problem that happened to also have the answer. She got pissed like 5 min later but I don‚Äôt know if she saw it or she saw someone else share their screens w the answer.  I talked to zoom customer support and they said the hosts don‚Äôt have access to PM during a mtg or in breakout rooms bc of privacy violation rules. Can anyone confirm?
2247,"Slack DMs can be read by workspace Administrators, yes."
2248,congratulations that's awesome. may i ask what you majored in?
2249,Keep up the amazing work!  I just got accepted into graduate school at UCLA. Been out of custody two years.  The sky is the limit!!!!!
2250,congratulations!!
2251,Welcome fellow history grad.
2252,"I mean it‚Äôs really dependent on the crime, sometimes younger people end up in prison when the crime is bad enough"
2253,"Hey man I saw your profile pic and I just have some words of caution for you. I‚Äôve been on WSB for about a year and a half, and something I‚Äôve learned is to never fuck with WSB stocks. Don‚Äôt buy them, don‚Äôt short them, just don‚Äôt touch them, because sooner or later they‚Äôll dump and someone gets holding the bags. Just be careful on wsb, it‚Äôs gone from decent quality to pure garbage in the matter of a month.

Stay safe out there, fellow retard"
2254,Accidental death.
2255,I think you are underestimating what people are capable of when properly motivated.
2256,How the fuck can a person be in prison for FIVE years before the age of twenty? What kind of country has a juvenile Justice system lile that? But congratulations!
2257,"I study criminal justice in the US and can confirm, our juvenile justice system needs a lotta work."
2258,Gah... I miss the old days. I've steered clear of the pumps for sure. The only meme stonk I've gotten in on is PLTR and so far have doubled my money and holding for at least 5 years. WSB just had the best memes but even those have kind of become low quality.
2259,[deleted]
2260,That's so cool. Congrats. I wish you the best because you deserve it. It is not easy integrating back into society after being a felon. You are beating the odds. Stay strong üíï also if you happen to be in New York the urban institute has a position for a community research assistant for those who were in the criminal justice system.  It is to help improve policies.
2261,"The US is the only country in the world with no minimum age for criminal charges. Shit's fucked up.

In most first world countries it is literally impossible to spend 5 years in prison before the age od 20.

Actions have consequences. Yes. Should the consequeces be the same for an 10 year old and a 30 year old? No. Should teenagers spend time in adult prison? No."
2262,thats pretty cool! good luck!
2263,"Maybe you should read what he did, accidental death. Someone died, obviously I don‚Äôt know the circumstances but five years seems paltry compared to the outcome. 

Not saying op deserves more time, is a bad person or anything like that bc obviously I don‚Äôt know. But I think in some instances, this one included prison is warranted. Not everything is ‚Äúthe systems fault‚Äù"
2264,Or how terrible the system is.
2265,"Congrats!! You should check to see if a Petey Greene program exists through your university or any nearby. The program has volunteer college students & recent graduates tutoring incarcerated people trying to get their GED. 

Your experience would be invaluable if you were interested in participating."
2266,Congrats!
2267,"Oh dope, yeah I saw the diamond hands avatar and I just stereotyped, there‚Äôs so many new ppl on wsb it‚Äôs insane. Take it easy dude"
2268,[deleted]
2269,"Love WSB, but thank you for being smart y'all"
2270,Well done!!!
2271,"How is that reflective of the system at all? If a teenager intentionally burns down your home, should we let him go free because they're just a kid?

Actions have consequences. More at 11."
2272,Congrats bro!!! What state ?  We have an amazing network out here in California that your school can model into a nice program. Let‚Äôs connect!!!  Fellow Felon
2273,"Wow, were you in prison as a juvenile? That's kind of fucked. Congrats, that's such a huge accomplishment"
2274,oh wow. good luck for your future endeavours!
2275,[deleted]
2276,"Well to get convicted of a felony and spend 5 years in prison as a kid, the person must‚Äôve done some pretty fucked up shit (maybe murder, robbery, etc.), so I think it is absolutely necessary to get the facts of what happened before we go declaring the system is broken. I am not taking a position, but simply saying let‚Äôs not excuse or dignify OP‚Äôs actions until we know what actually happened.

Edit. Reading some other comments, OP was charged with accidental death which would explain the severity of the punishment.

Consider all the facts."
2277,Nobody is complaining here friend. I'm doing the work and taking things into my own hands
2278,"Super unprofessional. I‚Äôd try to go through the stages of ‚Äúchain of command‚Äù because regardless of the issue, the way it was handled is ridiculous."
2279,"OP you can also reach out to your advisor or head of Dept and find out the meaning behind this comment. Maybe it was a mistake..? If this is your last semester and you need just this one class, many schools will work with you to find an available alternative class. Best of luck. It's easy to jump on the defensive with a comment like that!"
2280,Yes
2281,Never thought I‚Äôd see something like that
2282,LOL **f**$**r**$**e**$**e**$**l**$**y** study...
2283,"Talk to an advisor. The message seems harsh, but it might be well intentioned. For example, it is really hard to get a CS minor at my uni. There are credit caps on a lot of the intro classes, so you pretty much have to be a freshman or sophomore to get in. Maybe the minor will set you back in graduating, which a lot of advisors try to stop. Get more info, there could be a good reason they selected that option."
2284,University is a place where you can freely study they say
2285,"I agree. It looks more like a small procedural mistake, and if OP asks nicely they'll review again and say ""oops, sorry"" and let OP in. No need to go into full offensive mode on this one yet."
2286,That is some bullshit
2287,What the actual fuck?
2288,"Agreed. Unfortunately a lot of times these things are decided by one person who may be very disconnected from the student experience, maybe even just someone working in admin. Always take it to the department, and if they don‚Äôt help go to your academic advising center"
2289,"I am a senior and messaged my advisor right before we made our spring schedules and stated that one of the classes I needed for my major has not been offered my entire four years here and she responded with ‚Äúoh yeah due to staffing shortages we canceled that major, may I suggest some others‚Äù."
2290,Denied. Student should not have been born!
2291,I was about to say same and then I realized that we go to the same school. Getting the CS minor was so much harder then it should have been
2292,"This is incredibly unprofessional, I‚Äôd go straight to the dean or department chair."
2293,"College is. University is an alliance of colleges (often called departments in shittier schools). Individual colleges admit you for your major. 

You can attend University and take tons of lower division courses but if you need to take an upper division, typically it needs to be an open course or you're restricted to your major/minor courses.

Ejection/acceptance to major is regulated by university board and is a HEAVILY regulated process to maintain their accreditation. If this happened to OP and their minor has been accepted, the college is obligated to provide the courses or an equal replacement to fulfill the minor. YOUR CATALOG RIGHTS ARE A CONTRACT."
2294,Yeah lemme get right on that in the middle of my minor
2295,I swear to god! Could‚Äôve just told me to drop out while he‚Äôs at it
2296,Wow. The audacity of that jerk!
2297,"That is so unbelievably inconsiderate, I would definitely report the issue and make an official complaint."
2298,"There's a part of me that hopes they really meant ""this minor sucks and you should leave and I'm really protecting you"" because that would be really funny"
2299,"Woah. Insanely unprofessional. I image a human person had to manually type in ""Student should change minor"" - maybe thinking you wouldn't see it, just that request was denied? - regardless, insanely unprofessional. Escalate that. Bring this to the Department Head, and then to the Dean of Students or Dean of Academic Affairs. I'd be pissed if I received a note like this when making a completely legitimate request."
2300,Yikes
2301,wtf.
2302,You might need to get clarification from the Registrar. You might be on a catalog that still has the major and thus they need to provide you some options. Normal colleges that know what they're doing have teachout plans for majors they are getting rid of. They don't just cancel them willy nilly
2303,goooooo Vikings
2304,Escalate that. That's bullshit
2305,">‚Äúoh yeah due to staffing shortages we canceled that major, may I suggest some others‚Äù

I'm cackling rn. Wtaf. You'd think someone would have mentioned this earlier..."
2306,"It just sounds like they actually cancelled concentrations within the major since you were able to fall back on Sociology. This is fairly common in departments that don't have enough differentiation in their coursework to offer concentrations. 

Don't feel too bad: it likely will have zero impact on your future goals. Love to see people interested in social welfare on here!!"
2307,"Hooo boy I remember I had to petition and fight to keep a class open in my community college because if they killed it I couldn‚Äôt complete my graduation goals. 

It made me so mad that people would cherry pick a person‚Äôs education as ‚Äúworth it‚Äù or not."
2308,"I am a TA, and last semester I was contacted by an essay writer who said they'd written papers for two of my students. I talked to the students, who explained that they paid the essay writer each $150 for the papers. The essay writer came back demanding $500 or that the essay writer would contact me, blackmailing the students. 

I felt terrible for the students, but you reap what you sow, right? Both were sent through academic misconduct process after."
2309,"There are ""tutors"" who will write something original exactly to spec. From the paper and student's behavior, I likely would be unable to tell those cases, but at that point, why are you in college & taking my class?

I have a second plagiarism checker (grammarly), I'll use in a case a student didn't follow instructions in a way that could be a premade essay.

But even if I don't find the plagiarism directly, usually the not following instructions is enough for a low grade (~60%) even with good content so you don't win anyways."
2310,"I‚Äôd really love to find a few of these essay writers, give them all the same prompt, and see what they each send back to me. Not for any assignments or anything, just to see what happens. Ever since I first found out this was a thing‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been dying to know the quality. 

Maybe one day if I have some money to blow, I‚Äôll try it for fun."
2311,">in case I somehow miss the plagiarism.

So how do you know if the essay was bought?"
2312,Hey! I never use plagiarized papers! I always submit my own new variation of the same tired point.
2313,Mods should sticky this thread.
2314,Crazy.  Out $150 and prob at least got a zero on assignment if not worse
2315,At our school one of these ghostwriters actually turned in the student for plagiarism after they refused to pay the ghostwriter for the essay.
2316,"This also happened to me. I‚Äôm a professor. I had the ghostwriter, who was a great writer but not a student, turn in their friend because they got into an argument over a Beyonc√© concert and the student refused to pay the writer. It was confusing, annoying, but also slightly funny."
2317,"Definitely not legal, but what can you do? They said they found the essay writer online. The essay writer's email to me was riddled with grammatical errors, so it‚Äôs not like the essay would have been worth it."
2318,"Not sure what happened during the academic dishonesty process. The blackmailing happened the day before the deadline, so they didn't have time to scrape together anything to turn in, so they both got zeroes on the final and failed the class. My guess is that because they never actually turned in work that wasn't theirs, they got away with only the F and nothing wrose."
2319,"Also note that once you've submitted the plagiarized paper, the ""tutor"" can then blackmail you by threatening to report your plagiarism to the university and getting you expelled.  You'll end up paying way more than the initial cost of the paper, and they can keep coming back for more.  Never trust random spammers."
2320,I was expecting this hahahaha
2321,"wow that's insane. Crazy business model, wonder if it's legal"
2322,[removed]
2323,"As per the instructions 

Does anyone expect a student with minimal to no experience to bring up new, original points that have not been considered, discussed, proven, disproven, then proven again for decades or even centuries?"
2324,I remember when I was I college and complained on Twitter about my paper having been deleted from my computer. The instant influx of ‚Äútutors‚Äù offering to write my paper was‚Ä¶ gross
2325,"Here's how I see it:

1. Pay $150-200 for someone across the world (a drastic overpayment -- could cover rent in some countries) to write an essay that looks like it came out of Google Translate. In the time it takes you to hire this person, you probably could have written a better essay than the one they are gonna give you.

2. Pay $500 for someone with the adequate skills to write an original essay. Continue having to do this because you never learned how to write an essay. 

3. Write the essay yourself and take your friends to dinner with that money. Get good at speed writing and churn out decent essays in two or three hours."
2326,Always do your own work. Period.
2327,"Well, yeah ‚ÄúGive me this money or I‚Äôll do something to cause you harm‚Äù is the very definition of blackmail."
2328,Still sucks‚ÄîAn F and -$150
2329,"If someone's dumb enough to plagiarize, they're probably also dumb enough to not do it in a manner that preserves their anonymity. 

Or maybe the dude writing the paper just asks the student directly, under a false pretense, or the student is dumb enough to provide the instruction sheet with the uni name on it to the writer. 

in short, I can imagine many reasons why. Point being that if they do, the student is absolutely fucked."
2330,Sounds like blackmail
2331,"Imagine giving someone the power to easily ruin your entire life, and then intentionally antagonizing them right after. Idk but with that thought process I get the feeling that student was kinda doomed from the start"
2332,Quick way to not learn lol
2333,Again I say to you
2334,"Some people want to learn at college but don‚Äôt like that they‚Äôre required classes that you may not be interested in, i know for myself that‚Äôs how it is, when in a class i don‚Äôt enjoy or am not interested in then I don‚Äôt have the excitement to learn or the want to get an A."
2335,"It's not legal but your local police can't exactly fly to Mumbai, Lagos, etc. and force the person on a plane here.

You could press civil charges. But you would probably go through a complicated process for a (relatively) small amount of money. If they were in the EU, you could get it into an English speaking small claims court and appear remotely fairly easily. But the countries most of these people are blackmailing from don't have stuff like that. And they are probably litigation proof (no assets for the court to take)."
2336,"When I was in college it was before the plagiarism checkers.  I had an acquaintance use a paper she wrote in the US as her paper for a class in the UK.

I asked her the same thing...why bother taking a class if you don't want to learn.

She just shrugged it off.

It's such a waste of time and money but I guess it's about getting a degree, not actually learning anything."
2337,"I dunno, I kind of get it.

I'm in college to get a degree in a subject that I've had a career in for the last 20 years. I just want the degree so it's easier to immigrate to another country and I guess to make job hunting that much easier.

I'm not really learning anything in these classes. Shit I could probably teach them, so it all feels like busy work for me. I mean, in the last class I took, I didn't open the book once and I got a B in the class.

Obviously my situation is drastically different than 99% of most college students, but I understand not wanting to repeat work you've already done and understand."
2338,Apologizing for offending someone isn‚Äôt the same as apologizing for what you said.
2339,There are still issues with this second email. They should have said ‚ÄúI apologize for offending ‚Ä¶‚Äù not ‚Äúif I offended‚Ä¶‚Äù such a crappy apology.
2340,Translation: I‚Äôm sorry I got caught being an asshole. I hope you can forget about this as I don‚Äôt want to be reprimanded
2341,"Fr man. Don‚Äôt wanna deal with a hungry lion during office hours lol. I‚Äôd just drop the course. College classes are supposed to be difficult, but with a crappy attitude this professor already shows, idek if it‚Äôs worth the time and effort. Just take a different prof"
2342,Why would anyone trust approaching them after that? They‚Äôre unstable.

2344,"What about admitting that what you said was out of line, condescending, and unproductive? I do agree they could have worded it a bit differently though. They definitely ruined credibility here."
2345,"""It wasn't my intention to offend anyone""

Previous email: ""you stupid idiots are so goddamn dumb, I can't believe it, you goddamn morons"""
2346,My petty response to his email would have been:  ‚ÄúDid your supervisor make you apologize to us? I am embarrassed for you‚Ä¶‚Äù
2347,"I mean, that's not apologising for their words. That's apologising for your reaction to it. I'd still bring it up and go ""Yea they haven't actually apologised, this is half-assed crap"""
2348,"> Lack of capitalization and grammar ‚Ä¶

Might just be old. I had a professor last quarter who was in his 70's. He spoke really eloquently in person and had a *huge* vocabulary, but online he typed like any old grandpa on facebook with all the ellipses, lowercase letters, random capitalizations, etc. It was really strange but I guess it made sense."
2349,This professor sounds like the professor who doesn't understand that his students are people too.
2350,"OP, are they a GTA? They seem so unprofessional for various reasons even in this second email. Lack of capitalization and grammar ‚Ä¶"
2351,That lack of capitalization and the random spaces and ellipses are classic old person text. Idk why they do that. Old people love to put ellipses everywhere (...)
2352,"I mean, at least the professor apologizes for the condescending tone. That's better than nothing. People make mistakes from time to time, so cut them some slack."
2353,"""Wow. Wow wow wow."""
2354,this. they don't seem sorry at all. i'd press the issue.
2355,that‚Äôs the customer service of apologies. you‚Äôre not really apologizing for your actions but instead putting the blame on them..
2356,"My business writing professor told us if we take anything away from her class it should be this: Email is forever. So remember this & think twice before hitting ‚Äòsend‚Äô. 

I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be smart enough to not do this over email again but I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them to do it in person during office hours or in class where there‚Äôs no paper trail"
2357,Man I hate when professors are assholes. THEN WHY ARE YOU A PROFESSOR?? Have patience god damn
2358,What's the point? You can't force them to feel sorry. Just move on with your life
2359,"I love how as students, we expertly craft our emails. Then professors start an email with a random space, don‚Äôt capitalize anything, or use proper grammar. Lol"
2360,[deleted]
2361,"> Email is forever. So remember this & think twice before hitting ‚Äòsend‚Äô. 

Always write emails as if they will be read aloud in court one day."
2362,"As one that‚Äôs been in trouble from the chair for being too lenient, I recognize this email as an older professor that grew up pre-internet when reading at that pace and reading ahead was what they were taught as gospel. I can tell by the wow wow bullshit. 

Their frustration that the academic experience now isn‚Äôt what they had in theirs is palpable. And a good reminder, if you had the whole bottle of wine, don‚Äôt email your damn class."
2363,I can kick the people above them to realise this shit ain't okay. I'll only be with this professor for probably this course. but I'm stuck with their superiors for the rest of my college tenure
2364,Lol thanks for the update I was wondering what would happen. What they said was rude and uneccessary
2365,You should narrate this movie
2366,That‚Äôs a mistake?? Found the professors burner
2367,wow wow wow...
2368,Chegg bought it. Now it's the exact same as citation machine and both have ad aids
2369,"I‚Äôd just like to point out that Microsoft Word has a bibliography tool for free! 

Bonus tip: I dump all the citations I want to use at the beginning of my paper (or as many as I have) because the tool will let you know if you‚Äôve missed using one of the citations you have!"
2370,GO OFF! EasyBib was sooo good when I was in middle school; quick and easy. Now I'm in college and the dang thing is so annoying to use. I imagine people kinda brought it on ourselves when we use adblock and don't pay premium for something we only use once or twice a month
2371,This. Would have been so useful even before grad school
2372,"+1 to Zotero, it‚Äôs the best"
2373,Chegg ruins most things.
2374,"*almost all of them

https://citethis.net"
2375,Chegg may have gotten me through ochem but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt hate the company for monopolizing so many academic resources
2376,"It has some other benefits, it runs as a chrome extension which can automatically import articles into your citations and you can save multiple projects. You can generate a whole citation page and generate in text citations that are linked to the citation page.

I found it a little cumbersome to use though, not easy to tweak the things it gets wrong without breaking all the links"
2377,No fucking way I JUST turned in a paper yesterday omg :):
2378,"I would rather look at irrelevant ads than paying a monthly subscription. But I know what you mean, I‚Äôm in the middle of class and I‚Äôm forced to watch an ad just to do my work."
2379,Chegg bought out or maybe owned mathway too fucking ad filled service now
2380,"Of all the companies in the world, very few put as much effort into exploiting students as chegg."
2381,"It's the difference between telling Alexa to add 71+32 and using a TI-84. Zotero does a lot of cool things as well. My favorite is automatically detecting my universities proxy and applying it to the sites i want it to so every time I enter some journal article I saw on Reddit, it automatically sets the proxy and i get full access. Otherwise it's a pretty cumbersome process sometimes"
2382,"Those ads crack me up too because when I‚Äôm grinding trying to finish a paper and  cite sources, the LAST THING IN THE WORLD I‚Äôm thinking of or prepared to focus on is some forced 60 second ad, I literally just multitask and wait for it to pass, I pay so little attention to them, I can‚Äôt even disdainfully mock what kinds of ads are played, I completely tune it out lol"
2383,Don‚Äôt you have to download and install Zotero? Why not just use online citation generators like [citethis.net](https://citethis.net)?
2384,"If you‚Äôre doing academic research, citations are an absolute necessity."
2385,Just use noodletools
2386,"Use this: https://www.scribbr.com/mla-citation-generator/

Does all types of citations with an aesthetic design and no ads."
2387,I always used OWL at Perdue.  And I think it still works okay.  I think it still has a citation generator but if not it's easy to navigate and tells you how to do the citations.
2388,You could plug in the url or title for a source and it would generate a formatted citation so you didn‚Äôt have to find all the info and format it yourself
2389,"Google Docs has a bibliography tool too, but it is not as advanced as the Microsoft Word version."
2390,[https://www.bibguru.com/](https://www.bibguru.com/) is amazing!   I tell students to avoid EasyBib and most of the others.
2391,"It‚Äôs okay, I didn‚Äôt learn this until my third year of college! I‚Äôve never used anything else since."
2392,Nowadays it just links to citation machine sadly
2393,Honestly I just cite my own things now. Less of a hassle and some websites miss things. I‚Äôm honestly happy about the ads because it pushed me to learn it correctly.
2394,">I‚Äôd just like to point out that Microsoft Word has a bibliography tool for free!

Years of academy training wasted..."
2395,"Add Collegeboard and Pearson to that list, man I hate those companies just as much as Chegg."
2396,"Around 8 years ago, there was an INCREDIBLE sentence diagram tool (google image search ‚Äúsentence diagram‚Äù if you haven‚Äôt heard of it). It carried me through a really difficult English/grammar class, and I learned a ton from it.

When I tried to search for it (via bookmark and website name) the next year, I found out that some company bought it out and discontinued the website. There was no other site like it, and the few sites I saw were not good. It took YEARS before I found a decent alternative, and they‚Äôre never as simple as the original online tool that I used. Most of them were monetized, showed tons of ads, and required downloads or accounts to use.

It sounds like Chegg is doing a similar thing here."

2399,ye I've got two exams today and I had a paper due last night
2400,I had an electrical engineering midterm this morning...after halloween night. Safe to say half of the class (including me) was still fucked up
2401,"Guess who has an organic chemistry exam right after Halloween?

Guess who also has a birthday the same week and spent it studying for this exam?"
2402,Found the ochem professor
2403,I had a chem exam in my 8 am
2404,"Mine makes some of the assignments due at 12:59 ‚ÄúPM‚Äù.
I‚Äôm on my very last course of my Masters and have never seen something due in the middle of the day."
2405,I love that so much
2406,"Yeah I just have a quiz today, when the professor had told us all our quizzes will be on Wednesdays"
2407,Jokes on you I'm currently dying in pchem
2408,This is true
2409,I have a physics exam today after halloween. couldn‚Äôt even go out last night
2410,"Haha, I was supposed to have a Calc test on halloween, but it was moved to Monday."
2411,"My physics teacher does this with homework and quizzes. Always due 12 pm, I hate it."
2412,Last year on Halloween I had to study for an immunology exam. This Halloween I am working on perfecting a lab notebook. The struggle is real. Canvas notifications like ‚ÄúExam 2 graded‚Äù are especially scary.
2413,I thought is would be Betsy DeVoss' ugly witch face on that pumpkin...
2414,F

2428,"Hi

Sorry to hear about you dying in a car crash but unfortunately, a lack of a soul is not one of the ""excusable"" absences according to our syllabus. I will have to give you a 0/10 for participation and attendance if you miss class this week."
2429,"Unlike doing what some of the others are saying, if you decide to escalate, it goes department chair first, then dean. However, it might be a good idea to work with the dean of students (a completely different office from the academic deans), who can help with documentation and advocacy."
2430,"Go to health center. Describe symptoms of a concussion (or be honest if you actually have them). Then email that teacher back with ‚Äúhey my friend is writing this because I‚Äôm not supposed to use a computer until I‚Äôm cleared from my concussion. When I wrote you earlier I wasn‚Äôt in my right mind and failed to mention that I was experiencing concussion symptoms. Friend noticed/I realized I felt weird and got  to the drs where they let me know I got likely got a bit of head trauma from the accident. Drs have recommended X course of treatment‚Äù and then get out of that class you missed due to taking care of possible concussion symptoms. That should fix them denying your legitimate absence due to car crash. Basically convinced teacher you only said you were ‚Äúfine‚Äù after totaling your car because you were too concussed to realize you‚Äôd been injured. If she tries to penalize you for suffering a concussion due to being hit by another driver, escalate up the department and reach out to student accessibility/accommodations office."
2431,"This is a great way to make the prof have a ""no concussion"" policy once they see a dramatic uptick of students with concussions."
2432,"This is so fucked that this is the only reasonable course of action nowadays.

Edit: Nowadays"
2433,Thanks for letting me know. I‚Äôll try to regain my soul by next week
2434,That would be illegal.
2435,"My fianc√©e has Chron‚Äôs disease. She had a flare up this past semester and emailed her professors letting them know she won‚Äôt be in class (most were completely understanding), but she had one that said her flare up was an unexcused absence and this would count as one of her three allowed absences before being dropped from his class. Professors are nuts."
2436,People and institutions that discourage honesty should expect it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
2437,"I think this is easily arguable if you have a medical emergency, but you're saying you weren't injured. I'm not sure how much of a case is here, even if your professor is being a dick. You could escalate this to the dean and try to see what can be done."
2438,"Show up to class with a roll of toilet paper and a bucket, play diarrhea chicken"
2439,This is unreal. Can you tell an administrator?
2440,My dad passed away in december. My teacher emailed me that day to see if i was still willing to take my final ..
2441,it would probably be better to visit a real medical provider regardless just in case
2442,Reach out to resources at your school! There‚Äôs tons of them. Email your advisor and explain what happened and see where they suggest your start. Explore your university website or your student portal for more student resources.
2443,"Don't do this. Do not use a fake concussion to try and get DRC accomodation. This is a terrible idea that will not work, and will not resolve your problem. DRC has sophisticated protocols in place to determine the legitimacy of your accomodation claim. If anything, it will make you look like a liar to everyone involved. 

Rather, contact the chair of the dept the course is ran through and explain the situation. Attach photos of your damaged car, and this email. If they persist, escalate to the Dean of the college. I can't imagine a car accident would not count as an excusable absence. That being said, be prepared to potentially get an alternative assignment for makeup: rarely is missing class a get out of jail free card, usually teachers have leeway to ask for you to makeup points."
2444,"The professor certainly isn‚Äôt doing you any favors, but lack of transportation for any reason typically isn‚Äôt a valid excuse for an absence. However, a university approved absence is, which can be obtained through your university resources with valid proof of your accident. The professor really is just abiding by his own departmental policies, though he SHOULD be pointing you towards student resources to allow you to go through the necessary channels."
2445,"The only thing is that I‚Äôm not quite sure whether I have any lasting injuries at the moment. Obviously I wasn‚Äôt hospitalized and nothings broken, but my shoulders a little fucked up (*possibly* torn ligaments, there‚Äôs just swelling right now) and my chiropractor says I have to wait to see whether it worsens (cause healthcare‚Äôs expensive as shit and I won‚Äôt feel the full extent of the pain until 2 weeks later). Since I haven‚Äôt gone to the hospital, I don‚Äôt know if saying I could possibly have issues will mean anything"
2446,"Once again, everyone is pushing ""go to the dean!!!!"".  Go ahead and try it, but you are not going to get anything out of it.  Attendance policies are in the syllabus.  

At my college, the only college mandated ""excused absences"" are court appearance, military service, and religious holiday.  That's it.  If a professor choses to show some leniency in other cases, they are allowed to (as long as they are fair about it), but the college is not going to force it.  

It's a few points for attendance.  Don't stress about it.  Let it go.  If your final grade literally comes down to these few miniscule points, the professor is going to bump you anyways.  

I promise you that ""going to the dean"" is only going to be a waste of time."
2447,"Also, do not lie and say you have a concussion. You could get kicked out of school for lying and wasting medical resources if you lie....I'm surprised so many are telling you to lie"
2448,"I've typically found bosses in the real world to be more understanding of issues that actually warrant an excuse, though."
2449,"Everything about your comment is bullshit lmao fuck off, nobody is expecting anyone to bend over for them, in fact professors like this are going out of their way to make things harder for students. And in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù jobs allow you to take sick days and file accommodations with HR."
2450,"It's not the fact that they don't have a car. It's the fact that their usual mode of transportation is unavailable to them due to unforseen circumstances, and they have don't have the ability to make other arrangements on such short notice. Theoretically, a student shouldn't sign up for an in-person class and bitch about in-person attendance. But OP shouldn't be expected to anticipate a car crash."
2451,"Yeah, chiropractors aren‚Äôt real doctors and often practice bullshit ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù."
2452,"Even then, it never really made sense to me. I'm an adult who knows how to prioritize. I'm sorry if your class didn't make the mark today. Good thing you get my money whether I attend or not. 

Attendance grades/requirements feel very much like high-school ""teaching accountability"" and it sickens me. 

Don't want people lying about dead grandparents? Don't put them into a position where literal death is the only reasonable excuse not to go to Intro to Psyche."
2453,You should at minimum go see your family doctor for an exam after an accident. I‚Äôve had friends permanently disabled from accidents after feeling sore but okay right afterwards. They were in shock. One has such chronic back pain she can‚Äôt even work. Go get checked out.

2455,how about we channel some empathy buddy
2456,"This sounds like a professor doing what admin is forcing them to do. 

I don‚Äôt know anyone who wouldn‚Äôt include ‚Äúcar accident‚Äù into an excused thing. Or have some other process for these unexpected scenarios.

2457,This is the dumbest fucking take
2458,"**""Can we just talk about how the coronavirus stimulus bill completely excludes us college students?""** 

""No."" - Congress"
2459,That's only because it's true. Y'all don't vote.
2460,Are we really though? I thought the common consensus was that the younger voting bloc doesn't vote.
2461,"Yeah, this is rough. Working at CVS (no hazard pay) and doing Postmates (also none) while still taking out loans for Pharmacy school and getting married in June to another ""dependent"" 

Guess I'll take the bullet for everyone else lol"
2462,"This MAJORLY sucks for me, as I moved out in August 2019 and pay all my own bills, but my parents were still able to claim for 2019. So now I don‚Äôt get check even though I‚Äôm 100% independent? Bullshit."
2463,Same. I had to do quite a bit of digging to find out anything about where I stood.
2464,"The only nit I would pick is that you could have chosen to file your taxes and take a full exemption and pay at whatever your tax rate would be, versus selecting something along the lines of ""I can be claimed on someone else's tax return"". Because of the way you did your taxes, you enabled your parents to claim you as a dependent. 

You could look into adjusting your returns with a tax professional and see what would make the most sense. I would involve your parents in the discussion, as it could also drive changes to their taxes, and result in them having to return the credits they got/get for claiming you."
2465,"I don‚Äôt think anyone was anticipating this shitshow when they did their 2018 taxes lol. If they were to file a correction, both the dependent and their parents will have to file corrections. Otherwise, it‚Äôll be rejected or an investigation will be opened for falsely claiming a dependent if it‚Äôs not corrected on the parents. It‚Äôs probably not worth the parents owing money back to the government so the student can then claim the education credits and the $1,200. There‚Äôs also the issue of time. I imagine this will be rolled out within a month and at best that‚Äôs how long it will take for the corrections to go through. But I imagine the IRS is short-staffed as usual if not more so."
2466,Spread this around! Nothing is final yet!
2467,"I vote and I still don't think it's the biggest influence I have. There are other ways you can be even more effective:

Sitting with your congressman for an hour, running some flyers to impact 100s of other votes, etc.

Voting is important but if you as an individual truly want to help push for something, there are ways to have a stronger impact."
2468,"CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.

THE PACKAGE CAN STILL BE EDITED."
2469,"I know this is unpopular opinion or whatever. I don't mean to attack you in anyways. 

BUT

Is there a lifestyle difference in someone who has never needed to file as a dependent & claim their own taxes? I imagine if your parents have been claiming you this far that you are likely still able to rely on your parents for support. Many people who are claiming themselves are living out in the world and working without a parents to handle their finances. This might correlate to being more in need of a bail out then the typical student.

Maybe that is why it flew under the radar?"
2470,"I got married this year in March (so I became an independent), however in 2019 was claimed by a parent. Fresh grads of winter 2019 are also getting the shaft, as most of them were claimed as dependent too, despite now being independent."
2471,"Voting isn't actually the most powerful tool you have in many cases.

One of our generation's strengths is blowing things up on social media. Everyone saying that makes it sound like a bad thing, but it's often a good thing when we do it with important issues. We should blow this issue up if it's a concern. We did the same thing with MeToo and BLM (not commenting a stance, just an observation of how fast those two things grew) and look at how fast politicians and imoortant figures started recognizing those things.

Social media is probably the most effective tool if we want to impact it."
2472,I'm a working tax paying citizen who has no income right now because of the virus. I need the compensation because I'm fucking broke it shouldn't matter if my parents claimed me as a dependent.
2473,[deleted]
2474,"I‚Äôm actually worried. Yes my parents have claimed me as a dependent and i live with them, but both of my jobs have let me go so how am i supposed to pay my bills? Dependent or not i need some kind of help."
2475,[deleted]
2476,"OP, that's a part of your taxes.  There's a question about if you are claiming any dependents and another about if you are being claimed as someone else's dependent.

If you are under 18, you must be emancipated. If you are over 18 and independent, then they can't claim you if you did your taxes correctly.

Honestly, many of us are working full-time and going to school with zero support from family.   Do you honestly think that someone who already gets constant family support and hasn't paid taxes is entitled to the same amount?"
2477,Same here. I got married in March and am a college student. It sucks because we‚Äôre independents now but not according to 2019.
2478,"> We did the same thing with MeToo and BLM (not commenting a stance, just an observation of how fast those two things grew) and look at how fast politicians and imoortant figures started recognizing those things.

I think it might be wiser to look at how slowly they did anything about it.

What exactly do you believe has changed since #MeToo? I can almost guarantee the next generation of Weinstein is busily cornering young actresses in hotel rooms right now. Sending one or two bad guys to prison hasn't altered the social power dynamics that make a Weinstein inevitable.

Likewise, Black Lives Matter didn't actually *do* anything. The passengers may have gotten upset for a while, but the ship sailed on.

The social media power you're extolling is ephemeral and largely meaningless. It's not real power, except perhaps personal power for those who enrich themselves via social media.

In general, if something is simple, easy and requires little thought, it's not going to make much of a difference."
2479,This may apply in some cases but there‚Äôs a broad spectrum of situations ranging from a friend of mine who is 100% financially independent but their parents need the tax return more to cases like mine where the only thing they provide is letting me stay on their health insurance which is far better than anything I could get on my own in return for letting them claim me on their taxes.
2480,"Same here! I moved into the dorms in August 2019 but lived with my mom before then so she was able to claim me. Got a place with my bf last month, paying rent, etc. and my mom can‚Äôt claim me anymore but still.. no monies for me!!"
2481,[deleted]
2482,"Blowing up social media might be great for social movements (sometimes), but it doesn‚Äôt remove the officials who can decide to ride against those movements from office. 

You have to vote. You HAVE to vote.

Look at what happened with Bernie Sanders. He captured the hearts of Gen Z and most Millennials, but where were y‚Äôall during the primaries? On social media talking about him? Agreeing with his platform on Twitter Dot Com doesn‚Äôt count as a vote, and now Biden has it in the bag because young voters didn‚Äôt show up. Granted they historically never do, so I know this is like screaming at a brick wall, but don‚Äôt sit there and say voting is some lesser application in a democratic society when that‚Äôs literally our most powerful asset. It‚Äôs the foundation of our legal system."
2483,I lean left but I put this on both parties. The senate Dems had a chance to fight to include us college students and they left us out.
2484,Why does a 17 year dependent on their parents get additional money but an 18 year old doesn't?
2485,My representative is Jeff VanDrew. You know the one on the news that everyone hates. I don't see that going anywhere lol
2486,"A draft for anyone who wants to email their representatives:

Good evening,

I am a college student being claimed as a dependant despite being 90% self sufficient. It is very disappointing that the current stimulus bill doesn't include anything for college students, especially those who have to take out loans. I would greatly appreciate a change before it leaves the senate to help out us students.

Thank you,"
2487,By this logic college students should be considered children and add $500 to the parents check.
2488,">Universities are taking this seriously. They don't care about your opinion on covid-19. They will take the precautions and send you HOME.

No. They don't. Hence why you were forced back to school or risk forfeiting the school year all for the profit of the college.

This country is using college students as a testing lab right now for reopening and its disgusting. Nothing says proactive like shoving 5 students into the same dorm!"
2489,My university president just sent out an email to the entire student body shaming the Greek life students for partying. A bunch of students were arrested for partying the other day.
2490,Still hurts the same.
2491,they should just go online instead of relying on college students to do the best thing for their safety and education.
2492,"no ineptitude on the college‚Äôs parts, only greed. if some random guy on reddit is able to figure out how fucking stupid this is no shit university admins know it too. they just want their tuition"
2493,Drink at home with your dorm/flat mates if you must.
2494,"This. I can‚Äôt believe how many people are falling into the trap of ‚Äúif we have to go home it‚Äôs because of the 20 year olds who made bad decisions‚Äù. Yes obviously you shouldn‚Äôt be going out to parties, but there‚Äôs a reason the school admin decided that we should come back, and it‚Äôs not because they trusted kids to make the right decisions..... it‚Äôs because if we‚Äôre here in person, then they‚Äôre making much more money than if we were online. 

I‚Äôm honestly so sick of the narrative that it‚Äôs the students fault, like, they reallllly trusted 40,000 20 year olds to make good enough decisions to keep in person classes going on a global pandemic? When whole ass cities and communities can‚Äôt stay open for a month without huge spikes in COVID numbers? Yeah okay, blame the kids..... 

It was so obvious to everyone that schools should stay online thoughout the fall, but the admin who stands to get money decided they might as well risk it. It should be beyond obvious that blaming kids is a scapegoat tactic and yet so many people on reddit are screaming about how it must be the students fault because they decided to go out."
2495,"Ironically at my school it‚Äôs not Greek life who‚Äôs partying it‚Äôs all the other people, because Greeks have much harsher punishments than everyone else"
2496,"Some are. Ohio State dropped the gavel on some 200+ students for not following guidelines and where I go you will either get sent home, suspended, or expelled."

2499,i‚Äôm just gonna flat out say that 90% of the kids who are partying aren‚Äôt on reddit...
2500,"In a letter Syracuse‚Äôs VP sent out to the students

‚ÄúI want you to understand right now and very clearly that we have one shot to make this happen. *The world is watching, and they expect you to fail.* Prove them wrong. Be better. Be adults.""‚Äù

Idk about you guys but I like proving people wrong. 

I know a lot of people want to blame the administrations and yes they deserve some blame. But don‚Äôt get it twisted, we have an opportunity to prove everyone wrong about college students being selfish and unfortunately it seems our peers don‚Äôt seem to want to shed that label. So yes some of the blame needs to go to the students as well, not all, but some."
2501,"You also have to look at it as though while you may have been wearing masks these last four months, a lot of people have not been. Since there are a lot of people that don't believe in the virus or believe that masks don't do anything, they don't feel the need to wear them which can further spread the virus."
2502,Wow this hit me too hard
2503,Especially not /r/college. This places has been shitting on people who party long before this pandemic showed up
2504,"Bro. There are SO MANY full-fledged, 9-5 working adults that don't take this seriously. Just look at what happened in Miami and Denver. And you're expecting college students to step up? 

College is, in its VERY CULTURE, unhygienic.  Administrators should have known better."
2505,[deleted]
2506,"That's really interesting to me! My school is known as a party school so really no one is surprised about the Greeks partying, and as far as I know other people haven't been partying as much but it definitely does happen.

For anyone else on this thread I want to make it clear I'm not bashing Greek Life, I'm just restating what the uni president said in his letter about Greek life parties"

Maybe I'm too cynical, but a generic canned email just wouldn't do anything for me.  It's impersonal and I'm sure the rest of the class got the same message.  There is nothing specific, so it is insincere. 

All in all, the first point outweighs the second.  While it's worthless to me, I'm sure many find value in it."
2522,"My professor:

""I hope you're doing well, this semester has been hard on everyone. If you ever need anything please don't hesitate to reach out and ask. I'm here for you.""

I'm sure the professor meant well but they likely just checked everyone's name who had an A in the class..."
2529,"I'm certain they meant well.  There was obviously no malicious intent.  There just isn't much value in a copy/pasted message.  It's on par with a motivational tape distributed to thousands.  ""You are smart. You are committed.  You did a good job.  I respect you and your work.""

2592,"Alright, let's see what I can do on this, though admittedly it's not something I'm great at explaining.

I think you need to look at why you're quoting someone directly. What about their original language needs to be preserved rather than paraphrased? Paraphrase indicates that you have mastery over the material, which is usually something good for an essay to show. My students, by contrast, often say they want to directly quote because they can't explain something as well as the original author ...yeah, but the solution is to learn it well enough to explain it just as well, or close enough to be serviceable. If you can't explain it in your own words, you probably don't understand it, and there's your problem.

So with direct quotes, you should have a purpose in mind, more than just ""prof said so."" Let's suppose Haidt had this line in his research:

>It would appear that pineapple triggers the disgust mechanism in some of our brains.

The sort of adequately competent way to introduce this, after Haidt himself has been introduced is just:

>Haidt goes on to conclude that, ""It would appear that pineapple triggers the disgust mechanism in some of our brains.""

Simple little bit of narrative explaining how the direct quote relates to what we've just been discussing. But, it's not particularly great. YMMV, but I prefer to minimize direct quotations. I think they appear lazy (like you're trying to pad your writing), can raise doubts about your own understanding (I've been at a conference where a presented admitted they didn't understand a quote they used), and frankly, we're reading *your* essay to hear *your* ideas, so we want *your* explanations.

Context is going to be key, but in this instance, the thing I need to preserve is the phrase ""disgust mechanism."" The rest of the language is very general, but that phrase is a really specific term of art he's coined, and changing that might be an issue. So, I'd get to something like this:

>Haidt goes on to conclude that pineapple on pizza seems to trigger a specific biological ""disgust mechanism"" in the brains of people who find it revolting.

The key thing here was the addition of the word ""biological."" It didn't appear in the original, but including it is a subtle way to signal ""I really understand this,"" or even more to the point, ""I understand this well enough to explain it with my own language.""

I have no idea if any of this answered your question. I maybe just went off on my own tangent, and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask."
2593,"Well, you're wrong. I mostly wrote this in the shower! It's hardly anything. ...Kinda.

It's actually a weird thing with writing when we talk about how long something takes to write. How long did this take? Actual time at the keyboard? 15-20 minutes. Active thinking time? A few hours. Accumulating background knowledge and experience to be able to write it? I dunno, 20 years?

An anecdote I like to use is that I did a conference presentation a few years back and wrote the entire thing in about 2 hours the day before. How'd I accomplish that? By writing a dozen different earlier drafts over the few weeks prior.

Or, you know, how hard is it to kill a level 5 monster? I dunno, are we asking how hard it is to kill it when you're level 3? Or how hard it is to reach level 8 and than slay the level 5 monster with ease?"

2623,It would still be the dependent check of $600 if I'm not mistaken.
2624,2 months for me.
2625,I think the only way to do that is too file your own taxes. I'm guessing you're parents get your stimulus because the claimed you on their taxes so the only bank info they have for you would be your parents and not yours

Hmm... kinda casts doubt on the validity of some exams doesn't it? Sometimes people have a bad day, sometimes the test is bad. Maybe we shouldn't base the success of a person in school (and in life in general) on the number of points they get on a quiz."
2650,"At the end of the semester, my writing prof was inputting attendance grades, and I think he gave me something like 250% by accident. I didn‚Äôt tell him because I had an A+ in the class anyways, and it was literally the last grade he had to put in, but I thought it was funny how I ended with like a 120+% in the class"
2651,"I wouldn‚Äôt say anything, but that‚Äôs just me. They‚Äôll probably catch it anyways."
2652,That‚Äôs lame. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your C several years later‚Äù yeah right trashhh
2653,"You could either email them about it, or just let it ride and it'll be changed eventually. Just don't hope it goes through, cause it won't lol. This is way too blatant of a mistake, they'll catch it probably the next time they look at your grade."
2654,wait this is actually so genius
2655,They‚Äôll probably catch the mistake. You could email them about it or you could just let it be. Most of my professors noticed those kinds of mistakes pretty quickly
2656,"It matters a lot for a relatively brief period of time, but that importance diminishes with time. Your professional history becomes much more important."
2657,"Somewhat unethical but don‚Äôt notice until later, wait until it‚Äôs a busy time so the prof is more likely to be generous bc they‚Äôre swamped."
2658,"...I wouldn't count on that.

2659,"F that. Assume you have an A and stop showing up. No need to even worry about the final, yolo!"
2660,A(5!+)*
2661,"Tbh kinda fucked you changed it after so many years.

2672,"I'm an instructor. I had a student who had a heart condition come on out of nowhere (health student in their 20s prior) and had to have heart surgery TWICE last semester. 

I met with them and gave accommodations that I thought were basic common sense: reducing assignment load and extending deadlines to when the student wasn't, you know, HAVING HEART SURGERY. 

They had a mental breakdown during our meeting and said that no other professor had tried to make accommodations or cared. 

Not that their grades matter, but they were still pulling A's.

I've never been more pissed off on someone else's behalf in my life."
2673,I once had to take a proctored exam from a hospital bed and the professor complained that the constant nurses entering the room could be viewed as possible cheating so to keep it to a minimum.
2674,I mean those are pretty lame excuses
2675,Perhaps this is the case. I‚Äôve seen it first hand in my major where students would do that and it‚Äôs not good at all. Their work ethic will show though when they get interviews and internships
2676,"That shouldn't be an issue as military service obligations can override school attendance policies.  Just show your professor your materials at your earliest opportunity and remind him a couple of weeks before you leave.  Worst case scenario, if your professor were to object, you can go to the Dean of Students."
2677,"You know the nurses may not have been checking to make sure I was alive, they could have been giving me exam answers! I had to let him know that if the heart monitor I had on beeped or my IV ran out of life-saving medication, the nurses would come in the room regardless of his test policy. I was literally dealing with heart failure and bleeding in my intestines. üòÇ"
2678,"This reads either like the prof is fed up with overused excuses and doesn‚Äôt want to hear it, or is just asking you to say instead ‚ÄúI have to go home early because I have to go on tour with my rock band and then make it back in time to preform in a circus on the acrobatic team, so please allow me to take the test a couple days early.

You‚Äôre either about to have the best semester or the worst‚Ä¶ no middle ground lol"
2679,Yeah I‚Äôm worried about that because I actually do have a legit excuse. I‚Äôm going to miss 2 weeks in April for military training and I already have the documentation for it. I was planning to talk with the professor on the first day. I hope it works out and since it‚Äôs months in advance I hope there‚Äôs some leeway. I‚Äôm already thinking about how to make up the work and everything
2680,What the hell
2681,"I don't even think *employers* can make you perform work when you are in the hospital. That professor probably wouldn't have had to do any if they were.

And that's a job you get paid to do by an employer that wants to make money. Imagine not getting an extension on *homework.*"
2682,lol accessibility resources (the equivalent at my school) told me to go fuck myself when I asked them to help me get accommodations
2683,Some excuses we get make these examples seem reasonable XD
2684,"Honestly, as a professor, I‚Äôd rather not hear an excuse at all than heat a lame one. ‚ÄúProfessor, I am sorry for the late notice, but I will not be able to attend class today. Thanks, Student.‚Äù That honestly works a lot better than talking about literally almost anything else. We hear so many lame excuses that sound made up that hearing nothing and being to the point is often so refreshing. Some students will say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience‚Äù or ‚Äúcan you let me know about anything I missed‚Äù, but I prefer students not do that. The first one isn‚Äôt so bad because I just think ‚Äúhow is this an inconvenience to me? I  still taught with no issues but you missed the lesson. It sounds inconvenient for you, not me.‚Äù But we HATE the second one. The syllabus generally tells you what was discussed on a particular day. It‚Äôs like an hour of difficult material. I can‚Äôt distill an entire lesson down to a single message and email it to you. Never ask that question. If you have specific questions about concepts you don‚Äôt understand, that would be fine, but general ‚Äúwhat I miss‚Äù or, GOD HELP YOU, ‚Äúdid we do anything today‚Äù are kind of infuriating.

Oh, and please write the email in a letter format, not all shoved into the subject line. We generally read and respond to them on computers, not phones."
2685,"Same. I had neurology issues, and had to medically defer. They‚Äôre charging me for my classes and gave me all 0‚Äôs. I go to a different school now who will let me have those classes taken off my transcripts. But the old school said there was nothing I could do. They didn‚Äôt even want to give me my transcripts until I paid my full tuition for that semester. I still haven‚Äôt because I plan to see what I can legally do first."
2686,This is genuinely messed up. I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with that. The education system really is something isn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶
2687,Depends on the fight with your SO lol. I‚Äôve been in some pretty gnarly arguments/near breakups that left me shaken for days. Stuff like people threatening to kill/harm themselves‚Ä¶that‚Äôll mess you up. And how are you supposed to explain that to a prof? Kinda awkward and too personal.
2688,"Attendance in college still irritates me. Grades on homework and exams will reflect knowledge.

I had a prof who had the TA walk around the entire class and dock us points if we were doing anything on our phones or laptops (except notes). Is this middle school?"
2689,Oof I‚Äôm sorry about that. I know I‚Äôm going to miss some school later in the semester but I already have the documented excuse. It‚Äôs for military stuff. I plan to talk to him on the first day of school and see what he says. It‚Äôs months in advance so I hope that helps my case.
2690,"Prof here. Military service most definitely doesn't count as a ""lame excuse"" (whatever one's personal feelings about the military may be). This is legitimate and will be excused and reasonably accommodated. There's probably a university policy regarding military service and class absences or leaves of absence."
2691,"Last December I had a student write several paragraphs because he was suffering from an STI and needed a prostate exam. This triggered him  and thus needed a long recovery time from an ‚Äúexistential crisis‚Äù (prostate exam not STI). I just wish he had given me no excuse, frankly."
2692,"I get it if you have to go home for an important reason, but who the hell uses, ""*I had a fight with my girlfriend,*"" as an excuse?"
2693,For real though. I‚Äôve seen worse in my classes lol. People trying to get out of work for the lamest reasons
2694,"It's okay was a few semesters ago. Last semester I had a broken sternum and was very immobile in my torso and heavily medicated, and my professors were very lenient with due dates and helping me out"
2695,"That‚Äôs good to know, thanks"
2696,"Yeah dude every single american college is like this one class, right on!"
2697,"yeah this is why i feel like there should be more no-questions-asked late work/test makeup policies. sure, some people will take advantage of it, but i think it's okay to let a few unscrupulous individuals sneak by if it means meaningfully helping the mental well-being of people going through trauma. my freshman year of college i lost my best friend and had to travel home for 3 weeks to manage my emotions and attend his funeral. thankfully my professors were all great people and gave me the time i needed but even that really wasn't enough for me to fully process what had happened. i don't think there's any specific policy at my school for these situations, so i was just relying on my professors being decent human beings and taking my word for it."
2698,"Even without copying entire sources into an essay, some of the peer reviews I have done have left me wondering how we were all seen as being the same skill level. I had one girl talk about Hitler saying ""The Nazi's did bad things."" In a COLLEGE LEVEL RESEARCH PAPER about CHRISTIANITY AND CAPITAL PINISHMENT. I read it to my family that day because it was so hilariously terrible."
2699,"Similarly, I had a professor last week remind our class be appropriate in end of semester course evaluations. A student a previous semester apparently put in her evaluation, ""I wish Dr. XXXX wasn't married."""
2700,As in ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt.‚Äù
2701,"Honestly it‚Äôs not just some; there are A LOT of people who shouldn‚Äôt be in college for one reason or another. 

Bioethics class: One girl, literally every time, without fail, always uses the ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt the way god intended for us to reproduce‚Äù argument whenever we talk about anything with alternative routes to pregnancy and childbirth. And that is the only argument she ever uses to reject that stuff. 

Medical nutrition therapy class: Classmates talking about essential oils and acupuncture to treat stuff. Mind you, our governing body specifically states, as part of its code of ethics, that we only use evidenced-based practice and techniques. 

Sometimes college really just feels like high school round 2."
2702,"Same, this weirds me out so much. And we have spell check now. We don't have to do all that shit ourselves anymore. Just USE IT. Hit the button. Let it fix ""deffinately"" for you!"
2703,"I knew a girl in middle school that would take the first few paragraphs of the Spanish Wikipedia article for a topic, run it through Google translate to put it in English, and submit that. I don't think she was ever caught for it, AFAIK."
2704,"Why would that student care if she was married? If you'd write that kind of bullshit, I promise you couldn't pull her if she was single or otherwise."
2705,"Well, most students do come in right out of hs."
2706,"I've seen classmates discussion responses where I could copy a part of their response, paste it to Google, and find the article they plagiarized their response from."
2707,"On my final, I discussed why the eagles couldn't take Gandalf straight to Mt. Doom and made the argument that Samwise Gamgee is the true hero of Lord of The Rings.

Professor dropped me a full letter grade, it was a poli sci class lol"
2708,"They know that no matter what they say, it won't prevent some people from doing it anyway."
2709,"I really hate that word. I will never get it right. If my life depended on it, like if someone was holding a gun to my head and said spell it now, I'd be there all night. I would just take the gun and do myself in. Just save everyone time.  I'm sure if he had a six shooter and shot me each time I got it wrong, he'd still run out of bullets.

He Defanatily would."
2710,"SHE might not care, but the vibes I‚Äôm getting is that the PROF would certainly care"
2711,"Not directly related, but your story reminded me of the time I took the AP test for US Government and Politics. I had no idea what the hell I was looking at (I had not paid much attention in the class, very bad senioritis), so for one of the essay questions I ignored the prompt and wrote why Pusheen the cat should be president. 

Got a 2. Which of course is not passing but all things considered I was amazed I didn‚Äôt get a 1."
2712,"True. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt expect a 1st semester freshman to just immediately grow up and instantly get rid of all their HS habits and problems. 

But when you see sophomores and especially juniors and seniors acting like they‚Äôre still in HS, I mean come on."
2713,"Honestly. I was in what I considered a very difficult honors english class my freshman year, and one of the essays I peer reviewed was so terrible I didn't even know what kind of pointers to give without sounding like I was picking on the writer. There was just a page or two of free association while the rest of my peers had \~20 pages of fairly decent draft written. I was actually clueless what the paper was on. Something about poison being very bad."
2714,">  I was in what I considered a very difficult honors english class my freshman year, and one of the essays I peer reviewed was so terrible I didn't even know what kind of pointers to give without sounding like I was picking on the writer.

During grad school, we had to peer review end-of-semester papers written by other graduate students (each of us was a grad student in either physics or engineering).  To preserve anonymity, the professor removed the authors' names from the copies he handed out to us to read.

One of the papers assigned to me was absolutely atrocious.  The physics and math were okay, but the writing, grammar, and spelling were at the level of a typical 9 year old, not an adult with a Master's degree.   It was incredible just how bad the writing was.

This being a STEM field, I naturally assumed the writer was an international student who knew English as a second language (at least a third of the students in the class were international students).  So I included kindly-phrased comments to the effect of ""Please have a native English speaker review your writing"", etc.  

Turns out, the author of that horribly written paper was an English-speaking American, a guy I had had a couple other classes with and knew decently well.  For the life of me, I have no idea how this guy was even offered admission into a graduate program.  There's no way he's capable of writing a scientific article, grant proposal, or technical document."
2715,It‚Äôs not that simple. A source with a relatively high % could be perfectly fine if it uses lots of quotes that are properly cited.
2716,"When I said ""she"" I was referring to the prof - I was assuming that ""her"" in the original comment meant the professor, as I don't think you can tell the gender of the students writing evals.

Yeah, the professor has every right to be pissed. It'd be super tiring to be treated like some sex object when you deserve the same respect that male professors get."
2717,"Really high, which is more lax, the most I‚Äôve ever been allowed was 8%"
2718,"Dang, 24% ?!?"
2719,I used to do that in high school except for French class and went English to French. Still read it over to proof read. God I hated French class
2720,"So the way those tests are graded, the people looking at your stuff have to read 100% of everything you write on the off chance you start saying something meaningful again after spouting garbage. (I had a teacher on some important committees who explained this to us). You also don‚Äôt lose points for writing garbage if you already did good work.

Because of that, I wrote an entire 4th essay on one of my AP exams about being bored and a bird flying around inside the test center (true story). I still got a 5. üòÇ"
2721,"I know people who cheat tend to be lazy, but that is a new kind of lazy..."
2722,"Yup. I watched this happen in one of my classes. The professor wrote a strongly worded warning the first week. The next week the student did the same thing. The professor wrote a very public reply about how it wouldn't be tolerated, they talked about it last week, and she got expelled.

It's so insanely easy to cite a source... Even if it's the entirety of your discussion post. (Which it shouldn't be)"
2723,[deleted]
2724,[deleted]
2725,"I had the highest A in the class and the professor insisted we had to write an essay in class along with the multiple choice. Multiple choice portion I got 100% on, so I knew fucking around on the essay portion wouldn't give me dread. Definitely helped me de-stress for the next class final later in the day."
2726,"Yup, that first step right there, infinety, that will stop me I'm sure.

 I'm doomed."
2727,"No, the questions were related to what we learned in class. I knew no matter what I'm still passing, so might as well enjoy myself and give the professor a nice chuckle."
2728,"im only a freshman but my course load has been rigorous. ive set boundaries for myself. i WILL not work past 5pm, and i will give my self two days of rest. it helps keep me sane"
2729,You would think it‚Äôd be common sense that pulling an all nighter when you‚Äôre extremely tired and probably hungry doesn‚Äôt help you retain information any better. But I guess not.
2730,"Same, 3AM is like the latest I will ever stay awake to study; any time past that and my brain just shuts down. Most of the time if I‚Äôm gonna cram, I‚Äôd rather sleep early and wake up early."
2731,The amount of times I've been stuck on a problem and gotten a good night's sleep and then miraculously solved the problem the next day tells me that sleep is way more important than studying
2732,"If anything pulling an all-nighter harms your mental performance. You might not be able to tell if there is any degradation in mental performance which makes it harder to understand the importance of mental health. Research shows that you never gain the lost amount of sleep. So, not sleeping a night and sleeping all day the next day is not going to help."
2733,"Jonathan Crary wrote an entire book about this, it gets even worse when you graduate and get into high-pressure corporate culture. Every second that's not Productive‚Ñ¢ is a second they'll try to take from you..."
2734,[deleted]
2735,For me I feel so guilty if I even have a day of doing no work. even on Weekends i force myself to work on HW during the afternoon. :/ Last Saturday though I could barely force myself to work on a problem idk what to do cause I feel so behind if I leave just a whole day of rest (I‚Äôm a freshman too in engineering)
2736,Damn the latest I will study is like 9PM but I do wake up early
2737,I don‚Äôt think one all nighter has any effect in the long game. Think of all the nights of sleep you‚Äôll get in the long run? What‚Äôs one night working really hard? Not arguing haha just playing devils advocate
2738,"we have to understand that busyness is not a measure of productivity.

It is a major problem in our student culture. It can easily be solved with proper time management and prioritization. We have to start from ourselves and not feel guilty about it."
2739,Right? Like I pulled only one all nighter in my life so far (just for fun) and wanted to die in the morning. How in the world would it be any better if I had to remember things for a subject ? Lmao
2740,All nighters really fuck up your brain. Sleep is probably the most important thing to be focusing on daily because you can really get hurt if it‚Äôs not paid attention to. It‚Äôll literally take years off your life
2741,Right... I‚Äôm not glorifying it. I want to have a healthy sleep schedule but I just don‚Äôt. Like good for  y‚Äôall cuz I can‚Äôt relate  sadly :(
2742,I wake up in the morning and do work all day until 5 pm. im not going to fail by not allowing myself to get burnt out over classes
2743,"I just pulled an all-nighter volunteering at a COVID vaccine clinic. I‚Äôm a healthy adult. I still feel like death warmed over. We need sleep, y‚Äôall! Prioritize sleep and your body will thank you."
2744,I used to feel guilty too. but the way i was feeling doing hours of work everyday with no end in sight made me feel even worse. the good thing about allowing yourself to have breaks is it teaches you how to work more efficiently in preparation of them. good luck on your degree!
2745,1st year undergrad here and hope to achieve the same thing!
2746,Same! I have a strict no schoolwork past 10 PM rule that I will only break if I have an exam or a big assignment due and even that is 11 PM. I go to bed around 11:30 so I credit the down time I have as one of the reasons that I'm able to maintain my GPA while taking a very intense course load.
2747,"In my experience, the people who I know that does this always say ""Sleep is for the weak"". Jokes on them, they look like dead zombies everytime our teacher catches them sleeping in class.

On a serious note, it's honestly better to get a night's sleep than to sleep late and spend the next day feeling tired and unproductive."
2748,"Fully agree. We sacrifice our sleep and then we may get the grades but our mental, emotional, and tbh physical health is trashed maybe for life. A lot of people think college kids drink all night and party, THE COLLEGE LIFE YAY but that's f\*ked up shit. We work our asses off and even in Covid the work load somehow goes up. That's why so many kids stay up all night, between work and school oh and maybe a few mins of socializing there's not enough time. So yeah sleep in college is a problem but the system isn't helping us to get any more"
2749,I'm currently a sophomore in undergrad and I have yet to pull an all nighter for the purpose of cramming. I have some friends who do though and I tend to be in a much better mood than them come finals week.
2750,5pm? Surely that‚Äôs only for these covid classes because there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll be able to do well normally with rigorous classes.
2751,"And the one who does best of all is the person who studies a little bit each day in the weeks leading up to the exam, and then gets a good night's rest the night before."
2752,"I've only pulled all nighters to reset my sleep schedule, but typically you'd go to bed at around 5 pm the next day and wake up at 8 am (YMMV though)."
2753,"Just out of curiosity, what‚Äôd you major in? Because in my major it‚Äôs quite nearly impossible to be done with homework and whatnot by 6 p.m. I pride myself in my time management skills (never missed a deadline or had to pull an all nighter) but being done with all my work before 6 p.m. is not even in my scope of imagination."
2754,"Same. Over five years of college, I only even worked past 6 p.m. twice (exams which required it). Time management is a seriously underrated skill in college, and sleep is important!"
2755,I never pulled an all nighter when in college. When you get less sleep I feel like you do worse on exams than the studying benefited.
2756,"Double major in linguistics and statistics, comp. sci. and economics minors. (There's a reason it took 5 years...) Full disclosure: I definitely woke up before the avg. college student (5:30-6) and was usually at uni working by 7:30 or so. Did have a job, but probably wasn't as engaged in extracurriculars as many students. Saturdays were mostly completely off, though occasionally that wasn't possible, and I had to work a few hours. Graduated with a 3.85, 4.0 the last four years."
2757,Duh. Guess which one you can go without for extended periods of time without impacting your quality of life....
2758,well sorry If I was trying to help bring some smiles to people since some schools start back up in the next few weeks so people may be stressed. if my post bugs you and upsets you so much just keep scrolling its not that complicated.
2759,"Don't worry about it. I very much enjoy looking at cat posts, they always put a smile on my face."
2760,"Hmm I don't know, judging from your textbook, you cat seems pretty WOKE to me.."
2761,Your cat's already paying more attention than I did
2762,what?
2763,"Awww, He's adorable"
2764,as boring as English if I have to stay awake so does he. im not helping him with his essays
2765,"Idk fam, if I was the professor teaching the class, the cat is getting an A+"
2766,Your cat is my spirit animal
2767,And r/cats too
2768,it was an interesting read. it was about this man who used to be a superintendent at the organ state penitentiary and he was the one that planned and carried out the states only executions in the last 54 years (from when this was written). he goes on to talk about his childhood and how he thought the death penalty was appropriate then. He then had to watch Douglas Wright and Harry Moore be killed since he could not refuse to not be apart of the punishment since he was the boss. now he's against capital punishment and tries to convince people that its a failed policy
2769,"My brothers cat helped me with mine. I left my laptop open and I came back to him walking all over it. Unfortunately I don't think the wise words ""adgsnejman"" are going to help me get that A, but at least he tried."
2770,"I‚Äôm not a psych major, I‚Äôm Philosophy and Religious Studies. I always have to tell people about my law school plans or I risk judgement :("
2771,"""What I learned from executing two men. "" 

Hmmmm interesting. Well let's find out."
2772,nah. im a nursing major forced to take an English class
2773,nah I don't think so. he came out of the closet a few days ago..
2774,"As a non-STEM major, this makes me quite butthurt."
2775,"aww how cute, my cat bites my laptop :)"
2776,Wtf
2777,Where has it guided you?
2778,honestly thats what attracted me to him love me a man with facial hair üòÜ
2779,"To my bed, but I have my book beside me"
2780,thank you üòÅ
2781,It's r/college. It's meant for advice and other misc. Look somewhere else for a sugar daddy
2782,The important question is he a heterosexual cat?
2783,I love his tiny mustache!
2784,"Aww. I love him! He looks so much like my little guy (tuxedo with a little mustache, I‚Äôve posted a pic somewhere). Hope he keeps your spirits up while you work!"
2785,Could u tell me which book is that.. looks interesting
2786,omg your cat just has longer hair!
2787,oh its my text box for school
2788,"i thought we were talking about going to college, not my usual Tuesday"
2789,I boo hoo‚Äôd off and on for a week after I got dropped off at college.  Totally normal.  It will stop once you start making friends...or you will find a group of friends who will cry with you.  Enjoy your first semester!!!
2790,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
2791,"Aww, I cried a little too (and I still shed a few tears whenever my parents drop me off). You‚Äôre embarking on a big change, but I‚Äôm sure lots of other people feel the same! For me, once I started with my classes and got to meet more people, I didn‚Äôt feel so homesick anymore."
2792,You're gonna be ok kid. You've got heart. Try to have a good time on this new ride ‚úåÔ∏èüïäÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2793,"Yes! Your heartbreak will end. You will still miss your parents but you'll cry a little less each day. Over time, you'll adapt to your new situation and find things that excite you and make you happy which will override your grief. You're one of the people brave enough to admit you're homesick and you're not the only one.  You'll make it!"
2794,"Depends on the person and the relationship they have with their parents. 

Personally, I only cried the first night and after that I was fine because I realized it was better to not be around them.

You seem to have a closer relationship with your parents so you being more upset makes sense. Be sure to call and text often if you want to keep them updated and know you will see them again. The first semester goes by faster than you'd expect"
2795,Ha ha ha üòâ yeah safe to say I could have handled move in a little better.
2796,I‚Äôm a senior this year and I still sob every time I leave. change is scary and new! but college is such an AWESOME change. worth all the tears!!
2797,"Meet people virtually this semester, unfortunately...."
2798,"Most people get better after a week or so of being around new people and such. You likely will get better too.

&#x200B;

I never really cried over it."
2799,No ‚ù§Ô∏è
2800,"Yeah I‚Äôm pretty distant with my parents, mainly my father, because it‚Äôs pretty suffocating living under their roof and dealing with his toxic behavior. I saw parents hugging their children one last time, lots of crying and cheek kissing, meanwhile my mom wanted to say goodbye one last time whereas my father, from inside the car, yelled at her to hurry up. They weren‚Äôt in a rush, he‚Äôs just impatient. I was dropped off just like if they dropped me off at a friend‚Äôs house, except with more texting and check-ins afterwards.


When you‚Äôre constantly walking on eggshells and yelling and arguing is a common occurrence in your household, you don‚Äôt cry when you start college. You celebrate because that‚Äôs when you can finally start living. That was my experience, at least."
2801,"yeah, I cried myself to sleep. It goes away eventually. But also watch for something stressful that will start the crying back up for a couple hours during the middle of the semester. That's what happened to me rip."
2802,"I can see this as completely normal, but my Mom and Dad and I never saw eye to eye on the things that mattered.

Don't get me wrong, they wanted me to go to college. And I figured I would. But there weren't really a lot of tears to be shed. 

Good luck on your new adventure though! Make friends and have fun! Or at least, as fun as quarantine can be lol."
2803,[deleted]
2804,Breaking: person is upset because I deeply love and miss my parents
2805,"It's normal to cry a lot whenever you have a huge change in your life.

It's also normal not to cry at all or feel nothing or be excited by everything going on right now.  You're a human and we all have different ways of dealing with  change."
2806,"Im the most insensitive person , 22 year old, I didn't even left home yet and still cried like a bitch."
2807,because I would like to know if any other people felt the same ‚ù§Ô∏è
2808,who hurt you?
2809,"I cried like a little bitch when my daddy dropped me off. It‚Äôs perfectly normal to be homesick, sad and missing your parents. But just know that this is a new chapter in your life that is going to be filled with lots of fun! <3"
2810,Because I would like to know if other people felt the same?
2811,[deleted]
2812,Let me be real with you: my freshman year I was okay for the first couple of weeks. Then all of a sudden on a weekend I got hit with a wave of homesickness that had me crying. I called my dad and couldn‚Äôt even talk because I was feeling so overwhelmed. But that cry really did me good. I actually felt a lot better afterwards. Let yourself feel what you feel.
2813,"I'm sorry but I screamed at yacht club I'm so poor

I hope you'll feel better soon op"
2814,Why be sexist when you can just not?
2815,"I cried myself to sleep every night for a week, it‚Äôs definitely normal"
2816,"When my mom dropped me off at college I went out to my car and cried for like 15 minutes. When I came back in I said to myself ‚Äúokay, on to a new adventure‚Äù. It feels really uncomfortable now because you‚Äôre in a space that you feel doesn‚Äôt belong to you. In a few weeks you will look back and think, ‚Äúwhen did this place start feeling like home?‚Äù. 

Best of luck üíï"
2817,Cry cuz Covid is going to kill everyone in the dorms
2818,"One thing I‚Äôve learned as someone who is very quiet and used to be afraid of being judged is that whatever is said in the class stays in the class, no one really cares too much in the end to judge you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to speak out"
2819,And all I get is a ‚ÄúOK. *Sent from my iPhone.*‚Äù
2820,correction: everything that is said in class stays in class unless you're an asshole
2821,trust me; don't. I used to sweat all the time about that stuff but ever since I've completely stopped caring and began asking the stupidest of questions I've obviously began doing better and my mental health is way better off too
2822,"Not everything that is said in class stays in class. 

There was this kid that was complaining during a discussion about school parking and his (serious) solution was to get rid of the handicap parking spots because, and I quote, ""handicap people can't drive, why do they need spots"" he got blasted all over social media for saying that. We have a sizable population of handicap people at our school, those spots are always full."
2823,"That's exactly how I am. In fact, the other day I was just silently scolding myself for speaking so much because I felt like I wasn't giving him the answers he wanted ( but it's a sociology course so there are so many different interpretations of the readings). When I got this message I genuinely thought he sent it to the wrong student or something ahahaha. He's amazing and I needed this message so much."
2824,"Aren't these types of profs the best? There's this prof, he's a goofy suburban dad, like this overexcitable collie dog, he's self-taught in our major which usually requires a masters'. He went back to uni in his forties so he could teach my major. He's the first prof you meet as his course is the prerequisite to every course in our major, and I'm so glad for that. Any class he teaches, I sign right up.

I'm extremely introverted but had to give a massive group presentation and facilitate a discussion in his class yesterday, this is heavy stuff. During the discussion, someone asked me a question, I realized that this is the stuff people get cancelled for, like veering one inch on one side or the other could cancel me. I tried to answer it as diplomatically as possible but by the end, I was kicking my tires over answering it at all. Then, two hours later, I noticed a Canvas notification and it was a personal message from this prof and it said :

""Hey Erik, I just wanted to thank you for your fantastic presentation! You clearly read up on the topics at hand and knew what you were talking about. Great job as always!"" And, I just calmed right down."
2825,"Awwww this is super sweet!  As a professor, I can‚Äôt tell you how much better class is with students who contribute.  I really love my subject matter, so it‚Äôs not surprising I love to talk about it and I love to hear my students perspectives on it, even if it‚Äôs different than my own.  I had an awesome group of freshman this past fall that had great opinions and talked up and they said they liked the class better too when everyone talked and shared.  It makes it more fun and engaging for everyone!  And being up there and getting blank stares from kids is just death."
2826,"It helps me to remember that there are always audience members who are looking up to the speaker for being brave enough to speak in front of a crowd, because they too have anxiety. When I have to present something in front of an audience I try to think of those people instead of those who would judge my speech skills."
2827,"They are rare, but yes - they make the experience well worthwhile!"
2828,"I'm currently a junior in high school with severe social anxiety, and I'd like to ask you a question about having anxiety¬†in college. I realize I'm still in high school, but I'd like to start feeling more at ease around others and express myself more without being afraid of being the center of attention. How do you do it? Any words of advice? I'd like to get more involved and express myself as much as possible because I know college is a very social environment."
2829,"I'm the same. I often knew the answer or what to respond to but was afraid to say something just in case I was wrong or, like you say, sounded stupid."
2830,nah there's this one cunt in our class (who unfortunately is the popular kid..) who does that type o stuff. Seeing him stumped at my attitude towards it is always funny though
2831,"My professor is also super passionate about his subject, and I am too. It makes for a really interesting class and it's definitely my favorite class I'm taking this semester! I wish I could award this professor somehow genuinely. I'd send a message to the dean or something if that was something people did."
2832,"Not the OP but they may have a diagnosed or undiagnosed anxiety disorder.  I have generalized anxiety disorder and it is not fun (I take medication for it now but before I was on meds I was in rough shape).  GAD is just having way too much anxiety for normal things, like your body is in fight or flight all the damn time.  I thought everyone had a constant feeling of dread until I finally started seeing a therapist in college.  I found out in my early 20s that it‚Äôs definitely not normal to throw up every morning before work.  I asked my therapist once why I was like this (like is it nature or nurture) and I don‚Äôt think there is a good answer yet, but some sort of perfect storm of the two.  But there is absolutely a brain chemistry component to it.  I have a very low Xanax rx for anxiety attacks and I can take one and it will just lower my heart rate a bit where as my bf takes one and goes right to sleep!"
2833,I definitely will do this. I'll be sure to leave him a detailed review and the highest rating everywhere. I'm also gonna review him on RateMyProfessor even tho I never leave reviews there. A lot of students I cluding myself do all use that and I want everyone to know he's great.
2834,bro
2835,"I would SOB omg, i love this!!"
2836,I wish I had money to buy an award for you. üëäüèª
2837,This is awesome!
2838,"Wholesome af. I've only had a few professors like this, but damn did they make a difference."
2839,This is amazing!
2840,"Life tip: keep a file of these kinds of messages. They come in so handy when you're having a bad day or a few bad weeks and feel like nothing you do is good enough or recognized. Many people don't say things like this but think it or comment to someone else about how great you are.

Also, please make a habit of doing this for others. You know how much it means to receive words of encouragement and it takes no effort to share the love with someone else. 

My current job is the only place I have ever received such amazing feedback like this and from so many different people. I let people know how much I appreciate their kind words and that they mean so much that I save them so I can read them on bad days. It reminds me that I'm not incompetent, no matter how much I feel like I am, and I do belong there."
2841,Teachers like this deserve the world
2842,"Reward them by completing the course review at the end of the semester.  I can say the percentage of students who do the course reviews is very low and it tends to be the students who have something to complain about.  Students who fill it out and give me all good scores usually don‚Äôt leave a comment.  At most schools, student comments are pulled and put in a teachers yearly review.  So especially if this professor is going up for tenure soon, you would really help him out by writing honest feedback on his performance and how he‚Äôs helped you improve when that time of the year comes!"
2843,This is how all teachers should be! He is amazing we need more or these guys. I‚Äôm majoring in special education so I want to make sure all my students feel valued. I think that all teachers should send out individual emails or letters to students. It makes them more confident and feel proud of themselves. If I got a email like this I‚Äôd be so happy and excited for class everyday.
2844,**You are lucky to have such professors.**
2845,"I‚Äôm taking a data journalism class that‚Äôs really stressing me out. I‚Äôve been working with the professor to improve, but I still feel bad for not being as good at the class work as I‚Äôd like to be. Last week, she sent me an email congratulating me for doing a good job in class and for working hard. She‚Äôs probably my favorite professor right now."
2846,"It's not a choice to have anxiety lol

Some people are diagnosed with GAD or Social anxiety Disorder,  it really affects everyone differently, for some people it can become more severe and go into agoraphobia (that also isn't a choice, it's one of the most stressful & annoying things to go through).

Some things that cause anxiety are: chemical imbalance in the brain, or it can stem from childhood abuse/neglect. Or it can be caused by different sorts of trauma, it can be passed through genes and even other unrelated medical issues.

Hope that helps a little! :)"
2847,I wish I was good lol. I'm struggling to pay attention in class and do my homework. I get distracted very easily.
2848,"One to hug, one to yell at, one to cry too, one to tell your secrets.. am I missing any others?"
2849,Get 2 of each so they can take shifts. Therapy bear for the others to talk to if they have a bad day. One to sleep with for night protection. One for motivation and tough love. One who just likes cuddles. Anything else?
2850,"Honestly, college students have more stuffed animals then anyone I‚Äôve ever seen before. My stuffed dragon and shark are currently on my bed as we speakü•∞"
2851,Well it looks like you're all packed up!
2852,"Great, you're already ahead by having a trusted friend!"
2853,"My college gave out free stuffed animals on earth day and there was a line of hundreds of students waiting when I got there before they even opened and more kept coming, I got a tiger to go along with the owl and dog I brought lol"
2854,"Only the essentials, of course!"
2855,I'm sure there's others' who can help out...
2856,"That is so cute, I might pitch it to my school! College is stressful, the best thing ever is hugging your favorite stuffed animal after a long day in class! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever leave them at home, they‚Äôre definitely coming to law school with me lol"
2857,This is a support system there packing up. Friends and confidants. But the walrus definitely will get you laid.
2858,I brought like 5 stuffed animals and I didn‚Äôt regret it a single bit
2859,One to explain class concepts to and practice your presentations with.
2860,"It‚Äôs important to SEAL your boxes well. 

(Yes I know it‚Äôs a walrus but I couldn‚Äôt resist)"
2861,I love my BL√ÖHAJ :)
2862,"62, one for each arm."
2863,One to yell/scream/vent frustrations into?
2864,"I brought my pillow pets and they were helpful for propping me up while I did homework in bed!

My mom also told me not to bring my monkey blanket. I did and it came very useful when the heating stopped working one nigh in the middle of December in Massachusetts!"
2865,I took my graduation teddy bear with me to college too. It helped the first few days when the homesickness kicked in.
2866,"One for every day, so 31 of them is ok."

2876,Absolutely.
2877,I have that Walrus!!! (Mine‚Äôs name is Wally of course!)
2878,My professor messed up entering my grade and I currently have a 340% in the class. I assume it will be fixed but I'm weighing the benefits of gambling that it isn't.
2879,"I got an A for a gym class in highschool that I never took. Didn't say shit, graduated without taking that required class."
2880,Don‚Äôt say shit and let them fix their own mistake
2881,"I had a professor like that over the summer, we had to do every single homework to take the quiz, had to do every quiz to take the projects, and had to do every project to take the exams.
Basically, if you didn‚Äôt follow the flow of events, you didn‚Äôt pass"
2882,"Some of my students need to do this, because they don't seem to get how skipping an assignment worth 40% of their grade isn't a good idea."
2883,Yes for my math class I just need a B grade on all my tests. I can basically just not do my homework and my quizzes and I will still finish the class with a B. The homework almost counts for nothing and their aren‚Äôt enough quizzes left to really impact my grade.
2884,Sometimes that bare minimum to pass is what you need. You're almost doneee if that's any consolation
2885,There is one impostor among us
2886,"I calculate my grade all the time, and teach others to do it too. Doing it out myself actually helps keep me motivated and see how much I need to care on assignments to pass."
2887,Oh yeah. Canvas‚Äôs what-if grade feature has been my go-to
2888,"My fiance had something similar happen, she even message the professor about it and he never fixed it. She finished stats with a 110%"
2889,A better feeling is realizing you only need a C on the Final to get an A in the class
2890,"Yes! I had to take a stupid gen ed health class last semester. It seriously had more homework and tests than my physics and 2 different math classes combined. I was just so done by midterms.

This semester I tried my best to keep up with everything until the last 2 weeks. Then I calculate the bare minimum grade I need to still end up with C's. It takes soo much pressure off when I know I only need a 30% on the final to still pass the class."
2891,I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy all of the required homework platforms so I just skipped the ones for classes where homework only counts for 1-5% of your grade. Saved at least $100.
2892,The teacher looking at guy who started on day 2: *I'm 4 parallel universes ahead of you*
2893,I can't do it. Fills me up with too much anxiety and guilt
2894,Isn't that the best feeling? Realizing you need sub 50 on a final to stay above a C
2895,I always use the rapid tables grade calculator that makes it super easy you just plug the numbers in and it does the math for you
2896,"Dang, that's horrible."
2897,You‚Äôre a mad man
2898,A better feeling is showing up to the final and only having to write your name on it.
2899,"Catch me out here doing the math to see if I can get away with not turning in an oral exam worth 5% of my gradeüòÇ

Grade is 82, 5% is like 4 points, yup, I can pass with a 78üòÇ"
2900,"Did this with a paper for one of my classes, figured I could still get an A even if I didn't turn it in. Regretting it now because I have a group assignment worth the same amount of points where no one is communicating with each other so I could've skipped this had I done my paper üôÉ"
2901,"Yes. I graduated with a 2.4 I think? Maybe less. But guess what!? I still found a job. I still make a lot of money. I have worked most of my life, I interview well and perform well at tasks that I am focused on.

In school my focus was not to get good grades. My focus was to graduate. And I did! C‚Äôs (sometimes even a D) gets degrees. 

Everyone does their own thing and finds their own motivation. I would not recommend my method if you are not me."
2902,"I'm sorry, homework platforms? You had to pay to in order to do your homework?"
2903,Dude just google how to calculate weighted average
2904,Some professors are cheeky like that but this guy dosent give a fuck

2906,[deleted]
2907,"All the time. In high school it made me de-stress and feel good. I was all like ""Ah shit I need a 50% on my english final to keep an A, better study.""

""I thought I was passing?"""
2922,I thought there was gonna be a scale
2923,I'll allow it 
2924,For the win
2925,Good meme
2926,Would you be willing to let us read it? I love some good collegiate level BS
2927,This is gonna be meee pretty soon
2928,Probably because you have standards
2929,English is my second language and i am fuming at this. I could never write 22 page paper in just 4 hour. Lol
2930,"reminds me of the time I wrote 8 pages of a research essay 1 hour before the class started. I got a low A but an A's an A!

Don't try this though it could be risky

edit: I already had the works cited and intro ready so it wasn't like i started a blank piece of paper."
2931,"Yes please give an update. Either way, you wrote 22 pages in FOUR HOURS. Even if it was dog shit, I couldn‚Äôt stretch out dog shit for 22 pages. Give yourself a Pat on the back my friend."
2932,Could be risky to upload due to turnitin/plagiarism screening. Would probably be smart to post as a screenshot
2933,"This will be me soon too, 4 hours before deadline. But for now, time to continue relaxing"
2934,Either your teacher has some shitty grading standards or you are a literal demigod.
2935,"If i write complete non sense i still wouldn't have 4 pages
I meant 22 wtt"
2936,Shit like this is how I got my English degree (with nearly all As) üòÇ
2937,Yuuup. In all reality this person wrote 22 pages of mediocre (or less than mediocre) work.
2938,I'd rather get a C on something I'm not proud of than an F because I didn't turn anything in
2939,It's all about that good ‚ú®self-care‚ú®
2940,OP can just upload it after it was graded
2941,"I had to do the science behind this.....

So given that it is an academic paper it‚Äôs most likely in double space so in total the man wrote 5,500 words and the average wpm is 41.4. I can say it is possible since someone would theoretically need 132 minutes to finish it though more likely achieved through 110% brain dead focus on the paper."
2942,what was the paper about?
2943,"I mean I already had the introduction and works cited ready, all I needed was the literature review, discussion and conclusion. Somehow I managed to pull it off. 

And no I don't think my professor has bad standards in grading, since I've heard of other students with tough grades from that same class. 

I'll never do this again though because I feel that if I attempted this I'd get cocky and fail."
2944,"You submitted it and that's the important part! So many people just decide to take a 0, but points are still points that will add up at the end! Good job, even if it's bad it's better than nothing every time :)"
2945,"So what? Done is better than a zero, yes?"
2946,"I'm not an english major but so far this is what i've been doing. i was lucky my highschool trained us to write fast in short amounts of time, ive been using this skill for college"
2947,"Oh absolutely I will accept it. I deserve it. And not at all, I love this professor- he‚Äôs actually been my favorite this semester. He‚Äôs a really nice guy which makes me feel even worse about the paper."
2948,"My issue with writing papers is just getting past that initial insurmountable wall where you feel like you can't think of anything to write down. Once you bash your head against that wall enough to break through, it's not so bad but it basically ruins a couple of my days every time I have to start a longer more research based essay."
2949,"Same, lol. At my best, I was able to crank out a page an hour in school. And I was crying the whole time. Then again, there was a lot of crying in grad school."
2950,"I‚Äôm thinking about getting out of that mentality now that it‚Äôs almost my 4th year. It‚Äôs hard for me to write complete crap, like my papers need to be top quality (for me, fuck everybody else), so I either do the whole assignment and submit it late like always lmao or I don‚Äôt do anything. I know it‚Äôs not a good mindset to have but idk how to write crap and then have the audacity to submit it. This is only for papers of course, if it‚Äôs math or random hmwk questions I don‚Äôt care but not for papers"
2951,Bruh this the type of adrenaline and shit we all feel at the end of the semester. üòÇ Either do it or fail. Goodjob making the cut! You got this!
2952,!remindme 2 weeks
2953,"I have a few degrees (2 more in science, one in business), but it is a useful skill for any of them. I also have my high school to thank for developing it, and depending on what field you go into, you may use it there, too.

And I‚Äôm in publishing now, so it all worked out."
2954,Second this!
2955,They can still get in trouble since some schools have an intellectual property clause in their handbooks.
2956,"My college would bring in puppies from a shelter once a semester. They would bring in many different puppies that had these 'shifts' to take them back to the shelter once they got all tuckered out and bring in the next round. They aren't doing it this year because of covid since most of the learning is now online. I loved it, and then some of the puppies would find forever homes!

And even people I know would bring in their normal dogs to school when they didn't have class so we could have a de-stress moment before classes. I remember campus police would come by but as long as the animals made no messes in the lounge, we could keep bringing them. Ugh, I miss how it was before."
2957,Well yes but it‚Äôs very low (2% of the 260 tested last week and those people and their roommates are now quarantining). We have a lot of guidelines and regulations to allow us to be on campus. Class room sizes are smaller. Seats and  common areas have marked off seats for people to be able to sit six feet apart. Masks are required at all times. Etc etc. There‚Äôs a lot but it seems to be working.
2958,"My school did that as well during midterms and finals. And they also had a group of therapy dogs that would be in the student center, library and grass areas for students to come and visit. They would be there every day during finals and midterm week and students would literally go chill with them for hours it was awesome."
2959,Is there no COVID where you go to school?
2960,Probably what they actually need is proper stress relief counselling for students.
2961,I hope my college will be like that
2962,"We had the puppies at our college the week before finals. I only went one year (that building was centrally located on campus, but pretty inconvenient to my schedule most years), but it really was nice to chill out. I also met a couple of people outside my major and had conversations not to do with class or internships, which was rare at that stressful time."
2963,Lucky. We have all those measures but our cases are still ridiculously high. I wanna cuddle a bunny
2964,My college did this but with chickens... wasn't nearly as effective.
2965,"Hey guys. Went to sleep and woke up to see this exploded. Thank you for the rewards. And I‚Äôm glad to be able to provide some free therapy/serotonin to all of you. 

I did want to apologize for my poor choice of words. When I said put him down, I meant put him back down on the ground in the pen, not euthanize him. I didn‚Äôt think that was confusing when I typed it out, but should‚Äôve thought about how others would‚Äôve read it. So I‚Äôm sorry about that. :)"
2966,"You said put him down and I worried for a second you were gonna,,.... you know,...."
2967,This bunny is so cute! Good luck with your studies
2968,Serotonin levels just got a boost because of this pic. So adorable!
2969,Don‚Äôt apologize. Some people are just looking to be aggrieved. It was clear to those of use who understand context that your stress relieving snuggle bunny moment wasn‚Äôt going to end with a dead rabbit.
2970,Hi. It wasn‚Äôt a permanent thing. Just that one day. And then the zoo left.
2971,this is the best free therapy
2972,My college didn‚Äôt (doesn‚Äôt) have a petting zoo but a bunch of profs have dogs plus people who live nearby walk their dogs through campus so we got to pet so many dogs randomly throughout the semester. One dog and her owners even brought a basket of chocolates for us for Valentine‚Äôs Day
2973,Hahahaha putting down an animal means euthanizing it. Caption confused a couple folks
2974,Awww!!!
2975,"Oh my gosh, his ears are so fwoppy!"
2976,"Meanwhile, my school is all like ""oh you're struggling with classes and covid? I'll let you take a class pass/fail as long as it's not required for your major or to graduate."""
2977,Thank you. Senior research is a lot.
2978,i love chickens but i understand not everyone likes them. chickens can also be a little mean especially if they are hens
2979,aww that's so cute
2980,Thank you.
2981,"Thanks! I'm lucky that I can prob take my math pass/fail but I'll be talking to mr pre major advisor on Monday. It's not going well and I was lowkey wondering if college is even for me. Told my dad and he said to take it pass/fail. Luckily most of the professors here seem to be pretty good, it's just the administration that sucks"
2982,"Probably. I know my school kept remodeling random crap I didn't care about. As long as it didn't give me cancer or lead poisoning and had proper heating/cooling, classes could have been in a neon pink log cabin for all I cared."
2983,"When I was in preschool, there was a reoccurring program where kittens and bunnies would be brought and we could pet/play with them, I wish my school had that now! Honestly probably more helpful now than ever lmao"
2984,ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
2985,"My college teachers brought in their dogs most days to class, they'd just jump onto your table whenever they wanted for belly scratches and naps. It was great, I miss that."
2986,Oh god-I can totally see my parents doing this. Ugh.
2987,"Professor here. I had a parent come to my office and demand to see the students grades. I explained it was a FERPA violation. They tried the old ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs in high school, this is a duel credit course‚Äù thing, and I had to explain that it doesn‚Äôt matter, I teach a COLLEGE class, I am still bound by FERPA. 

She left in a huff.

The student came by later after he found out and apologized for his mom. I assured him there was no need to apologize. Funny part was he was making an A in my class. He was just trying to help relax the massive control she had on his life I guess. She seemed the control freak type. He said she had approached ALL of his professors after me and we all told her the same lol. We aren‚Äôt idiots."
2988,"Not to mention there's not much legally the professor can say to the parent, as they don't own the educational record anymore, the student does."
2989,"As a Veteran, I just want to tell you that you're a fucking idiot."
2990,Yeah staff contact information is pretty easy to find on school websites ‚òπÔ∏è
2991,[removed]
2992,"Parent here. I'm here for guidance if needed. If my kids want advice or need assistance, they will ask. Quite possibly my ex has contacted the school and/or teachers as her default setting is *overbearing*, but that's out of my control.

I open up the dialog on how school is going; issues, concerns etc and if they don't express the need for assistance, then I'm good."
2993,Yes I find that college even though people are adults they still act like children it's like college is just an extension for high school for some when in reality its not
2994,"How would that help national survival? Have you seen our military? And as per usual the rich kids will find their way out of mandatory service so only the lower class will get screwed, just like in Vietnam"
2995,"controlling parents exist. you can try as much as you can in this situation, but certain parents will do questionable things just to retain some form of dominance on the student/child. so you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúget your parents in line.‚Äù"
2996,"Shame on parents for contacting the professor.  If the student is in college they are meant to be an adult.  They can learn to address their own problems.

This has been my biggest gripe with dual enrollment kids.  They are still kids.  They don't have the maturity that college demands."
2997,There are people that do this? I'm suffering from severe second hand embarrassment at the moment.
2998,"Yeah my dad did this it was really embarrassing because he even called the wrong advisor, once he told me that he called them"
2999,"Even if they ask for your help, if they are in college, your answer should be ""you need to handle this yourself."" Go ahead and share your thoughts but don't insert yourself in any way at their college."
3000,Sounds like something freshman year of college could handle.
3001,Hey bud. Asthmatic college student here. This is a terrible idea.
3002,Sorry man that‚Äôs all around a bad idea
3003,"This! The school is legally sanctioned from sharing anything academic with anyone but the student assuming they're 18. Each of the schools I went to had very clear policies on this, one of them even going as far as barring parents from program/financial adviser meetings."
3004,Do you actually think that taking an 18 year old and sticking them behind a desk (the same thing they'll be doing after college) is a decent solution? What high school student irritated you in college that much?
3005,"I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre applying your situation to everyone else... the only way to get my controlling parents to stop doing shit like this was by going no contact with them and I haven‚Äôt spoken to them in years. 

Most college kids need to rely on their parents at least a bit, and some parents won‚Äôt just ‚Äúget in line‚Äù.

edit: all that being said though, there should be rules against info being released, and if any college student is worried about parents speaking with professors, they should inform the school that they don‚Äôt consent to their information being released. And talk to professors and let them know that you have asked your parents to stop contacting people at the school.

second edit: I‚Äôm also not advising people to just automatically go no contact with their parents... my parents were abusive as well as controlling, and I made sure I was in a financially stable situation. I had to put off going to college for a couple years, so it‚Äôs most definitely NOT a decision to be taken lightly. 

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is that some parents may ‚Äúbutt out‚Äù after a simple conversation, and some parents will only get off your back when you move halfway across the country and cut all ties with anyone you knew... it‚Äôs a different situation for everyone."
3006,"You can confirm information that is publicly available. I've have to take the FERPA test for employees every year for over 18 years now. Sometimes it's really put to the test. I've had a mother the parking lot of a dorm crying her eyes out, because her son wouldn't respond or talk to her at all. She knew his dorm room. She paid the bills. She had all the information, but still, I could not let her into that building. I did make a compromise, however. I went onto that floor and made a general announcement that there was a woman outside desperately looking for their son, and that if they chose to do so, whoever that son should happen to be, they might want to look into responding. 

Many parents try to argue ""But I pay the bills, I pay tuition!"" which is nice and all, but still doesn't obligate us to give you any information about your adult children that are enrolled. Stop the funding if you feel that's appropriate, but we still cant tell you their grades, or their absences."
3007,"> But I pay the bills, I pay tuition!

Yep. FERPA is literally there to protect students from exactly this. In the same way, HIPPA is there to protect people from their employers saying 'but I pay for the health plan, I get to see their medical records'."
3008,"This is an absurd comment about dual enrollment kids.

In my area it is very common for high school kids to be concurrently enrolled in community college classes and in my experience they are usually the best students. Most of them are used to rigorous coursework so a CC class is less work for them than an AP or IB class, they are used to going to class so they actually attend and do the work required.  I always make room for concurrent enrollment students because they don‚Äôt drop the class when work is required."
3009,"I think that is a big and unfair assumption to make about all dual enrollment students. It is true for some but I wouldn't generalize. I went to a high school where everyone did dual enrollment and we were all fine and talked to professors on our own.

I have met college students older than me that are more immature than high schoolers. Age has nothing to do with it unfortunately"
3010,Sounds like they should join the football team
3011,It may be a FERPA violation to even respond at all to certain questions.
3012,"\*Any questions. We can't even confirm if a student is in a class, or even at the institution without documentation/waivers."
3013,"Sure, but only if we take the power to deploy troops during peacetime away from the president.

I don't have a problem with learning discipline, but I do have a problem with killing kids so rich fucks can get richer.

Hope you think this over before you SIMP for Bezos and billionaires..."
3014,[FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html)
3015,"Yeah, definitely no high school behavior in boots. Not like they're notorious for irresponsible purchases or marriages. You are incredibly naive."
3016,"Also, please go like my post on [@purduetrashion](https://www.instagram.com/p/CN07_PklI9o/?igshid=o52bursp9erg) (insta)! The most likes gets a guaranteed A+ on the project‚ô•Ô∏è"
3017,I‚Äôll let my girlfriend know you said that. She modeled for me haha
3018,Took the comment from my fingers üòè
3019,I quickly looked at your username and read it in my head as ‚Äúart is my chlamydia‚Äù
3020,Just did! Thanks ‚ô•Ô∏è
3021,Everyone best be cautious of the May Queen here. She'll put you in a bear suit and burn you alive.
3022,For sure!
3023,I feel like the top most skirt is making the dress feel overly formal because it‚Äôs covering the whole shoulders while being very close to the neck. Just a bit of criticism
3024,"Nothing to do with Mexican style dresses, actually was inspired more by the movie Midsommar. For my class, we were supposed to make a piece of wearable art of found materials. I used bedsheets, artificial flowers, bbq skewers, and pipe cleaners.  The work was supposed to be moreso a piece of art than a beautiful piece of clothing. Plus I got less than a week to work on it. I apologize if you do not like it"
3025,[deleted]
3026,Took the air to speak the comment straight out of my dorsally-vivisected wing lungs.
3027,Looks great on you
3028,I‚Äôm like #131. Hope you get a ton more so you can get that A+!
3029,100% a fair criticism. Made it easier to get the ruffles I wanted this way though
3030,No one cares. I'm Mexican born and raised and couldn't give less of a fuck. This dress looks nothing like traditional Mexican clothing and the fact that your first thought about Mexican style is Frida Kahlo is a little stereotypical.
3031,E+ for effort ‚ù§Ô∏è
3032,Imagine giving this much of a shit
3033,Thank you so much for the support! :)
3034,Awesome! Lowkey festival vibes. Hopefully the country finishes getting vaccinated by the summer
3035,Knew i wasn't the only one.
3036,Very cute!
3037,Cute! üå∏
3038,Very pretty!
3039,Yes hello finaid office? Give this person all the scholarship money
3040,Very gorgeous. This pic belongs in a magazine or a museum :)
3041,Girl. Seriously. You've posted this to TEN different subs now. Time to take a breather.
3042,Wowww!!!
3043,So springy! Love it!
3044,"This is sooooo dope!!! Not exactly it, but I thought this was r/cottagecore at first!!!"
3045,May Queen?
3046,I haven‚Äôt had friends since I started college and the pandemic hasn‚Äôt helped at all. It‚Äôs a horrible feeling to be alone.
3047,"we all got covid going on init, so dating opportunities (unless you use apps) is pretty thin on the ground atm. when things ease up, maybe then it's the time to literally put yourself out there - like literally try new things. fucking turn up to a gig for some rando music you don't know and just vibe bro"
3048,"I‚Äôm only 19, but yeah I‚Äôm totally in the same boat. It‚Äôs so hard meeting people nowadays, even being in the dorms and everything."
3049,i‚Äôm 19 and i haven‚Äôt even had a kiss. Rice purity score is about 90 :(
3050,Same here girl... 20 years old and the farthest I‚Äôve gotten w a guy is a kissüò≠
3051,"At 21 I was dating my ex. I felt like you, I felt like i was running out of time so since I was already dating him I didn‚Äôt want to start all over again. Let me tell you, that whole mindset was a mistake. I would have stayed unhappy. 

It took me until 24 to meet the man that I want to be with forever. We‚Äôve been together 4 years next month. Still not married or have kids but I realized that I would rather wait for the right one then settle for the wrong one early. 

My point is. You‚Äôre not running out of time. You‚Äôre just waiting for your person."
3052,"Although it sucks, seriously don‚Äôt worry about it. You‚Äôre all still so young. Even if you were 28 and graduating college I‚Äôd STILL say you‚Äôre all so young and shouldn‚Äôt worry. People like to gauge their life progress off of others and what people their age are doing but honestly, just do you. It‚Äôs a cliche but true. I went all through my high school career, military career and then college career without having a single girlfriend. Time just wasn‚Äôt right and I just never got around to it. Eventually the time will come and the best advice I can give you is to just be patient. Don‚Äôt rush something that shouldn‚Äôt be rushed."
3053,"Same here, it really sucks"
3054,"Lol I'm 19 and never been kissed either and can't remember the last time I even talked to a guy in person

edit: Rice purity score is 96 -\_-"
3055,"I‚Äôm going to a new college in sept 2021, and it sucks I only got to spend a few months at my current community college before it went online because the library was awesome there."
3056,I don‚Äôt even know what my university‚Äôs library looks like lmao
3057,"Yes it fucking sucks. Especially attending community college where it‚Äôs hard to interact with people & make friends to begin with. I‚Äôve been using dating apps (mostly Tinder) lately and you‚Äôd think with this pandemic causing a lack of in-person socialization opportunities that it would be easier to meet people through there but it‚Äôs not üòî 

I vowed to recreate my social life after high school while I‚Äôm in college but this pandemic has completely crushed my efforts. I‚Äôm soooo lonely"
3058,"I miss dressing up, doing my makeup, wearing cute clothes to school üòî that was literally like therapy for me honestly. 

I also miss seeing the international students showing up to 8 ams like its Milan fashion week"
3059,"I think perhaps many people don‚Äôt know how to be alone. Wanting to be with others is natural, but a fear of solitude is a different, self imposed sort of torture.

I always advised that people should learn how to be alone and single before getting into relationships, and this perhaps holds true here.

This is an opportunity to discover yourself, I imagine."
3060,Girl I'm 21 and not haven't had my first kiss lol
3061,"Honestly, I don't feel like the whole ""college is your last chance at dating"" statement is very true. Yeah, it's easier since you have a sea of young college kids that you can pick and choose at your disposal. But even after college, I feel like dating isn't diminished in the slightest. Hell, I feel as if it might be easier since there may be less drama and more and more people are seeking long-term and serious relationships.

Don't let the pandemic bring you down. If it makes you feel better, I'm 20 years old and I've never dated before. But use this time to work on yourself and be the best version of yourself that you can possibly be. Be the person that you would date. Whether it be picking up a new hobby, learning a new language, volunteering, or exercising and eating right, there are many things on this planet that you can do to improve yourself. I'm not saying you aren't already awesome, but be the best you can be is all I'm saying!

And please don't feel like you're in this rush to find a partner. It'll come. I promise you."
3062,"Feel the pain my dude. 

My life  at this point has been reduced to working night shift, sleeping, class work, watching anime/games, then going back to work ahaha. 

I am very lucky to have a job where I work with a lot of people, or else Id be kinda fucked on the social front of things."
3063,"This is exactly how I‚Äôm going about it. We can only control so much, so we may as well focus on making the most of those things. This is going to end eventually and we‚Äôll all be glad to get back to normal life. I think I‚Äôll definitely be putting myself out there more after all this"
3064,"Same :( I was really excited to take my new found confidence into college, and meet some people who are doing things with their lives. *Sigh*"
3065,I'm in a long distance relationship with a Canadian. Haven't been able to see them all year because the border is closed. It's hard not to be depressed.
3066,"As a 20 year old dude in the same situation, a relationship would be nice, but COVID and all...."
3067,"Geesh me too, I was able to think clearly away from home in an educational setting. At home all day in my bedroom, my brain is like ""what is an intelligent sentence? Can... Not... Compute""."
3068,21 and my senior year of high school i dated my best guy friend for like a month and then ended things because it was weird. then i had a few little things with guys where we talked and liked each other but literally never did anything bc i freaked out and decided to stay friends. every kiss i‚Äôve had in college was part of a game of truth or dare or something. literally i have no idea how to date someone lmao
3069,my heart <3
3070,"I'm 18 and a guy, RPS is an 87. Never even kissed a girl, and I feel like there's just so much I'm missing out on!"
3071,"My score is 98, do I win something?"
3072,"freshman here with no friends and no where near home alone in these shit dorms

i feel fantastic üôÉ"
3073,"Made a huge move for college so I did a lower amount of clubs and activities last year to deal with all the new things more easily. I made a few friends. But now fully digital means I can't do clubs or more social stuff like I told myself I would, so I'm not making more. Paired with my college friends all losing contact....very isolating. I'm basically only talking with my family and a few high school friends right now. I have always struggled to make friends so it's especially damaging to lose a whole group like that, small as it may have been."
3074,"look up ricepuritytest.com You basically lose points for doing anything sexual, drinking, smoking, illegal things etc. The higher your score, the more ‚Äúpure‚Äù you are. It‚Äôs kinda bs and it means nothing but it‚Äôs fun to compare"
3075,"Same, it really sucks"
3076,Well flashcards can take up alot of space and be kind of expensive. Also if you dont want to be flipping the cards all the time this can be used.
3077,Neat but wouldn‚Äôt flash cards be easier?
3078,"I just make quizlets and that works a bit easier than this. For me personally it helps most but by no means is it the only correct answer. What I like is that quizlets can quiz you and have engaging means of study as well. Not just quizzing. And that often, there‚Äôs a quizlet for your class. Depends on topic though. Cool suggestion"
3079,Quizlets take forever to make if you're not great at typing. Also some people don't learn best online like myself. I need the material physically infront of me to learn it.
3080,Aaaaanki
3081,I love anki too but sometimes it's nice to have something that's not digital
3082,"And the ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" board game, come to think of it there's a lot of board games using this."
3083,"Also you can just make the quizlet on a microsoft word doc. You just plan beforehand what symbols you will use to seperate the answers and questions. Like maybe you can use / or ; right before the start of a new question and tab for answers. When you‚Äôre done, you click on ‚Äúimport‚Äù in making a quizlet deck, copy and paste the doc and tell quizlet what symbols to look for. It will make the quizlet for you. The whole process takes 5 minutes to understand and make. 

I do this ALL the time. Doing it right now actually haha

In the end though, however you learn best is however you learn best. Good luck"
3084,Fully agree! I‚Äôm fully dependent on Anki myself but I‚Äôm also keeping a handwritten ‚Äúbook of knowledge‚Äù with the most important concepts and facts.

3088,"[Typing.com](https://www.typing.com/) is completely free and its where I learned how to type without looking at all. Did this back in high school. If you want to type much better, check it out. Believe me, its super good. It slowly introduces you to all the letters on the keyboard."
3089,Same! I have such a hard time studying on a computer.
3090,"Fun story. When I was in college (graduated 2015), I took a very difficult Intro to Western Philosophy class. The instructor assigned a lot of dense reading and it made preparing for the weekly quizzes and monthly exams tough. To make things easier for us, he allowed us to prepare a single 3x5 notecard for each exam. There were no limitations on what we could put on the 3x5, only that we had to make it ourselves. 

Flash forward to our final exam and the kid I'm sitting next to shows up wearing those 3D glasses that you would get at a movie theater. He had filled the 3x5 with information written once in red, and another time in blue with different, new information. When you looked at it without the glasses it was completely ineligible, but when you covered one eye you got half of the information. The instructor commended him on his ingenuity and allowed it. I can only imagine how far that kid has gone in life."
3091,I still can't learn will online. It sucks but having thr material physically infront of me helps me most
3092,"Username checks out. Also, Anki is the only way. It‚Äôs better than real flashcards, even."
3093,no?
3094,Or save yourself the ink and the paper and not do this

3096,Or save yourself time by not arguing with random strangers on reddit lol
3097,i thought everyone did this
3098,Ooh I like this better than flash cards
3099,No its like a divider for a binder to separate subjects or assignmen typeor even chapters. You can use anything like that but that is what I found cheap around me.
3100,Or save yourself the hassle and battery and do this.
3101,Last time i checked a pen and paper is less expensive than electricity... oh also last time o checked some people cant learn the best on quizlet (me including).. last time i checked it more time to type it out if you're not great at typing... last time i checked long time exposure to screens strain our eyes
3102,You're a fucking genius
3103,"Are you familiar with anki, it‚Äôs an flashcards app that uses spaced repetition in order to keep information in long term memory. Like you said in another post, it can be really time consuming much like quizlet. The drawback is that typing doesn‚Äôt really get the Information in writing does. I think a cool idea would be to write it down and practice the way you‚Äôre doing, and then eventually put them into anki if you want to remember it long term! I‚Äôm going to try your method out, thank you! üòÅ"
3104,"When I was in Japan, the Daiso store would sell these. I have a couple of these myself.

That was a lie but it got the professor to reevaluate their ""camera or fail"" stance"
3112,Not much you can do. Maybe email your professor a heads up in case they record and post the lecture online.

3122,It depends. A zoom call with 300 people shouldn‚Äôt be too bad. My zoom calls with 30 studenrs would show the professor‚Äôs screen and 5 other classmates. I never saw all my classmates at once so i‚Äôm assuming only a couple people saw you.
3123,"Definitely for the rest of the class, and maybe a few will recognize him on campus, but i think most will forget who it was in like a year even if they‚Äôll always remember the story. I can‚Äôt remember a single name of someone I only had class with once."
3124,it‚Äôs all over twitter bro i think cnn just picked it up too
3125,"i told my professor that last year and genuinely meant it (i was a nanny and was bottle feeding a 6 month old who i did not feel comfortable putting on a camera that was recording + feeding a baby in front of my classmates lol) 

in the last 15 minutes of class she told me that i wasn't allowed to tune into class from work and that she wouldn't give me any credit for attendance or group work i had done on that entire 2 hr zoom call. i had a meltdown that my poor roommate had to listen to when i got back from work lol."
3126,">in the last 15 minutes of class she told me that i wasn't allowed to tune into class from work and that she wouldn't give me any credit for attendance or group work i had done on that entire 2 hr zoom call

This seems illegal"
3127,"First thing I‚Äôd say to the next person I saw after that happened would be ‚Äúsome dude pulled his dick out on Zoom today.‚Äù Owning it is definitely the best advice, no use in pretending it wasn‚Äôt funny/significant to everyone who noticed."
3128,"i have no advice, but that's the most unfortunate thing i've ever heard in my life"
3129,"At this point, just own it. Yes, I AM the guy who's dick was on camera. Yes, I AM the guy who exposed myself to 300 people. Don't be ashamed-- you gave people something to talk about and probably tell their grandkids when they ask ""grandma, what's a Zoom?"". You're probably the most interesting thing that's happened to them in months, so just embrace it and make sure your camera is physically covered if you're gonna change in front of it again, just in case!"
3130,"Personally, I would just change my identity and move away far. But than again I literally don't speak, let alone move from my seat when I'm on zoom."
3131,"""lol you're the guy who showed his dick on Zoom.""

""Why do you care so much about my dick? You gay? Here's my number."""
3132,"Profs can consider attendance to be whatever they want. Same reason a professor can tell you not to use your phone in class and threaten points for doing so. 

And honestly professors dealt with a lot of shit and non-participation throughout covid so I don't blame them. It sucked being in online discussion-based classes without my classmates participating."

3135,Guy's name is Jeffrey Toobin.
3136,It‚Äôs crazy how many people here are so oblivious. The colleges don‚Äôt give a fuck about you and are sending you home after they get your money.
3137,My uni is actually planning to pivot online at Thanksgiving for the rest of the semester.
3138,I‚Äôm 99% sure we won‚Äôt make it to Thanksgiving without being kicked off campus
3139,"I'm a professor. I'm totally against ANYONE coming back to campuses in the fall. And the above statement is absolutely true. They don't care about the students, faculty, or staff. It's all a numbers game and it's got me seriously looking into moving out of academia all together."
3140,"My college has said they'll prorate room/board if we get sent home, which was a huge weight off my mind. It doesn't solve everything, because I absolutely will not make it if I have to do college while living with my mom again, but at least I'll get the money back."
3141,I‚Äôm pretty certain COVID will break out at a lot of college campuses. My hope is that universities will choose to keep students on campus as a sort of community quarantine as opposed to sending thousands of people who have been exposed to COVID back out to their communities at home
3142,"i've heard about unis saying in the housing agreement that they don't plan on refunding students if they're sent back home due to COVID, so you may want to check for that"
3143,I graduated highschool recently and all of my classmates keep saying they wanna go dorm and do in person classes. No one is mature and no one knows how serious this outbreak is.
3144,"That's exactly the problem. I don't care how many plans the universities come up with to ""keep campuses safe."" Even in the best case scenarios (which I still think aren't enough) it all relies on 18 and 19 years olds to follow the rules, wear masks, and practice social distancing on AND off campus. It's never going to happen. Administrations know it's never going to happen. But everyone is freaking out about budget cuts and decreased enrollment so they are knowingly taking that chance to get as much money out of students as possible. They absolutely know they will have to close things down when numbers spike again."
3145,My sisters college is about 3 hours from home and last year she would come home every other weekend because she gets homesick. I'm trying to get her to understand without hurting her feelings that she can't do that again this year because of high risk people living at home
3146,"> I‚Äôm really worried we‚Äôre all gonna pay tuition, room and board and then get sent home within two months with this whole covid thing.

That's probably the plan."
3147,"Rather than getting a lease at an apartment, just moved into the dorm, so if classes go online and were kicked outta dorms, ill probably get a refund back."
3148,Especially considering flu season is right by the corner.
3149,[removed]
3150,My administration has already stated they can‚Äôt morally send students home once they‚Äôre tested positive. Thankfully.
3151,"The same thing happened last semester at my school. They reduced the cost of the dorm on the bill which resulted in a refund. Though, it was only if you weren't a on full scholarship. So some students got a decent amount of our dining money and room back while others but a small amount. 

Albeit it is a small University (~3600 students) and maybe half of them live in dorms so it isn't the worst situation compared to huge state schools and such, but it would definitely be safer to continue school online. 

IMO:
I want to say that having an option to dorm is okay, and that should be up to the student and family, but we know students are gonna be irresponsible. So maybe this option for graduates and law students? (I'm assuming they are a bit more responsible which might be little to no difference)..."
3152,"It sucks because I don‚Äôt want to get sick or spread COVID, so I would *prefer* online or distance learning, but spending more time cooped with my parents...is not ideal either. Physical health or mental health?"
3153,"As far as I know ISU doesn‚Äôt plan to keep the money. They treated students pretty decently when they made us leave last semester. Also a renter would 100% not give u a refund where as the university might, so Id rather take my chances with them."
3154,"i‚Äôm worried about that too. i don‚Äôt want to waste my money. plus, i‚Äôm a chemistry major and the lab class i‚Äôm taking this semester is one of if the not the most important and practically useful classes i will take in college. it‚Äôs basically a lot of the stuff i will need to know how to do in the lab once i graduate. i cannot do this class online. if classes do go online, at the very least i am going to take an incomplete for this course and finish it the following year. if not, i‚Äôll take a leave of absence."
3155,"If you signed a lease for an off campus apartment, why not just stay there? Live your own life."
3156,"I totally agree. People of my age group are immature, in a sense where they just want that life experience and not worry about the future. I am on the side of teachers and staff that would have to risk their lives if schools do reopen, in a sense that students won‚Äôt follow rules no matter what. It would be a different story if there was a cure for this disease, but I really don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt comprehend the severity of the symptoms this illness can bring."
3157,"I‚Äôm doing at least this semester, probably the whole year online because of this. My school is doing mostly online anyway so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to pay room and board for online classes and limited campus life."
3158,My school is similar. That also made rules but idk how they‚Äôre going to enforce that outside of academic and meal times. I‚Äôm also worried about having to move in and a few weeks later move out. I also have a fish tank which I initially (pre-COVID) was hoping to bring to campus this year - and my parents don‚Äôt want to watch any of my pets...
3159,"Meanwhile my university made an addendum to the housing contract stating if they kick everyone off campus, they won't be receiving a refund lol"
3160,"Frankly, every single college is pointedly ignoring what's staring them straight in the face: the numbers are *already at crisis level*. Like this isn't some hypothetical second wave we're all really worried might happen, it's literally happening right now with no signs of slowing or staying in certain areas. We shut down the spring semester when conditions were *better* than this.

It's insane to me how the topic of conversation right now is ""should we or shouldn't we have a semester and not ""how fast can we get everything shut down again and get people safely back into isolation to flatten to the curve again?"""
3161,My university was thinking the same and just went back on everything today and we‚Äôre online for the fall now.
3162,I'm a chemistry prof and I am angry at the way things turned out last semester.  Online labs are a farce.  Other profs have talked about recording themselves doing the lab and asking students to watch.  That is a complete waste of time.  I would take a year off and wait for all this to blow over.
3163,"Yup, I agree. That's why my decision to stay home this fall semester is not without confidence. 

I'm fairly certain that either A. There'll be an outbreak within the college and they'll send everyone home or B. There'll be an outbreak and they'll forcibly make all the classes online, basically removing a large part of the experience that makes up the reason why you room and board in the first place: being able to meet professors in person and seeing them during their office hours."
3164,My college is shortening the fall semester to end before Thanksgiving. We still have full tuition and room costs.

3186,"I had to take a interpersonal communication class, and the whole class was just talking about any and everything about yourself. I just talked about my sims lives"
3187,"Imagine you're given a really generic prompt to a topic and told ""Here, respond"". So you respond in a generic manner as do all of your other classmates. You're then told to respond to one (or more) of those generic responses from your classmates. You're also not allowed to use informal language like you can on Reddit, and you have to be nice/civil, limiting the creativity of your response (stringent criteria that I did not have, nor did any other student have, while responding to this post. Hence our creative unfiltered expressions :) ). Good luck.

I feel like online discussions work better for philosophy classes where there's some actual variation in the opinions being discussed and creative answers are allowed. It would probably for creative writing classes as well which allow for more creative freedoms. However, for most classes that I've taken where students are told to write a response to a prompt and respond to other students, responses are generic as hell and everybody is just pulling shit out of their ass to respond and meet those point requirements. Nobody actually cares in generic online discussions and most of the time nobody learns anything because of their bland generic nature."

3190,"Most of my professors tell our classmates to harshly critique each others work because professors + TA's will mark harder, to prepare for more professional jobs, and to let us see through other people's perspective.

3196,"If you're truly concerned about not learning enough, then take all that excess time and learn more. Find a project related to your field of study. Look up and learn about more interesting topics that are perhaps not what you're being taught right now.

All of these extracurricular activities are what allow people to really talk through an interview. Projects outside of school are absolutely excellent on a resume. I got my offers without a single internship because I did a couple fairly simple but applied projects outside of school for fun."
3197,"You missed what I'd consider to be the most important part:

The homework software. 

if you're unlucky enough to attend a college that signs contracts with textbook companies or have professors that get kickbacks for using them, you will likely find yourself spending the majority of your time in homework software. Cengage or Pearson, most likely. Your in-person classes may have had some, but you mostly did the learning in class with a professor, and the questions in the software.

For an online class, you will do all your reading there and all (or most) of your homework there. Quizzes, tests, exams, all on the software. Depending on the class you might find yourself learning absolutely nothing from the professor and just using your resources to pass the tests. You might see some power points or PDFs in the classroom folder the professor uploaded, but when you look at them they all say ""Cengage"" or ""Pearson"" in the corner because the professor didn't create them, they're just providing what the software gave them to provide. You can barely even say it's ""their"" class at this point.

Your professor will do very little, you'll learn very little, your access codes will cost a lot, and so will the class fees, for what was essentially an automated ""teacher"" that recites multiple choice questions from the book and nothing more.

And you'll feel ripped off, because you absolutely were. You'll find yourself asking why colleges are allowed to get away with such scams, and you won't have an answer.

This has been the norm for online classes for a long time, but I imagine a lot of people who usually only take in-person are going to experience this for the first time. I know even some in-person math classes are turning into glorified third party software usage sessions while the professor turns into a simple moderator."
3198,[deleted]
3199,"For me the thing that makes it weird is just not being on campus or in the same town as campus. Being there really puts me in the ‚Äòschool‚Äô mindset, especially being in the libraries. I‚Äôve personally never been one to glean that much from lectures beyond making friends with classmates, so I‚Äôm cool with online lectures."
3200,"This is an excellent suggestion.  I am a professor and have been teaching online since March 2020.  The thing I tell students who do online course work is to treat the time-flexibility they may have (depending on the course) as ""value add time"".  What else do you want to learn, either related to my course or something else altogether? Pursue it.  

In fact, in the fall (I am in STEM and teach computing courses to MEs), I will be providing some value add team work which will allow my students to have a far shinier CV than many of their peers in other universities."
3201,"To counter this, many people believe we automatically have extra time because classes are online. Really, the only extra time we have is from a commute. Albeit, it does add up. Also, because of this assumed extra time, students are allotted a lot more work.

I for one agree with you, and also try to use my free time the best way possible, but I can see where students who don‚Äôt have the added time can feel a little cheated."
3202,"Professor here.  Cengage and Pearson suck.  I would rather be burned at the stake than make my students sit through that boring crap.  If it were my kid, and that is all they were getting, I would be pissed."
3203,And they still expect us to pay full tuition smh
3204,Some professors deadass just gave up on lecturing and just make us watch prerecorded lectures
3205,"That‚Äôs because all the empirical evidence about online learning says that students learn more from short, pre-recorded lectures. Online classes are not supposed to resemble a face-to-face classes. If your professor is lecturing via Zoom they are doing you a disservice and were simply too lazy to adapt the content appropriately for an online environment. Why do they lecture via Zoom? Because they don‚Äôt want to spend the massive time it requires to record those dead-ass pre-recorded lectures that you are complaining about. Also, your professors are just as annoyed at having to teach online as you are having to take classes online. Suck it up. We‚Äôre all doing our best to deal."
3206,"Another professor here... Cengage, Pearson and McGrawHill (connect?) should all fuck off and die."
3207,"As a professor,  I can sympathize with you.  In fact, I have ensured that my lectures are short, to the point and effective (from my 200+ students' reviews of my teaching online courses).

> I decided to dropout till everything reverts back to normal

You do realize that this may be a while?"
3208,Never even saw my summer ECON professor. Dude literally put the assignments up on Canvas and then peaced out. Oh but of course we still had to pay the same amount of tuition + the privilege of having McGraw-Hill teach us the coursework instead -_-
3209,"some people like real-time because it feels more personal and gives a feeling of normality while things are rough - let them vent, this is a weird time to be in college and we should give each other some grace :)"
3210,"I used to spend like 4 hours a day in the library, now i'm stuck in my studio apartment lol"
3211,professor here....Cengage and Mcgrawhill can fuck off.  Pearson is a god dam fucking money pit.
3212,"I'm in the ""taking a break till it's over"" crowd. My university straight up jacked up tuition and fee prices because not a lot of people are going back, so they're losing money. I feel bad for the ones going back, paying inflated prices for a lackluster education is sad. I bet their parents are Karens."
3213,"Same i dropped out cause it was irritating AF sitting in my room all day instead of being in campus, and my professors mic was earraping the fuck out of me so I decided to dropout till everything reverts back to normal"
3214,If you think outside factors don't effect motivation you're either the most sheltered little baby to ever exist or lying to yourself.
3215,"I miss taking on campus classes and I still didn't get in contact with my advisor due to how hell of a traffic is creating massive problems with students trying to get their classes set. And plus to set up advising appointments is broken. Nobody wants to do everything online and it just kills the point of attending to a specific university. Is just a massive waste of time and money, and there alot of people thinking about dropping college at this point and focus on getting 2 or more jobs at this point."
3216,"omg exactly, its not ""spoon feeding"" us information, its called teaching. aka what we're paying out the ass for our professors to do. i dont want my hand held, but lectures like, exist for a reason."
3217,"I am thrilled. I didn't have to drop my full time job and taking online classes is too easy. Personally, after my MA I'm going for PhD if Ms. Rona still here ."
3218,">  instead having a professor spoon feed it to you

I fucking hate, so so much, the use of the term spoon feed in an academic context

God for-fucking-bid you want someone to tell you what to learn to be successful after you've paid thousands in tuition"
3219,"I keep seeing a lot of this, but when I was in college I tried my best to do online. No pressure to make the hour drive to class, I can watch the lectures whenever instead of early morning when I'm too tired to pay attention. I can literally pause and play lectures and rewatch them to make sure I understand whatever topic is given. It was so much better to me."
3220,"This has been the norm for math classes for a decade.  I remember having MyMathLab for College Algebra all the way back in 2008.  I still learned how to do college level algebra.  Used it for Precalc, Trig, Stats, Physics and so on.  I still learned them.  The model works for math.  If it didn't, no student would pass subsequent math courses, would they?

I've used Cengage for Financial Accounting 1 and 2,  Managerial Accounting, Medical Terminology and a few others.  I learned those topics well enough to apply their concepts in subsequent courses that built on them. The model clearly works for these subjects too.  

Think about it this way.  A singular professor or even a singular department at a university will devise the curriculum for a course. No need for external validation if the school is already accredited. Then that professor could half ass the instruction and hand out A's like candy, setting you up for failure at the next higher level.  Or you can have a professor that takes it upon themselves to play gatekeeper and grade more harshly than any other professor, hurting your GPA and future prospects.

Cengage, Pearson and McGraw Hill are using hundreds of professors to devise these courses.  They are administered and graded in a standardized fashion.  I understand you feeling like you are being ripped off financially because the professor assigned to the class isn't really the one teaching.  However, you are getting a far more reliable deal academically."
3221,The school I transferred from is charging EXTRA per semester because of the pandemic. About $200 per semester. In the middle of a pandemic which has left millions of people in a financial crisis. For lackluster classes which the professors have no idea how to teach. Makes sense /s
3222,"I really miss the social dynamics of a good class. Interacting with other students. Conversing with the professors about the topics we're learning. I feel like I learned more from discussions that weren't strictly based on the syllabus/textbook than I have in the awkward online class sessions.

It's like for students that usually take in-person classes and teachers that don't generally teach online, everyone just doesn't want to do this but we have to put up with it."
3223,"Definitely can be the case. It all depends on how the professor sets up the course to be online. Is there now more busy work or perhaps more lenient on work volumes, etc"
3224,It‚Äôs like students are paying for Cordon Bleu and then getting some shitty mass produced McDonalds.   I seriously question the integrity of any faculty member who uses just canned curricula.
3225,"I just graduated with a degree in IT and concentration in cyber security this past corona spring for context.

In the Fall, when I was interviewing initially, I decided my resume wasn't very good - it wasn't. So I took it upon myself to make a couple programs in Python to do brute force dictionary attacks on passwords and other fairly basic but applied things like that. That way it showed my effort, interest, and proficiency beyond the classroom.

To be clear, I did it for fun and my own benefit. I'm by no means the type of person to kill myself studying all day and night for that 5 extra percent. But I did see the need to better my chances at getting hired."

3227,"Do you know the class average? If everyone did badly then sure something is wrong with the course, but if the average wasn't bad then it seems you're just bad at it"
3228,"Pretty similar, the course I‚Äôm taking is history of interior design.  My undergrad degrees are in fashion and theater production (costume design) and my masters is in educational administration (so not really).  I teach history of fashion which follows the same timeline so I feel like I have an above average background in the subject, if only for the reason that I know the development of human history fairly well."
3229,Dude half of studying the sat is studying how to answer the questions. Fuck sat
3230,She noted the class average is usually an 80 (I was actually the first in our class to take it so I‚Äôm not sure what our specific class average is)
3231,"80 is a pretty reasonable average, bigger than most of my classes"
3232,"Quite the experience huh? Is there any chance that a hint of overconfidence while taking the exam affected you? Or maybe it‚Äôs just the professor and the syllabus. Nevertheless, best bet you would probably become a better teacher from this experience."
3233,"You seem like a great prof, just from your humble attitude and obvious love of learning and education. Please don‚Äôt beat yourself up over this. Sometimes you have a bad teacher, poorly organized course, or a class that doesn‚Äôt really suit the way you learn. Even if that‚Äôs not the case, everyone has different talents and sometimes learning is about finding what yours are and aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm only a Sophomore myself but I hope I can give you some words of encouragement. You got this. All you can do now is try and do better next time. In the grand scheme of things, it likely isn‚Äôt as big a deal as it feels like now."
3234,Possibly?  A big theme of the course is thinking about design choices and why they were made within the context that they appear
3235,"Maybe over confidence?  I was extremely anxious before taking the exam and taking the exam, just because I‚Äôm an anxious person.  I had forgotten how anxious I make myself over school.

But absolutely - I will be a better teacher because of this.  I feel like I have a better view of places where students can get confused."
3236,"I have two masters degrees and my buddy's girlfriend asked if I could look over her English 102 essay. As a favor I punched it up significantly - added nice APA citations, fixed her reference page and formatting, and all her grammar and punctuation, improved the thesis and conclusion, basically everything, I thought it was a fuckin banger of a paper when I was done with it. 

She got a B. 

I was pissed. 

Just goes to show you, even if you think it's perfect and you know what an A performance looks like, it's not up to you. Professors are dicks."
3237,Yes I am an assistant professor.  In my department of 8 only one of us has a PhD.  I think that‚Äôs more common on the theater side than the fashion side of the things.
3238,Computer engineering
3239,"Did she give you the grading rubric with her paper?

Sometimes I receive beautifully written papers that I *wish* I could give a 100% to, but they missed some required elements of the paper and therefore end up with a score that's lower than my qualitative assessment."
3240,Honestly look pretty high for engineering courses. We're generally at 50% average.
3241,That reminds me of my microeconomics class. I got an a in macroeconomics and generally done well in school. I studied super hard for the test and got an 83. I was so depressed. Then I found out that the class average was something like 75. One kid got a 98. My professor flat out said that he didn't think he could have gotten a 98 on the test and he wrote it.
3242,Are you a professor (according to the university) or an instructor? I was under the assumption that the ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù classification was reserved for those with a PhD. Genuine question.
3243,Also a NYer here‚Ä¶grew up during the age of standardized testing. Every year we went over how to just read the damn question. They purposely make the questions wordier and more complex sounding. Always irritated me especially as someone who has anxiety who gets distracted easily made taking the test even harder than it already was
3244,What‚Äôs your major if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
3245,My compsci class last semester had an average of 76 and 72 in our 2 tests lol
3246,Dang bro do you want his credit score as well?
3247,"In my opinion, professors should have more pedogeological training. I've met many incredibly smart and academically successful professors, with years of teaching experience, that *sucked* at it. Plenty of professors have teaching experience, few have meaningful pedogeological training."
3248,Yeah those are pretty normal averages
3249,"I feel like some professors just aren‚Äôt great at writing exams. My bio prof would ask the most ridiculous questions that were so hard to answer. On five different instances I emailed him explaining why I thought my answer was correct  and I got credit. My psych prof had super clear, upfront questions where I knew the questions I got wrong were due to me not knowing the right answer."
3250,Well if you could tell stories from the future the military would probably kidnap you and plug your brain into a computer
3251,"To be fair, micro vs. macro econ can be very different course material."
3252,"As a student who returned to college later in life... I'll say that it airways takes me one test to figure out the professors testing style. Typically, my first test is half to a full letter grade lower than my final testing average. Figure out what on the test held back your score and work on that area. 

Also, professors who share a pre-test or sample test questions are the real mvp's. I'll spend a fair bit of time looking at the testing strategy and use that to figure out my study plan."
3253,"Im 32 but returned to college last september. Like you I am a perfectionist for assignments and tests as well. Last semester my lowedt mark was a 93% in marketing. 

Anyways, this semester, in my business math class, my teacher blasts through the power point in 50 mintues and leaves class. I have 2 2 hour classes of this a week. Every class so far, I've had to ask for clarification about slides that just had errors. The teacher never reviews the slides before class. 

Just today, i received an 80.23% on an accoutning assignment. I went through the feedback to update my copy of the assignment for studying purposes. At first i couldnt even understand what was the prof had written. Then I realized her feedback was based on the assumption that all 3 questions were based on the same company when her assignment sheet shows 2 different companies.  

Last friday we had a quiz in which one of the questions was ""which is not the right order for so and so"". There were 4 answers. 1 was the proper order and 3 werent. I was wracking my brain thinking there must be some alternate order or somthing. So i finished the quiz and mentioned that the 1 question trioped me up. Prof exclaimed condescendingly how reading the text book would help. We took up the quiz and low and behold, the quetions was written incorrectly so the prof gave everyone a bonus mark.

For my first semester books, i thought id be proactive and buy the ""recommended"" book list for my classes from the campus library. Ended up returning 3 because they were the wrong book...

Overall this has been a gong show. I feel your pain.


Update: for anyone who cares. Had a quiz today. 9 questions. 10 marks each. 90 marks total. 1 question was worded wrong again. That was the only question i got wrong. Prof said hell give everyone an extra 10%. 100%/9 questions goves each question a weight of 11.111111111. Now im literally sitting at 99% for a test i got perfect on........ not a huge deal but the rediculousness bugs me."

3286,"You have every right to complain about this. I can't speak for all universities, but my college expects assignments to be graded within a week."
3287,"I once had a professor who would take a little bit to grade the exams, and this happened one day.

Student: Did you finishing grading the exams?

Professor: Did you finish your homework yet?

Student: Fair enough"
3288,"I'm one of these! Except instead of feedback on 20 papers, it's feedback on 120 papers.

""But purple_ombudsman, why not just do multiple choice?""

I do MC, but MC is a tool in the toolkit of pedagogy, not something you lean back on because you have too many students and want to stuff applied learning into an auto-graded box."
3289,"> Grading Papers Is Why I Drink

same"
3290,"At one of mine (I teach at multiple), the *recommended guideline* is two weeks from hand in. But there's zero enforcement mechanism. The only real incentive is to keep students happy. And let's be honest, fewer and fewer professors give a half of fuck about that, especially tenured ones."
3291,"I had one professor who, honest to God, did not grade a single assignment, quiz, or exam until week 9 of a 14 week semester. I had another professor that same semester who graded everything within 48 hours of submission. I guess they evened each other out?"
3292,"My online biology teacher last semester would literally grade things five minutes after you turned it in, it was awesome."
3293,"I grade them as soon as I can after they are turned in, but that's for me. I'm paranoid about getting snowed under. Plus it's nice to be able to say, ""I can put these off one more day, they were due yesterday"" than to have to say, ""sit down and concentrate, these were turned in 2 weeks ago."""
3294,"Damn, lucky. My professor seemingly stopped grading my hw a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve sent in about 7 assignments and only 2 of them got graded. Makes me wonder why he‚Äôs still assigning hw if he won‚Äôt bother to grade them."
3295,Most of my stuff is graded by TAs.. I have a paper I've been waiting almost a month for a grade on.
3296,They must battle to the death!
3297,You are a better person than I am.
3298,My criminal justice teacher takes 5 weeks just to grade 1 discussion. It's so freaking annoying. The teachers also use a system that doesn't let us see our tests and quizzes afterwards so we have no clue what we got wrong snd what to study more on. So frustrating. How are we going to learn all the material like you want us to if we don't know what we got wrong?!?!

3304,Same here!!  It's really frustrating.  I basically commented the same thing yesterday haha
3305,"For my senior thesis, we have set amount of pages due every few weeks.  My teacher often times doesn‚Äôt grade those pages before the next pages are due so I can‚Äôt go back and fix mistakes . As a result my grade has suffered alittle. I also asked for her to meet fot Tuesday. We were emailing this Friday and I have yet to have a response. Fun times."

3308,2 years ago i had a class where i didn‚Äôt get a grade until the end of the semester. and it was an art class so i really had no idea
3309,"I'm taking 5 classes and don't have a single grade for any of them. I've gotten feedback on my work for 3 of them, so I guess that's enough, but grades aren't really a thing in my major. Definitely makes it hard to stay motivated."
3310,"If all I did was my job, it'd probably take about 2.5 weeks to return papers to students."
3311,Lol my math prof graded my midterm in 1 day.
3312,Yeah my teacher has my grades for quizzes and tests but not for any labs or assignments. I highly doubt I‚Äôm doing any good in that class and I got another lab due this weekend on top.
3313,"You're not wrong. However, essays notwithstanding, every student still requires feedback and not everyone, unfortunately, gets TAs. No matter how you slice it, it takes an enormous amount of time."
3314,"I have a professor who has homework due 1am Mondays.  He emails us our grades by 9am the same day.  

On the other end of the spectrum, I had a French Professor in undergrad who never returned half the work for the semester.  Worst part was that we were supposed to have an extra credit opportunity by making corrections on our returned assignments, which were supposed to be due a week after we get our feedback.  When he got behind grading, he gave us to the last day of classes to make our corrections.  When he got further behind, he made it due the last day of finals.  He still never gave us our feedback lol.  Some say he's still grading our papers to this day.... But seriously, I guess he somehow graded them since we got our course grades halfway through January (the semester ended around Dec. 20th)."

Imagine that but at the 1.5T scale. The government does this to encourage businesses to put money back into the economy, and not just hoard it. So businesses keep little cash in hand, and in an emergency, the government will give them cash, that is based on the bonds of the company.

3333,"Hi! Thank you for writing this out, hopefully it will get more people to contact their reps! I edited some of the wording/phrasing and wrote an email in the perspective of a college senior. If anyone else is in a similar situation as me, I‚Äôm posting my edited version below! 


Hello Representative _______,

My name is ________ and I am writing to you today as a constituent of _____(state)____ congressional district ____( district #)____ to request your support of a new House bill that Rep. Angie Craig recently introduced, the All Dependent Children Count Act, which is intended to amend the upcoming CARES act in order to financially aid currently excluded Americans.

The CARES act, as I'm sure you are aware of, is intended to financially aid citizens through the current COVID-19 pandemic. While this act is good for many Americans, there is also a large portion of our adult population being excluded as of April 1st, 2020. Unfortunately, this is no laughing matter. American workers and taxpayers aged 18-24 under the current CARES act, whom were claimed as dependents in the 2018 or 2019 Federal Tax Year, are currently ineligible for the stimulus program.

This is an exclusion that is disappointing at best and harmful at worst to Americans. Those who made claims in that tax year had no way of knowing what kind of damage the pandemic would cause to the American workforce. Those claimed in the 18-24 age range are hurting just as much as the rest of the nation, and they need to be assisted at the same level as other American citizens. 

For college age students like myself, many of us live independently from our parents, have our own jobs, and contribute to our economy as any other adult individual would. Why do we not deserve the same consideration that our peers are receiving? Being claimed as a dependent is a common tool used by parents to lower their taxes. This measure and the reasoning that ""parents shouldn't have claimed them then"" is a response that feels unnecessarily punitive. 

To quote Representative Angie Craig: ""In the middle of a pandemic, we need to look out for our working families and make sure we are doing everything we can to provide financial support to those most in need. When I learned that we were leaving out dependents over 17 and students up to age 24 as well as the disabled, I knew we needed to introduce legislation to fix this immediately. I urge the House to take up this legislation as quickly as possible or to correct this retroactively to the CARES Act in the next bill.‚Äù

There are at-risk Americans in this group that will be financially devastated by this disaster, and they will need all of the assistance that they can get. College seniors like myself that are about to graduate face an already uncertain future and now a likely devastating recession, if not a potential depression in our economy. We should not be excluded from the CARES act. 

By publicly supporting this bill, you can right this wrong for your constituents, assist the economy in this uncertain time, and ensure that our country's citizens have the resources that we need to get through this pandemic.

Thank you for your time and I hope to see you support this bill as a representative of our district. 

Best,
_________"
3334,"Yep, I'm 23 and I've been financially independent and living alone for several years now. But because my parents still claim me, I don't get anything. I still have bills!??"
3335,Is there an interim seat or someone taking the spot temporarily? Seems weird to have a congressional district empty when numerous local gov positions have contingencies.

3349,"**TLDR; not worth doing since I didn't need the points**

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets about every six weeks to assess the state of the economy and to decide what actions the central bank should take.

Find the schedule of minutes and press releases at www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/.

When was the last scheduled meeting of the FOMC? When is the next meeting? Review the press release from the last meeting. What did the committee decide to do about short-term interest rates?

3377,"If you‚Äôre at a public school you should add in the state contributions- guarantee it has gone down substantially along with tuition increases. That‚Äôs why college has gotten more expensive- public universities are no longer majority funded by the public anymore.

3384,"We need to tell kids theres nothing wrong with working in trade or as a postal worker.

Too many kids getting useless degrees and rewarding the universities behavior."
3385,"Yeah, this feels about right. Rate of faculty/staff hiring is only 1/2 that of student growth, meanwhile tuition has been skyrocketing.

 Feels bad to be faculty."
3386,">which is pretty insane, given, you know, they're in one of the most stressful situations of their lives, away from home for the first time. who doesn't want to live in squalor? it's part of the eXpeRiEnCe! builds cHaRaCtEr

I avoided campus at all costs, shared a room, had a queen size bunk bed, worked 2 jobs. That was an experience if I've ever heard of one!"
3387,"Yep, there it is. That‚Äôs the important number if you want to compare college costs now to anytime in the past. I hate to boil things down to generational divides, but the truth is that the boomers took advantage of affordable public college and then when they had the power, promptly started defunding and put the cost burden on individuals instead of the state. Pretty shitty all around."
3388,">So corrected for inflation, state appropriations have fallen, but less than I was expecting.

3389,"At first I was mad at the boomers, now I‚Äôm just jealous. Like, I want to be able to go to college and buy a house for the price of 2 corn chips, come on"
3390,"It‚Äôs funny bc my school sends me, a graduate who just finished school in a pandemic, emails begging for money for their various programs. They also have a day dedicated to asking current students to donate. It‚Äôs ridiculous that they strip us of our money to begin with, and have the audacity to ask for more."
3391,"I respect you hanging in there for all of us students! I honestly feel us students gotta stand up for professors like you and to just fuck admin and their unnessary raises. Currently a college student and many of my professors have stated my university's tuition increased even with a COVID scholarahip given to every student. 

All i gotta say is thank you for dealing with this bullshit and educating us students!

3392,A bigger issue is the decline of support of higher education by [state and federal government ](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2019/10/two-decades-of-change-in-federal-and-state-higher-education-funding)
3393,"Im not sure which(or if any of these) are the correct one, but these are what I think falls under the category you're talking about:

3394,"I agree, if I didn't have a degree I was actually interested in (and happened to make me a decent salary) I would have just gone to trade school - its much cheaper and has great opportunities"
3395,"So corrected for inflation, state appropriations have fallen, but less than I was expecting. Have they risen steadily, or does either year account for a significant increase or drop, like for a new building or some other significant expense?

If ‚Äúgovernment grants‚Äù mean federal grants, then those probably shouldn‚Äôt be included. Most federal money comes in as research grants (think NSF or NIH) to individual faculty and does not contribute at all to undergraduate student instruction."
3396,Any degree that you dont make use of
3397,"Professor here. I second this comment, and I can‚Äôt agree strongly enough with your final sentence."
3398,"Yep- that‚Äôs the other problem with relying so much on tuition dollars- students (or really parents) become consumers to entice to your university. And students / their parents want to see fancy gyms, updated student lounges, and comfortable dorms. No one is recruited to the university because they like the look of the math building. 

Once universities stopped being a service- paid for by the state- and started being a commodity- purchased by consumers- those consumers had to be marketed to and won over."

3400,And people think I‚Äôm crazy when I say physicians deserve a higher salary.
3401,Plus the **millions upon millions spent on Student Success measures** that have failed to produce graduation rates that are any better than the past.
3402,"Id have to look at each report individually for more details on each year, but I can say they're always building newer and fancier dorms with all these great luxurious features to them (and then charge out the ass for it), meanwhile the math building was literally built in 1964 and looks like it hasn't seen any major improvements since the 80s... Students struggle to even get wifi in that building, its a nightmare and unfortunate because its a very busy building, they even put two or three teachers in an office to share, its definitely weird in office hours. Obviously that's just one example of stuff being neglected or other stupid stuff.

&#x200B;

Money needs to be flowing to the right places and clearly its not, and while it may be giving people a Marriott Weekend getaway vibe for their non-educational needs, its screwing everyone else whether or not we want any of that crap. 

&#x200B;

I think I paid almost 1k a year in fees for the gym I never once used? And then I took an online summer class remotely from a different state and they still charged me that damn summer gym fee, and on campus bus fee, etc... Gotta love it."
3403,"Absolutely YES to this!  The Federal Pell grant originally was about equal to a year's tuition. Not so anymore.  States are cutting the the amounts that schools request. 

Now add to this COVID-19. I work at a University.  Trust me, I'm not getting rich! I just took the first part of my furlough and will need to do the second part due to our budget outlook. No raise this year, so instead of my income increasing, it goes down. The furlough percentage of a decrease in my salary equals my raises for the past 3 years."
3404,"Not to mention students want mental health services, clubs, top of the line equipment, instant access to materials via a LMS, internet every where on campus, study spaces, dedicated advisors, tutoring centers,  etc.

Many things that were not readily available 20 years ago. All these extra services cost money."
3405,Another insane thing I noted is dispite it being a literal pandemic the rate still went up for 2020
3406,we have a similar thing but with all of these assignments i end up doing the same amount of work those days as if we didnt even have off :(
3407,"My professors: ‚ÄúRemember that you need to read chapters so-and-so and do the related assignments plus y‚Äôall have an exam scheduled the Monday you come back. Have a great spring break!!‚Äù 

Not a single one of my professors gave us any slack. 

On the bright side at least I didn‚Äôt have to sit through their boring lectures so there‚Äôs that, I guess."
3408,I go to a community college so I‚Äôm pretty grateful they still gave us our break
3409,"My school gave us 2, 2 day instructional breaks. The first one I had a final exam right after (break T, W exam F) the instructional break so I didn‚Äôt even get to enjoy it. The second one I was able to half enjoy and damn was it needed. I‚Äôm counting down the days until the end of the semester (only 18 days left!)"
3410,"Same, same. My professors are still making assignments due at 5 pm or midnight on our wellness days. Then they‚Äôll walk into our next class talking about how they used their day off to go snowboarding or to go hang out in the desert ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3411,"Every time I‚Äôve sat down today to study I‚Äôve gotten overwhelmed with anxiety and as a result, I haven‚Äôt done shit. I‚Äôm fucking over it."
3412,"My spring break just ended but I spent it all working on assignments and studying for exams, all of which were due the day after (today). One professor even assigned work on Easter Sunday (yesterday). Yeah. 

Easter is such an important holiday for my family. As everyone was enjoying the festivities, I was holed up in my room working. I couldn‚Äôt even work ahead to take the day off because there was just too much to do. And now I have 2 months of school with no break to look forward to. Yay. 

Needless to say, I‚Äôm drained. üôÇ

Can‚Äôt wait for this semester to be over."
3413,Me too haha another upside to CC
3414,I've had no time off since first week of class.  I have 4 exams this week and no desire to continue to study.
3415,Oh. My. God. THIS. And then they‚Äôll have the audacity to ask how we spent it after assigning us a 10 page essay in the same breath that they wish us a ‚Äúhappy and relaxing Easter.‚Äù
3416,Ha suckers! We get two Thursdays AND a Wednesday at Penn State
3417,"In the fall, at my school we usually get Labor Day off in early September and Veterans Day off in early/mid November, then we also get a Thursday-Friday fall break in mid October, then we get Wednesday-Friday off for Thanksgiving. In Spring we usually only get MLK day off early in the semester then Spring Break in early March. Nothing else. It absolutely blows, and we didn't even get a proper spring break this year. My school only gave us two 2-day mid week instructional breaks, but most people still end up doing school work during it so its kinda stupid."
3418,Do you guys get breaks in the middle of the fall semester? i've never had that so it just feels like another fall semester to me
3419,We probably go to the same school then rip
3420,"My college gives us 1 ""mental health wellness Monday"" which was today. The school is usually closed today, the day after Easter Sunday, but instead so graciously took away our spring break and gave us one day where class is still held but they suggest that all teachers and students take a moment to practice mindfulness. Heckin' bull."
3421,[removed]
3422,"nope, it must be a common experience across campuses unfortunately. definitely suffering tho"
3423,We had no breaks last semester and it was the worst semester of college I‚Äôve ever been in. I set a new record for all nighters in a semester and our course work was tripled.
3424,Sadly not all CC are doing spring break. My CC didn‚Äôt do spring break. A week off would be nice. Exhaust
3425,I'm getting heavy boomer from Facebook vibes right now.
3426,CC is the way to go if it‚Äôs a reputable one. Same classes as a Uni and like 1/5 the cost
3427,Can‚Äôt wait to relax with all these deadlines on my shoulders on Wednesdayüòé
3428,A girl in my history class was asked what she did over her break. She said she worked the entire break and my professor just laughed. He then continually (3+) times mentioned her and basically said have fun doing school and work 7 days a week guys. I think he was trying to be humorous but after I spent my entire break doing assignments I thought it was the perfect cherry on top of the university shit sundae.
3429,"thats true, i dont even want to go anywhere i just wanna sleep for a week lol"
3430,I have the same experience just focus on one assignment at a time. You got this!
3431,"im sorry to hear that, that really sucks. i feel like a lot of people who arent in college think that we just want spring break to go to florida or something irresponsible like that (tho im sure some would) but i literally just need it to catch up on sleep and assignments

we got this, though, the semester will prob be over before we know it, stay strong!!"
3432,I would RATHER sit in lecture! Arrrghh *Heavy Eye Roll*
3433,"Oh, miss me with this condescending bull. Working adults get scheduled breaks, too. 

And let‚Äôs not ignore how many of us are ALREADY working adults. We don‚Äôt need professors making shit harder to ‚Äúteach us‚Äù about something most of us already know. 

A break is a break. Not sure why that‚Äôs such a hard concept to grasp."
3434,My school is doing wellness days too except they‚Äôre just scattered on random days but I still have shit due. Like stg we never get a break and I‚Äôm so burned out üôÉ
3435,PU suffering gang?
3436,Is it common to cry tho? It was an accident and she told me to skip her class today to calm down üò≠
3437,"Don‚Äôt be mortified, this is a natural human stressor.   


We need to be vulnerable"
3438,">Sometimes emotions get so big they leak out of our eyes and noses.

I'm absolutely saving this phrase to use later. That's wonderful."
3439,[deleted]
3440,Prof here. It‚Äôs ok. You don‚Äôt need to be embarrassed. Sometimes students cry. Sometimes I cry. It‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of.
3441,"It‚Äôs not totally common for a student to cry in office hours but it‚Äôs certainly not uncommon it happens , you are at a stressful point in your life too it‚Äôs part of life . You have nothing to hold your head in shame about you had a real emotion I‚Äôve had kids breakdown in my office before I guarantee the professor‚Äòs biggest concern is that you‚Äôre OK ."
3442,"I burst into tears in my dean‚Äôs office once. I was having trouble signing up for an honors course and the person I needed to talk to wouldn‚Äôt be on campus for another week. I walked by the dean of my major‚Äôs office door, and because I had a class with her that semester, I decided to see if she could help, because I knew she used to be in charge of the honors program. In the middle of explaining my situation, I burst into tears. She was really nice, gave me tissues and waited for me to stop crying, then filled out a paper add drop form for the class I needed. I still had about half a semester of classes left with her and it was fine. Then again, I cry easily so I‚Äôve gotten kind of used to crying in front of people, lol"
3443,I‚Äôm a professor in a high stress program and have had multiple students cry in my office. It‚Äôs ok to cry. Life and school are stressful and sometimes that stress just has to come out.
3444,"I wish my professors were like you. Mine have the ""suck it up, no one said college would be easy"" mentality."
3445,"Currently a professor. When I was in college, I cried multiple times. First, because I thought I wasn't going to be accepted into a class, at which point a different professor saw me looking for the other professor, invited me into his office, and I broke down in tears because I was afraid I wouldn't get to graduate if I didn't take the course (and this other professor invited me to take his class instead). 

Later, I broke down in tears in front of that *same professor* because my grandfather was in critical condition following a car accident, and I was looking for the other professor once more when he invited me once more into his office. He was so kind. I didn't even have his class that semester.

As a professor, I cried in my chair's office after my future father in law passed away. I cried in her office later, when I was very pregnant, after I walked out of a presentation a woman was giving about her son dying from an fentanyl overdose.

So yeah, crying happens."
3446,"I'm GTA for a large, challenging class that is commonly one of the last classes taken before graduation. In my first semester I had to steal a box of tissues from the health center bc there is A LOT of crying in my office hours/private meetings. Now the GTAs office has tea, snacks, a huge squishy teddy bear for hugging, and honestly, we deal with people crying about this class, some other class, work, trauma, all the things, literally \*all the time\*. College is hard. Adulting is hard. Crying is a totally sane response to stress. Please don't worry about it! ;)"
3447,You are a blessing! My teacher had tissues in her office too and it made me wonder if it was because other students cried as well haha
3448,"I have tissues handy in my office (learned early on in my teaching career that they‚Äôre a necessity for the exact reason OP is posting about), but I really love the idea of water and sugar, too."
3449,I cried on zoom office hours once over balancing acid chemical equations. She was very nice and just told me that it wouldn‚Äôt be the whole exam and that I‚Äôd never have to use it in the career I was wanting to pursue anyways.
3450,Thank you Professor. I needed to read that.
3451,"I have not personally yet (I am a crier so I know my day is coming), but I have heard more than a handful of stories like this. I wouldn't worry about it!"
3452,"Profs understand ur human

Humans cry

Its normal ~ in fact, its usually quite beneficial

So long as that prof is not a jerk, i bet they wont even bring it up unless to check on how ur feeling post-tears"
3453,"While maybe not common, it is normal to cry. A professor is a resource who can relate to us. They've probably also had that one or two class they struggled in, and it's so frustrating especially when you're so close to finishing. 

I've cried in office hours before and even though I was completely vulnerable it was nice to finally let a staff member know what was going on. They can help reach out to that professor for a second try, or even a recheck of your test. Maybe even help communicate with your job. It may be that you take this course during the summer. 

Regardless, it is good that you are visiting office hours. It's a major step that you care. Please try visiting that classes office hours and relearn what you may have missed. They can always curve your final grade if you show enough effort. (I once ended a course with a 65% and my professor gave me a B for trying to improve)"
3454,"I‚Äôm a PhD student. 

I cried in my professors office a few months ago. 

During my masters I found myself in your shoes. I had a 4.0. My last semester I took a class I had  no business being in, the professor told me not to take it. Yada yada. I BOMBED the final and was convinced I‚Äôd end up with a C (that‚Äôs failing in grad school). I had already signed a lease and accepted a job in a different state for my PhD. I cried my eyes out in a professors office (not the professor whose class I was in). 

I was a TA for a semester during my masters. I had two different students cry in my office. They had perfectly fine grades, they were just stressed out. 

It happens. Even good students struggle sometimes in class and in life. 

I‚Äôd bet money that you weren‚Äôt the first student and won‚Äôt be the last student that cries in her office. There‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of. College really wears a human out, especially near the end. It happens! <3"
3455,"And both are true! It‚Äôs necessary to cry because it‚Äôs one way to cope. But, you also have to suck it up, push ahead, and persist. 

We‚Äôve all been doing both for two years now, right? Cry - but persist!"
3456,"I have at least one or 2  crying in my office a semester I would guess.


really common"
3457,No reason to feel embarrassed. I have cried multiple times to my professors in undergrad. I am in grad school and have cried a couple of times as well. You will get everything worked out!
3458,Dude I‚Äôm afraid this is gonna be me for my minor. I‚Äôm deadass just dropping my minor if this happens to me. God I wish professors were more sympathetic to seniors in their last semester.
3459,"I know this isn‚Äôt what you were asking about, but maybe you could reach out to the professor of the class you‚Äôre worried about failing to ask if there‚Äôs any opportunity for extra credit? Some professors are very understanding. Also, don‚Äôt worry about crying, I cried in one of my classes last semester (I have a mood disorder and I was going through a rough patch) and the professor was super nice and understanding."
3460,"I was fighting cancer while in grad school. I had a particularly challenging day leading up to a meeting with one of my professors (I think I had chemo earlier or something). I walked in, and while I didn‚Äôt cry, she could tell that day was rough. She just walked over and stood there hugging me. No need to feel ashamed about being vulnerable."
3461,She was so so sweet about it but I am just embarrassed because all she had to say was ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù And i started tearing up!! That question always makes me cry
3462,That prof has probably cried before. You can't get through a PhD without experiencing a breakdown :'3
3463,I'm not a professor but I am an older student and a mom in college. There is nothing wrong with what you did. You obviously are experiencing a lot of stress and have high expectations for yourself. You're going to be ok. Be kind to yourself firstly and try to get some therapy to learn how to handle stress in a healthy manner before it gets like this. Please remember - it's ok to cry even if you're embarrassed and most likely your professor only felt compassion for you.
3464,The fact that you continued to pursue grad school while fighting cancer is mind blowing to me. You are an incredibly strong individual. I hope things are going ok for you now
3465,"I was actually working full time, too hahaha. It was several years ago. Looking back now I‚Äôm not entirely sure how I did it but at the time I just kept my head down and did what I needed to do. I am doing great; thanks for asking! No signs of cancer, boobs that will never sag with old age, and a graduate degreeüòé"

On the other hand, his name is ""1977_Chevy_K10""..."
3484,That's actually pretty scary when you think about what they're capable of
3485,"Having lived in that area for awhile, I'm almost surprised that they even have that alert at all. Anyone who lives in the Moscow/Lewiston/Orofino area is most-likely very used to seeing wildlife. Moose are beautiful creatures, despite being somewhat dangerous.

3497,Right in the feels lol. Love it when i see what i need to make on the final to make an A and it comes out to 127 lol. So many 89s for final grade making Bs on my transcript
3498,Go you! Keep up the good work!
3499,This is the worst! I wish some teachers didn't design the class so one bad quiz or test fucks you
3500,"Congrats, I bet that feels really good!! Keep it up!!"
3501,"Do your teachers just allow you to turn in missing work? At my university that pretty much just doesn't happen.

If you missed the deadline and are outside of their late policy of bank days or whatever they use, good luck ever getting to make it up later."

3504,"I've found it depends on the prof. I've got one this semester where it's an automatic 0 if things are even a tiny bit late. He's even told us if you're not finished something just turn it in anyway because even 30% is better than 0. 

I had a prof last semester who was very laid back ""oh don't worry just get it to me next week""."

3528,Whiskey: started to grade papers in a good mood. Then remembered old high school friends are making more money and now grading based on who of you reminds me off which asshole friend doesn't talk to me anymore. 
3529,I would go C with A afterwards.
3530,"In our first class our professor said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt bother adding my personal Facebook page, because I won‚Äôt accept your request‚Äù. So I did a bit of social engineering and managed to pose as a friend of a friend to get him to accept my request. Turns out he‚Äôs an amateur actor and regularly plays gangster roles. The clip I found was of him and his cronies cutting off this guys dick with a pair of garden shears whilst torturing him. 

[The guy was an unexpected badass](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.castcall.blue-compass.com/portfolioraw/444/444596.jpg). I posted the clip of him on our groups Facebook page with the caption ‚ÄúIncase anyone was wondering, don‚Äôt mess with [insert professors name]. Everyone lost their shit. 

Edit: the film in question is actually [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OT3m3V4whIc). Skip to about 25mins for the gory part. I warn you though... this film is rated one of the worst films ever made on IMDb. It‚Äôs truly unwatchable. "
3531,How fitting that D is my favorite...
3532,Needs more E whiskey. Then you can combine A and E for best effects.
3533,"Looks like he's almost polished off D already, so.. good luck, OP!"
3534,I would would do the opposite
3535,The world needs more drunk professors 
3536,Is your professor a 19-year-old sorority girl?
3537,No but you are
3538,I just finished. Thank tha lawd.
3539,"Homemade Four Loko! 

Wide-awake drunks are the best drunks."
3540,TIL The_Donald posters sometimes leave to complain on other subs.
3541,you'd struggle to take it seriously when somebody is joking?! Really?! Imagine that! :)
3542,Sounds like every TA I've had ever has gone for C. 
3543,this is how the professor asks for bacardi for christmas
3544,"all us profs are alcoholics, we don't need to be 19 year olds"
3545,I think he was kidding guy
3546,"Sweet, according to you apparently no one is supposed to disagree with the president. If that‚Äôs a disqualifying factor for you, then maybe you should stay away from hospitals, libraries, post offices, grocery stores, airports, and record shops, because he‚Äôs not well liked by employees in any of those. Grow up, lol."
3547,Username kinda checks out
3548,Agreed 
3549,"Not everyone is a friendly/happy drunk, I wouldn't wish for more!"
3550,Ya got me.
3551,"Right, it was a commentary on the choice of alcohol, not the alcohol itself. I'm an adjunct lecturer myself, and my usual drink for grading is gin."
3552,Yeah I was just trying to make a joke because this guy‚Äôs comment is kind of absurd
3553,Most rational humans have no choice these days than to get drunk to dull the mental pain caused by  the current administration. 
3554,I would bubble in all of them. 
3555,Fuck this guy.
3556,I just fell asleep during mine...joined a breakout room and then realized that they had just finished what they were doing
3557,I'm always on reddit during my lectures lol
3558,"I was talking with some people in one of my classes recently and like 4 people admitted that they wake up right before our lecture starts, turn on their laptop and set it on their bed, then go back to sleep. 

Can't say I've never been one of them..."
3559,"I've started taking lecture notes on a manual typewriter. 

There are no apps on a manual typewriter. 

No internet, no Facebook, no reddit. 

Just notes."
3560,"I think it's because we don't really have any if all, true connections with our peers and professors. I also think it's BS that we can' have socially distanced classes like most high schools where half of us come one day and the other half comes to class tomorrow. Also, it would be awesome to have group projects where your socially distanced. I think the reason we are zoning out is that we are kinda the same way that we are unengaged in ""social"" media ."
3561,I just left my lecture and baked a chocolate cake today
3562,"Started zoning out a month and a half into online class. 

Some days the classes are consecutive so I get tired, sometimes the topic (or the professor) sounds boring. I‚Äôm worried how I‚Äôll perform this semester but am too tired to actually care. :/"
3563,I hand write notes for this purpose honestly.
3564,"All my lectures are recorded. I'm weeks behind in watching them and try to frantically learn what I need to for whatever assignment is imminent. Send help, it doesn't work very well"
3565,My handwriting requires fluency in hieroglyphs to decipher.
3566,Last semester I had an 8am so sometimes I would do basically that; I‚Äôd join the meeting but then put my laptop in another room so the noise didn‚Äôt bother me and then go back to bed
3567,Same boat
3568,Considering I‚Äôm reading this and replying with my professor as background noise... yes. These classes don‚Äôt really feel real: I wake up or turn off Netflix 5 minutes before I log into Zoom. I play Animal Crossing during class then go back to bed and submit my assignments at 11:57.
3569,as you should
3570,Playback at 2x speed.
3571,Maybe they absorb some of the lecture while they are sleeping.
3572,Hahaa being checked out from day 1
3573,same
3574,Same
3575,I second this... Well I second this while my econ lecture plays in the background.
3576,Same
3577,i agree we pay for college and most dont have inperson but kids who dont pay for school get in person teaching
3578,Bold of you to assume that I ever mentally check in to them to begin with
3579,I‚Äôve started not even bothering with the laptop and just turning zoom on on my phone rip
3580,Doing it right now lmao
3581,"About half my classes are in person. My calc class did it the way you suggested. We have class Monday and Wednesday. Half is online on Monday and half is in person. Then on Wednesday we switch who's online. So I'm in class every Monday and online every Wednesday.

My physics class holds class outside, weather permitting. 

First year seminar is irl unless you're sick, then you can join on zoom but it's much less interactive if you do that. 

Chem Lab is half irl half online. We have cohort A and B, for example I am A and my partner is B. We alternate going online and irl each Wednesday. The online person typically does the math and answers questions. The irl person takes measurements and does the experiments, facing a camera (the school provided) towards the experiment so the online person can watch.

The one class I am doing horrible in is Chemistry, fully lecture fully online. No homework or anything, only three tests. BS. Don't know any of my classmates, hate my teacher, don't know what's going on."
3582,I would check out during in-person lectures too.  Especially those after lunch.
3583,Same
3584,I'm checked out of life full stop.
3585,same
3586,"My professor had a HUGE exam on Election Day and major assignments for the rest of the week. Give me a freaking break, I feel like I‚Äôm dying. I haven‚Äôt been so sad in a long time."
3587,"With a lot of work moving remotely and signs that some jobs will remain remote, it's a good idea to start learning how to work with a team remotely. But yeah, it sucks and may not be realistic depending on your major. Edit: I suppose it's easier said than done, especially in the first couple years of college. As a grad student, it's pretty easy to organize team projects because everyone wants to succeed. Thinking back on some of my undergrad groups.... All I can say is god speed. Remember these times when an interviewer asks you to describe a time when you overcame a challenge."
3588,omg same with my professors! I have two major projects due this week and I'm like yall really thought I can stop being on Twitter for two hours to see who has finished counted ballots just to finish my assignment? Sounds fake!
3589,[deleted]
3590,"In the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù, jobs happen during a certain set of hours leaving you with scheduled time for things like election results (which mostly came out after a typical work day ends). 

With school (and especially with online schooling), there is no ending. Because when you aren‚Äôt in the scheduled class time, you‚Äôre expected to be doing assignments or reading materials or just going over everything again to make sure you understand it. There is no built-in break, so a lot of us end up overworking ourselves to keep up (see: all of the burnout posts on this and like every other college subreddit rn)

Like I get your point. We have to learn certain curriculum in a certain amount of time, sure. That doesn‚Äôt mean that some profs aren‚Äôt being straight up disrespectful with their workload this semester.

I just really dislike when people use the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù excuse to dismiss how fucking difficult school is."
3591,"I really can't stand the group projects. Why do these lazy uncooperative classmates get to benefit with the grade from my hard work when they do the bare minimum? 

One of my classes I have to write a lab report with a partner because we need to learn ""collaboration skills."" I'm a good writer and I've always gotten good grades on my reports until writing with her. She literally edits my every sentence which removes the flow. I don't know if she just thinks it reads better or if she's being passive aggressive but it's frustrating to work on something and think it's complete only to come back later to find it regressed."
3592,"Especially in engineering classes where there are random ""milestones"" you need to accomplish individually. You don't know who's in your group until you participate in the graded discussion, and who the fuck even knows what the milestones are."
3593,I feel your pain. Hopefully the next few weeks can blow over soon enough. Best of luck in your group endeavors!
3594,"At least in a work environment, you're getting paid to deal with that."
3595,"I'm in a group project with 10 people. 4 of which weren't watching the lecture when the assignment was announced. 3 of those 4 say they have covid and that's why they couldn't watch the lecture or do their part of the project... 
If you get sick with Covid it's very serious and I understand. But it's not something you use as a lie to get out of duty because that takes away from the seriousness of those who legitimately get it. Don't do this."
3596,I‚Äôm *so* glad that none of my professors thus far have assigned group work. I can‚Äôt even make it to our zoom classes because of how wonky my work schedule is. I have classroom observations (Ed major) where we are paired up with one of our classmates and I‚Äôm having a hard time even managing that and we don‚Äôt even have to do anything together besides show up.
3597,Because your parents and other students complain that you aren't getting a true education or the college experience so the admin force us to do shit that none of us want to do....I fucking hate discussion boards with a passion after this semester...
3598,We will all get through this semester. Your professor is an asshole for doing that :(
3599,"Because I made the project part of my rationale for the course to satisfy a university learning outcome and it‚Äôs too time intensive to grade individual assignments.

I know it sucks for students, but it‚Äôs also honestly what most white collar workers are having to do right now, so it‚Äôs not terrible workplace training."
3600,"Group work is essential to an *in-person* curriculum. Requiring group work during a pandemic is just ignorant. Many students have difficulties with learning remotely, don‚Äôt add salt to the wound and have them coordinate remote group work on top of it."
3601,"My math teacher is doing this. Every chapter we have at least two group projects. On top of that, she has no idea how to date stuff. So something will be due on the third, but she wants it started on the first. But it doesn‚Äôt show up in our due section until two days later aka when it‚Äôs due. So we constantly get points taken off of assignments because we are supposed to start it two days earlier. I tried explaining this to her and she just couldn‚Äôt understand what I was talking about. 

I am so done with this class."
3602,My professor admitted to me in private it's the only way they can climax.
3603,"It doesn‚Äôt soften the blow. Also, in my experience, the coworkers that have not pulled their weight usually excel at claiming credit for other people‚Äôs work.   

Tip: if this happens in a work environment, make sure to update your boss frequently with what you are doing. At the end of the project, when the Slacker tries to brag about the end result, at least your boss will know the truth."
3604,"I have three group projects so far this semester, all in my online classes. Had one group that wouldn‚Äôt answer my emails until the night before a project was due and told me they didn‚Äôt know I was in their group and had already finished and submitted the project. Ended up doing an entire 5-person project on my own the night before it was due."
3605,That‚Äôs a real dick move!
3606,It only gets worse when you realize they are all going into the working world with you and making the same amount of money as you with half the work.
3607,Thanks man :)
3608,"Well FYI, there's still group work in normal life so not sure why there wouldn't be group work in school.

PS The same people who struggle with group work in the workplace probably struggled mightily with group work in college.  I can see why professors would want kids to practice."
3609,Damn my psc 101 professor changed the midterm to next week because he wanted to give us a break from the elections.
3610,"And the groups are ‚Äúassigned‚Äù instead of chosen so the idiot students who won‚Äôt do anything get spread among the groups instead of isolated in a group of collective morons. 

Oh and there is no stick given to the groups; no enforcement mechanism besides ‚Äúcommunicate more‚Äù; in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù, I just fire people who can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt perform."
3611,"I mean, I have one group project and I do all the irk cause they deemed me th smartest of the group so I would love no more group work"
3612,This semester I have so many more group projects than I‚Äôve ever had all three years in college. It is DRAINING
3613,"This is why I do literally everything I can in Google Docs. I do everything in my personal version of the group documents, then copy/paste my completed work into the group document. Want to fuck around and not do your part by making me do everything? The professor's going to get the links with full access to the version history showing you did fuck all. 

My only problem with it is professors don't give you their grades, too. Four-person project where I did it solo? I should be getting four grades, not just one, because I did the work of four people."
3614,This. I don‚Äôt know that many understand how stringent it can be when you need to spell out in detail how you intend for students to achieve learning outcomes. The damn lesson plans are longer than the papers or projects people are being asked to do.
3615,"As much as I hate group work with a PASSION, it's...justified. Classes going remote honestly isn't enough reason to cease all group work.

And, note, this is coming from a person whose 4 out of 6 classes require group work. That, along with being in a different time zone, absolutely SUCKS. But I kinda signed up for it."
3616,I have a final tomorrow. Summer courses.
3617,my grade average out of 4 exams was 100% 
3618,Some professors are just chill like that. I don't think it depends on which semester you're taking it.
3619,Ahh I guess that makes sense. I didn‚Äôt consider that cause mine don‚Äôt end until July 
3620,"Do they only do this in summer classes? Because at least at my university, we aren‚Äôt exempt from a final for having an A in the class. "
3621,I want to get that kinda grades once in my lifetime. Congrats btw!
3622,I recognize that course ID
3623,I feel second-hand relief from this
3624,My professors hand out emails like this exempting students from taking the final exam too. But the email says your attendance has been too low so I have failed you regardless of your exam grades.
3625,In my econ class last semester my exam scores were all 100% up to that point and I got an 80 on the final ending with a 3.5.
3626,How?
3627,I know some professors do it in the regular semesters. 
3628,"It happened once or twice. Some profs are chill and say the final only improves your grade. 

But you learn a lot by studying for the final "
3629,Taking my last final today during exchange in Korea. It‚Äôs awful
3630,[deleted]
3631,does this happen frequently in college? 
3632,"I had it happen once. Granted there were only 3 kids out of 100 with an A at that point. All three of them ended up being the top 3 students in the college by graduation, so I barely count that."
3633,"yeah same, the only grades we get in my classes are the midterm and final exam. Some classes have mandatory attendance, some might have a group presentation or a research paper but other than that nothing else contributes to your grade so there is no such thing as getting exempt from the final. Especially when your grade is curved with everyone else's..."
3634,I think OP's average was so high at this point that he had an A regardless.
3635,it's not a standard. 
3636,My final is next Thursday. Also summer courses 
3637,I‚Äôm wondering if you go to my school 
3638,Congrats. But also I can‚Äôt help but feel like someone might be trying to prank you? If I were you I‚Äôd double check to make sure that‚Äôs legit... but congrats regardless! 
3639,"I'm guessing someone at the opposite end of the curve also got an email like this, but it didn't contain the word ""Congratulations."""
3640,"I have a senior who is in his 5th year for a degree which normally would have ended in four. He had a argument with some prof regarding something about his final bachelor thesis project and pissed him off. He failed him for no reason whatsoever except ""on disciplinary grounds"". He is one of the more brilliant people in our college and seeing him struggle in the campus with no friends taking just one course for the whole semester was really tough to watch. "
3641,I go to University of South Florida 
3642,what a waste of his time and money....
3643,"How does that work? We only have exams twice where I live, so it would be impossible to be allowed to 'skip' one. Anyway, congrats!"
3644,wait hold up what? if you get an A in college (in us) you dont have to take the finals? what kind of sorcery is that?
3645,"Congratulations! You deserved it, and have a great summer "
3646,"Open up Insta right now and say ‚Äúhey, what do you think about going out to get sandwiches together. On a date.‚Äù You have to be clear that it‚Äôs a non-platonic date because guys are either oblivious or learned to err on the side of caution."
3647,Girl don't sit around and wait!!! Take your own shot
3648,"Alright, a lot of people are telling me to ask him out myself. I think I might do it!

Should I ask him out through dm? Or in-person?

And when exactly should I ask him? This weekend? After finals? My semester ends in May, so would it be best to wait until then?

I'm sorry, I've never asked out a guy before. It's always guys who ask ME out, not the other way around ;\_;"
3649,Very wholesome post
3650,Thank you for the update! I hope you go out and have sandwiches together next.
3651,ü§£ü§£ü§£ omg üíÄüíÄüíÄ you‚Äôd think they would be sandwiched out‚Ä¶
3652,im gonna need another update if y‚Äôall end up dating or becoming besties anything üò≠
3653,"Omg, I want an invite to your wedding because I hooked you two up!"
3654,"Bro just imagine in the future when you both have kids.
 They gne ask 

""Mom how did you and day meet?""

Your answer 

""For the love of sandwiches"""
3655,"As a guy, I don't think I could ever be sandwiched out"
3656,I might post an update depending on how things go!
3657,"Err on the side of caution is the perfect description. I went out with an old friend and didn't get told until weeks later that it was not just getting food, it was in fact a date."
3658,I hope so too ü•∫
3659,In person!!! This weekend maybe make plans for after finals?? (No stress and solely focus on the date)
3660,"If he makes you another sandwich, you could make him yet another one back but put a piece of paper in it asking him out."
3661,as a human being you cannot be sandwiched out regardless
3662,"Just ask for a Study date. It‚Äôs def classic- see if y‚Äôall vibe on a little deeper level than sandwich exchanges lol. If it goes well, get his number at the end. text when u get back to ur room thanking him for his help, and as if he wants to (non-study activity here).

As far as the timing, ya it‚Äôs not great, but what can u do? Better to act now than let any spark fade over the break. plus if it goes well, it‚Äôs something both of y‚Äôall can look forward to when u get back!"
3663,aww thats awesome
3664,Ship sailed. Sandwiches to lovers speedrun
3665,"If you followed my advice and made him wings you would've been engaged by now.

Happy update just the same."
3666,Why don‚Äôt you do it?
3667,This is so freaking cute. üò≠
3668,You have to really be explicit. Even if you take off your clothes and start having crazy sex on the bed she could just be being polite. Maybe she‚Äôs Canadian!
3669,You guys get asked out..?
3670,"This is so cute, thanks for the update!!"
3671,Just ask him out. Why does he have to do it?
3672,Save wings for a few dates in. Hit me up for some killer wing sauce recipes when it is time. You got this!
3673,"Good call making it clear that it's a date. As a guy, I can confirm that I'd assume it's platonic just to be cautious unless I'm actually told it's a date lol"
3674,Omg that‚Äôs cuteü§£
3675,This is so wholesome i love it

3677,"Thank you for saying this. I am a prof myself and have zero interest in either assigning or reading papers on the topic of COVID. 

There are well-meaning (I'm sure) colleagues of mine out there who think it's a good way to recognize the role of trauma and blah blah blah. I disagree."
3678,Yasssss. I work in a business school and someone wanted us to do a cawe competition with a covid theme- I told them I explicitly did NOT want that. There‚Äôs enough covid In Our lives. And now my students get a really cool case that has nothing to do with covid :)
3679,Our Resident Advisor for our dorm made the door placards mask with our names on them lmao. God forbid it be something fun.
3680,Oh God. Not the diff eq courses!! Glad your prof was flexible about it though
3681,"I only have one class that talked about Covid, but it was actually valid. It's a marketing and promotion class for the music industry, and the professor was talking about how Covid affected the industry and asked us our opinions on what will happen to the industry. The class was very involved and interested in the conversation because it's actually a huge deal to us. Classes like that, that teach us about something that was directly affected by the virus, should be the only ones to talk about it"
3682,"Daaamn as a former RA I wouldn't dare, it's creative in an almost insensitively morbid way."
3683,"> Although we're all insanely sick of the current situation, isn't it sort of ""nice"" that we're actually leaning something that we can see is applicable to real-world situations? 

I do appreciate the irony of how people used to complain how schools should teach more things with ""real-world applications,"" but now when they do, no one wants to use it. I have more appreciation for the math teacher who said you don't need ""real-world applications"" to get students interested in learning, you just need to create interesting problems."
3684,"I get some r/catsonkeyboards vibe from that huge number, yet random number"
3685,"Thank you for being so sensitive of your students' mental health. You don't say whether you're in a field that might actually be well served by incorporating COVID into the curriculum, but regardless, thank you for resisting the temptation."
3686,I'm in psychology. So COVID would fit in many ways. But I'm just not going there.
3687,"To be fair, that actually has a fair bit of relevance at the moment. COVID is doing some funky things to housing markets all over the world, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs entirely off base."
3688,"I get this, I really do. Of course, my microbiology class did it, as well, but for obviously good reasons. Although we're all insanely sick of the current situation, isn't it sort of ""nice"" that we're actually leaning something that we can see is applicable to real-world situations? I'm not convinced that a college education is normally like that, at least from a student's standpoint..."
3689,Or coffee and colorectal cancer.
3690,"I was annoyed with this during my MPH as well. I went into epidemiology wanting to learn more about zoonotic diseases, but most of the professors were focused on hypertension and diabetes. At the time I found that exceptionally boring, but then I started getting into marginalized populations affected by hepatitis C."
3691,[deleted]
3692,"to be fair, im in an honors course but my lab (yes my LAB, not even the lecture) prof is having us write a paper on a certain inhibitor and binding site of a covid19 protein using ochem language. then she wants us to modify it so it works better like homie wants us to cure covid19 or something as a project lol"
3693,"Don't worry. They'll stop caring about coronavirus research the second things go back to normal. People tried developing vaccines after CoV-1 and grant agencies were like ""lol why tho? it's not like we'll have to deal with this ever again.""

It's the joys of life science research. People don't care if you can't tie something to cancer or a major world event."

3695,SARS-CoV-1 from 02-03
3696,"I loved diffeq! But yes, he is an amazing instructor."
3697,"I‚Äôve had to give a presentation and write two papers on COVID. So tired of it. My summer class had us write 7 page papers and teachers going to put it in the school archives for future generations to use as references because you know, no pressure or anything."
3698,"It is nice in that I can read the news and communicate with my native speaking friends in the target language about the situation and better understand everything, so trust me, I do appreciate the real-world relevance aspect. I guess I'd just prefer it to be on my terms if I want to look up the vocabulary and regulations myself in small doses, not as part of a lengthy homework assignment. Given the difficult and all-consuming nature of the ""real-world"" right now, every moment I can go without thinking about the pandemic is a hard-fought win. 

There's already more than enough to cover in a world language class without adding this in an attempt to make the class more relevant. It's one thing to be studying engineering and your calculus class has engineering-focused problem sets that are real-world applicable, it's quite another to be bombarded out of nowhere with relatively tangential in-depth pandemic protocol in a world language class. 

Covering COVID in microbio or other science/health focused classes makes complete sense though, and I'm certainly not advocating missing out on the opportunity to teach students material in a new way incorporating COVID if it's going to benefit them long-term in their specific studies or future careers."
3699,My data analytics professor wants us to use COVID related data for our final project üôÑ
3700,"Same,major oof."
3701,Are they badly made üòÇ
3702,I made mine Lysol wipe containers!
3703,"So, you're  all getting A's for effort right? No, but for real.. dont doubt your ability to think just because your a student and don't  have your degree. Sometimes having a wealth of knowledge pummeled into your brain CAN make a difference on how you think of things. You guys as students can come up with just as good theories as any scientist. Children are literally little scientists from the time they are toddlers, so those ideas always flow. Sometimes stepping back and realizing that just because you have a degree doesn't mean that you can think abstractly. So, don't ever think a question is a stupid question. You never know, it could be as simple as figuring out something that prevents the virus from hooking into the cells.  I know d-mannose does it for UTI strains of bacteria... Now I'm not biologist or virologist, but its a simple idea. You got this!"
3704,"My major is actually Music Industry, so yes. My major covers pretty much all aspects of the industry, from working in a studio to working on live tours. We all want to be in the industry, and we're learning about how much it's being destroyed, which really sucks. The people in my major are so amazing and talented and it sucks to see our dreams basically being destroyed"
3705,"I loved diffeq, too. I took it at the same time as calc 3, both with the same prof. He was quite good in both."
3706,This is a really nice painting!
3707,"This is a awesome painting! I love the sparse brushy strokes! I wish I could paint as a relax activity, but I'm in fine arts lol."
3708,"Tysm! It's my first time painting since like art class in grade school xD So much fun, I'd recommend it!"
3709,I‚Äôve maxed my credit card and have zero dollars. How do I chill out for free?
3710,I do this and I‚Äôm still behind if I take even a day off.
3711,Thank you! It's from a Bob Ross tutorial haha
3712,"IDK what your schedule or situation is like, but if possible, take a few days to get in as much work done as you possibly can‚Äîwork ahead, even‚Äîso you can give yourself at least a day or two off a week."
3713,"If you're on campus, see if any clubs or the school is hosting fun events. Not only are they free, but they provide an opportunity to meet new people!"
3714,Bob ross that you?
3715,Thanks for this reminder!! I am an introvert but honestly forget that I need to take time for myself
3716,"I desperately needed a day off so I spent all of Friday reading for leisure. Unfortunately it bled into Saturday and I spent 3/4 of Sat reading too, lmao.

But yes, unwinding is super important. I definitely feel more rejuvenated.

Also: great painting! You‚Äôre very talented!"
3717,Art always frustrates me. I always do an activity that I don‚Äôt care much about.
3718,W-what mental health?
3719,You have time for downtime?
3720,It‚Äôs funny when you‚Äôre slipping in school so stepdad takes away everything you use to relax so you can‚Äôt de-stress
3721,[deleted]
3722,Took a bath yesterday with candles. Afterwards I ate some chocolate and slept like a baby. Feeling so much better!
3723,"If you enjoy videos, watching YouTube always makes me happy. There's a channel for everything you can imagine so it's not hard to find something you're into. I recently found out that watching car detailing videos relaxes me lol but whatever floats your boat."
3724,"good question. I'm sure there's something for ya that's free. probably more things free than paid imo ex.walks, meeting up with socially distanced friends etc."
3725,"Even if you aren‚Äôt on campus (in reference to xxxHarZxxx‚Äôs reply), check to see if your school or the clubs is hosting something digitally! For example, next week, my school‚Äôs Student Activities board is hosting a Movie Night on Zoom, and some weeks ago, they hosted a painting activity by Zoom, and you could go to the school to pick up supplies to paint at home.

You can also go to Eventbrite to discover events being hosted and use filters to find events near you, online events, free events, etc. and the search bar to look for specific things. I‚Äôve seen plenty of free to attend events on there."
3726,I literally came to the comments to ask if this was made from a bob ross video hahaha it looked like his style
3727,That‚Äôs what I do 24/7 haha
3728,Thank you. Highly appreciated
3729,Just started painting :)
3730,So hard to relax I‚Äôm on fire lmao
3731,It's really important to unwind ourselves and be in the moment for once. Thanks for the reminder! Love the painting !!üòç
3732,I took a 1 credit yoga class to give myself at least an hour every week that is dedicated to relaxing. Would definitely recommend it!
3733,You are very good at painting!
3734,What if im failing :(
3735,That's why I'm not gonna be a student very longer
3736,It was a lab and I had the professor last semester for the level 1 version of the class so I knew exactly what they wanted and how to do it.
3737,[deleted]
3738,"If it's general education then I don't mind, in fact I welcome it. I already have enough pressure doing my major specific courses. I like to take general education classes seriously but sometimes duty calls and I need to get my priorities straight."
3739,Not if your goal is to learn.  A freebie class that doesn't teach me anything is a waste of my time.
3740,[deleted]
3741,I agree but it also  depends on the class. Some students might struggle in there while you find it easy. When I took petrophysics I slept everyday and got an A while others had to bust ass for a C
3742,My GPA needs stuff like this
3743,"I am also taking sociology and having a similar experience. I'm currently at an A-, I never pay attention in class, haven't taken notes since the second week and I don't participate in the in class group activities because talking to a stranger irl is a fate worse than death for me"
3744,"That‚Äôs awesome! Good job and good luck w/ finishing out the semester!

edit: whoops this does sound like it‚Äôs not fundamentally wrong. It‚Äôs bad to be able to get an A with one days of work, but nonetheless it‚Äôs great to have gotten an A!"
3745,"It leads to some super crappy scenarios. More than once I have had to treat major classes I was genuinely really excited about like you described, because I had to put a ridiculous amount of time and energy into a non major class (looking at you calculus...). I‚Äôm not saying it didn‚Äôt deserve effort. I‚Äôm just saying I can‚Äôt focus on what I am there for because I‚Äôm drowning in side quests."
3746,And money
3747,"Yeah I don‚Äôt think every class needs to be an intense, painful experience..."
3748,No there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs heaven LOL
3749,"All of my communications tests were open note/open book take on your own time sort of things, and every question was already on quizlet. Guess who stopped studying after week 1."
3750,"Nothing wrong here. You demonstrated an intimate knowledge of the tools, techniques and materials needed to accomplish the task, and did so to a more than acceptable level. In real world terms, your ‚Äúmanager‚Äù assigned you a project with a deadline and you met their expectation, delivered on time."
3751,This. Some classes you can put off and get a good grade with minimal input. Others you can't. I'm perfectly happy with that.
3752,[deleted]
3753,Hard agree
3754,That seems a little extreme.
3755,[deleted]
3756,[deleted]
3757,So it was only a one hour class? That's not that weird then because you should spend about 1 hour per week over 15 weeks. You spent 8 or 9 but that's because you said you already knew the material so I'm sure it took your classmates longer than that.
3758,"Here is the problem I think:

1. If you can get your work done after you master the materials higher than the question standard, then I think either you're overqualified for the course, or the course shouldn't exist in the first place.
2. Else if you get the work done but you have 0 understanding of the course, well... let's say it's more than a waste of tuition.
3. Else you will learn the materials after by yourself, or you think you definitely have other focuses that are more right now, maybe your work or digging in to some theories, or any other things you genuinely feel worthy, then... GOOD JOB!"

3760,Not for your GPA
3761,"My friends and I called these ""Buy an A"" classes."
3762,"I did state govnt class like this. Read all the chapters, wrote all the papers and took all the quizzes and tests in one marathon run of a day at the library. I saw nothing wrong with it. I did all the work."
3763,"I have been taking online exclusively for 2 years and theres always at least one or two classes like that every semester. Several times I've searched a question from homework on google to help me understand the steps and found the whole assignment and the next online. I didnt use it or anything, but I dont know if I'd be that honest if I forgot to study. Its insane and I'm a procrastinator so I get almost everything done day of and it's the worst. I hate online school but I cant commute."
3764,"I feel like it lessens the value of a degree honestly. I also agree with your statement. I don‚Äôt want a degree cuz I paid money for it, I want it because I put in the work and effort for it."
3765,My first year of grad school we had a class so notoriously difficult that the professors of both of our other classes purposely designed their classes to be less strenuous.
3766,[deleted]
3767,"You‚Äôve got a good professor right there, and having those people around really means a lot."
3768,I‚Äôm really hoping all of my professors are as understanding as this one
3769,"I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your grandpa, and I‚Äôm so glad you have more understanding professors than I did! I ended up having a decent allergic reaction during a mandatory seminar for my college of Ed, and was told to just go get some Benadryl at the Walgreens and suck it up."
3770,I‚Äôm sorry for what you‚Äôre going through and I send good vibes to you and yours.
3771,[deleted]
3772,Thank you. I think it helps I have otherwise perfect attendance and really try hard in class- I‚Äôm sure if I‚Äôd skipped half the classes she wouldn‚Äôt be so understanding.
3773,"Hugs OP! I lost my grandpa a bit over a month ago (also stage 4 cancer) so I know how much the hospice part sucks, especially trying to juggle classes with being there as much as possible. Sorry your family is dealing with this."
3774,"No worries, I‚Äôve replied elsewhere in the thread with the text of my letter- I figured just being blunt about what was happening was the way to go. When I had to leave class to put my cat down last semester I wrote something along the same lines apologizing for leaving class early and my professor still gave me attendance points even though I was only in a three hour class for maybe 15 minutes."
3775,I did this too and ended up having to withdraw
3776,"From what I‚Äôve heard, most professors would just send an email like 
‚ÄúSend proof
-sent from my iPhone‚Äù
So it‚Äôs refreshing to see someone genuinely care and be helpful."
3777,"I sent something along the lines of:

Professor,
My grandfather has finally chosen to stop chemotherapy and hospice at home through the next week. Due to the limitations of his health and the abilities of my family to provide care and comfort during this time I am most likely going to miss some classes during the last few weeks. If I miss any tests, I would appreciate the ability to take them in the testing center but I understand if that‚Äôs not a possibility. Thank you for your understanding- I will still be studying lecture material and reviewing PowerPoints for any lectures missed, and I‚Äôm sorry for any inconvenience this will cause you.

Many thanks,

U/hella_happy

It helps I go to a small school and sit in the front row, as well as take advantage of office hours."
3778,"Thank you. He‚Äôs spent more of the last two months in the hospital than he has at home and he‚Äôs ready to be out of pain. We‚Äôll hopefully have a week or so to say goodbye and help him make sense of his life so far, and try to comfort him. It sucks, but hospice has been wonderful so far, as well as he hospital he was receiving treatment at."
3779,The fact that basic human decency is so rare is troubling. Your professor is a good egg.
3780,My professor would tell me to fuck off üò≠üò≠
3781,"Whenever a Professor is an ass the entire sub says ""report him to the Chair/Dean""; fair enough, but here's a thing: report this sweet sweet human person to the Chair/Dean. They deserve recognition as much ass the assholes deserve condemnation."
3782,"Definitely! I wish you the best of luck with your grandfather, and on those exams."
3783,Honestly that‚Äôs what I was expecting
3784,"OP, your family is in my heart rn. Sending good vibes your way. Went thru this same exact thing while my father was passing this time last year. It's encouraging to see that professors at other universities are handling this the same way. Gives me hope for humanity."
3785,"Would appreciate if you could describe or tell us how you informed the professor of this by email. Maybe, I'm reading it into too much but a professor would definitely evaluate how a student would write this email. Especially, if this is a large lecture hall and you don't know the professor too well."
3786,"I was in this exact same situation. All of my professors were quite understanding, it was nice and very much needed."
3787,I‚Äôm sorry. One of my profs did not give me any extensions when my grandpa died.
3788,I love to have professors that actually care about the wellbeing of their students. üòä
3789,"Wow what an awesome professor, also my condolences. For a second I thought this was r/HumansBeingBros"
3790,"I am sorry to hear about your grandfather- I hope he passes in peace and surrounded by love ones. The hospice nurses will take good care of him, it takes a special someone to work in that field. I am a nursing student and my oncology rotation was rough. Cancer sucks. 

Your professor is very understanding in this hard time and if there's anything a teacher can teach their student, that would be it."
3791,"Me: Hey, I might have to get my appendix removed and I got pneumonia, can you drop me from the class or give me an extension?

&#x200B;

College: N O"
3792,That is very nice of your professors.
3793,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost 2 out of 4 of my grandparents to cancer after they fought multiple battles with it. One step at a time with grieving, and good vibes/prayers/whatever you need your way. üíï

Awesomeness that your professor was so understanding!"
3794,Going through the exact same thing as you right now:(
3795,<3 I love when professors actually have souls.
3796,In one of my classes the other week some rando was playing COD or some other FPS game while on mic. The prof couldn‚Äôt care less and told everyone that he will just mute the rando
3797,"Shit. It‚Äôs going shit. In my BIT-430: Business Analytics I will go from a 98% to a 76% in the matter of two assignments simply because I cannot figure out this damn software that we are required to use for the last two assignments. Professor, google, YouTube, and Chegg are of no help. It is safe to say that I am pissed off"
3798,[deleted]
3799,"The host of a zoom meeting can mute people, stop their video, and even kick them out of the meeting. If schools are going to have professors use zoom and they‚Äôve  never used it before, they should offer them a ‚Äúzoom 101‚Äù information session where they learn information like this."
3800,"I get that some classes utilize discussions, but it‚Äôs a complete waste when it just becomes a disaster. I just pre record lectures and have a Q&A discussion board where I post video responses."
3801,Does it have a Pinocchio doll in it?
3802,"Statistical package for the social sciences?   

I used a version of that in the 1980s."
3803,Yeah that‚Äôs been happening to a lot of zoom meetings. Somehow random people get access to them just to cause trouble. A big lecture meeting at my school got hacked and they started playing child pornography
3804,Korben üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
3805,"There are *tons* of resources for learning Zoom available even if the school doesn't explicitly offer or require them. A professor taking this long to learn the basics of very simple software is inexcusable. If they expect students to be able to take 3-5 courses in this trying time (while often *also* getting experience with new software and online learning experiences) and still expect to test them/hold them to similar standards as before, students have every right to hold their professors to the same standard of adaptability and learning. This far in there is no excuse for professors failing at basic use of Zoom."
3806,My English professor just now after like 5 weeks is holding her first Zoom meeting because there was no help and she had to figure everything out herself...
3807,IBM SPSS Modeler
3808,What's the software?
3809,"There are ""zoom 101"" seminars. But many, especially older professors, still find it challenging.   


I tell my colleagues that when something go wrong unexpectedly, it might just be the internet glitching. Often they over-troubleshoot and create more problem, when wait 20 seconds could've resolved the issue."
3810,"After something like that happened the last week of last quarter, our school made the whole staff take like a daylong mandatory zoom training. It's been so much better ever since. I'd think more schools would do that"
3811,Didn‚Äôt know if you saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/fntlv4/aww/)
3812,"Exactly! I want to know where these gosh darned  rabble-rousers that everyone talks about are!

All jokes aside, in my Modern Physics class everyone is left unmuted >50% percent of the time and we are all very respectful of that responsibility. People take turns responding to questions without needing to raise their hands, are silent otherwise, and mute themselves if someone comes into the room they're in.


 I see these videos of people trolling in Zoom classes and I just can't imagine what kind of person it takes to actively try to disrupt the class that they paid for and need a good grade in. This is university, people. You're going back (hopefully) in the fall. You think your professors and classmates take kindly to your disrespect toward them? I guess in a very large university (and choice of major) there's less accountability, but still...why can't some people act like adults?"
3813,I had to leave my chemistry class like that too. I am not doing so well under these conditions.
3814,"Eh, my classes use voice for questions, discussion, etc, it's never been a problem for us."
3815,I feel bad for you and the professor. My professor is also having a hard time with Zoom and I feel bad for her because she really wants to have a discussion with us.
3816,[deleted]
3817,Timezones exist so:)
3818,That makes way too much sense
3819,"Based on the interface and usability, we‚Äôre probably using the same version of SPSS today. 

My school made us access SPSS through their remote access VPN, apparently also designed in the 80s. Getting the thing actually working felt like I was involved in building ARPANET."
3820,Ohhh hahahah I misunderstood. That's so cute!
3821,"I know nothing of what this IBM thing is, but if I learned anything in engineering, the Indian guy on YouTube knows what's up.

3823,Derp faces lmao üòÇ
3824,"i have a discussion class and the professor consistently cancels at least once a week and changes the schedule without notice, affecting the responses i‚Äôm supposed to have turned in before class. kind of hard to turn in the right one when i don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre discussing."
3825,"I feel bad for all students and teachers right now. Schools are not giving their staff enough information on how to work Zoom and for people that aren‚Äôt tech savvy it‚Äôs a struggle to figure out. My professor decided Zoom was too complicated so she recorded videos for our last unit. But I would‚Äôve been able to do so much better on the last test had it been Zoom lectures. But I really can‚Äôt blame the staff, I blame the school for not having resources prepared for the teachers and students.

Unrelated to college, my sister teaches 4th grade at a very poor school where most of the parents are migrant workers and very undereducated. She‚Äôs teaching her class via Zoom right now and even though students were provided equipment and internet if they didn‚Äôt have it previously, she said about half of her class hasn‚Äôt been participating. When she started reaching out to those families individually, she found most of them couldn‚Äôt figure out how to work Zoom so their kids haven‚Äôt been on. And I feel so bad for these kids, most of them enroll into school late and leave the year early because they go wherever their parents go, and their parents are in no position to educate them. Some really bright students are left behind because our system doesn‚Äôt have a way to help them."
3826,Thanks hun!! I will be updating periodically and hopefully will see your name!! üòç
3827,Congrats!! üçæüéâ

3856,"this is a professor who writes and reviews fanfiction, in the best way possible."
3857,"Writing prof here. It's a shame that your prof's comment makes others here uncomfortable. When you do good, sometimes it makes others excited. Accept the compliment. You deserve it.

Also, college is a place where some professors aim to have an equal relationship with students, including using an informal tone. You're young adults, entering peerhood with us. You teach us as much as we teach you. It's not creepy. Human connection makes the world run.

Finally, I'll agree with another comment that it's rare to find a student who actually gives a shit about their writing AND has natural talent/works hard at it. As fellow writing nerds, we get excited to see another human join our tribe!

Keep writing. At 35, my written and interpersonal communication ""soft"" skills have gotten me literally every job I've ever had. Those skills are more valuable than society tells you. Don't let anyone diminish them."
3858,I will never get that compliment
3859,"Oh my god yes, this gives off such a fanfic comment vibe"
3860,"That's what's up man! Congrats! 

~ the only time I ever received a compliment was for a play I had to do and I wrote all of it 15 pages ( in 1 night ) just for me to realize on the next day that only main ideas and drafts were do :(. People literally cane in with just a title lol. I stayed up all night so I guess in the end it was worth it for the grade and compliment"
3861,Great writing skills! üíØ:)
3862,Sounds more like a peer to peer review and not a professor
3863,"To be fair, the writing professors (especially the creative writing ones) get so excited when people take the class seriously. 

I thought my undergrad professor was going to cry when she saw me use a semicolon correctly."
3864,"yall are weird haha! my professor was pretty young (maybe 27/28?) and no, she had no attraction to me as this was a completely online class‚Ä¶ she was just super sweet! most people who take her class agree that she is one of the best. she might be friendly, but she‚Äôs also a good professor. nothing more or less to it :)"
3865,That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking!
3866,"Ah nice, makes me want to read your writing ngl haha"
3867,it‚Äôs not surprisingly! she was a super cool (and young) professor which is probably why she worded the compliment that way haha
3868,Lol what the hell that‚Äôs pretty weird
3869,"This. I love making comments like this on papers because I wish I had gotten more positive, encouraging feedback when I was in school. 

Ignore the haters and take pride in your work. üòä"
3870,"I dunno bro, they didn't even use punctuation. /s"
3871,\*unzips in anticipation\*
3872,How‚Äôs that creepy??
3873,Yeah it‚Äôs a compliment but it‚Äôs toooo much of a compliment
3874,"Is it a crime to better relate to your students and be encouraging and positive toward their work? I would love if my professors were more personable, and I don‚Äôt see how leaving a friendly comment about an assignment is unprofessional. 

You can be respectful and professional without being a cold, distant, sore thumb."
3875,Is it the lack of formality?
3876,least negative r/college user
3877,what üòÉ
3878,"It's unfortunate this response garners such uncomfortable feelings with some.

I truly feel like this type of encouraging and uplifting form of feedback should be the backbone of education, higher or not. Not because it panders, but because it builds someone's skillset up so they can improve it further.

If a professor is gonna dedicate their time to specifically give you credit where its due and not a generic response, that is so much better than a grade and it shows the respect your professor has in your work. I'd take a comment like this and a B paper over no comment or feedback and an A. 

People grow with communication and this was a beautiful way to initiate both growth and communication for this student. Exuberance being overbearing and inappropriate is mostly taught by old grumps as tales of social etiquette. We simply adopt that thinking as socially approved because the stubborn and dry people before us taught us that is how you talk. Doesn't mean it's correct or even an effective outline in determining correspondence appropriateness. 

BREAK THE MOOOOOLD."
3879,"Don‚Äôt sweat people thinking it‚Äôs weird, that‚Äôs a dope compliment. I‚Äôd probably save it to an ‚ÄòI love me‚Äô document or print it out, compliments don‚Äôt come every day!"
3880,"It's giving ""cool grad student TA"""
3881,"Any professor compliment is a good one‚Ä¶ but one that‚Äôs as enthusiastic and in-depth as this? go you, OP. You must be something special"
3882,"Congrats OP, I've personally found the younger professors can be really cool sometimes.

My bcalc professor is only like 10-15 years older than me (non traditional student) and answers all my math questions and even records personal videos to explain concepts and where I went wrong!

He'll even look at my work and be like hey right here this is where you went wrong, and lets me finish the work!"
3883,Is your prof like 19
3884,üòÇüòè
3885,This is cute. I want to read your paper now too
3886,"Why is it always physics. Same here as well !
Legit i study the most in this subject to get a basic understanding of concept and still get bad grade"
3887,Had one that was two or three weeks worth of quizzes behind on grading when we went into the final. So I had no idea if I had actually known the material I was gonna be doing an exam on. That was fun. We had quizzes every Friday.
3888,"It ruins my week if not more

Because everything i‚Äôve done for half a semester is now worthless and 35% of my grade is now irreparable"
3889,"Depends on how u study imo. Like if I studied for a week, a few hours a day, and really put the effort into it (office hours/tutors/etc) to get a shit grade, oooooh boy I feel. ESPECIALLY when the prof gives you weird times to see ur grades/withholds the test from you its wack on so many levels. 

But if one crams for 10 hours the night before the exam, idk chief thats just bad planning... Idk one person who has done that successfully"
3890,"Same for physics majors, if it makes you feel any better. Dedicated my life to physics this term. Luckily it mostly paid off, but physics is hard for 99.9% of people"
3891,I love the professors that go over the tests with you.
3892,">But if one crams for 10 hours the night before the exam, idk chief thats just bad planning... Idk one person who has done that successfully

Very true. I haven't tried something like that since high school. Always ends in a disaster."
3893,"I‚Äôm sorry, the iNtEgRiTy is more important because the department wants to use a question bank for next semester /s"
3894,"I‚Äôd rather bomb an exam I didn‚Äôt study for than this. When you don‚Äôt study, you know it‚Äôs coming and you can always think ‚ÄúI would of done alright if I tried‚Äù. 

When this happens, it makes it look like your best wasn‚Äôt good enough and it feels terrible."
3895,"Honestly my best exams are the ones where I study the night or two before but my worst ones are the ones I‚Äôve been spending weeks studying. I think it really does depend on how you study. Some people review their notes and think that their brain absorbed everything. I always go to class so I pretty much know that material but I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúlearnt‚Äù it. That‚Äôs why the night or two before, I quiz myself on everything (textbook questions, quizlet, etc). People just don‚Äôt experiment or want to improve. They just want marks given to them. They gotta realize that you have to constantly look for better ways to study if you want a better grade"
3896,"I hate to say it, but most engineering disciplines will be like that too. Though, for engineering, the abstract aspect goes away mostly after graduation when you work on practical projects. They still want you to learn the theory behind it in school. 

I will say this: if you‚Äôre interested in physics OR engineering, and just feeling disheartened because you didn‚Äôt expect the difficulty or nature of the material, you‚Äôre not alone. Keep pushing through if it‚Äôs what you want to do. I believe in you, stranger. Your brain will adapt to a new way of learning and while it doesn‚Äôt get easier overall, you‚Äôll find that your ability to think and learn will grow quite rapidly. 

There is a lot of overlap between physics and the engineering disciplines in terms of topics covered. That being said, a quick and dirty distinction between the type of learning is that in physics you‚Äôre concerned more with the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and the ‚Äúhow‚Äù, whereas in engineering you‚Äôre more focused on the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and the *applications* of that knowledge to industry and commercial processes. 

If you don‚Äôt know you want to do one or the other, just ask yourself first if you would find quantum mechanics (quantized energy states, Q tunneling, Q harmonic oscillators, etc.), and particle physics (quarks and all that) more fulfilling than say chemical reactor design (such as in chemical engineering) or structural mechanics (mechanical engineering, civil probably, etc). And, after school (assuming you want to work in the field your degree is focused on) would you rather go on to graduate school (usually needed to work as a physicist) where you‚Äôll be working mostly in labs or would you rather be working for a company after your bachelors with a wider range of variance in how technical or focused your work is (engineering)? Most engineers say their work isn‚Äôt nearly as abstract or intense as their undergrad education was, but that can also mean sometimes leaning toward more mundane tasks, such as working with spreadsheets or going to meetings and things like that. 
 
I should make a clearer distinction, though. For just a bachelors, engineering is much more employable unless you‚Äôre okay with straying outside the world of physics and engineering for your career. 
I hope this helps, as much of a ramble as it is."
3897,"""learning from your mistakes"" has never been part of a college education"
3898,"This is me right now. I was doing really well in my math class on all my tests but the final was such a train wreck. It was stuff i‚Äôd almost never seen before on any assignments or reviews. It‚Äôs almost like he picked the hardest questions out of the concept to put in there. The average for all previous tests was like 80 - 85 but on the final it was a whopping 60.

My grade fucking tanked and the professor sees nothing wrong with it and refuses to curve it"
3899,[deleted]
3900,"I went back to college towards the end of my 20s and in my first semester back I had to take college algebra. I was in a PANIC because not only was I never really good at math it had been like 10 years since I had done anything more than count on my fingers. I studied SO hard for the first exam, I took the practice test like 12 times and I ended up with a 64. I walked out of class in tears because I felt so hopeless about completing the class and I NEEDED at least a C for my degree requirements. 

Ultimately, it did get better and I did really well in the class but that first test broke my heart. I have never felt more stupid then when I walked out of that test. 

The best advice I can give is to see if your school offers academic coaching. I ended up meeting with a coach who helped me figure out more efficient study techniques that helped me learn the material better."
3901,"Yeah, it completely obliterates your self-confidence."
3902,Aka the professor uses the same exact exam year after year
3903,"Have you reached out to the professor to see them in office hours so that you can go over your exam?  I tell my students that even though they don't get their tests back in class, I am always willing to sit down with them and go over their exam with them. Otherwise, how can they learn from their mistakes?

I would ask the chair of the department if the professor WON'T go over the exam with you, in their office.  They may not want you to look at the exam on your own, but they should be willing to help you figure out what you did wrong."
3904,That‚Äôs what I was told from people who graduated. But professors still say it around me.
3905,">Idk one person who has done that successfully

You must not have met me"
3906,"Ugh! Yes! I needed a 75% in a finance class to pass onto the next class in the curriculum‚Äôs sequence and I got a 72%. Now I have to take the course again. The course started in late December and I finished assignments the course last week. I spent no less than 3 hours daily‚Äîno breaks‚Äîstudying the entire time and I still failed. This is the worst and I want all of that time and effort back üòÇ 

The university‚Äôs format of this class is not great. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúweed out‚Äù course but is place very late in the curriculum. After this class, I have three more courses to take before graduation. So why have a weed out class this late in the curriculum!? Gah! From how other students speak, almost no one passes on the first try, which is pretty lame and further illustrates that there needs to be an overhaul of how information is presented."
3907,I know a lot of peers who still do and bitch about it‚Ä¶ we are seniors :/
3908,"That's why I don't study much, I'm never too disappointed by bad grades. I'm half joking but I definitely think this plays part in reinforcing my procrastination."
3909,"Ah, this is my current class. My prof is great actually he's just extremely forgetful and the entire class badgers him every day for our grades back. I studied so hard for my first test only to be presented with questions in a very foreign format from the material we were studying and some of them I just couldn't tell what they were asking. Classmates had the same experience."
3910,"I learned that it had a lot to do with my sleep, if I stayed up too late and got less than 6 hours I would miss questions I knew the answer to! After I prioritized at least 6 hours of sleep my gpa went from 2.0 to 3.5"
3911,"Find out your learning style. You could be studying the wrong way. My learning styles are visual and kinesthetic. I can‚Äôt learn by just repeating flashcards. I have to watch videos, make matching games, write on my white board. I found out the hard way that my studying wasn‚Äôt effective"
3912,Same here. I'm a junior math major and my worst grades so far have been in Physics I and Physics II. Bombed every Phys II test no matter how hard I studied
3913,"I have a lab from January that hasn‚Äôt been graded. Our first exam was almost a month ago and crickets‚Ä¶ I have no idea what my grade is in this class and no idea if I‚Äôm getting anything right. It‚Äôd be nice to know if I‚Äôm doing poorly before the withdraw date which may have already passed‚Ä¶

Anyway, I feel you."
3914,"physics is not for all. I tell that to all my physics students on day 1, that they should be open to the possibility to drop the class. It is better to be upfront with the students, than see them suffer and crumble in pressure."
3915,"Yes...it's frustrating to put effort into something and then not reap the rewards for your effort. It's also difficult because it's hard to make changes to get a better grade next time when the professor/peer says something along the lines of ""you just need to study more""...

i'll admit it: i feel much less motivated to study for a class after i study and get a bad grade. i want to make changes, but it's hard when you know in your heart that you tried your hardest.

Especially with STEM stuff...for me it was physics, chem, and calc---yikes..."
3916,"Dude same, i feel like im just copying words that i hear and taking tests on info that doesn‚Äôt matter, it just feels superficial."
3917,"Yeah I'm thinking it's probably a good bit to do with pandemic fever. Everyone is just bored and tired of the same old thing everyday, the lack of movement, lack of socializing etc and that has caused us all to just feel mentally drained which ultimately leads to making us feel physically drained."
3918,Yea .. 4 weeks left in the semester and it‚Äôs just feeling stale. No spring break so it‚Äôs just been the same tediousness everyday for almost 3 months. I‚Äôm about to start getting really busy again studying for my finals and preparing final assignments and I just don‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore. Exhausted and feel like semester should have ended weeks ago.
3919,"I‚Äôm fucking exhausted and tired of getting so much work. I currently have to work on 2 essays, a math project, and a programming project.  When I tell the professors I‚Äôm tired and to give us a break, they‚Äôre like ‚Äúlol deal with it‚Äù.

Like I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a win win if professors don‚Äôt give us work...they don‚Äôt have to grade it and we‚Äôre not as stressed out."
3920,[deleted]
3921,yeah. I was failing four of my classes and finally just decided to try and get a medical exemption for mental health because my depression and anxiety was absolutely through the roof.
3922,"Yea, it‚Äôs a cycle of being tired and taking breaks but then ending up stressed due to feeling really behind on things."
3923,Relate to this so hard. I‚Äôm like a robot just completing my tasks
3924,"Most of school, college, and office work is pointless bullshit and worthless hoops to jump through for a paycheck.  We need a serious restructuring.

My trigonometry class keeps wanting me to hand graph things when I own a graphing calculator and it's a 100% online class."
3925,"This couldn‚Äôt be more true. Honestly I felt I learned little to nothing over this and the past semester where classes were all held remotely. There are simply no any incentives for me to focus on online lectures where it‚Äôs so easy to get distracted (many times I unconsciously start playing my phone or begin watching random YouTube videos)...

My college will almost entirely switch back to in-person teaching this fall, but unfortunately I‚Äôm graduating this May..."
3926,"Good for you, mental health is more important then ever now that we are alone for a huge portion of the day. You will sort it out"
3927,Absolutely. I get frustrated doing the same things. I try to jazz it up with hobbies but it‚Äôs not easy.
3928,I can't believe some colleges decided not to have a Spring break. Everybody needs time to decompress.
3929,"Coffee works wonders. But it might be because I drink too much. I am brimming with energy throughout the day and blaze through stuff once I have some cups of joe, the only side effect is a big crash and missing that alert feeling at the end of the day. This choice is up to you but it works well for me. I was feeling really tired during the pandemic but I started experimenting with different blends and such and it's become a small hobby of mine! Definitely though though, I've been in college for a year online and it's getting really tough now."
3930,"Yes. I‚Äôm not retaining the information, I‚Äôm tired all the time, my grades are all dropping so close to finals and it‚Äôs only my first year lol. Definitely regret not taking a gap year."
3931,"My professor for an honors class likes to do quizzes for extra credit at the end of each section. At the beginning of the last quiz he asked us to select which of the readings from this semester had been our favorite. He noticed one person hadn't answered and that person was me and the only thing I could say was ""I don't remember any of these"" because they literally all blended together and I don't remember them at all."
3932,"Drawing graphs by hand and doing calculations by hand is actually critically important in lower level classes!

If you don't understand the nuances of the thing you're plotting then it's *trivially* easy to tell a calculator to plot something unreasonable or mathematically invalid. And being the stupid computers they are, they will do *exactly* as you tell them. MATLAB in particular has a rather horrid little habit of doing what you tell it to even if you tell it to do the impossible - it doesn't throw an error or a warning, and sometimes it gives results that seem pretty reasonable if you don't already know what the exact answer should be. Your calculator will do the same. Every single calculator is capable of doing this.

That's why you **really, REALLY** need to learn to graph them by hand. When you move on from this and do end up using nothing but computers to do the grunt work, you'll have an intuition for what's possible, what's going to cause issues, and what the rough answer should look like. This is **NOT** a pointless exercise or worthless hoop to jump through. It is a fundamental part of your education.

I experienced an example of this literally this week. I passed zero into a sine function and then passed the result of that into a logarithm. Log(0) is undefined. The result? Energy and the r component of magnetic field undefined over my simulation, making it useless and costing us a fair bit of money and time. That stupid little error has cost me days of debugging, and it's all because the computer did what I told it to do. The only reason I didn't lose more time/money is because I understand these functions and I could immediately see the problem of passing a cylindrical radius through a log function."
3933,"yeah.

I'm much less suicidal now that I've completely given up on this semester, since stress levels have gone down a fair bit. so that's nice I guess."
3934,"I think because your body learns to do what you do to it. So when we went to school physically, we were always on our feet, socializing, so we weren't tired. But now we're always home or staring at a screen and your body/mind feels the lethargy and it's exhausting. I completely understand and a lot of people are going through this. It's really hard. You might be experiencing mild-depression as well.  A lot of people are suggesting exercise in this quarantine to get all that pent-up energy out. At least 20 minutes of sunlight everyday and at least 20 minutes of excercise everyday. As well as 20 minutes of self-care, whether it be doing your nails, yoga, journaling, or pampering yourself."
3935,Totally feel this. I‚Äôm literally distracted on my phone right now while my online lecture is happening because I just feel checked out for the semester. Just going through the motions at this point.
3936,Yes!!
3937,"Yep, definitely blew an interview when they started asking questions I should‚Äôve known, literally taking the class that would apply to the question. And I just haven‚Äôt learned anything from the 100+ fully packed PowerPoints we have to read every week, can‚Äôt focus enough to read through, comprehend, and retain everything"
3938,"I'm also just unmotivated to do anything. I have only 1 more assignment left but it's a long ass research paper. No energy, just been gaming a lot because my semester's practically over."
3939,"I was an A B student and I would tell all my friends C‚Äôs get degrees but I held myself to a much higher standard (those B‚Äôs mentally destroyed me) and no I just gave up after months of tears and stress I gave up. My therapist through the school asked why I‚Äôm still doing school if I hate it so much. I wish it were that easy to just be done. I don‚Äôt care about my major or my minor anymore I don‚Äôt care about the classes I‚Äôm in. I don‚Äôt enjoy a single one to any extent. I can‚Äôt sit and just take notes during class so I play solitaire on my laptop as I take notes because otherwise I‚Äôll freak out and panic, I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough time for anything. I am just bitterly angry with my school at this point I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm just burnt and done. Your post perfectly articulated it and I want to thank you for the space to rant because this was much needed."
3940,I don't care about anything and I hate everyone
3941,[deleted]
3942,This is extremely similar to my situation. I am mentally and physically tired.
3943,not to knock your struggles but I find exercising and playing with my dog/dancing (don't laugh) helps. it pumps you up yknow? Also eating less junk did wondersss
3944,"yes. a person has about 10 mins attention span, there's no point in attending a lecture for longer than that. If you have a teacher that's worth listening to for 10 minutes that is"
3945,"I did a survey to evaluate mental health in my college for a proyect, we got 50 respondants. 70% of people reported feeling tired throughout the day, and 77% said they had reduced motivation to do schoolwork. I wonder why???. Lol Im tired of schools acting like nothing is going on and we aren't taking classes through a fucking computer with no interaction and rewards normally associated with college, excluding learning of course, which often feels like a chore because classes are so boring."
3946,She wants to sit next to me!
3947,"Not necessarily creepy. It's a genuinely nice thing to offer. Just don't push if she declines, and also don't expect anything to happen if she accepts. Just be genuinely nice and considerate."
3948,I don‚Äôt know I could see why someone could find that creepy.
3949,"female woman lady here nothing creepy about it, as long as you‚Äôre genuine about it and not expecting anything from her, go for it. she‚Äôd probably appreciate it"
3950,Fucking get it buddy
3951,Did u do it? What happened?
3952,Haha I‚Äôll try
3953,She said we should sit next to each other!
3954,"Sorry OP, everyone on this thread is so over dramatic. I would find it sweet so go ahead and do it!"
3955,"i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs weird at all! it‚Äôs a great thing to do and if she finds it weird/doesn‚Äôt appreciate it, that says more about her than you :)"
3956,"Nah, just say 

*‚Äùhey, I noticed that you missed class today. I hope you‚Äôre doing okay! I have the notes for class, would you like them?‚Äù*

If there was homework given, let them know that too. :)"
3957,"Go get your gurl, boiüò≠üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Happy for u guysüòâü•∞ü•∞"
3958,Ohhhh SHIT let‚Äôs go!!
3959,I did and I‚Äôm glad I did :)
3960,"This man knows how to pick up some women, follow his advice"
3961,"You‚Äôre being weird by thinking this much into it.

You‚Äôre offering someone notes, and then you say if she needs a study partner you‚Äôre available üòÇ"
3962,W
3963,"^ this though I am a guy, just don't over think it man. You aren't asking her out."
3964,OMG YAY
3965,"This is the way. 
.""hey I noticed you weren't in class today. I've got notes if you wanna copy them. If you need a study buddy let me know"" 

Or something along those lines"
3966,"Or plot twist, it is the girl from class.

EDIT: my bad typing."
3967,W
3968,W
3969,Awesome! let us know what happens
3970,Hell yeah bro!
3971,"Hell yeah man! Make sure you don't smell bad, and maybe carry an extra pencil in case she forgets hers and asks to borrow one"
3972,it's a joke man
3973,Just texting to ask.
3974,Expect absolutely nothing.  Do it as a thoughtful gesture for its own sake.
3975,Please keep in mind that her wanting to sit next to you does not inherently mean she likes you that way. You seem to be diving in really fast in your feelings for this girl who you've never even talked to in person before. Take things slow and try to manage your expectations.
3976,"You‚Äôre not a bad student. You‚Äôre going through some shit, just like everyone else. A lot of people feel depressed, unmotivated, lethargic, etc. Man, I have a 3.9 GPA, I‚Äôve always loved school, always tried my best. When classes were in person, I would go to the library every day and do homework for hours. I would even get ahead in my classes sometimes. 

Now that we‚Äôre online, I struggle to do even an hour of work each day. I find myself falling asleep or going on reddit. I can‚Äôt bring myself to watch the online lecture. I don‚Äôt even get up to go to the kitchen, I just eat snacks in my room instead. I‚Äôm not a bad student. I‚Äôm a good student going through a bad time (with depression and an uncertain future and financial issues - a lot of people are going through this exact same thing right now). 

You really should forgive yourself. Even surviving is tough at this point, so if you‚Äôre alive, you‚Äôre doing great. Your grades aren‚Äôt the end of the world, and they don‚Äôt define you. Even if you get a C-, it‚Äôs still an accomplishment that you‚Äôre able to stay in school and pass classes during such an awful time. Be kind to yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è"
3977,"Told myself about a week ago I'll break my schedule just this once to eat lunch and catch up on the online lecture later. Now I'm a week behind on lectures. 

Don't break schedule and more importantly don't be a bad student like me lol."
3978,I literally was just talking to my family about this yesterday. I was explaining to them how nothing feels real to me rn. I feel like im in a simulation. Something feels so off
3979,[deleted]
3980,I used to bust my ass and now I think I formed depression being on my computer in my room all day doing schoolwork and feeling like I have no direction in life. My brother is an EMT and he may fail because he can‚Äôt do life saving scenarios through a screen.
3981,[deleted]
3982,I think this is a very common feeling right now.  It's very interesting times and no one really knows how to process whats been happening so don't be too hard on yourself and let yourself feel the feelings
3983,"Same, nothing was the same as it was 7 months ago. 7 months ago, I was commuting, had a bunch friends, and getting good at my job. Now, I‚Äôm doing online school, have really no friends, my job is easier but more stressful at the same time, and I will be doing classes I‚Äôve never had experience in. It feels weird, also it‚Äôs my sophomore year and my sophomore year of HS my depression got so bad that I went to a mental hospital.  I‚Äôm afraid it will happen again because I‚Äôve been in isolation (other than work) for 6 months straight. I‚Äôm not sure how much more I can take. I‚Äôm hoping January 2021 will bring a miracle, a reset, and I can go back to campus."
3984,"This is absolutely normal, you‚Äôre lacking the physical cues that you associate with being a student and are therefore disconnected from the experience. You‚Äôre also likely under stimulated, making it hard to feel engaged!"
3985,"Im glad i read this lol, i feel like i haven't been able to switch to school mode at all. My brain in stuck in some weird limbo and I'm doing work all day that could theoretically take less time. Even though im doing ok gradewise i feel like im learning absolutely nothing."
3986,"Feels more like a loading screen in a video game. Cant really go anywhere, cant interact with other people socially, nothings really going on, except for some loading graphics (tiger king S1)."
3987,"me freaking too. i‚Äôve been in school for almost a month and even on campus things just feel weird. i‚Äôm a freshman & really feel like i missed out on the usual activities to meet people, & being out of state i feel like i don‚Äôt belong already just from that. plus meeting people with masks just sucks enough, like you can‚Äôt even smile at someone or see if they‚Äôre smiling at you"
3988,glitch in the matrix
3989,Me too. It also feels like I‚Äôm dreaming. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do next my body just does it for me without conscious thought but I can think about what I‚Äôm doing or why I‚Äôm doing it I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in control half the time. I find myself cleaning stuff or walking around campus without even realizing I was
3990,"Very much so. I am also just feeling very cut off from any desire to be a part of things. Half my classes are hybrid, half are fully online. Class involvement? Could get switched to online and never see these guys again, and the fully online ones don't even have zoom sessions. It feels strange ""knowing"" a professor and classmates solely through words... I haven't heard from any clubs I joined previously, maybe I should email or text them? Well, they never contacted me when we switched online, so why get involved now. Activism? I've been in that for all summer and such and nothing has really happened. 

I am in my seventh semester yet still feel like my classes are very intro, but my degreeworks doesn't show any alternative classes I can take- I need like 7 more credits for my minor, 15 more for my major, and no classes required for the degree are offered rn it seems. I'd talk to my advisors or faculty like they say, to use them as resources, but what's the point? 

It just feels so strange. And then I look for jobs online and nothing pops up, or is way overcompetitive- how can I get a bar tending job when almost all bars are closed, so even a part time listing can ask for three years experience, and I have zilch? Should I even still be in college when everything seems like on the brink of a huge disruption?"
3991,"Yes, Jesus Christ yes I‚Äôm so glad somebody put this into words. Not in like a serious derealization way or anything but to me just nothing feels incredibly... real right now. Nothing seems to have much purpose, I‚Äôm scatterbrained and confused, my education seems like it doesn‚Äôt even matter right now. What good will it do me? The world is fucked anyway. I‚Äôm not even gonna get to walk the stage, at least not on time. I don‚Äôt know man."
3992,"This semester doesn‚Äôt feel like it matters, it feels like it doesn‚Äôt count. Nothing feels like it counts. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre currently enrolled in school, but not really. It feels like you don‚Äôt have to do anything."
3993,"Yeah, I can relate. I feel like it‚Äôs because nothing is concrete anymore. Before the pandemic, you might‚Äôve been able to do well in online classes because that was the only change in your life. Everything else would‚Äôve been normal. 

But now we‚Äôre in a situation where it‚Äôs like...what am I doing? And why? How can I make a goal about my school and my career when I don‚Äôt even have a reasonable estimate of what life will look like one year from now? Before, it was concrete. You‚Äôd graduate at x date and then get a job in x industry. Now, graduation dates are up in the air because of finances, and who knows if that job will exist anymore and if it does, is it even paying the same as it used to? And a lot of us also feel like, what‚Äôs even the point of having that job if you can‚Äôt use the money to go out with friends or travel? What does the future hold? What even are my goals anymore? 

My advice is just try your best. Do what you can, but don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. We can deal with the future when it comes (in your case, your issue of not learning might affect your future classes or job, but I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt worry about it now. Deal with it when it comes up)"
3994,It doesn't even feel like school started. It's just all weird
3995,I recently had to run codes virtually and it was very strange
3996,Yes! I‚Äôm an instructor lurking on here but I‚Äôve been feeling like this for months.
3997,"I'm graduated now, but I spent most of spring quarter in virtual learning. By the time April and May rolled around, we were getting inundated with news about the pandemic and the protests were heating up, with all the videos of cops brutalizing the protestors. I remember going absentmindedly to my classes and not being able to focus or engage. The rest of the time, I was just sitting in front of the computer with readings and empty Word documents pulled up, unable to absorb anything and just obsessively following news and videos about the protests. Through it all, the lightheadedness was definitely very jarring to me - it's like as hard as I tried, I just couldn't focus my brain on the present."
3998,Care to explain? I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting a good education just being online and just feel demotivated not being in an enriching environment
3999,"Yeah it just feels odd really. I‚Äôm at my school right now, as I moved in they switched my courses to all online classes so it just been weird. There‚Äôs never anything going on like last semester and I find it hard to motivate myself to actually do these course because they‚Äôre not engaging at all. 

I just hope next semester will be different"
4000,I feel the same way. The state burning down isn't helping. What even is this reality.
4001,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way. Honestly, I feel exact the opposite. Everyday feels great to me, but it may be because I got out of depression as soon as the lockdown happened. 
For some reason, I feel like I‚Äôm more in control of my life now than I ever have been. I used to be an extremely anxious person, but after quarantine started, all my stresses just literally faded away in a week. Online college really helps me feel like I have more control over my life, and I‚Äôm loving it! 
Is there anyone else who feels the same?"
4002,"I want to point out that (though I'm not a mental health professional) this sounds just like dissociation. Dissociation is a normal way for our brain to protect us in stressful times, and people who are prone to anxiety might experience it more readily. But if you start feeling dissociated on a regular basis, if it becomes distressing or feels like it never seems to end, or if you begin forgetting large blocks of time, you should see a therapist."
4003,Yes. My fianc√© died 11 months ago and then covid happened soon after. I truly feel I entered an alternate reality. Hell maybe. I‚Äôm so over it. All of it.
4004,"Thanks for this! Really need to hear that. I know I‚Äôm not the only one that feels like this but for some reason I alway think I‚Äôm alone with this mentality that I can‚Äôt stay motivated with these online classes. I relate very much, days go by so quick with me just doing homework all day and studying and then the next day it‚Äôs the same thing I barely have time to do anything I would like. I have always been a good student as well getting A‚Äôs and barely any c‚Äôs during my whole college career so far (I‚Äôm in my junior year), but this online experience is not the best. I‚Äôm not trying to just complain abt the whole experience because I have saved a lot of money not dorming or commuting but my social aspect of life is disappearing. Also, these professors are doing the bare minimum at least in my case and don‚Äôt seem to care abt there students experience online or grades."
4005,Yeah I feel that 100%. I was basically saying that if work is your personality and takes up your life something is probably not right. It sounded like to me that this person is busy all the time but now that they are less busy the feel like they have less self worth and are bored.
4006,"I‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôre safe and healthy.

I get that, I just got diagnosed with ADHD a couple months ago. Makes a lot of sense, and I already had other mental issues... I used to get those failing messages from the system too. Then I changed my major! And I got some meds. That stuff helped a lot

I used to do my hw at night but I have class in the mornings now so. Idk why I could sleep tonight but I have class in an hour, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna happen anymore lol

I‚Äôm glad your semester is going well! Let‚Äôs try our best, that‚Äôs all we can really do :)"
4007,"yea as online classes progress, I find myself to lose the spark I once had for school. My degree just seems so bland and boring, the lectures are vague and don‚Äôt go into great detail that would help a ton, the work is more stressful as I‚Äôve had to teach myself and professors haven‚Äôt been too well w communication via email. I feel like it‚Äôs a hard time for us all. I can‚Äôt blame the professors, for all I know, they could be stressing out and don‚Äôt like the online platform as much as students do. I‚Äôll probably ease my work load to just courses that I know are doable online and switch back to full time credit hours once in person is available."
4008,"your professors actually email you??? lmao. everytime i email my professors i have to email them multiple time to even get a response back. one of mine doesnt have office hours posted, so i emailed her about that and have yet to get a response and the assignment is due tn."
4009,"Same, I admire him so much for this. I want to work hard to make it up to him.
And yeah exactly, I asked for an extension on the midterm so I can go through everything thoroughly"
4010,I was honestly so touched when my professor emailed me when I was in the psych ward for a suicide attempt.
4011,"That's a lot better than one of my professors whose method of that is posting a PDF that the class program generates of who has logged on and completed what they need to at a given time and basically says ""make sure you do what you need to do or I'll drop you from the course"""
4012,"My major, Anthropology, has small classes and very kind and personal profs. I used to be a bio major and that was a whole other story...

I think the fact that they‚Äôre literally teaching us about different cultures and perspectives....they tend to understand personal struggles, especially rn, a bit more. I‚Äôve never had an experience with an Anthro prof not being understanding, and I promise you last semester was so bad.

That being said, I‚Äôve reached out to my profs first. But this one reached out to me. That‚Äôs why it really hit me this time :( He‚Äôs so kind 

I hope yours can communicate more :((

Edit: Just remembered that I reached out to my chem/orgo professor about an exam once and she never responded so I literally had to go to the Dean to get in touch with her üôÉ"
4013,[deleted]
4014,"This month has been an emotional rollercoaster of both my parents getting covid, and my grandmother passing away because of it. Seeing my language professor reach out to me was great and she gave me the time I needed to catch up"
4015,"

A teacher emailed something like that to one of my classes before and I was told her that I was struggling with my mental health and was contemplating suicide. She called me and let me vent over the phone. She was really sweet, but had the cops sent over to my place for a wellness check which was really embarrassing and shameful to me."
4016,"For sure, do what works for you.

I feel this completely. It‚Äôs my last year and I just want to *finish* but online courses really drained me completely this time"
4017,"wtf noooo

things are rough rn, I wish profs would understand that a little more"
4018,"I definitely am, thanks."
4019,"This is one thing I miss about high school lol. I'm basically done with college now, But I'm struggling with these last few classes.

These classes aren't big either. I think a lot of the profs Ive had kinda have a ""*Welp! yall are adults and it aint my business. just make sure to turn the work in on time*."" approach to their job lol.

I'd rather they check up on me through email to *understand* why I'm failing, instead of assuming I'm being lazy tbh"
4020,"Yes, not everyone is lazy. In fact I think most people aren‚Äôt, a lot of things coming up during this time of our lives.
And before I switched my major from biology to a smaller one, my profs were the same. My profs now are really understanding, I‚Äôm very grateful"
4021,"Wow, your Professor is a saint <3  
Wish more people were like him"
4022,"Those types of professors are great! I tend to turn in my work super early, but my school has this 14 no activity/work turned in, they drop you. My professor called my cell to personally let me know that I needed to turn in something because it was about to drop me. I was so thankful because she really didn't have to do that."
4023,"Maybe they do hate it as much as we do, maybe they don‚Äôt. My calculus professor doesn‚Äôt have any lecture videos for the content, just an assigned textbook and tests, midterm, final. He doesn‚Äôt have a grade a thing (MyMathLab grades it) and his only job is to respond to emails, which usually takes him days. I‚Äôm being taught by khan academy and my friend who is a math wiz, so I just FaceTime him with questions. Anyway, this professor is being paid a salary to essentially do nothing. Maybe I should get into academia after I get my degree /s"
4024,"Professor here: very stressful for us also. Online teaching takes away nearly all the things most of us love about teaching, and leaves the parts nobody enjoys (such as grading). Our workloads have also gone up, and many of us are also dealing with kids in remote school and/or parents on at-risk age groups. 

BUT - the good ones still do their jobs and do their best to help their students."
4025,"Damn, that's cold"
4026,"Please do!! Honestly, even the thought that the person we‚Äôre working hard for in each class is looking out for us in some way, it really cheers us up. The relationship of effort feels more mutual, I think... this prof definitely got me more motivated to do well in his class now :)) Thanks for reaching out to your students!"
4027,"It‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôm really glad you were able to reach out to someone at that point of your life. That takes extreme courage.

I‚Äôve communicated my own mental health issues to my profs and they‚Äôre always been understanding. The fact that this one called and checked up on you though <3 I‚Äôm glad someone was looking out for you!"
4028,"Yes, soldier through it and get done w it! I would do the same if it were my last year, I‚Äôm a sophomore right now so I don‚Äôt mind taking on classes during the summer until I am comfortable w being a full time student again. I wish you a wonderful graduation as you deserve it."
4029,"hahahha yes I‚Äôm having the exact same conundrum, my math class is on my math lab and her lectures for each unit are literally her working 3 problems and saying to revert back to the vids to work all of the other 30 problems, but the issue is most of the problems are completely different from the ones she works and require a formula she didn‚Äôt teach us. So I‚Äôve been using free services like YouTube and khans academy to do school work that I have to pay for. what a world we live in."
4030,thank you!  I hope the years coming up are easy for you :))
4031,happy to hear that :)
4032,This makes the best teacher.
4033,I totally agree. I unfortunately didn‚Äôt have that this semester though and was withdrawn from a course for not turning in a few quizzes that were all due on the same day. Instead of asking what happened they just withdrew me even though I had just submitted a major assignment and every other assignment.
4034,"One of my professors individually asks every student how they're doing at the beginning of every class. Granted that it's a small class with only 15 students, but I still have so much respect for him."
4035,It means the world when they go out of their way reach out to you. I hope you‚Äôre doing better <3
4036,It was unfortunately based on a true story: [https://www.insider.com/quarantined-nyu-students-sharing-confusing-meals-on-tiktok-2020-8](https://www.insider.com/quarantined-nyu-students-sharing-confusing-meals-on-tiktok-2020-8)
4037,"This hits deep at the University of Iowa.

Athletes are put up in the fancy new downtown hotel. Normal students are in unmaintained rooms that haven't been used in years and had roaches.

COVID tests cost $35 through the University, are not mandatory, and even if you're positive, are *self-reported*. Basically, the University is saying ""look, we have like no cases!"" even though there 1) are still lots of cases being self-reported and 2) are only being reported by the people who are taking this seriously enough to PAY for their own test and then self-report it. People going to the bars fall into neither of those categories.

It's. A. Shitshow."
4038,"Only a slight suggestion.   

Your University President, M.B.A."
4039,"Oh my god, I thought it was just an exaggeration. What the fuck"
4040,"*laughs in a total of <1% of the total student body getting Covid since August*

I'm legit surprised we're gonna make it through this semester."
4041,I like the synergistic opportunities between your comment and my post.
4042,[deleted]
4043,"Ooof, it feels weird to say I'm jealous. Over 10% of our undergrads have contracted it this semester so far. Three weeks to go."
4044,"Yeah, but at least we got one full week of football. Almost makes it all worth it."
4045,Nice. Thanks
4046,"This is brilliant, well done."
4047,"Yikes. Yeah I'm really proud of my school. It's almost as if people wearing masks, testing 5% of the population weekly, and testing everyone before arriving on campus actually works"
4048,"For real, check out [this fuckin' guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jm1hdz/is_it_even_worth_it_to_apply_for_internships_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) over here"
4049,lmaooo that was an issue at my uni before corona even happened
4050,"I wish my university handled it this way, because mine is actually handling it even worse than this."
4051,You can tell who has a brain and who doesn't from the comments. Top quality post dude
4052,"Thanks, I needed some cathartic outlet for this semester."
4053,"What an interesting take, would you be interested in an opening we currently have in our administration? We feel that you would be a valuable asset to our team."
4054,"This was so funny, i just want to feel like I have some control over the situation we‚Äôre all being put through."
4055,"> Oh, and tell the RAs to consider this semester a life lesson on what it means to be on salary, and that ‚ÄúOther duties as assigned‚Äù is a literal statement. 

As an RA this hit way to close to home. Good shit"
4056,What school?  Just so I never apply to work there.
4057,You okay?
4058,"The school could've not brought people back. And don't say we could've stayed home, as part of the overworked student life staff mentioned above, my job for the next 2 and a half years depended on me coming back this semester, not to mention my in person labs, the only thing not over zoom."
4059,"The best part is that these are the reasons I cry multiple times a day, but reading them in this letter just made me laugh for like 15 minutes straight"
4060,Bruh do we go the same school? I feel like all of this is exactly the same stuff going on here
4061,"In honor of your service, here‚Äôs a coupon for a free small beverage or $0.50 off a pastry of your choice at the local coffee shop that‚Äôs currently closed due to COVID."
4062,It's satire dude. He just took the situation and created the best possible comedy out of it
4063,This cuts way too deep
4064,Lol what‚Äôs funny is the quarantined students are staying at Old Dominion University‚Äôs ‚Äúodu inn‚Äù which is where I stayed last semester and it‚Äôs a fucking palace compared to regular dorms
4065,\[spiderman point\]
4066,"This is also why I so strongly support gap year(s). Take time off to work and get a little experience outside of that high school bubble and then decide. 17-18 year olds are notoriously idyllic and rosy and are just excited to be going to college and unfortunately that can also translate into picking a degree with less than ideal prospects and salaries because they get told left and right by their guidance counselors POTENTIAL incomes and POTENTIAL jobs, not realistic incomes and realistic jobs. No biology major expects to come out making more at target than they do at a job doing something with biology, but its what happens to a lot of people.

Of course EVERY degree has an application but a lot of that comes from work experience. A fresh English grad is going to be in worse shape than the 50 year old English degree holder with 30 years experience after probably busting ass to put their degree to use assuming they don't go into teaching. Yes college degree holders typically see higher lifetime income but that doesn't mean just pick a degree simply because you feel like you have to go to college. You wouldn't invest in a company without researching it a ton beforehand, a college education is the same thing."
4067,"In that same vein, don't expect that growing, well-paid field to remain exactly the same after four years. Just because it looks lucrative when you start college doesn't mean it will stay that way by the time you leave. A lot can happen in four years (in case it somehow needed reiterating), so have a backup plan if at all possible."
4068,[removed]
4069,"Look, I was a fucking idiot at 18. Most people were. Let‚Äôs blame the system, not the kids"
4070,"It‚Äôs not all or nothing. You have to make a compromise and find a balance between your passion and financial success. There‚Äôs nearly always an alternative, these types of people just don‚Äôt care to do research until their last year in college when they figure out their majors prospects are crap"
4071,"I disagree. Most people that I graduated with (2020 grad) have degrees that have nothing to do with their careers. 

While I think doing your research is smart I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre screwed if you don‚Äôt. Most employers just want to see that you have a degree and that you have the skills.

I have a degree in agriculture, started my career in supply chain, and now work for a major financial institution."
4072,"You‚Äôre missing that not everyone has been introduced to these things before college and learns late. Others are taught in high school or by parents about these things. In my case I went to a high school with a low graduation rate and their attitude was ‚Äúas long as you go to college you can do whatever‚Äù. Both of my parents are high school drop outs, they had a similar attitude. I do like my major but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd be willing to do the work of going for my masters as well as the cost being too much for me. I wish I‚Äôd just gone to an art school or at least just an associates, these were not things that were really looked at as a good option at all around me. In the end, I know that‚Äôs what I would have enjoyed but I‚Äôm a senior in college now. Don‚Äôt forget that everyone comes from different backgrounds"
4073,"If I have to see this post one more time, I am going to murder someone. 

In middle and upper class areas in America, we push people to go to college. We tell people there is no other opinion. We look down on people that go to community College. We look down on people in trade school. We look down on people that go into the work force. 

People are told time and time again that college is the key to a successful life. It is the key to making money. 

College is a fucking scam because people aren't taught any better. They don't know until it's too late, and they're already invested. It's great you had the resources to navigate, but first gen student especially fall victim to this *all the time*. Why do you think colleges trip over themselves to recruit them?"
4074,I love it. Blame the 18 year olds fresh out of highschool. The population thats historically been known to fully think things through. Its their responsibility to go find the credible sources to resource a very niche field with almost 0 outside help unless asked.
4075,"Meanwhile my high school counselor was legitimately depressed and sad all the time and when I found out my ‚Äòideal‚Äô major was what he chose, I decided to steer clear of it. So far I don‚Äôt have too many college regrets, at least not with my major."
4076,You‚Äôre looking at this from a far too black and white perspective. There‚Äôs so many grey areas. Lots of people don‚Äôt even know what they want to do. And many people would rather have a low paying job they love than a high paying job they hate. You can‚Äôt just have everyone research highest paying and growing job entries because then everyone‚Äôs gonna end up in these fields and there won‚Äôt be as many job openings once that happens. Also some fields are just naturally more competitive. Not everyone can be a CEO or doctor but that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt try hard to compete for those jobs even if the success rate is low.
4077,"I went to a shitty high school and it took me a while in college to even figure out what's out there. I feel like it's hard to find what to do if you don't even know what the options are. It's a little complicated if you weren't raised in an environment that helps you understand how the world really works. 

(If you're about to accuse me of sour grapes, I accepted a high paying job after college with my social science degree)"
4078,"to people who are panicking reading this thread: the best jobs are likely to not even be related to the degree you received in college. you can still make it into a good position even if you feel your major is lacking; you can still work towards obtaining practical technical skills that are in high demand (coding!), because employers look for skills and what activities you‚Äôve done outside of class to show that you are a well-rounded individual with experience. learn to network with professors to get letters of recommendation. most of all if you work hard and you grind you can make it to a good not poverty wages job. this post makes it sound like your degree is the end all be all of job opportunities and that‚Äôs simply not true! some jobs depend on your degree (like some kinds of engineering) and a lot of them also don‚Äôt!"
4079,"If you need a 4 year degree to get into a field, it should pay a middle class salary. End of story."
4080,[removed]
4081,"Different problem. Picking a major without making career research is poor decision-making. Picking a major and then failing because you get bored is poor motivation. Someone could not make career research out of pure ignorance, they simply could have never thought of it.

Having poor motivation and failing because you didn‚Äôt want to do it is totally up to you and your effort. There‚Äôs no ignorance to be blamed here, everyone knows you need to do shit you don‚Äôt really wanna do. Life is full of shit you don‚Äôt want to do. You think anyone wants to pay taxes? Wants to work for 30-40 years? Wants to wait in line at government offices to file paperwork? 

Life is full of shit you don‚Äôt want to do, but you have to do it. If you fail to endure 4 short years of college so because of motivation, you‚Äôre going to fall on your face because the next 40 years are filled with way more shit you won‚Äôt wanna do."
4082,"This is another point the ""look at me, I'm better than you"" crowd on this sub misses, your degree rarely translates directly into your work, at least at the undergrad level. I'm doing my Master's in biostats now, which was barely a field at one point in history, never mind things like ML which are still rather new."
4083,But‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ I picked psychology and no one told me I couldn‚Äôt do anything in the field with only a bachelors /s
4084,"Really needs to be a mix of both teachers/counselors and parents. Not a lot of kids, especially teens will to listen to their parents. I‚Äôve seen more luck when a teacher or counselor broaches the subject."
4085,As if the job market is some static thing that stays the same for 60 years.
4086,GenZ is in college now. We grew up with the internet. Not googling your major even once is your own fault
4087,"I don‚Äôt disagree, if you pick a major that isn‚Äôt conducive to your goals that is on you. That said almost none of us have a choice but to buy into college as it is. No degree generally means less access to jobs and prosperity. That said I think most college majors could incorporate more practical skills. My favorite political science class was the one where we were finally taught data analysis and strategy. Opened up new skills and this new opportunities. There is something marketable, practical, and useful to be offered in almost every major, college just lacks the structure to make sure everyone gets or has to take those classes."
4088,Yeah I didn‚Äôt figure things out in college until sophomore year. Takes time to become a real adult.
4089,"The people who do it JUST for money, sure. But the people who do it just for money usually don't make to the end to begin with. But nowhere did I even say people should be going into engineering if they want money anyways.

EDIT: Also not to mention that's just untrue?? Salary ranges are a thing for a reason"
4090,"This exactly. Degrees translating directly into someone's work, the way statistics, CS, DS do, is more of a niche case than a rule. The vast majority of degrees will make you employable for the vast majority of positions, so long as what you're after isn't incredibly technical."
4091,"Instead of researching your major, research different careers. Once you find a career that you like, then choose a major that will help you get that job. I have tons of friends who didn‚Äôt study the quote on quote ‚Äúgood majors‚Äù like engineering, who have great careers because they had a plan."
4092,"They're not supposed to, parents are. Seniors in high school should be taught well enough to ask questions without expecting someone to hand them everything."
4093,"In my experience, most people *did* research their majors quite thoroughly, but what they were sold as their prospects was very different from the reality. I mean, look at the bullshit press around a bachelor's in biology or psychology, both of which are lauded online as intensive STEM degrees that will prepare you well for the workforce, but which are basically worthless unless you go to grad school.


Also you're completely missing how your specific field of study rarely translates into job titles, which can make it hard as hell to figure out what people work as. Few graduates of biology programs, even those with master's degrees and PhD's, work under the title of ""biologist""."
4094,"College isn‚Äôt for education anymore. It‚Äôs for accreditation. It‚Äôs a way for employers to minimize risk with new hires. If you stuck it out for four years and passed accredited tests, you‚Äôre less of an unknown and therefore less of a risk to potential employers."
4095,Fr not to mention that simply encouraging tons of people to choose a well paying major would cause that industry to be oversaturated and thus decrease wages lmao.
4096,Lol do you also forget to turn in the easy freebie grades too?
4097,Does your school use Sakai??? Never seen another school use it! I absolutely hate it tho lol it‚Äôs so NOT user friendly

The assignment was an easy ""introduce yourself"" thing I forgot to do at the beginning of semester and got a 0.
This feature is new on sakai and it just confirms what a depressed moron I am in classes full of highly motivated ppl. 
&
I don't have imposter syndrome, I know I don't belong here"
4102,damn if this aint me
4103,Sus
4104,when the midterm grade curve is SUS üò≥
4105,When the imposter is sus!
4106,Yeah canvas has the box and whisker plot and says the low high and average
4107,Canvas has a similar feature to this :(
4108,Ithaca College uses it! But they‚Äôre replacing it with Canvas after this semester I believe
4109,Lol the feature is new and everyone hates it too. Rather than fixing existing issues they just create new ones with every update
4110,[deleted]
4111,"Yes, water is wet"
4112,"Looks like a quiz or something, premise is still pretty funny"
4113,"Yeah yeah, and I thought my exam was easy too and I fucked that shit up."
4114,"ROFL

It's hard to remember assignment due dates, especially when you're dealing with depression (or even just ""depression"" due to being home all. the. time due to covid and having too much school work or whatever)

Write them down. On paper. Force yourself to look at the paper constantly. 

If you still need help, set alarms on your phone. If it's a simple assignment due at midnight, set a reminder at like 1pm to do it and plan to turn it in by 2pm at the latest. That way, there's room for stupid mistakes (like forgetting to actually turn it in) (just don't tell yourself that there's wiggle room in there)"
4115,Do you mind sharing what happened? It seems like the test or assignment or whatever should‚Äôve been a breeze.
4116,F
4117,Take my award lmao
4118,"Sakai is incredible, my school (Duke) uses it and I've never had any issues. The interface is clean, the functionality is all there, it makes sense.

It's also [free and open source](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai)!"
4119,"You need planner life. It's hard to get in the habit but once you do, you'll Never. Go. Back. Document everything!"
4120,Could‚Äôve been the other students had a test bank and OP was left out of the loop
4121,Whenever I see an assignment where the maximum grade is 100% but the class average is like 50% I'm just like. something terrible happened here
4122,"I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve tried this, but I recommend getting a planner and scheduling blocks of time for your work with breaks in between. It‚Äôs helped me get a lot of work done and reminded me what I need to do."
4123,Wait why do you guys not like this? Really great to see how you measure up
4124,Wow I think you‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve met who has had a good experience with it. I haven‚Äôt used it as much since the big update so I might change my mind but before I had so many issues and the save function for wiki pages was an absolute bitch
4125,How did this happen though? Seems like the exam was pretty easy?
4126,"I believe it's pronounced ""meth"""
4127,"Thanks! And as of right now I plan to work in industry, preferably the engineering sector. I was planning to go to grad school, but due to COVID and everything I wasn‚Äôt able to get into any programs because of the limited spots available and the number of people that were applying."
4128,Congrats! Do you mind me asking what your future plans are with the degree?
4129,Because eventually I want to go back to grad school for physics.
4130,Congratulations! I just picked up my diploma from community college and then you were the first post I saw! So exciting :D
4131,I also got my associates from a community college. You‚Äôre doing the smart thing! Saving some money.
4132,Thank you!
4133,Because then he couldn't put physicist in his bio dawg.
4134,Thanks! I graduated with no student debt and im applying to pharmacy school this year so this will be very helpful
4135,"Out of curiosity, why didn't you just go for an engineering degree?"
4136,"Congrats. I work with a few guys from U of A, excellent work."
4137,"Congratulations! My bf majored in physics, did his PhD in computer science, and started a hedge fund $$$. Physics is sexy lol"
4138,I'm a chemical engineer in pulp and paper.
4139,"This is seriously awesome. Congratulations to you! I have to take a 2 semester physics course my junior year, which everyone in my major is dreading lol! What a great accomplishment, man!"
4140,"Thank you! And I don‚Äôt know man, spending sometimes 10-12 hours on just one hw problem by itself was enough to convince me that it can‚Äôt get much harder than that lol. Maybe more stressful, but difficult I‚Äôm skeptical haha. Unless we‚Äôre talking about grad school, then that‚Äôs a whole different ball game."
4141,"Physics degrees are pretty diverse in industry. I know people who went into finance, engineering, data science, etc. it‚Äôs really flexible in terms of career options, because of its inherent nature on being a degree that essentially makes you an expert problem solver."
4142,"The title ‚Äúphysicist‚Äù or ‚Äúchemist‚Äù or ‚Äúengineer‚Äù is subjective based on who you talk to. To me, if you‚Äôre educated in the discipline, that‚Äôs what you are. There are ranks to being a physicist if you want to think of it that way. There are physicists like me who have a general/solid background of the subject, and then there are physicists who are experts on the subject (normally in some type of sub area like particle physics for example) and have PhD‚Äôs."
4143,Thanks! What field do you work in?!
4144,"Congratulations, however not the hardest thing you will ever do, it gets a lot harder. Keep your chin up and enjoy the challenges as they come."
4145,A physics or math major is a stamp of approval that you can handle really difficult stuff and are smart.
4146,"Imho the title comes with weather you actually work in the field or not. I too have a degree in science, but am in grad school, so I would call myself a ‚Äú_____ student‚Äù. If I finish my studies and don‚Äôt get a job, I may be holding a degree in ____, but I still am not a ____ologist.

To use bitemes example: having a license doesn‚Äôt make me a driver. Driving the car makes me a driver."
4147,"WOO PIG SOOIE! Great job, OP!"
4148,Thanks! And that‚Äôs a first hearing ‚Äúphysics is sexy‚Äù haha. Most people are intimidated by it for some reason.
4149,Why not both?
4150,"Best thing you can do to prepare for it is making sure you have a good foundation in mathematics. You‚Äôre a bio chem major so I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve seen at least up to calc 2, that should be enough to get you through physics 2. You might need to know a little calc 3 for physics 2 but it‚Äôs not really necessary depending on your professor."
4151,Congratulations!!!
4152,Thank you! And it‚Äôs definitely not for the faint of heart lol. Good luck in your continued studies!
4153,"Because it's hard as shit lol. Like many people, I have to take a physics class my final semester and so not ready for it."
4154,Thanks! Any advice for a bio and chem major that needs to take physics? I am so unprepared for it lmao
4155,When you get to grad school you say ‚Äúwow that problem only took 10-12 hours‚Äù hahaha just kidding you‚Äôll love knowing you are working deeper into your field probably
4156,"~5 years ago I saw one that said 696969, It was the best day of my life"
4157,Those things have some seriously miscalibrated readings. I filled up a 20oz bottle and it counted up at least 5.
4158,You shoulda bought a lottery ticket that day 
4159,"That's my school, AMA!"
4160,The one's at my school (NCSU) seem to be fine. Filling two 20oz Bottles cycles it 3 times
4161,Hey that was my school! aMa! 
4162,"at my work we have machines that count how many times they‚Äôve been used. For days I was hyped about one of them reaching 15,000, even told my co-workers I was bringing in pizza to celebrate. I‚Äôm the new guy still so I was lowkey ‚Äúbrown nosing‚Äù,  but did it more for shits n‚Äô giggles. pizza was great of course lol"
4163,I mean honestly they need to make people feel like their fountain is saving the environment or people won't want to spend the extra money. If their system was properly configured it would increment every 16.9 oz but you could make the argument that each time someone puts any water in a bottle they didn't use another disposable bottle.
4164,Probably the Quarters system. 
4165,All of the displays at my school are broken... must be the all the lead
4166,You guys have finals at the end of March? What's your semester system like that's interesting to me. 
4167,"Peetrius is right, we're on quarters. They tried to move us to semesters a while ago but we fought back. I prefer it, it gives me more breadth of subjects, and I don't have a weird point where I get extremely bored with my class subject like I did in high school "
4168,"If I walked up to the machine and saw that, I would just let myself go thirsty that day"
4169,Post history checks out. Loving the wifi 
4170,"SLO is my #1 choice, I‚Äôm at a ~3.0 but my extracurricular are HELLA fine. Decisions come out in a few weeks, what did you make it in with? "
4171,"I made it in with a 3.4 which was definitely on the low end. I pretty much only got in because I got a 34 on the ACT, had a lot of leadership-type extracurriculars, and was out-of-state. I‚Äôm just naturally a good test taker but a slacker during the courses; so poly was a slap in the face freshman year. I ended up leaving poly because I didn‚Äôt like my major (Business) and finished my associates at Cuesta. Then took a couple years off, moved back home, and started a new major (outdoor education) at a school in Wisconsin. So my point is no matter what you think you want now more than likely it‚Äôs going to change whether you get into poly or not. Best of luck though! "
4172,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but if you haven't heard anything yet, you didn't get in."
4173,"I want to guess that counter just makes a guess based upon the time the tap is opened.  A clogged filter can dramatically slow down the flow rate on thosw dispensers, which would screw over a time-sensitive counter."
4174,"I got into the journalism program with a 3.39 gpa and 2200 SAT. I don't think they looked at extracurriculars in my application, so that might be something new that they'll be considering, I'm not sure how it'll play out. Keep in mind that you are ranked against the department that you applied to, so if you apply to architecture your chances won't be as high as if you applied to agricultural business, and a high writing SAT will help you with English more than it will with engineering. 

It's a toss up with just knowing your GPA. It's not a high one, and I don't know how they consider extracurriculars. We also got a high number of applicants this year, which doesn't help."
4175,Sac state?
4176,Lmao this is my school
4177,"If you move a bit away from the sensors, it miscalibrates the readings. "
4178,"I know this may not be a popular opinion but here goes nothin'. In life, things rarely go the way you want them to go. You need to be flexible and accept things as they come. This too shall pass. It's the rare person who looks back and sees that everything went according to plan."
4179,Thanks for saying that. It means a lot coming from a professor. I‚Äôm honestly just hoping this tips can help students.
4180,I‚Äôm actually pretty happy classes are online. I‚Äôm better at teaching myself anyways
4181,Oh also I forget to mention. If you need physical reminders of when you assignments are due I recommend getting that app I said in my post because the premium is only $5 dollar year.
4182,No prob. That book saved my life
4183,I‚Äôm not complaining about online classes I‚Äôm just trying to get tips to students (mainly incoming freshman who might not be able to juggle having new found freedom along with online classes.
4184,I‚Äôm more worried about still spending 40 grand to basically watch a video online everyday...
4185,Yea me 2 to an extent. However I really need my math classes to be in person
4186,"I am fine with getting my work done and turned in on time, but I feel like I don't actually retain any information. Like, if you asked what I learned in my classes last semester the only thing I could tell you is what I wrote my final essays on. Other than that I remember nothing. Any tips for retention?"
4187,"Nah. I‚Äôm paying 40 grand to upkeep unused buildings, fund new construction projects that won‚Äôt be complete until after I leave, and pay the 6 figure salaries of multiple administrators doing the job of 1 person."
4188,Okay so I highly doubt the pandemic is gonna go away after the fall semester and until their is a vaccine the majority of classes will most likely be online. So you might as well just deal with it ig. (not trying to sound harsh in that last sentence. Just trying to be realistic)
4189,For me and many others it's easier to focus on the lecture in a class environment compared to in a bedroom
4190,"or dont be a fucking dickhead. people arent ‚Äúr*tarded‚Äù because they have difficulty keeping track of things, especially in a non-classroom environment. also, dont be an ableist.  fucking choke on a dick, you degenerate. dont be so rude, op is only trying to help students who have trouble staying focused, and that‚Äôs completely ok AND normal."
4191,"Same. I'm a professor, and I'm making notes for my students."
4192,"I don‚Äôt want to take a class online 

I‚Äôm thinking I might take a semester off but I‚Äôm in need of advice"
4193,"You are paying for the expertise of the person who made the video. The problem is that many professors are terrible at the videos and at teaching, in general. I'm a professor who teaches (many awards from students) other professors..."
4194,"Third prof, taking notes for my students!"
4195,I know. I think I was speaking to them too. You were being helpful... me? not so much! Sorry! I just hear so many freaking out and I thjnk we all need to just take a breath and relax about it. Your ideas are great!
4196,I personally bought a printer. Its earned its weight in gold. I print everything off and do it by hand like before when you did that for class then merely type it in later. Physically writing retains information better then typing. I also found highlights that are blue or green are gold. See we retain info much better if in those colors. It's why alot of textbook have blue to empasize the words. But everything online is printed. I highly recommend invested in a printer. As someone who is in a medical hand on program that went 100 online due to covid these things have helped me keep a 4.0
4197,If you need help for retention then I suggest writing your notes on paper in class and then re-writing it in either Microsoft OneNote or Evernote. Since you are writing it down twice you essentially retaining it more.  I‚Äôll add this tip to the post itself tho.
4198,You say that like this disease doesn‚Äôt kill people at an alarming rate. Over 100k people have died in the U.S so far. Plus if people don‚Äôt wear a mask like they are supposed to we just gonna be stuck in the situation. Hybrid classes are fine but certain classes should not be online.
4199,"Ehh I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure about that. What if a vaccine doesn‚Äôt come for the next 3 years? Or not at all? You really think classes are going to be online until then? They won‚Äôt. My school is already implementing a hybrid system for the fall with some in person classes. 

If you think people are actually going to accept online education indefinitely, or that universities will implement it indefinitely, you‚Äôre wrong. It‚Äôs simply unsustainable for most schools. 

If we get to this point next year and a vaccine isn‚Äôt in our sights, things will ultimately just go back to the status quo. This is not a forever thing, vaccine or not. That‚Äôs being realistic."
4200,"Yes, I know covid is dangerous. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not. But it‚Äôs also realistic to say that this cannot go on forever. People literally will not allow it to go on forever. Corona hit the US back in what, March? It‚Äôs been four months and look at how people are acting. You think people are still going to be putting up with this after 16 months?

The fact of the matter is eventually, we are going to have to move back towards normal operations. If a vaccine takes long enough to produce, or it never comes at all (which is totally a possibility. Treating a vaccine like an inevitability is ridiculous), society will eventually reach a level of acceptable risk regarding coronavirus. We are not going to be quarantining this and social distancing that forever. I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so hard to understand about that. It‚Äôs unsustainable. 

As corona continues to ravage the country, the medical field gains increased knowledge about how the virus affects us, the best treatments for those that do get seriously sick, and overall how to manage it. If distance learning goes on long enough plenty of universities, and businesses as a whole for that matter, literally cannot afford to stay open and will close their doors permanently. 

Past a certain point, society as a whole will eventually say ‚Äúenough is enough and it is what it is.‚Äù I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs the right move or the wrong move, but it is the inevitable move regardless of how shitty it sounds."
4201,"Big tip: treat the day like a day at work. Wake up at your usual time, get your morning routine done (coffee, workout, shower, etc) change out of your PJs and pretend that it‚Äôs a 9-5. This way you won‚Äôt be stressing at 10 pm and you can relax because it‚Äôs not during the ‚Äúwork time‚Äù."
4202,"People learn differently. Physically watching someone do something on a backboard and explain it face to face just helps me absorb it better. The interaction is more natural. 

Not to mention I‚Äôm just much more motivated to do anything if I‚Äôm in a physical classroom. The pull to do absolutely nothing and procrastinate when everything is online is real."
4203,"i‚Äôd rather take an online class than die alone in a hospital, or worse, be the reason some poor person(s) had to die alone in a hospital"
4204,"Too far in to do that and doesn‚Äôt have advanced courses in my major, but yes should have for first 2 years. Doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt comment on the bloated university system"
4205,"I have no idea how those of you who have actually difficult majors are doing this. I'm getting a BS in the job I already have/do - I even sometimes find it challenging, despite already knowing the material!

I use a combination of Google Calendar/Tasks to keep track of my due dates and make a habit of looking at it daily. On Sundays, I take a look at my obligations for the week (I work full-time) and plan out times I will work on a given assignment. If I think an assignment is going to take two hours, I block off 10am-12pm on Monday. Having that time committed helps me avoid leaving things to the last minute, or having to do schoolwork when I want to be doing something else.

Good luck to you all in the upcoming semester!

&#x200B;

  ETA - I highly recommend a Pomodoro technique timer app for your phone! Helps you keep focused for those longer tasks."
4206,"Yeah, I feel, luckily YouTube and Khan Academy helped me through all my calcs and such for my engineering classes"
4207,"Exactly! I don‚Äôt have a desk, so I have to study/do schoolwork downstairs at the dining room table. I have five younger brothers & getting them to be quiet is a pain in the ass. I definitely prefer learning in a classroom on a usual basis, but I don‚Äôt mind online rn."
4208,I haven‚Äôt even started my homework yet üò¨
4209,"1. Drink three energy drinks

2. eat an entire pizza

3. play minecraft for 12 hours straight

4. hold breath"
4210,got big ass assignment due tonight haven‚Äôt even started on it
4211,"I do 3 too often lmao. I'll write one paragraph of a paper and be like ""time for a 30 minute break"""
4212,I actually started doing this recently. It helps quite a bit.
4213,"Bought a dozen krispy kreme donuts, brain food."
4214,"Exercise is more important then all of these. Guys, try to workout every single day for at LEAST an hour. Your life will seriously change."
4215,This is the way
4216,Boi sameee
4217,"Honestly, there's no secret. Just have to take a deep breath (or more if needed) and tell yourself you got this."
4218,You get a spring break?!
4219,"1. Is important. Coffee dehydrates, gotta balance with water."
4220,It feels harder with remote classes and the pandemic thing. Hard to take a break from a screen when screens are the only connection to the outer world and to social interaction.
4221,I usually take longer breaks after an hour and a half or so. I usually do 5 minute breaks every so often.
4222,"Go get one. Hell, call them ‚Äúperformance enhancers‚Äù and get 12. Thats what i do."
4223,I want a donut now...
4224,What's your secret?
4225,But if I do #3 I will be left alone with my own thoughts and that is simply not allowed üòÉ
4226,I feel like if I didn't have an eating disorder before COVID I definitely do now. Sometimes the only thing I have to look forward to in a day is sitting down to a nice meal and just relaxing for thirty minutes.
4227,"Haha 12 is probably a bit too much, But I'll definitely get one."
4228,This is 3 am and need to study for atleast 5 hour for exam
4229,Any update?
4230,Oh God sometimes I want to just sleep forever and when I try to think of reasons to get up (besides all the shit I've got to do) the main thing that comes to mind is food. It's no good
4231,"Oh yes, I'm here having a latte at a seaside resort and not thinking about school at all.

PS this is a lie, I have a self paced math class so I need to do eleventy nine assignments this week before school starts again."
4232,Thanks for reminding me to drink water lol my poor hydro flask is collecting dust
4233,Thanks you got at the perfect moment
4234,I've had 2 major assignments hanging over me and I just knocked them both out. Feelsgoodman
4235,Yes and do school for 1 hour i between eating and Minecraft
4236,"I grant you the silver award in honor of ‚ÄúFuck, that‚Äôs totally me‚Äù"
4237,No
4238,No food allowed? Bitch this is my house
4239,"The only thing that seems super overkill to me is staring directly into the camera. How are you supposed to do that while also watching the actual lecture?

(Never mind, I only read the first page).

The being aware of your surroundings part is also a little cheeky. I understand professionalism and all, but I‚Äôm not going to re-organize my room for a single class that I take a couple of times a week."
4240,some of it i understand and some of it is out of line
4241,"Beware of your surroundings, adjust lighting, and adjust camera levels to eye level. Does this professor think we stream on twitch? I use zoom on an iPad and can‚Äôt adjust it that much on their first gen keyboard."
4242,hahaha well said. It just comes across as so intense and controlling? Like what if my desk faces my bed? does my professor want me to come and buy me a new set up)?
4243,Can I just say that my face looks very fat when the camera is at eye level..  So I think I will skip that one.
4244,"Ok, but the one that‚Äôs getting me is the direct eye contact with the camera.

1) If a student is looking straight into the their camera at all times, they are not looking at their screen, and therefore are NOT ACTUALLY LOOKING AT YOU

2) Direct, uninterrupted eye contact is creepy as hell, and I would follow this rule to a T just to see how long it would take the teacher to tell me to stop

Edit: also, I‚Äôm so sick of teachers not allowing questions throughout class. Let me as my question when it‚Äôs actually relevant to your lecture, not forty minutes later when I‚Äôve forgotten what the question even related to."
4245,[deleted]
4246,"No eating? No unmade beds in the background? Bitch what are you gonna do, remove me from class cause my bed isn‚Äôt made?"
4247,"I have an external monitor -- as a result, the camera (on my laptop) is way below my eyeline, so it looks like I'm staring up all the time. But who tf cares"
4248,"What are they gonna do, take the food away? I ate a whole-ass dinner during class last semester. Nobody cared."
4249,It‚Äôs the ‚Äúbrush your hair‚Äù for me üòÇ who said I can‚Äôt go to college with messy hair?
4250,"Bahaha, no teacher is going to dictate how I set up my learning enviornment.

Of course, I'm going to clean up around me, but only for my own personal benefit."
4251,Why are they expecting you to have a YouTuber-ready professional recording studio set up lol.
4252,LOL or if i‚Äôm taking notes? Might just put my eyes right up to the camera so she knows i‚Äôm really engrossed in the lecture
4253,"No beds in the backrgound??? This is college and a lot of the people in this course are gonna be in dorms, right??? At least in my dorm you basically always have your bed in the background."
4254,"Besides for the bed, messy room, and eating, this reads like an instructor basically at their wits end. I don‚Äôt think people realize how demoralizing it is to either 1) teach to 100 black screens, or 2) teach to people lying down, playing with pets, doing their hair or makeup, angling the camera up their nose etc etc. It can be distracting to the professor and other students. 

Hop over to r/professors and you‚Äôll see they are just as fed up with remote learning and all that goes with it too. This reads like an instructor desperately trying to claw back some semblance of a classroom. I think they go too far with some of it, but I get it to an extent. 

And some if it, like the reference to the bathroom noise and NSFW art, sounds like it falls under the category of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think this needed to be said, but‚Ä¶.‚Äù Who knows, maybe there was an incident with something in a messy closet last semester so now they feel like they might as well say it. 

Idk, this sucks for everyone, and we should try and remember that."
4255,"If this were me, I would drop this class immediately unless it were mandatory üôÉ"
4256,"What I'd do is just the option where you can set a background or blur it. Still a pain in the ass that you shouldn't *have* to worry about, but then you don't get profs making rude comments about your living space."
4257,might as well film a makeup unboxing and tutorial at this rate
4258,Streamers on twitch don‚Äôt even follow a lot of these rules lol
4259,"I _made_  my breakfast during class and ate it. Still, nobody cared."
4260,right like what are you my mom? we‚Äôre adults who gives a damn
4261,"i work for the house of representatives. all of my coworkers eat during zoom meetings and we usually order food for in-person staff meetings, so i don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting these ideas‚Ä¶"
4262,"Also a prof. 

First, I wonder if this was recommended text from the university. No excuse for passing it on, but it feels that way to me.

More generally, I would be OK with ""be professional"" or something similar. I was blown away when this started and students showed up on zoom in bed and (seemingly) undressed. There was a lack of understanding that some decorum was still necessary. (Basically, this was like the periodic emails addressed ""Yo, prof"" or similar.)

So, I get \*some\* sort of rules. But I'd actually encourage food, and I have fellow faculty who give extra points for cute animals/kids."
4263,They said no beds whether they were unmade or not. Not everyone has the privilege to remove that from their background.
4264,"That one is excessive to me. Many of these things are common sense, and to type them out seems silly, but some people are dunderheads and don't follow these basic courtesies. Another dumb rule though, I think, is NO eating EVER and that your video has to ALWAYS be on. Last quarter my schedule got rearranged and I ended up having a schedule where I had to get lunch right before my synchronous class, and unless I scarfed it, I had to finish it during class. I was ready to email my professor to explain the situation, but they didn't require our video to be on. If my schedule is tight, I am NOT inhaling or skipping meals. Period. Shit happens. The professors needed to allow a little wiggle room."
4265,"I kinda think that students should have an unchallengeable right to question their instructors, but that's not a popular view among my colleagues."
4266,Yeah one class I had virtual my teacher would actually call out if I wasn‚Äôt eating anything that day in her class because I ate so frequently
4267,"Lol same, my laptop (and camera) was to the left of my monitor so I looked crazy when I was talking"
4268,Your new teacher might have also just lost a friend. It's ok to be honest and just express that you're trying your best but struggling. They'll hopefully be understanding. Your school might offer free counseling services if needed.
4269,"I find it kind of rude not telling the students, as if it needed to be kept a secret. Students may have loved the guy and wanted to say goodbye."
4270,I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. It‚Äôs okay to grieve! Take care of yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è
4271,"(1) You have my condolences. If you or any of your classmates are upset by this, please seek out counseling on your campus. Most college campuses have excellent support for such matters. And there is no shame in seeking help!

(2) When I was a TA in grad school, a senior professor guided me through getting oriented to my duties and treated me like a colleague rather than a newbie. He was smart, funny, and full of life. During the first week of classes, he took a few days off to go see his daughter receive her doctorate. He had a massive stroke and never returned. I was very sad, but I tried to emulate him. I still do."
4272,">I find it kind of rude not telling the students

Bizarre and borderline unprofessional, IMO. You don't need to reveal a diagnosis but the fact that he *died* is public information and should have been conveyed to the class.  Every time I've lost a professor or colleague a great many students have attended the funeral."
4273,"So sorry for your loss. Back towards the end of my degree, I was thinking of going into academia. One of my lecturers was a fairly young sessional lecturer who was near the end of her PhD. She had a husband and a beautiful 2 year old daughter. During the entire course she was very attentive to every student and would respond in huge paragraphs to her students‚Äô emails (contrary to the one-liners that other lecturers typically give). When I approached her for advice on starting a career in academia she was most supportive and offered to help me along the way. I still remember her telling me that it was going to be hard at certain stages and I was always welcome to catch up with her over coffee and have a cry together about our researches. I was really looking forward to that.

A couple of months after that course ended I received an email saying that she passed away due to complications in surgery. I was heartbroken. I wrote her an email (knowing it‚Äôs not going to be read) saying how I couldn‚Äôt believe she passed and it was returned cos the email no longer exists. I still grieve when I think of her."
4274,One of my professors died the day before spring semester began. It was a logistical nightmare.
4275,What they said and good luck with your exam! You sound like a student who works hard and studies hard in confidence you‚Äôll do fine!
4276,As someone hobbling around with a sprained knee right now..
4277,And sad. You forgot SAD. Sad face :(
4278,Not the best thing to read huh
4279,"Try explaining the way you‚Äôre feeling to a college help desk or counselor or someone along those lines. I‚Äôm sure they will understand and perhaps let you pass the class maybe?  May he Rest In Peace, he sounds like a good man."
4280,I agree
4281,I love that you try to emulate your old professor. üòÅ
4282,You're so far off target you hit walmart instead.
4283,my condolences. this is honestly heartbreaking.
4284,"So did mine, except I was his graduate student. It was the hardest thing that ever happened and completely derailed my career (doing fine now, just never expected to be here). Here are my suggestions:

1) The department is likely going to struggle with the first couple weeks of this. We were lucky to have myself and another TA that could keep the expectations of the class on track. Do you have a TA you can talk to? 

2) The teacher may change a couple times. For us, usually the professor would teach and the TAs would do one/two talks a semester. We ended up covering the lectures until a new teacher could be found (it was pretty  quick). But realize that material covered throughout all lectures are things you are expected to know, and that testing might be difficult because of that.

3) If you think that grading is changing or unfair, talk to the new teacher/department head. They are a great, very sympathetic resource to you right now.

Honestly, everyone in that department is likely going through grief right now. My whole department was a total mess. My professor was the most student-oriented: he was always there to chat, help a student figure out what they wanted to do, and would always find anyone who asked a summer internship. Remember the ways this professor inspired you and try to inspire that in others. 

Feel free to PM me if you have specific questions about traversing this time, it's not easy."
4285,I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. I‚Äôve never had that happen. My professors wife died once but he stayed the rest of the semester.
4286,"Considering my mom has to go in for knee surgery sometime within the next year this was not a fun thing to find out could happen.

Condolences for your professor. It's scary how suddenly things can change sometime."
4287,"My partner had this happen to them when they took O-chem in their old University.  They transferred to a better professor that ended up passing away within the second week of the class.  The new prof wasn't very good and made the class a lot more difficult to deal with.  If you feel you need more time to grieve see if your school offers counseling.  I always say it can't hurt to ask the professor what to look at for the exam, some profs are really upfront about it and if they beat around the bush ask about specific tactics you were thinking.  For example I asked my chemistry prof recently if I should study his paper questions over the book ones and got a good response."
4288,"Don't worry it's exceedingly rare still, just surgery complications do happen. It's humans operating on you after all, just humans with years or decades of learning and experience. That's why they're there instead of anyone else though - because they're trained to do it. Don't sweat it :)"
4289,My sister had a professor die during her first semester. She felt really weird about the whole situation for a few weeks. I‚Äôm sorry :/
4290,Bystander effect
4291,We just had a physics instructor pass away. Was he a professor at Norco College?
4292,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear about that. My creative writing professor died suddenly in the middle of my semester too. A few days after her last class, she was emailing us from her hospital bed. She was a kind and patient woman, so it was shocking and sad to have her go."
4293,"Prof here. I've had this experience as a graduate student and with the sudden loss of a colleague. Bear in mind that your other professors/staff will be grieving too, so it will be hard for everyone. I'd assume folks will be sympathetic to the students, but it is *very* hard to step into a classroom in this situation. I had to assign one of my colleagues to do that some years ago and she found there was no syllabus nor any assignments made for the second half of the semester so she had to design half the class herself. Of course it turned out different from the first half, and some of the students were unhappy.

No advice other than what I'd suggest to anyone suffering a loss like this: talk to your classmates, support one another, be mindful of the fact that people will be affected differently.  It's a sad situation, disruptive for everyone, and a major workload burden for the person stepping into the role of instructor. Good luck to you all!"
4294,"No mine was just about 2 years ago at this point, cause it was spring semester of 2018"
4295,"Any time people go under there's a chance they don't come out. But it's rare. 

If it makes you feel better, there's a better chance of him dying in a car wreck on the way to the hospital."
4296,"I was in a real estate class last year and our professor fell and hit her head. She was older. She tried to continue on, but we called 911, to make sure. The whole class was concerned and took action. Turned out she had a concussion and at her age it could have been much worse. We made her tell her daughter as well. We were definitely pushy, but a person in that state isn't thinking clearly and is likely embarrassed"
4297,"Last year my honors director passed away. It was expected, he had pretty late stage esophageal cancer. It was pretty rough on all of us, even the freshmen who had only known him for a semester. Honestly he was the best prof I've ever had. He just wanted to see all of us happy and successful. He was the kind of prof who wouldnt care about what you talked about as long as you were passionate about it.

You're definitely not alone in this. If you need someone to talk to, I'm sure your school has a counselor or any prof you trust."
4298,"I'm the same way and it scares me. All I've done all semester is just churn out homework assignments, like you said, but I don't actually retain any of the material. I could look at a test question and not be able to answer it unless I go back through the readings or lecture recordings. Thank fuck 3 out of my 4 finals are open book and we have a few days to do them, otherwise I would definitely fail."
4299,">	I wish I was in a classroom setting where I could ask questions and actually learn.

Do your professors not let you ask questions during remote lectures? That really sucks."
4300,My grades have been slightly better online but I also feel like I learned almost nothing in any of my classes.
4301,My college was online this semester and all I basically did was submit assignments before 11:59pm
4302,"Ah, yeah, those async courses can be tough. Lectures are definitely more conducive to class participation and asking questions. Writing emails to profs is never easy."
4303,"Personally I still feel awkward speaking up and I always think that people will think my question is stupid. There's also usually a few students who are always participating, and they're like the main talkers in the class, so I feel weird just suddenly jumping in with a question, especially if I haven't talked all semester"
4304,"i totally get you fam. what should have been a piss-easy 4 A's for me this semester has turned into one lucky A, two probable Bs and a solid C. I'd be failing if not for my ability to find Quizlets and bullshit my way through."
4305,I've pretty much written an entire book of notes for each class. Can't really bring myself to remember anything though.
4306,I've found that most people don't ask questions even when they're in a synchronous class.
4307,"I feel like I‚Äôve learned some* but the majority of the semester has been a sort of auto-pilot. If anything, I went really hard in the beginning of the semester and now I‚Äôm crashing and burning."
4308,With you 1000% taking my chemistry final i had to look up everything cuz i have no clue what was going on
4309,"Right there with you. This is garbage, especially in one of my classes.  I have good grades but man in one class I feel as though I have learned literally nothing.

It‚Äôs a nightmare and the final is coming soon (I legit feel like I could drop 30% or lower on it) because it‚Äôs proctored on zoom.  They can‚Äôt track what you‚Äôre doing on zoom because that feature is disabled (as long as you have 2 tabs up) but this is robbery.

I wanna learn and I cannot do it through zoom.  This is horrible and a messy situation."
4310,The proof that practice tests> notes is just piling up in this thread
4311,"couldn‚Äôt agree more. my finals are this week & i literally know nothing. the entire sem was just focused on doing assignments after assignments, quizzes after quizzes. 

what a waste online classes are. half of the time in classes, ppl are having connection problems, asking random questions, or turning on their voice chat out of nowhere. some don‚Äôt pay attention in class & legit ask the same ques which has BEEN answered already by the prof. 

istg this is a jokeüíÄ"
4312,"> if not for my ability to find Quizlets

This dude gets it. Quizlet is the GOAT for Zoom University students."
4313,"As an eavesdropping prof, I will chime in to say ""please email us!""

&#x200B;

I also made three ""check in points"" as exam grades throughout the semester where I zoomed or called with students to see how they were doing with the class, with school, with life. I really think students would retain better if profs took the time to do this. Though it is incredibly time-consuming, I'll admit."
4314,"What I usually do is write notes but then never read them again or even really comprehend them while I'm writing them. Honestly I could be writing notes all class but then if you asked me what I wrote about, I probably wouldn't even remember."
4315,I haven‚Äôt learned a thing. This semester has been tedious and dreadful. My goal is just to submit assignments on time.
4316,"It‚Äôs complicated/I can‚Äôt get a job or do any of my original plans (move out, get a job, etc) due to COVID. All my plans have been derailed for now and I‚Äôm just trying to get through the semester honestly."
4317,Don‚Äôt worry if you feel like you didn‚Äôt learn much this semester. I‚Äôm online as well as all of my friends at various school and everyone is basically treating this semester like it doesn‚Äôt count. Obviously try not to fail classes but with the current global situation it‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôve been a lazy fuck since August like me
4318,"Next semester isn‚Äôt gonna be real different unfortunately, but I‚Äôll manage. (I really don‚Äôt have a choice in the matter lol)"
4319,"ME TOO.

After each test, each quiz, each assignment I forget the material. I never truly learn it, I am memorizing just enough to get by. Yeah, part of it's on me but I did not have this issue at my CC where I had professors with thoughtful lectures who actually taught us. 

This is insane. I want to drop out because this isn't doing me any good but I'm this far in and need to finish. I'm in my 30's. If I walk away from college again I won't be coming back a third time."
4320,Same. The semester before we went online I got a 3.0. This semester I got a 4.0 and learned 1/4 of the information lmao.
4321,"That‚Äôs the tough part with online classes. I‚Äôve always been someone who actually learned and did better in those settings because I have severe social anxiety that would always get in the way of learning in-person. BUT, for those who don‚Äôt or don‚Äôt have a reason to like online classes they are insanely difficult and tbh it‚Äôs hard to give advice because I can totally see that. It‚Äôs hard to learn when you‚Äôre not in class because why should I? Like, I‚Äôm not in class, I can‚Äôt meet my teacher or peers, what motivation do I have to actually learn and not just go with the motions? The only thing I can recommend at this point for you would be to take it a step at a time but go at the pace you need to make it to finals. Like, if you went over 5 chapters of something during these last few weeks, go back and skim those chapters for what you think is the most important info. Did you guys ever do discussion? If you did, those kinds of questions or that topic will likely be on the final so that‚Äôll give you a better idea of what to expect. Email your professors and ask them what they think is best to focus on from the reading/book/class. It‚Äôs not bad to ask, I‚Äôve done that numerous times. I have a lot of reading I have to do in the next week and one of my classes just sucks up all my time so I totally understand how you‚Äôre feeling. Just hang in there and try to take in as much as you can and write things down for better memory retention. I‚Äôm wishing you the best! üíóüíóüíóüíó"
4322,"I recall how nerve wracking it is to ask questions, but oh boy does it help me (as the instructor) to know where I've done too much or not enough teaching. So, even if it's via e-mail, keep asking those questions!"
4323,"My professors aren't even doing remote lectures. 90% of them aren't comfortable with the technology and don't know how to stream. We're teaching ourselves with the ebooks, taking the tests and turning the homework in through the publisher site. It's bullshit. This isn't teaching."
4324,Yeah that makes sense. I‚Äôll only ask a question if I REALLY need to. It‚Äôs nerve wracking
4325,Yep same. My senior year has been pretty lame and I'm not learning much anymore
4326,I‚Äôm cramming lecture slides for a letter on a piece of paper that‚Äôs supposed to apparently show I‚Äôm competent in something. If I don‚Äôt pass these gimmicks and tricks my professor puts on me apparently that means I‚Äôm a dumbass lol.
4327,I love the idea of check in points! It sounds like you truly care about your students! I‚Äôm gonna try to email my professors more next semester! (since this one is already almost over).
4328,Thats gotta be satisfying
4329,"You put in the work despise all odds, you must feel great seeing it come into fruition. Proud of you stranger üëèüèª"
4330,Needed an 85 for an A. Got an 87. My professor gave me an A- on the class :(
4331,"This brings many fond memories of undergrad. And also this one time sitting on a bench freezing my ass off in the middle of campus after bombing the hell out of a calculus final

*ahh good times*"
4332,"
Unbelievably so üòå"
4333,Yes I am taking full credit for this haha
4334,"Good job my dude!

ETA: Dude, not dud."
4335,Thank you for your kindness :)
4336,get some sleep dawg u earned it !
4337,Thank you üòä lol not a dud‚Ä¶ this semester
4338,Congrats! Your graduate program is multiple classes at a time? Mines just 2 a semester but 2 8 week courses. So it‚Äôs just one class at a time.
4339,We luckily have no plus or minuses in our grading system. & you did awesome!!! Congrats on your A!
4340,"I took four even tho they advise against more than 3, but we just have the regular duration semesters (3.5 months). I bet those 8 week ones are super intense!!"
4341,I‚Äôm looking forward to my anxiety free slumber!
4342,congratssssssssss
4343,Thank you!
4344,Yeah I have emailed her. Hopefully it's just a mistake
4345,"Honestly those types of grades scare me. The thought that if u had one final, tiny fuck up u wouldnt get that A"
4346,So happy for you!
4347,"Congrats! You worked your ass off, hope you go celebrate for your accomplishments"
4348,> That is unfortunate. Maybe you can ask the professor if there was a mistake on his end.
4349,You're a badass!
4350,W
4351,One of mine is 2% off I'mma see what I can maneuver but not get too mad at myself if I can't
4352,Congrats! You earned this achievement and you should be proud of yourself. :D
4353,"Totally.  I had a similar experience. ""I need a score on this final that allows me at least a C in this class.""

Final grade: 75.9 solid C, as requested.



Am off to ask for other things. ;)"
4354,I need a 35 to get a C-
4355,Good lord. Congratulations! I love that feeling of sitting on the edge lol
4356,W
4357,"Well done. I needed an 88, and got an 87. Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work out"
4358,"Same! I hated math and wanted to get through calc 1 to be done with it. After discovering him, I've changed majors to CS and I'm looking into taking Calc 2 and 3, which I know I can pass with Professor Leonard."
4359,proud of you :) keep up all your hard work!
4360,Congrats! That class is a beast. Had to take it twice back in my day lol
4361,If I graduate I'm giving a shoutout to the Organic Chemistry Tutor. And Brian Mclogan
4362,Im in CS too! I wanted to switch during calc 1 until I found him lmaooo
4363,"Congrats, calc 2 was probably the hardest math class I‚Äôve taken, and now I have a math minor. Keep working hard, the semesters almost over"
4364,Anyone else notice he literally looks like henry cavill?
4365,Bruh congratulations- celebrate for yourself and dude organic chemistry tutor is a god- I‚Äôll have to check out Professor Leonard
4366,Professor Chad
4367,Nice work
4368,"Straight up my calc 1 professor last semester used his videos for the class, since his curriculum and my professor‚Äôs was so similar. I was so happy lol"
4369,Great job! I got a 0 on the first calc 2 exam so I think you're doing alright!
4370,"I agree, he single handedly pulled me through calc 3. An absolute legend."
4371,"haha yeah it's brutal, especially the way my school does it online: we get no partial credit, can only see one question at a time, and can't go back to see the other questions :("
4372,thank you :))
4373,Congrats! Prof. Leonard and the OCT are carrying me through Cal II as well. I have one last class test coming up and hope to do much better than last time... went from 90 to 70% real quick.
4374,"i got a 30 something on my first calc 1 exam last semester, so coming into calc 2 I was like ""I may be screwed"" lmao"
4375,Let's freaking gooooo
4376,Professor Leonard is hot af ( im a dude lmao )
4377,PatrickJMT is really good too
4378,"Brian Mclogan is pretty good too, youtube is such a savior"
4379,yesss check him out!! He is a math genius
4380,"Nah, I got a 56 my first Calc. Just got an 87 on my Calc 3 final.
You'll be alright."
4381,Dude Professor Leonard is amazing. I also recommend Paul‚Äôs Online Math Notes for extra practice. Congrats! Best wishes for the future.
4382,ayyyy nice!!
4383,Awesome!!
4384,Ayee!!! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs up congrats!!
4385,"Congrats man, I took it last spring and it was brutal compared to Calc 1"
4386,"I hope they know they have a ton of students worshipping them. They are literal STEM gods. Man, I would marry Organic Chem Tutor he‚Äôs literally getting me through Chemistry and Calculus. His partner is a lucky person smh."
4387,Proud of you
4388,I get you. My screen time has skyrocketed.
4389,I literally cannot focus on doing my handouts. I'm so behind ü•µ
4390,Yeah. I hate accounting 1 cuz of this McGraw-Hill connect shit. I haven‚Äôt learned a lick lol
4391,"Yeah I decided to withdraw from two classes and now im taking three and it still feels crazy.the past three semesters I have had a full course load and worked 15-30hrs a week. Now with no work, but everything online, it feels like its harder than its ever been!"
4392,"I feel ya buddy. It's General Ed Science class for me. It's just because I'm too busy busting my ass at a factory just to live through the pandemic along with several crucial certification courses to ensure that I never have to slave and get hurt at manual labor jobs ever again and with such a busy workload, it becomes so hard to even focus. 

Like, this teacher is hard but he is actually a fair and kind and really stand-up guy. I hate the fact that I'm letting him down by being such an utter failure.

If this were an in-person class, I would nail this. However, it's not and I'm failing unfortunately."
4393,"Highly recommend blue-light blocking glasses. They've saved my future self from blindness, I swear."
4394,Same.
4395,I found out that regardless of where i take classes i just suck at focusing so i work in short bursts. It keeps me feeling slightly productive
4396,I‚Äôm not doing badly in the grades department but my motivation has been Thanos snapped every week or so. I even got a part time job cause I was so bored.
4397,"One thing that helps me focus is the Lofi live playlist on YouTube, whever I play it I have to focus on homework. If I don‚Äôt, I feel my anxiety go up almost tenfold. I do love my computer and am on it 24/7 now because of school, but that music helps me get in the mood for school"
4398,"This makes two of us. Doing accounting online sucks lol, I haven't learnt anything either."
4399,"I feel the same way. My grades are dropping because I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything. I‚Äôm losing it, having all my classes online. I can‚Äôt sit in front of a computer screen any longer. I don‚Äôt even have the energy to write my papers anymore because it‚Äôs just more time in front of a computer."
4400,"I sit down on the weekend and write out a list of things I have due the coming week with the days and times they‚Äôre due and then tape it to the wall above my desk. So I have to look at it every day and don‚Äôt forget anything. And it‚Äôs a reminder for action steps I have to take to get whatever is due, done. And when I finish something completely, I cross it off. It‚Äôs an easy way to stay organized and motivated honestly. It feels good to be able to cross stuff off as I get it done."
4401,ME TOO IS IT THE ONE WITH THIS KID NEXT TO A WINDOW WITH THEIR CAT CAUSE SAME
4402,Right there with ya.
4403,I feel you 100%. At first I was happy everything went online because I hated waking up early and having to get ready each day. But now I just desperately want to be back in person. I learn so much better in the classroom.
4404,We use this for my stat class and I literally can't with it... I just don't feel invested in learning the content
4405,Bruh I‚Äôm failing and it we haven‚Äôt even gotten to midterm yet. Even if I wasn‚Äôt deployed for my state‚Äôs national guard for a month I probably would‚Äôve still Been lost in this accounting class. And the kids in the zoom class always ask obscure ass questions that don‚Äôt really pertain to the classüò©
4406,"Hmmm, everyone?"
4407,orr you could turn on night shift/night light on your screens. works pretty much the same
4408,Same. I Been getting 1/2 points on the homework modules cuz idgaf anymore. I don‚Äôt wanna drop the class and imma try to get a C.
4409,"Yes, I cannot focus for shit"
4410,"I just turned in an encrypted file, and renamed the extension to docx so that I could get more time on reddit before I start the paper."
4411,You should let him know your situation. Maybe he can give you extensions or ways to make up your grade with extra credit or even turning things in later. Professors are humans too and have seen their fair share of struggle personally and in their lives so it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask for some help/understanding.
4412,"I‚Äôve learned nothing , I have no idea when anything‚Äôs due and every days a surprise. God I miss in person lecture:("
4413,[deleted]
4414,"I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones, I commute and I‚Äôm on campus 2-3 days a week so it‚Äôs a nice way to break up the monotony. It‚Äôs been a pretty good semester so far for me actually so I wish everyone else luck."
4415,"What's aggravating me is keeping track of deadlines for assignments and online quizzes that aren't being posted to course calendars, aren't mentioned at all in emails, often aren't even in the posted lecture slides, and if one is lucky there is a brief mention of the task in the middle of a 60 minute recording of a lecture.


Also, classes that aren't setting firm deadlines for assignments WILL be the death of me.  It's really easy to procrastinate on something you know will be due weeks from then when the deadline isn't even firm."
4416,Sameee last week I logged 70 hours ON MY COMPUTER ONLY
4417,I'm home all the time. So therefore I should have all the time in the world to complete my assignments. However the place I do my homework and zoom meetings is the same place that I do all my gaming so I get distracted quite a bit
4418,"Ive had 2 stress enduced dreams from stress and honestly both were hilarious aftert the fact. One was senior year of hs, i took a fun class that was taught by one of the most notoriously strict teachers on thr school. Once dreamt that if you turned in an assignment late it would be thrown onto this pile in the corner of the room where she'd burn it and the school was just kinda fine eith it. Great class tbh.

2nd was the first time i ever wokeup laughing from a dream. Long story short i was takimg a women in film class because it met requirement credits. In the class was 3/4th film majors who were all trying to break into the film industry. Night before a test i dreamt that the teacher announced to the class that everyone who scored a 93% or higher in the overall course he would put in a word to the states film and media head board (basically all the people lobbying for more benefits for film in my state that also basically know every job in the state and at minimum can get an interview for you). The teacher had us come one by one up to the front and wpuld tell us our current grade and how close we were vs how bad we were. I went up and was told 84% and how i was a failure and i was never going to make it in the film industry.

Now, why did i laugh? Well, 1 i ddint care about the class or the film industry. As far as i was.concerned calling an 84% in a class i only cared about the humanities credit for was laughable. 2 (and this is the big one) that film board the teacher would put in a good word for us? Yeah. My dads president of that board."

4421,"I‚Äôve never had that experience but it sounds like you‚Äôre still anxious about the exams, despite them being over. I would talk to someone professional about that anxiety and that could help with the nightmares."
4422,I once had a dream where I signed up for an online class but completely forgot about it several weeks in and received a WF. That‚Äôs the first nightmare I have had in a while lol.
4423,"That‚Äôs hilarious! Dreams are funny because it‚Äôs your own brain making the dream, but also it‚Äôs your brain thinking about how stupid the dream is."
4424,"I think these are generalized anxiety dream, dreams of being unprepared. Ever have a dream that you were at school without shoes on?"
4425,"Shit, I still have nightmares about either failing a class in HS or getting embarrassed. And I graduated in 2011 lol."
4426,"I don‚Äôt get them specifically after finals, but I have recurring nightmares about school where I‚Äôll completely miss one class/didn‚Äôt even know about it until like the last day of school and then I end up failing it, it‚Äôs really distressing lol üò©"
4427,I graduated two years ago and still get nightmares about school ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4428,"Thanks! ‚ÄúNightmare‚Äù might have been a bit of an exaggeration. I‚Äôll admit I was pretty stressed about finals since my grades were all 10-15% lower than normal, but engineering courses have some thick curves, so I‚Äôm good now that grades are released."
4429,Been graduated since 1999 and I still have nightmares about forgetting assignments
4430,"I have a nightmare every now and then about logging into my grade portal and seeing all F‚Äôs. It almost scares me to death during my sleep and I wake up in a pool of sweat 99% of the time I have those.

Worse is that in my dreams my parents give me the silent treatment. Honestly I would prefer they lecture me about my grades rather than not care or say anything at all lol."
4431,"The most recent one for me happened just hours after our finals. I took our final exam for our 6-unit subject at 7am - 10am, after that I went back to my dorm and slept. I woke up at 2pm and I literally forgot that I already took my exam, I thought I had slept in and I was almost crying when I checked my phone because I thought none of my friends even called me. After a few minutes I got back into my senses, and I felt so relieved hahaha"

4434,"Oh I see what the disconnect is here. My comment was poorly written - I was expressing surprise at OP drawing that conclusion about me, not dismissing the existence of school trauma."
4435,"Every now and again I wake up in the middle of the night shaken to my core with anxiety. I dream that I am failing a class that I always forget to go to. Today is the last exam of the semester, I already failed the first two and I will not be able to graduate this year if I don‚Äôt pass this class.

... I graduated 10 years ago."
4436,"Not me, but my dad in college would always have a nightmare during exam weeks of finding out he was registered for a class that he had never attended and then having to take the final exam that was two days later for a class that he had never attended in a subject he knew nothing about"
4437,"I don't know about the others, but the final for a class you forgot you had is a very common dream, even years after graduating.

The common dreams phenomenon is one I'm surprised we don't know more about, since, ya know, it's really friggin' bizarre that so many people would independently share the same basic dream concept.

They're also so weirdly specific. Not just anxiety about an exam, or an exam you're unprepared for, or an exam you forgot about, but an exam for a class you went the whole semester without showing up for. If you had an episode of Star Trek and two crew members reported sharing such similar dreams they'd investigate the shit out of that.

The only other shared dream I get is discovering a new room in your apartment. This one is apparently only common among people in high density cities like NYC."
4438,"I usually get nightmares before exams come up. For example I dream that I wake up late and miss my exam (which results me in waking up multiple times and checking the clock!), or receiving a really shit grade."
4439,"It wouldn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm subbed or not. Im just a lurker. I‚Äôm only commenting my experience with this. The dreams happened during college, after high school. It‚Äôs just what my unconscious associates stress with."
4440,[deleted]
4441,I‚Äôve had those years later lol
4442,"I‚Äôve had these before. I‚Äôve had the nightmares but I think the worst part is I get too anxious that I can‚Äôt sleep. This doesn‚Äôt help with studying just makes me not want to do anything related to it as it increases my anxiety levels. When it comes to the exam, I can‚Äôt focus and feel anxious until it‚Äôs over."
4443,I have these nightmares and I'm in high school
4444,I still have these and then I need a solid five minutes to realize I graduated already
4445,"It‚Äôs not always about finals, sometimes just school in general but always this time of year. One that‚Äôs reoccurring is where I‚Äôm trying to get up the steps and just about to be late for a test, but as I go up each step my legs start becoming almost paralyzed or just stiff and won‚Äôt move. It‚Äôs terrible."
4446,had a nightmare yesterday that I wasn‚Äôt able to turn in my AP human geo exam :‚ÄôD lmao woke up and seriously questioned if I actually turned it in or not (I did)
4447,What you mean? I have daymares. I get anxiety that I didn‚Äôt turn in my 12 page paper when I literally did it like 10 minutes ago. Or that I missed my exam time even though I looked at the clock and start time multiple times.
4448,"I would reach-out to student housing with your concerns specifically. You are not comfortable rooming with a girl which is totally valid. It can be a pain in the ass to get rooming arrangements changed. If nothing changes before move in I would just be upfront with her that you are attempting to change because you do not want to room with someone of the opposite gender, she will probably understand. If student housing is giving you hell, go to your schools title nine office. This is likely a title nine issue and if the title nine office decides so, students housing will magically find a new arrangement for you both. Best of luck."
4449,"Lmao, if anything you're being trans-supportive by recognizing she's not a guy. I'm not sure how to escalate here‚Äîif there really is no other housing you may be sunk‚Äîbut for now I'd discuss this with your roomie and see what you can each do to be comfortable and get some privacy."
4450,Exactly. This all seems very unsafe for her!
4451,How does your roommate feel?  Would she prefer to live with other women?  I'm thinking if the two of you make the request together / at the same time it would carry more weight.
4452,"Yeah, OP should talk to her and join forces. I'm sure she'd understand and even be grateful, as it means he really sees her as a girl. 

Worst case? Look out for each other. This may be a better roommate match than if she gets put in a room with a transphobic cis girl"
4453,"She has a legit Title IX claim. Universities go full stop at title 9 claims, they don't eff around with the Feds."
4454,"this post is a shitty situation, but these comments are for the most part sweet, empathetic, and constructive, and i wanted to acknowledge that. thanks, chat!"
4455,ya ur also supporting her identity which is good
4456,"I'm guessing she's also pretty uncomfortable with the whole situation too. I bet if you two work together you could probably switch out for someone else.

Funnily enough a similar situation happened at my uni, a trans girl and straight guy were put together and although she trusted the guy, was fairly uncomfortable with him. A gay guy from the same building actually volunteered to switch with the straight guy and while it wasn't a perfect solution, made everyone a lot more comfortable. Maybe you could do something like this?"
4457,"I'm trans, and you're certainly not transphobic at all, the blame would totally lie with the university as they were the ones who couldn't update the system! (:"
4458,"came here to say the same thing, your roommate is probably anxious about the arrangement as well.  if your college says they‚Äôre full for housing, you may have to make the best of it (communicate any discomfort w your roommate, continue being empathetic, etc.). 

there will likely be ppl in your incoming class who drop soon into the school year or after the first break. this frees up rooms and hopefully you or her can move into a different space that makes everyone happy."
4459,"what kind of mixed signals?

OP requested to be roomed with a male. His roommate is not male. There are no mixed signals here."
4460,"""How do you think a young woman will feel about having a sexually active male in her tiny room if that's the case?""

Uhhh, she's not a ""sexually active male"", she's a woman.

""I am a trans-feminine castrated male""

I seriously doubt that because trans women do not typically call themselves ""castrated males"".

""After I came out, but before I transitioned, I would never have imagined entering women's spaces.""

Transition is a very long process with no defined start or end, it includes, but not always, social transition, hormones, and surgeries. At what point would you consider it okay to enter woman's spaces? As a woman I'd say it's after any of those points.

""And yes gay people exist and college dormitories are basically torture for them.""

Just, bro... what the fuck are you talking about?"
4461,"This one is tricky, because the campus gave you what you wanted based on the paperwork. Whether it's socially constructed or not we can debate it later, but sometimes guys want to be with their boys (you wanted to bond with another guy both in gender and biology). When I was pre-law, I use to love complex cases like this. You're not going to win if you put the focus on you. However, you could go to the university and say that they aren't respecting her gender by putting her with males, plus they aren't respecting you by putting you with a woman. By pushing this angle, you are supporting trans rights and forcing the university to acknowledge that they didn't respect her transition in order to keep her as your roommate."
4462,"If OPs roommate goes to the Title IX office to file a complaint, it is entirely possible the situation will resolve itself as universities DO NOT mess about with federal laws. I am not a title ix officer but I did sleep in a holiday in express once."
4463,"Um.. it says he profile was made before she transitioned. There's a possibility there was a mistake due to a lack of communication but I don't believe a college would on purpose disrespect anyone's gender identity. But I also don't know, I am privileged that my university is respectful."
4464,"yea as a trans person, i'm sure this is honestly super uncomfortable for her as well. i would reach out to others at university housing. at the very least there has to be some sort of arrangement that makes the both of you comfortable"
4465,"Lol really? Ofc it can be worse, but if he uncomfortable then he should not just suck it up.
Ask for a room change üëç"
4466,Garbage take. Gender is a very important aspect of a roommate to most people and that's perfectly normal.
4467,"In what way?


He didn't want to room with a woman. He's rooming with a woman.


Pretty cut-and-dried."
4468,How does a Title IX factor into this situation?
4469,"Trans med alert! üö® 

Please deal with your internalized transphobia in a space thats not public where all of us have to see your hateful thoughts please!"
4470,How? He‚Äôs clearly labeling her as what she wants to be labeled as.
4471,"as a trans person, i think you're getting confused between trans males and trans females"
4472,1.4 million comment karma damn üíÄ
4473,"The correct term is ""cis"" not ""natural"""
4474,Trans is just an adjective.  Trans women are women who were born male.  Source: am trans woman
4475,maybe they meant that due to a title IX rule the university bought them a hotel instead. This would show how much they‚Äôd try to avoid a title IX issue
4476,"I didn‚Äôt say you were fake at all! I have no doubts that you are completely genuine :) I have met enough people in the trans community that love to gatekeep and medicalize all sorts of things related to transition unfortunately! So no need to convince me of your existence too. 

But rather than taking your internalized transphobia out on others in an attempt to appeal to cis het standards, I implore you to get in community with other queer folks and learn how harmful what you are spreading is to us all.

4481,"I‚Äôm just not going to say anything for now, unfortunately the online class is full so if i have to do in person i have no choice but to decline the offer."
4482,"First off, this ain't your fault. This is your advisor's fault. Your advisor should feel unaccomplished, not you."
4483,"Honestly you may wanna try and stand your ground. Go in and say ‚Äúlook I know this was an accident but you screwed this up. If I‚Äôd known about this class over the last 4 years I would‚Äôve knocked it out in time but there‚Äôs not a lot I can do about it when you drop it on me in my final semester a week before graduation. It‚Äôs ridiculous that I‚Äôve paid a lot for this education and your office screwed this up. You need to make it right and let me graduate.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs big bullshit that they did that to you."
4484,"Working on that now, the reapplication for graduation takes 2-3 days. My enrollment is locked until then. Thank you"
4485,I would email the Dean or department head and explain your situation. This is definitely a case where they would lift the limit especially if you have a job offer.
4486,"Same situation with an acquaintance at UPenn about 3 yrs ago ... counselor admitted error.  Parent called and complained about counselor error, etc etc etc ... they found the credits and she graduated. The parent was pretty loud in their displeasure (rightfully so bc they would have had to pay for the additional credits too!).  In your situation I would mention that this could potentially jeopardize employment since you truthfully filled out the employment application as graduating in May.
Did u have regular semester mtgs with the counselor?"
4487,"I just feel stupid, i did my degree audit and it said i was good except when I did it for supply chain and it said one class was missing I just figured my advisor had a better idea what was going on than me."
4488,"if the mentioned class if full at your university, are you able to take it at a community college and then transfer those credits? Lots of community colleges offer online classes and usually have tons of seats open"
4489,"I sure hope so, i appreciate it"
4490,This exact thing happened to me but I got my advisor to count another course I took as a substitute for the one I needed.  I don't know if you can do that with a core course but it's worth asking.  What BS.
4491,"Don't blame yourself. Your advisor fucked up and now it's interfering with your goals. That's not right at all, and it's not fair. That's literally their job. The other commenters had great advice. I wish you luck!"
4492,"If I were in your shoes, I would let my new employer know the situation exactly as you described it ASAP.  You need the class regardless, so at some point you will have to take it, and the job is either going accommodate it or they wont."
4493,"Check your Degreework, if you have that. It tells you the % completed of core classes. Just do it to verify what the advisor said."
4494,"Even if it is asynchronous, I would still let them know. Open communication should never be an issue."
4495,"If this isn‚Äôt the truest post ever. In 2019, I was in my second to last year of college, severely depressed, suicidal, close to being dismissed for a second and final time, all while battling a very serious substance abuse/addiction problem that I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone about.

It‚Äôs now 2021,  and I started my first big boy job at the height of the pandemic making close to six figures. 

looking back, i can‚Äôt believe I made it out of that dark spiral. At the time it was literal hell, like I actually wanted to die but I can‚Äôt help but look back and smile and see how much I overcame. 

My point is, don‚Äôt sweat it. It will work out. My school was extremely accommodating. Schools measure their success by the success of their student. They are there for you. Regardless, even if they can‚Äôt work something out if you‚Äôre honest with your company, there is no reason why they wouldn‚Äôt work with you. 

Reach out if you need"
4496,"You might be surprised how malleable colleges can be. It's their own criteria, anyway. I had a bunch of theology credits but literally none of the required courses at my very Catholic university, and the dean of the theology department wrote waivers for all of them."
4497,"How tf does an advisor make that kind of mistake? Doesn't your school have degree audits that can be used to check degree progress. Nevertheless, congratulations on a successful 4 years. Do not let a summer course ruin the moment when you still get to walk and keep your upcoming job. 10 weeks will be over before you know it."
4498,"You might also ask about an independent study. If you have a prof that likes you they will sometimes take it on. 

But first confirm about maybe using occupational/life experience for credit and such. 

Sorry you got caught up in this BS. Won‚Äôt matter in a few years but is a pain right now."
4499,">suck at math) for an entire week and studying, genuinely trying to do my

I almost check that once a month, or at least every time a class is complete. 

I sadly hear this adviser or this mistake so much, that I give up and just do it myself and don't even talk to the adviser. but also my school's Degreeworks can be wrong because of stupid changes to the degree plan, that doesn't grandfather you in unless you're graduating that semester."
4500,Yes. Do this. Now. It's bullshit that they think it is okay to do this to you
4501,If i can get into the online class should I still say something? Its supposed to be a pretty easy management class. I can get it done on weekends.
4502,"I came here to say this too. OP, check into DSST or CLEP exams. I took 10 of them to shorten my undergraduate degree and 3 of them counted towards both mandatory and elective business courses (the rest were general electives to fulfill my 120 credit hour requirement).

CLEP/DSSTs are about $100 per test and are entered as a pass/fail grade (no fail if you don‚Äôt pass though, so the only thing you‚Äôre out of is time and money)."
4503,Yep. See if you can ELP assess or CLEP it.
4504,"I've seen things like this happen a few times over the years.  Unhappily, even though it was an honest error you will probably still have to take the summer course.  At least they are letting you walk and there is a ready fix by taking the summer course.  Its a bummer, but there is no reason for you to feel defeated over it.  Edited to add: I agree with the answers which say to see if they will make an exception to the size limit of the online course."
4505,"I‚Äôm sorry OP. Sadly, if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. I always have double checked everything my advisor says and emailed other people like department heads about credit questions too if my advisor was ever unclear about something. I hope you get this straightened out and can still take your job."
4506,"Did they tell you last time you saw your advisor that you would graduate? I would raise hell man. 

They tried to do the same thing to me for a class that I was enrolled in but they dropped because there wasn‚Äôt enough students. I said when am I supposed to take it and they said it would be available again in the fall and I said I‚Äôm graduating this spring so figure it out. They ended up rolling one of my credits to cover that credit and then another one to cover the one they moved

Edit to add: basically everyone I talked to at my university had been screwed at one time or another by an advisor. They don‚Äôt know what the hell they‚Äôre doing. If you put enough pressure on them they‚Äôll snap"

4538,"Remember that the majority of weight loss is dependent upon a good diet! It's very easy to put on weight if you aren't watching your caloric intake, and it's very hard to combat an excessive caloric intake with exercise!"

4545,"For some motivation, I was 280lbs in August and over the school year I dropped my weight to 220lbs. All it took was a little discipline in what i ate and working out a few hours a week."
4546,"I agree.

Personally I love working out, looking good and being strong, so I never had a problem with working out.

My tip would be not to force yourself to do hard training, but to find exercises that you like and turn working out into a hoby. To my mind a better long-term strategy to work out a bit every day tham to do hard exercises 3 times a week.

P. S. During the quarantine I've became the strongest form of myself in a long time, because of zoom lectures I am able to plan my time better and have more energy at the end of the day."
4547,Chloe Ting workouts HURT I 100% recommend them
4548,"I suck at continuing to work out. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I would go to the rec center for a day, and then not go again for months. Even during quarantine, I worked out one day in March. Haven‚Äôt worked out since."

4557,"Could it be that you went there, did a hard workout, got home, felt tired and by doing so created a line of thought that workimng out is very hard and by doing so discourage yourself from ever doing it again? 
I have a few tips for you (if you're interested).

1. You started too hard, burned out and trained your mind to think that working out is hard and sucks.
My advice would be to not go to the gym from the start. 
Start working out at home. Start by doimg like 10 push ups, and 20 squats (if you jave the opportunity it wouls be great to add pull ups to this [the pull up is a very important exercise]).

2. The key is consistency. Don't pish yourself very hard 1-3 times a week, instead do easy to medium intensity exercises every day. You don't have to do push ups until your bones start to crack (OPM joke), instead do as many SETS as you can with low intensity.
Example: you stand up to go to the bathroom, on the way there do some pushups and squats.
Go to get water, do some push ups and squats.
Taking out the trash, find a bar and do some pull ups.

This kind of low intensity training has amazing results.
1. You will build a habbit of working out a bit.
2. Even though it's low intensity, it WILL give you results.
3. Eventualy you might start to feel like training at home is too easy and go to the gym (which isn't a requirement).

All in all, try it out, good luck!"

For time management, a week before school resumes, I usually create a very very detailed schedule/time tracker form that details literally down to every hour(I get distracted very easily).

I had one who never called an exam an exam. They were ‚Äúcelebrations of learning.‚Äù 

I had one who wore a baseball cap on exam days because ‚Äúit‚Äôs less formal.‚Äù 

The exam I had last week included a ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù question about how to advise a difficult colleague about a statistics thing they were definitely doing wrong. He ended the question saying it was definitely a made up story and not real. The professor is the chair of my PhD committee so I asked about it. It was a real story, which I suspected."

4629,"I completely agree. We have no idea if students are first generation college students who didn‚Äôt get to hear parents talking about the differences between high school and college, whether they have anxiety and feel the need to err on the side of caution the first couple of times, whether they had a bad experience with another teacher publicly calling them out, etc."
4630,"For those who don't know, there's a tradition at a dissertation defense (the last step before you earn your Ph.D.). Though it's already been decided by your committee that you've passed, there is still a public defense, after which your committee retires to another room to pretend to make the already made decision. _The one word your dissertation advisor says when the committee comes back out_, in front of other faculty, other students, your friends, and your parents is: ""Doctor"".

You don't f with that title. 

To qualify OP's excellent advice, the professor title is traditionally specific to professors, which many people with doctorates aren't, or aren't yet. (For example, it's common to take a ""postdoc"" position before you become faculty as an assistant professor.) There's reasonable debate about whether you should first address, say, someone with the job title ""lecturer"" as professor or doctor, but others' advice stands: start with the formal title until encouraged by the person to use something like a first name.

About that, when I taught a class once, I -- who don't hold a doctorate -- made a point the first day to ask my students to call me by my first name or Mr., not as professor or doctor. I'd seen what it takes to earn those titles, and I wasn't going to imply I had."
4631,"Hint: Read the syllabus. Their preferred title is likely in there. If their signature says ""Dr."" Or ""PhD"". Call them doctor.  

If you haven't received the syllabus yet, professor would be safe. 

After you meet them, call them what they request."
4632,"First name is common enough in the U.S., but the courtesy followed is Prof./Dr. until welcomed otherwise."
4633,"Ps: I think this applies more to American universities. In NZ, the professors are more chill and prefer to be called by their first names. I've been to 2 local unis here."
4634,"Yeah, it's something that could've been included on class rules during orientation or the first day of classes."
4635,It is weird but it can‚Äôt be totally surprising. For years and years we‚Äôve had to use the restroom and then suddenly we don‚Äôt have to ask? Like sure we‚Äôre adults but the assumption that all adults are magically the same overnight is a bit frustrating üò≠
4636,"well if you dont have a doctorate you definitely cant claim the doctor title, but you couldve claimed professor!"
4637,It was beat into my head in high school to ask for anything. Like we had to ask to get a tissue. So in college I wasn't thinking and asking my bio prof if I could go to the bathroom and he stared at me for a second and looked concerned.
4638,"We do that outside of class, but never to the actual professor"
4639,Is this still true in small classes (<20 people) where getting up and leaving would be very noticeable? Feels strange to just get up and leave without acknowledging it. I just avoid using the bathroom during class lol.
4640,"Yes it is. Just get up, quietly, and walk out."
4641,I have never called a professor by their name in my 8 years of higher education. I ain‚Äôt ever know em like that.

Edit: For those who don‚Äôt know: if you‚Äôre in a post-baccalaureate program it means you‚Äôve earned at least a bachelors degree and are in a 1-2 year program taking upper level science courses (or standard science courses depending on your major) in order to enhance your application into a Pre-health higher education program (dental/medical/PA/etc)

Edit 2: not once did our professor say it was okay to refer to him by his first name. When this email was sent out, the semester was basically almost over. A whole semester of calling him Dr. _____, just to all of a sudden switch it up to his first name ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

4659,"I can‚Äôt reply to u/Maximum_Obligation40 for some reason so I‚Äôll comment here directly.

I think you grossly misinterpret the status of Asians in American society. I concede two things. Diversity and welcoming other backgrounds is important, and an exclusively Asian student body would be harmful. However, in UC Berkeley, a college that cannot legally implement AA, only 36% of their student body is Asian, and other non-white students comprise 46.1% of the student body. A lack of diversity created by Asians is not a problem there.

I also concede that Asians have the highest median income among major demographics. However, median income is not the only determinant of opportunity. Asians, on average, invest far more into education into other demographics, and that‚Äôs the primary driving factor of positive education outcomes like higher test scores. I don‚Äôt believe the Asian bloc as a whole should be punished and pitted against each other by AA for their cultural preference to investing more into education because it erases a reality that Asians generally work harder to promote youth education.

Asians are discriminated at a comparable level to other minorities. For every hate crime against a white person, there are 20.6 against Blacks, 5.1 against Asians, and 2.6 against Hispanics. 1st and 2nd generation Asian immigrants also don‚Äôt receive any generational benefits such as legacy admissions and industry connections that are generally exclusive to whites. I can tell you from personal experience that the vast majority of early career opportunities today are diversity programs for URMs or unofficially exclusive to those with connections, and Asians are the only demographic excluded by this practice.

A relatively small gap in median household income between Asians and Whites is not nearly enough to justify Asians being the only demographic negatively affected by AA and other diversity programs. Why should evaluating skin color be the only option to even the playing field? In my opinion, metrics like household income or generation status are far more appropriate. I hope you diversify your sources of knowledge, learn more about Asian experiences in the US, and develop a real understanding of AA before you call it‚Äôs opposition dangerous and racist."
4660,"Affirmative Action is racist in nature. NOBODY should be given an advantage or a disadvantage based on their race. If you do want to help, then base it on socioeconomic status."
4661,"A lot of immigrants don‚Äôt have parents who finished high school. Heck, my parents didn‚Äôt even finish elementary school."
4662,I mean if you look at things it‚Äôs not Affrimative action that‚Äôs taking your spots but trust fund kids and legacies . People who donate tons of money or pay coaches or photoshop their kids into teams like that recent scandal. And it‚Äôs not necessarily test scores that matter at all with everything. Almost everyone who get accepted has top scores and 4.0‚Äôs and 1600‚Äôs. So there‚Äôs more factors to do with it than you think.
4663,"As a Black, non-nigerian, college graduate who went to a high school with a primarily asian body, I have a lot of opinions to share on this with regards to AA.

Obviously, there is no such thing as asian privilege that is perceived but the schools your applying to, which by gauging your complaints in this post, is probably not a great level school, but somewhere in the ivy league range or above..  maybe even a school with a prestigious (shitty) acceptance rate of 6%. No one is running into issues with AA at anything below that, that's preposterous given how large student bodies are and how many dumbasses make it into ""great"" schools. I'll define a great school being something that if a reputable company saw it on your resume, you'd be in a ballpark for a hire.

Based on my personal experience, I took AP classes all throughout highschool, so I sat alongside the best of the best at my school, which was a large school of primarily  students of asian descent. Not a single one of them missed out on an opportunity for higher education as they all made it into the great schools (as I defined above) that they applied to as ""fallbacks"". If you're having trouble hitting a school at that level, it's not AA, you're just not good enough. That's all there is to it.

Let's say your goal is upper level ivy league like Brown, Harvard, etc... These schools reject literal valedictorians. This is where AA might seem like a problem, but I'm going to argue that it's your own race outshining you and not the outlier black guy who barely made it in. Let's consider you: let's say you have great community service hours, highest chair in band/ ochestra, amazing GPA, high SAT/ ACT, top 3% or above maybe even valedictorian at your school. I guarantee if I search around I can probably find another student of asian descent with even more success than you who probably has PERFECT SAT/ ACT scores, presidential roles in all their organizations, Valedictorian, and amazing community service, and let's say they even some how raised $300,000 on their own in charity. I guarantee if I search around I can find a student of asian descent even better than him.

Now you tell me how likely it is to find student of black descent that is valedictorian, perfect SAT/ ACT scores, amazing community service hours, and also high ranks in organizations. Yes we exist, but how common do you think that is? Very uncommon, arguably we are an outlier group of students, and assuming you know your stuff on math, outliers aren't going to calculate statistical significance in your claim that we are hurting your chances at getting into a school such as this. We make up roughly 10% of the population, of that 10% a small amount are seniors in highschool applying to college, of that even smaller percent -> an even more miniscule percentage have the credentials to be applying to upper ivy league. So I'd argue it's incredibly rare for you to even see a student of black descent making it to that level or above.

If you're complaining about us, an extremely rare occurance nonetheless, hurting your chances at getting into an amazing school, that means you are likely at the bottom of the barrel of all the other students of asian descent, arguing that you are the worst of your race who applied to that school and sitting at the supposed boundary where AA affects your chances. This is an extremely thin line to be at, and if you made it there, you yourself are an outlier which I'm going to assume is untrue.

You probably just don't have the necessary backing to hit these schools. Unfortunately, it is what it is. Continue applying and don't bring race into this, that's what a lot of us POCs do already.

On the rare chance that you are sitting within the boundaries where AA determines your acceptance and getting rejected, call the school and explain that you want to get in and why you deserve to be a student. Don't waste your energy here, this is Reddit we can't do anything for you.

Regardless, your accomplishments DO matter. You're not an asian student. You're a student first who happens to be asian. And if it matters, don't worry to harshly about this point in you life, it's so short in comparison to the remainder. Your hotheaded ambitions tells me already, you're going to be successful in the future, so keep trying and I'm sure you'll hit something big."
4664,"I feel like people tend to lump everyone who checks the ‚Äúasian‚Äù box into a single category forgetting that the range of experiences we can have.

4668,"There is no other country in the world with a system like this. America specifically created a system that focuses on race to pit minorities against each other and ensure class structures continue.

4671,"I completely agree with you. I mentioned this in another comment:

It also doesn't make sense to compare applicants to their own race group. One Asian applicant may have had significantly fewer educational opportunities than another. I would completely get it if they compared applicants to their own socioeconomic group based on income - and in turn, educational opportunities (ie. applicants with a household income below 15k/year, 30k/year, 100k, etc.)"
4672,"You are falling for a big misconception where you see Asian people as a monolith, which is not true in the slightest, but Affirmative Action naysayers have imprinted in the media and on political bandwagons. The system in which you speak up wanting to suppress Asians is not BIPOC/Minority driven but a mechanism of the dominant white culture that is prevalent in higher education. You are told to turn around and kick other groups for your own success, and this isn't just a Asian vs. Everyone scenario, it's the same for BIPOC who turn around and kick their own communities down. There are also no such things as race counts in affirmative action (even when it was technically on the books), and it's a non issue given that no pubic schools are using it now (due to the laws).

Southeast 1st-2nd generation Asians actually stand to benefit greatly from affirmative action due to the smaller population of Vietnamese, Filipino, Thai, Hmong etc. For many years they were classed together with the legacy groups such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. As schools have begun to separate them  consist trends have shown the lack of community divestment in South East Asian groups and the over lower numbers of them going into college, let alone graduating.

A lot of the affirmative action boogeymen concepts are just a way for (and I mean this in the nicest way possible) many Asian groups to continue their anti-black behaviors and for many parents of first generation to fit into the model minority. Luckily (and conversely unluckily) the recent rise in anti-Asian hate is making many Asian people realize that they are still considered 'others' by the dominant culture."
4673,"An interesting link I'd like to drop here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/t0j79t/oc_raceblind_berkeley_vs_raceconscious_stanford/

For those who don't know, the UCs aren't allowed to discriminate based on race, and therefore Asians tend to be overrepresented there. However, when you compare Berkeley to Stanford (both pretty prestigious top universities), which isn't race-blind, white students are actually more overrepresented than URMs. 

The point is that it's ridiculous to claim that AA is what makes it so hard for Asians. Not to imply that that's what you were claiming, but wanted to provide some data to back up another commenter's assertation that legacy admits and rich kids are what skew admissions against Asians more."
4674,This right here!!! Regardless of OP‚Äôs feelings about Affirmative Action POC still remain the minorities at all these top institutions. It‚Äôs the legacy and trust fund kids taking all the spots. The post is just misdirected confusion and I don‚Äôt think Affirmative Action can be cited as one of the reasons Asian‚Äôs face discriminations in the college application process.
4675,"Of course, and this is how I responded to other Redditors:

&#x200B;

Yup, exactly! And that's why I mentioned that AA does not give Black/Hispanic applicants an advantage. It simply accounts for their underrepresentation.  
If a Black/Hispanic applicant had bad stats regardless of their race, AA would not make up for that.  
All I'm saying is that Asians are expected to do better just because we're Asian. If two applicants fighting for one spot had identical GPAs, SAT scores, ECs, and LORs, the non-Asian applicant would be chosen over the Asian applicant, even if both of them had 4.0s/1600s.

&#x200B;

It also doesn't make sense to compare applicants to their own race group. One Asian applicant may have had significantly fewer educational opportunities than another.

4676,"the whole affirmative action thing based on race/sexual orientation just completely stupid. It should only be based on family income. If you're white/asian but came from a single parent low income household but still achieved high gpa and many achievements, then well done, despite your race."
4677,I cannot agree with you more. Thank you for this.
4678,">it's true that if affirmative action didn't exist that all the top schools in America would be 100% (or close to 100%} Asian. probably the top firms as well, would all be represented by Asians, with a zero sum for other races. there is a general meritocracy amongst Asian culture, generally, that is fierce and should be respected.

Exclusion isn‚Äôt even the only issue. Affirmative action is a political issue which can further affect the racism issues in our country. Minorities will have all their accomplishments attributed to affirmative action when in reality they worked their asses off for their place in a competitive university. It just creates animosity between students. 

More often than not, students from low income households are minorities. This should mean that using income as a basis for affirmative action will help increase diversity in a similar way that race based affirmative action does. I really don‚Äôt understand why race based affirmative action is necessary other than to boost numbers and make your dumb lecherous college more attractive ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Us have been dealing with for nearly a year. It‚Äôs this new change that no one predicted, but everyone hates. People are tired of this, they want to go back to some degree of normal. Is it annoying and stupid that people are fake caring, yes 100%. Am I tired of following the rules while others have fun, absolutely. However, I feel that mentality is exactly what our peers are feeling. They are done, they just want a college experience, they just want some fun social interaction that they have been deprived of.

4694,"When two people at my job tested positive for COVID and I had plans with my friends the following Saturday, I told them I couldn‚Äôt go because I didn‚Äôt want to risk anyone getting it if by the off chance I had it as well. As soon as I know about it, I will distance myself away from others to make sure they will not get it.

Wish others were like that."
4695,From what I've seen it's about split. The people coming to campus are either trying to get away from the responsibility of the virus or trying to take the responsibility of school seriously. There's a tension between those two want to be there to study who'll snitch on the partiers and those who don't care and want to party.
4696,Wow selling merch to capitalize on a global crisis is so slimy. That's like selling 9/11 themed t-shirts
4697,It is pretty controlled at a lot of schools. Generally things are caught pretty early and there aren‚Äôt any serious outbreaks or complications.

4701,They care when they actually get it because they cant party
4702,Too many people live in denial of the reality we're in. They think their fun and their convenience are the only things that matter.
4703,"I‚Äôm also sick of it. My frat used to have parties with 200+ people. Now, nothing. I‚Äôm a freshman and as sad as I am to not be able to party with the brothers I just got. I‚Äôm more excited to get through this tough time and celebrate that we can party again, WITH A HUGE PARTY OF COURSE. Until that day comes though, no parties for us. We have over 10k people on campus and haven‚Äôt hosted a single frat party."

They can be responsible and sensible. Their gender isn't stopping them."
4705,"I‚Äôm more sick of schools pretending to care, i don‚Äôt get why gouvernement owned businesses like schools get to have their classrooms with 30+ students in a small room but anyone else is completely restricted. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that the whole thing hasn‚Äôt just been moved to online. And you know shit like this is gonna happen because of braindead frat boys putting everyone at risk.. so just avoid the whole thing... gab it hurts my brain"

4707,">I think college students still think it‚Äôs only a old person‚Äôs disease and that young people don‚Äôt get it and if they do they won‚Äôt get sick

This is probably closer to the truth than you'd like to think.

This country needs to be shut down and all college classes need to be online. Bruh this is going to last several years if we just half ass fight it. We need to do what China did.

But of course we won‚Äôt because this country is obsessed with making profit. We could‚Äôve stopped and if not stopped at least made the virus controllable by now if we would‚Äôve took a better approach as a country.

Ohhh but ‚Äúmy first amendment right‚Äù screw those people freakin pigs. They‚Äôre a large reason why we are still stuck in this mess and why I can‚Äôt have a normal college experience."

4734,"Damn here I was ready to relate to some bad shit but it turned out mad wholesome. Good luck to you and you're doing great! I'm happy you have a prof that is kind and compassionate.

4735,"Earlier I had to present a programming project to a professor and was really nervous about it because it involved a lot of math, which I'm not very good at. I have an anxiety disorder but usually do well with presentations because I'd be well versed in what I'm presenting and ready for any question. It wasn't the case since, yeah, math makes me feel like the biggest idiot to ever live. 

I think he could tell I was quite anxious. He was very patient throughout, chuckled at my attempts to be funny when I'd say shit like ""someone *way* smarter than me came up with this"" when talking about a formula I used  and kept telling me that it's fine that ""I'm not a mathematician."""

4748,"Not to be an asshole or anything but working on an hour a day for me would never work out. In taking 15 credit hours and my engineering class alone of 5 credit hours regularly said I should be putting on average 2 hrs per day minimum so that I can spread out the work. Thats on the low side and assuming that I am not aiming for As in the class, 2 hrs average would be aiming for a high C low B.

Im really glad you found a way that works for you an your major and espically going to school when you have kids. I could never imagine how stressful that must be for you. Thank you for making this post because even if it wouldnt help me, it will help someone else.

I really just wanted to say that this advice will not work for everyone and no one should be feeling bad that they are working longer than an hour a day and not getting As."

4750,"Hi!! Thank you for providing these tips.

May I ask you what your major is?

I wish I could do this. Online classes have gotten harder this semester. I feel really burnt out, especially since my university took away our breaks for fall 2020. I am a nursing student and I‚Äôm looking for different, more efficient ways for me to study but still take care of myself. I‚Äôm also getting a puppy too.

How do you study for exams and remember information?"
4751,we really all have the same disorder huh
4752,[deleted]
4753,"Business Administration; Accounting. I want an MBQ and CPA. 

Very different than nursing, but look into a bullet journal on pinterest. Nursing Students specifically use them. I use them for a ton of non school stuff too just to stay organized"
4754,1 hour a day for homework is not possible for some majors. Cudos to you for finding a system that works and a major you are passionate about!
4755,"The math doesn't really work out. You'd be only doing 70 minutes per class a week. Also, ADHD with a solid GPA. I put in 6 to 7 hours a week on my primary major class alone."
4756,Are you speed reading textbooks and watching zero lectures? I'm not trying to be critical it just sounds a little impossible by a wide margin. I'm also an accounting major.
4757,Thats like 6 classes. Either youre joking or your program is a joke
4758,You have 3 school aged kids at 23?
4759,"I have a calculus midterm in 45 minutes, should probably start studying..."
4760,So you‚Äôre just bragging?
4761,"I actually stopped reading his comment as soon as he said ""engineering"" I heard enough stories and seen enough memes to know engineers study 24/7"
4762,I actually wrote it for the ADHD subreddit. It was mostly for people who struggle with time management because they excelled at academics as a teen and have bad habits.
4763,"I mean memorization-heavy curriculum still requires more than 1 hour a day, medicine says hi"
4764,I agree. I‚Äôm a computer science major and the people I know who study most efficiently still easily spend upwards of three hours a day. This is great advice if your major is memorization heavy.
4765,"It‚Äôs Business Administration, learn buzzword soup with intro economics intro accounting and intro finance and voil√†. 18 credit hours is a cakewalk."
4766,"Yeah, if it works for OP, good on them, but I hope everyone reading is critical of whether or not they can apply the same tips. For example, I take a lot of math and physics heavy courses (engineering major) and there‚Äôs no way I could get away with working for just an hour a day. One physics problem set can easily take me over 5 hours to do and my coding projects can take take 10+ hours a week and I‚Äôm definitely a quick worker (usually finish exams in around half the allotted time), and that‚Äôs just 2/7 courses"
4767,"Tldr: be organized, be concise, be diligent, be consistent."
4768,Failed.done.moving on
4769,even with a memorization heavy major i don‚Äôt understand how any way near 1 hr a day would be possible. I am a biochemistry double major which is a memorization heavy major and to get anywhere near an A in my classes I would need to spend more atleast an hour on them alone. like i didnt spend the proper amount of them in them and thats why my grade sucks
4770,"Ok, so by the time you get around to homework you know the answer already I assume. Maybe you've developed a super efficient strategy and honed it. Bravo, nice when ADHD gives a little back. How hard is Intermediate 2, I have got it coming up."
4771,/r/holup
4772,Yeahh. I don't buy any of this. OP is spinning tall tales.
4773,"""i (23f) just took my adderall and want to make a long extremely detailed list of things and publish it""

im 26 now and i used to take the maximum prescribed adderall (30mg xr) 5 to 6 days a week. it made me feel great and it made me feel like all i wanted to do was be around people and talk to them and tell them all sorts of cool stuff. unfortunately its all crackhead energy and when youre young and surrounded by academia people dont notice it as much, as well as it hits your system differently. luckily i stopped using adderall when i was like 19 so it never made me look or sound like a crack head."
4774,"I only put about 7-10 hrs into school a week. I literally can't afford to put in more with 3 kids and a job. 

I use these tips to study hyper efficiently because I have to. 

(I'm majoring in business Administration;accounting, going for an mba and CPA. To give you a clue to the specific courses.)"
4775,"sounds like advice for neurotypicals tbh. I can do all that and still not be able to process what I'm reading when I try to study

I get what OP is going for and if I had some external structure like her these tips could probably help me but I don't. I need external structure to function and there's none in quarantine so I just can't do anything. being basically unmedicated this entire semester isn't helping either"
4776,"Just find the derivative and you‚Äôll be fine, promise.

Also good luck, I wish my university offered calculus, I absolutely loved it in HS"
4777,Cries in STEM
4778,"I‚Äôve done something very similar to this. Except it wasn‚Äôt minutes before the class it was two hours before class. It was me using a textbook to make a 2 page script for some psychology presentation. I was extremely sick, on a bus that was not making it easy to write the script down, and I presented 3rd. So I had about 15 minutes to practice this bullshit script I wrote on a bus. I ended up remembering the entire script. Presented it really well and got an A. Felt like a super hero, but also like a major idiot lol."

Literally me pulling bullshit Latin American music essays out 15 minutes before class starts."
4780,post the powerpoint please !!
4781,Being sick and doing anything school related sucks. It‚Äôs truly when your worst work comes out cause you just wanna lay in bed and die.
4782,"Me and a partner did something similar. An hour before class, chatting with someone else from class in the library, I learned our 10 minute presentation was 30. We banged out another 20 minutes and got an A. It was stressful, but less so than your experience."
4783,I should also mention that I wrote the final six pages of my senior thesis the day it was due. And I got an A. Clearly my last-minute writing skills improved by then!
4784,[deleted]
4785,Did the same thing my freshman year. Miraculously got a B. I will never be that ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù ever again
4786,"This reminds me of the time I finished a 12 page research paper the night before it was due in high school. Had to be on the bus at 7:50 so I worked on the paper until 1am and slept for 5 hours and then worked my ass off to finish it before I left. 

I bsed that paper so badly but somehow I had earned an A. My teacher even told me about how she was so proud of me and wanted to use it as a model in the next year. I wanted to laugh so much in her face as I thought I turned in shit work since I rushed it."
4787,"What an experience, haha! I‚Äôd love to see the PowerPoint!"
4788,"""I don't procrastinate because I'm lazy, I do it for *the rush*"""
4789,I've gotta see this presentation
4790,"Done this! It was also for history, it was my first 5 page essay and I started four hours before it was due. I got an A and he commented the biggest ding was I didn‚Äôt use all my sources but besides that it was solid."
4791,100% not worth risking failing for plagiarism.
4792,I feel like all of my hair would turn gray and fall out if I were to write a seven page paper in two hours.
4793,"Last fall I had a 6 page paper of the Aenid which I had not read. Started it around 3 am and stopped about 5 am to take a shower, I finally finished putting my references in at about 7:50 and had to print it and turn it in by 8am. made a 90 would have had a 100 if I would have had another source. Later we had a group project over the Canterbury tales and she made me a group leader because ""I can tell you put so much work into this class"". I'm just like yeah totally."

For my online technical writing class: The final project was due & I was able turn it in no problem. 

However, upon further reading into the rubric: it needed to be 10 pages & it was due in 10 minutes.

I stayed up till 6am with my morning class in an hour writing this paper.

In the additional comments section I wrote: ""I am really sorry I ""accidentally"" sent the wrong file!"" 

I somehow got the highest grade in my class & my report is currently being used as example for future students of that class"
4801,That's impossible there is no fucking way
4802,"i honestly would have just walked out. Nothing gives me anxiety than not prepping for a presentation. Could never wing it like you, like my mind would be blurry and wouldnt be able to focus."
4803,"Maybe you use so much source material from your lack of knowledge and studying that it really was a great research paper. Everything in that paper came from your sources to make it faster, and thus u won"
4804,"I can relate, I once wrote a 10 page essay within four hours for a guy I was dating for a 400 level class I never took.

4810,"Shitty situation, but awesome attitudes of both you and the professor, it seems like."
4811,Does this happen a lot to a lot of students? My final exam dates are stuck into my head since its getting close to semester ends.
4812,"Don't think of it as wasted. It's life experience. You can grow from this experience and take that knowledge with you the rest of your life. Maybe you met someone you wouldn't have otherwise. Maybe you will meet someone in the next class. Maybe your spouse!

I'm sorry I know it sucks. No way around that. But try not to dwell on it. Good luck"
4813,"Hes a very nice person and I have no reason to act up because Im the one that made the mistake, also we we got along really well in class."

4817,Thank you appreciate your perspective.
4818,"Hey, it‚Äôll be okay! People makes mistakes! Clearly you are a good student and will ensure nothing like this will happen again.

While you will have to take the class again, your relationship with the professor seems good, you won‚Äôt have to relearn any material, and maybe there will be some extra opportunities outside of class given your expertise with the material!"

4826,"I missed mine too. Overslept, the dumbest way to miss that shit. Ur not alone."
4827,"Showed up to the exam hall on tuesday rather than thursday when it actually was. It was a different psych exam than The one I was supposed to take but didnt realize until I had already given the TAs my student ID and sat down in the middle of the room, when they handed out the paper exam. Flipped it open and immediately saw psych 180 or something and felt stupid as hell. Ended up just doing it though so I didnt have to squeeze past people taking the exam, walk all the way to the front, and have the TAs search through 500 ID cards while I just stood there in front of everyone."
4828,"I'm am so sorry about this. Shit happens to all of us in life. None of us are perfect. 

I know that it is hard to think positive right now but at least you will have an easier class next semester if you understood the material well. Your professor seems fond of you. You can also go over material for the course during your break since you already have notes if you are motivated to study.

4838,"He's bluffing, just leave on time, and if he tries to pull that, go directly to the head of his department. As far as saying you have shit to do, just say, ""I have obligations after this class, and the class ends at 6:45."" No need to elaborate further."
4839,"I'm a professor, and his behavior is super inappropriate. If I accidentally run over even a minute, I (quickly) apologize to my students. They might need to get to a meal, another class, a job, the bathroom, etc. It's just none of my business what they do after class time. I would never ask. 

Since talking to the professor apparently hasn't worked, I suggest going to the department head. Even if the professor can't stop you from walking out early and doesn't verbally abuse you, you may miss important information, which should be presented during the stated class time. To be extra polite, you could even ask if the time on the schedule is correct, because the professor lectures until 7:00 p.m. and you need to leave at 6:45."
4840,Exactly - it‚Äôs an abuse of authority period.
4841,I dont want him to yell at me in front of everyone and he says he‚Äôll count us absent for packing up/leaving early. Im just not sure how to word ‚Äúim an adult who has shit to do‚Äù nicely without triggering him

Boggles my mind that attendance is a thing in some places. I understand taking attendance in high school but in college or at university? Lol."
4843,I guess I‚Äôll see tonight. Thanks for the input
4844,"Literally say, ""it's 6:45, unless I'm getting an extra credit hour for staying longer, you will not mark me absent, or I'll be speaking to the chair."" Make a boundary. If he crosses that boundary make sure he knows there will be consequences."
4845,"When troublesome students contest grades, it's nice to have a clear paper trail of ""you didn't even show up to class."""
4846,[deleted]
4847,"Don't do this.  It's unnecessary and easily verifiable if the prof decides to look into it.  Just leave it at ""I have other obligations""

If you lie and he catches you on it, it changes the discussion from the prof's inappropriate behavior to your honesty.  It muddies the water and puts both of you in the wrong for no reason.

If you feel compelled to give him a specific reason, family obligations, doctors appointments, work schedule, etc. are all valid reasons to need to leave.  He might not be happy about any of them, but being honest about what you're doing is a much better idea, especially if your complaint might go to the dept chair or dean."
4848,"I know a lot of people are saying ‚Äújust leave you‚Äôre an adult‚Äù but people have got to remember that‚Äôs lot of college students are only now just learning to have independence in an educational setting. We spent 12 years of our life being told when we could use the bathroom. I know it sounds silly but it took me quite some time to feel comfortable leaving class to use the bathroom, since you don‚Äôt ask the teacher anymore. I am growing and learning with my independence, sometimes it‚Äôs not very useful to say ‚Äújust leave‚Äù when someone may have guilt to leave from all the years of school telling you you aren‚Äôt allowed to leave. We are still unlearning the conditioning from all the years in school."

4851,"As I understand it as explained by one of my former professors, it‚Äôs because in the U.S. most student loans are distributed by the government. It‚Äôs a way of basically kicking someone out for wasting government money. It seriously doubt it‚Äôs true and it‚Äôs just a power trip universities pull."
4852,"Haha! When I was in grad school tons of undergrads would program their phones to go off-- but  minutes *before* the bell.   I remember commenting ""You know, the building's bell goes off when the session *ends*. You really don't need an alarm to go off 2 minutes earlier?""

Students *could* leave whenever they wanted.  And besides that, the students for the next class would be massing in the hall waiting to enter. The *prof for the next class would be arriving*. That person wasn't going to be thrilled with being told to wait before they can start their class.

I don't remember a single professor taking attendance.  Few ever ran over (and they shouldn't.)  Heck, the prof for the next class generally expected the previous prof to erase the chalk board.  If you didn't finish, you'd have a colleague on your a\*\*, not just students!

If this a professor is trying to force you to stay, talk to the department head.  It's not unlikely you or other students have *another class to go to*.  That professor isn't going to start late to accommodate late arrivals."
4853,"I loved this, TBH. One of the few profs I had who took attendance didn't formally base grades on attendance. But at the end of the semester I had something like 89.7% and since I had attended class and done the 2 extra credit assignments, he gave me an A. 

A friend had skipped frequently, and never attempted the extra credit. He finished with a 79.9% and got a C. He was furious, he went to whine to the professor and prof just shrugged, ""you missed 40% of lectures and made no attempt to help yourself. You take the C you earned."" 

It felt really good, as someone who worked hard for that class."
4854,"The polite thing to do is to let him know in advance (an email is fine) that you've got obligations after his class that you need to get to, and you can't stay past the scheduled end of the class. THEN get up and leave if he goes over, but at least he has advance notice. Maybe not precisely at 6:45, but if he's still going at 6:48 (say) then just leave.

And yes, as a general ""life tip"", I will say that it is important that you be polite to this professor, even if he isn't showing courtesy to you or respecting your time. Be a good person, even when the other person isn't."
4855,‚ÄúHe has a PhD and the school loves him‚Äù‚Ä¶.. having a PhD in the world of academia is nothing special and absolutely not a reason why other academics with PhDs would give him special treatment.
4856,You have another class to get to and the other professors time is just as valuable as theirs
4857,"This is such underrated advice. I learned this from my mom and it works 80% of the time. You‚Äôd be surprised what people will go out of their way to do for you when you‚Äôre nice to them. Plus, if you do happen to be wrong you don‚Äôt look like a dumbass lol"
4858,Just make sure you leave at 6:46
4859,"After reading your update, just giving my $0.02 don't meet with this guy. It'll just validate the fact he thinks he can bully or intimidate you. You have nothing to ""smooth over"". You were doing the right thing emailing him to confirm and he responded passive aggressively 1. To be a jerk and make you second guess yourself, and 2. So he didn't have to admit to the fact he's been deliberately going over time every class. 

Meet with your academic advisor instead of him, and email/set a meeting with whoever is the head of his department."
4860,"This is one of my major pet peeves. If class ends at 6:45, then that‚Äôs the absolute LAST minute you should be kept in the room. I‚Äôve gone over a couple of times, but never more than a minute or two, and I know I‚Äôm the issue in that moment. It‚Äôs super disrespectful of others‚Äô time and obligations to consistently run over.

You‚Äôre within your rights to leave on time, and if he tries to penalize you for it, then it would be a good idea to contact the department chair."
4861,"The class ends at 6:45 pm, he knows theres no more classes after that."
4862,Please do provide an update!
4863,"True, I just dont want to have to go to the school to try and fight an absence he gives me for leaving when he wants us to stay after, because he has a PHD and the school loves him and i doubt they would believe anything i say about it over him. He‚Äôs an ass but every college has asshole professors."
4864,Well then time to pull up those pants and say that you have to get home because of blah blah blah
4865,"I had a professor who was very old and would drone on every class period online for 30 extra minutes. She would say ""just let me finish"" but her lectures were full of unnecessary bullshit and easily could have been ended 15 minutes early had she not done this. When I told her ""Professor, I'm a school teacher and I actually need to prep my lessons and we are 30 minutes over time now."" She got the hint for the first time ever. She continued doing it occasionally but so many people complained to the chair that she finally stopped."
4866,In life there will be many bosses like this. You have to set ground rules upfront
4867,"I had a professor who had a tendency to run over and he would just let students leave at the appropriate time if they had to go or wanted to leave. He actually appreciated it, it let him know he was going overtime and knew people would fight back if he wasn‚Äôt being fair."
4868,[deleted]
4869,I agree. Especially with huge time differences it can sometime get ridiculous with international students or even just east and west coast students. I have had to wake up early just so I can catch a student on the other side of the world at 10 pm.
4870,[deleted]
4871,I would've gone over the professors head. That's unreasonable beyond belief.
4872,"Preaacchhh. I worked 25 to 30 hours a week during undergrad, and it irked me to no end trying to find some compatible time for me and my group mates to work on a project. I was always free Friday or Saturday evening, but they always had something (parties) to do. One professor straight up told me to cut back my hours if I wanted to get my degree. I did have to reduce my hours my final year of undergrad to make classes work, but it financially drained me to pull it off. And yeah so true, gen-ed professors loveee to think every kid in their class is religiously devoted to them and their course subject. I definetly think colleges have the mentality that ""if you're a student, this should be your full time job"". I'd love to kick back and study hard-core for four years, but my dog's gotta eat."
4873,That's dean worthy. It's obvious the professor doesn't care
4874,"Oh sweetie. I'm not a traditional student. I have worked ""in the real world"" for 15 years. Group work is stupid and bothersome and sets an unrealistic expectation of how tasks are actually accomplished."
4875,I do not like it because in person classes you can kind of poke at/remind the people that haven‚Äôt done anything yet but online it‚Äôs a lot easier for those people to just ignore you and force you to do a lot of the work.
4876,"I'm 40, an army vet, with many years of experience out in the real world. College group projects are about as far from realistic as you can get, especially with online classes."
4877,Go above her head. Those other students are engaging in academic dishonesty and she is ENABLING that behavior.
4878,I have group virtual wetlabs. Wrap your head around that lmao
4879,"I really like professors that have students grade each other. It is obviously hard for some students to be honest (bc they know the other student will get a bad grade) but it makes it so less stressful if you know they can be honest. 

I'm also not the biggest fan of ""in the real world your 'grade' might be based on group work where people don't put in the effort."" So in the real world I get punished for something that isn't my fault, we should start doing it even earlier so I can get used to the disappointment???"
4880,"The reality is that in school most group requires real time collaboration. Especially on projects that really require constant input, producing even just mediocre work is not feasible. And in school project are not usually long term as they might be at work. They are small 2-7 day projects and communication is awful in such a small time frame."
4881,I wish it could be my full time job. Then maybe I wouldn't be 24 just now working on the credits that'll have me considered a junior.
4882,"Wow! Groundbreaking info there! But seriously i am not saying it isn‚Äôt possible just saying half the time I would actually produce a better project on my own because I can actually work on it rather than have to wait until I can get into contact with my group. Not to mention that the overlap is only true if its a group of two. Three or four becomes a mess. Also, you know at work people get paid to do this. They actually dedicate a certain amount of time in their days to their job. In school students have stuff going on and when you‚Äôre asking them to work at 10 pm oftentimes they rather just not do it. Nevertheless it is possible but requires dedication from both sides and even at a top college it isn‚Äôt always easy to get."
4883,My teacher this semester gave us a 7 person group project.... with a zoom live oral presentation
4884,[deleted]
4885,I HATE GROUP WORK ONLINE. I signed up for this one completely online class. Not a synchronous one. We had to schedule times to meet up with other people over zoom to write four of these mini 3 page papers. I had another class where we had to write a group paper and no one contributed anything and I wrote the whole thing myself.
4886,"Professor here. I don‚Äôt assign it. My colleagues are in love with group work and peer review, especially peer review. I find it of limited to no value, a hassle for students and for me, and a general waste of time. I‚Äôm bucking the expectations in my field (composition), but so be it. I tell students one great reason not to compare what we doing a class to the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù is that in the real world, you wouldn‚Äôt have four or five different bosses who aren‚Äôt aware of each other and don‚Äôt talk to one another about deadlines and who all hold you to different standards and overlapping due dates. Also, the real world often has more flexibility with deadlines, not less, depending on the expected product."
4887,"Best of luck dude. It took me 4 years, an extra fall semester, blood, sweat, and tears to get my bachelors. I wonder how different the last 4 and a half years of my life would've been if I could've just been a full time student like a normal college kid?"
4888,"100% agree. Lost a lot of opportunities and sleep because of it, but I *had* to work. Most kids without parent, spouse, or loan support have to work. I made it work, but just barely."
4889,"No. Maybe it is for those people, but I hate the ""college experience"" part of college. I think many older students would agree, I'm taking these classes to get the degree, all the ""socializing"" parts of college that are constantly thrust on students are exhausting."
4890,[deleted]
4891,"While I get where you're coming from, the professor is kind of right in a sense. Realistically a person cannot work more than 20 hours and take more than about 12 credit hours and not wear themselves thin to the point of tearing."
4892,"I like that compromise, and it's how one of my professors handled it last semester. I am not totally against group projects in college. It's just so dependant on who is in your group and how reasonable the professor is."
4893,"The only time they seem to work well is in computer science classes where the industry has proper tools in place for dealing with many people collaborating asynchronously on the exact same project. Many of those tools would work great for other classes, but try getting a nursing student or English major to use Git."
4894,"Having also worked a grown up job, you're being abused by your workplace. Your team should be helping you, your hours should be decent, and you should be compensated fairly. No one should be asking you to pull odd hours, if they need a certain block of time covered, it was a management failure that there was no one but you to do it. You are being failed by your company, and everyone should have higher expectations of their universities and workplaces."
4895,Everyone is talking about how lonely and isolated they are and how they miss the interaction of in-person school.  How is this not a semi-reasonable alternative?
4896,That sucks.
4897,"Optional group work for people like you, and then us who really fuckin' struggle with it don't get punished"
4898,This is why math is addicting to me. When you finally get it it‚Äôs like a huge dopamine hits.
4899,I literally need a tutor for both of those things right now too üòÇ
4900,[deleted]
4901,"I sometimes stay up late studying for math tests. The feeling that comes when I figure something out, after rereading the same few pages countless times and scribbling notes, is intense. I love it every time, and I go to sleep with a wide smile on my face. I‚Äôm sure many others can relate."
4902,"Organic chemistry tutor, man...where do I even start. He beats every single other educational/video resource out of the water. Nothing holds a candle to him imo. He explains the concepts so clearly and simply and then does so so many practice problems that you‚Äôre ready for every single type of problem for the class (something that resources like Khan Academy lack-not enough guided practice). His hour long videos are my replacement for subpar lectures."
4903,"Wait, people can actually understand stuff in college?"
4904,"Exactly what I'm feeling! Taking an Intro to Stat course, and was mindblown at how I understood interconnected equations that would explained why topics I'm confused about happens. Mind you, I already encountered a fair amount of stat in high school (I knew what I was doing back then but my brain just forgot those things), but to truly absorbing it, it just feels like a win. Congrats on your achievement! You've earned it! üòÑ"
4905,I‚Äôm retaking few classes in my final year. I hope its life changing
4906,"If Organic Chemistry Tutor was in danger and I had to sacrifice my life or protect him I would do so in a heartbeat. He got me through high school and is getting me through college too

Not exaggerating"
4907,That‚Äôs motivating. Math takes me a long time to grasp too but when I get it it‚Äôs so much fun. I love seeing a problem and immediately knowing what to do and solving it in like 2 minutes. Unfortunately 70% of the time problems takes me 20-40 minutes during homework.
4908,"Oh, wow thank you!!"
4909,"happened to me this morning... i was studying for a test and a whole chapter was hella interesting, and on top of that, it was relevant for the vague idea i have for my master's thesis.

made me much more enthusiastic about studying and optimistic about that one test."
4910,"Yes, I cannot recommend this man enough!!!"
4911,"yeah, the understanding that you must pass the semester rather than actually learn anything."
4912,Thanks I‚Äôve been struggling with calculus but I thought his content kind of ended at high school math. I‚Äôll definitely be revisiting his videos before my exam next week.
4913,"Not me. I get extremely anxious and uncomfortable when I don't understand something. If I can get an A through plugging things in, I won't feel accomplished. It's one of the reasons why I never cheat. Like one of my professors this semester gives quizzes that are open note, *with* her old quizzes and answers online, and the questions are all basically the same or reused. I still studied for that or tried to understand the concepts because I just feel very uneasy when I don't really understand."
4914,"I‚Äôm a sophomore and also hope it‚Äôs life changing, best of luck to you"
4915,"An achievement that doesn‚Äôt gather much motivation I guess I should disclaim lol.  I generally understand the material in my calc class, but still need time to actually think about it.  So, having only 55 mins to take exams is still kicking my ass to the moon -_-"
4916,"Yeah, agreed. I find that with math as well as physics - really anything with calculations, especially when they get complicated - practicing the ""flow"" of the solution goes a long way. You've probably been told this many times by your teacher/professor/parent, and they say it for a reason: it really does work. I hope this helps üëç"
4917,"""to the point where you don‚Äôt even feel like you‚Äôd need to study for it""  
You got it right, but don't fall for it! just don't fall for it lol... continue to review before bed or whenever u like."
4918,I feel like this in my math class. Math is finally making sense for the first time in my life.
4919,"If you're looking for a replacement for subpar calc lectures, you'll want to check out MIT's open courseware version of 18.01 Single Variable Calculus which is taught by an actual mathematics professor vs. sloppy grad student. Literally saved my calc grade."
4920,"He goes very advanced, up to some major specific classes as well which is crazy, like Statics for instance..."
4921,"No man! He does calc, physics, obv organic chem as wellüòÇ he may go up to calc 3 I think."
4922,"Learning IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and how to AND for calculate networking stuff.  when we started learning I was struggling and having a hard time, so I went to the library with my laptop and textbook and spent the whole day studying and making notes and practicing and by the end of the day I had that *click* moment and I was able to *understand* what I was doing! I'm a technical support specialist and I always remember that moment, when I get stuck or and hours into a troubleshooting process."
4923,Oh don‚Äôt worry.. I‚Äôm definitely never letting my guard down because that‚Äôs exactly how it goes... I understand it now so that it can become 5x more difficult later lmao
4924,Exactly! Like you're a failure at your class and not getting what you pay for. I feel you...
4925,"I originally wanted to be a vet so my undergrad was aiming for animal science when I transferred to a better school, but then I hit organic chemistry. Fuck that class! I got panicked about how I was going to handle vet school, but then I found the wildlife major at the better college I was going to transfer to.

AMAZING. I'm so glad I found it! I actually understand what's going on, how it applies to my future career goals, and there are so many more job choices I don't even know what to do with myself. I get it and I'm so happy! :)"
4926,I feel you. I came to that conclusion over the summer ‚òπ It feels like I learn to pass the class instead of learning to gain knowledge.
4927,What‚Äôs the point of college if you don‚Äôt understand stuff?
4928,Life sciences is healthcare basically (not sure why they didn‚Äôt include this)
4929,[deleted]
4930,what exactly counts as a job opening in a particular field? don't buy this
4931,"The data here is pretty skewed and missing info. Ive been looking into getting an aerospace engineering degree and from what I‚Äôve seen, people who get engineering degrees generally go from intern to employee in the same company or hired directly, so job openings don‚Äôt really get posted."
4932,This looks like a graph that‚Äôs made buy someone against the value of a college degree. Aka Doesn‚Äôt make a whole of sense
4933,"engineering fields are definitely oversaturated, just not to the degree shown here. Whatever your area of study is im sure is at least as important to society as engineers, if not more so"
4934,I've had better luck hiring mathematicians and engineers to do CS jobs than CS grads.
4935,[deleted]
4936,"Yeah, this infographic both excludes lots of jobs directly related to each of these fields and ignores the fact that different types of degrees can lead to the same jobs. I have no idea if/where they include sales and business jobs, they probably account for most of the apparent engineering job deficit."
4937,"Yep, thats why STEM degrees are glorified and pay well. Teachers, social workers, health care etc have a much more important impact on society overall (imo) but aren't compensated as much because those industries dont have money shoved down their throats like the military industrial complex does."
4938,"i mean that makes these numbers pretty obvious to me and also a little misleading. how many of those graduates intended to work ""in their field of study""? betting a lot of those maths grads are going into data science etc."
4939,It‚Äôs less about whether your job is important to society and more about whether it‚Äôs useful to the military.
4940,This chart screams confirmation bias BS
4941,Super misleading data. You won‚Äôt find many people who study math/physics and do not go to grad school.
4942,Because a lot of life science bachelors are used as stepping stone.
4943,Ok so that‚Äôs what 30k at least? Pauly double the pink bar
4944,"A lot of physical sciences end up in CS or mathematical jobs. They don't include that kind of crossing either.

I think they just want to show degrees awarded vs jobs in that exact field. They're not trying to show employability statistics. Those already exist elsewhere. It's not like the majority of people in math are expecting to get a math job."
4945,This is why I‚Äôm double majoring in mathematics and computer science lol. The code classes teach you the basic ideas and practices but the actual problem solving is learned in math.
4946,Conspiracy theory: cs companies paid nytimes to publish this to oversaturate the market with cs majors to further undercut salaries
4947,[deleted]
4948,"Well yeah ... the only first hand experience I have is ... my own. I have a bunch of second hand experience talking to colleagues as well as people that hire for other companies (common consensus seems to be that while the talent pool of CS Grads is large, finding competent candidates is really difficult). All of that is also ... anecdotal."
4949,"Most engineers have very different job titles from their degree name and often in fields that they were prepared for by school but not ""in their field"". (Eg I majored in mechanical engineering but now work as a material scientist.) Many others get placed in roles like ""product manager"" or ""technical process owner"" that are engineering jobs but aren't counted as such because they're in service of a business need. This graph is very sus."
4950,[deleted]
4951,"aye exactly this, this is just a graph that says ""there aren't many pure maths jobs"" like fuckin duh"
4952,[deleted]
4953,Yup. That's how it works at my company
4954, anecdote
4955,i have a double major in computer science and applied math and still can‚Äôt get a job in the CS field üòé
4956,Okay fellas pack it up. He called this. There's nothing we can do now
4957,[deleted]
4958,Congratulations! I hope that‚Äôs me too in 2022 lol.
4959,"Nah man. C‚Äôs almost failed me out. Working my ass off after almost failing sophomore year and earning A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs for the first time starting junior year got me my degree.

My degree was in Computer Science.

Copied response from other comment."
4960,"My company won‚Äôt hire anything below a 3.2 or so and 3.5 is preferred. Personally if I‚Äôm hiring I care more about your internships and your thought process than a good gpa. At the same time if your gpa is below a 2.8 I‚Äôm gonna really wonder if you have the work ethic to be a good employee. 

This is for engineering and my own personal opinion."
4961,Thank you
4962,">2.85 GPA

C's get degrees,Amirite? Congratulations, my guy :)"
4963,Congratulations! I'll be graduating from a Community College on May 27th. I'm very nervous.
4964,"what is considered a 'good' gpa? im 1 semester away from being done and my gpa is like 2.899 , like right below 2.9 is that good or bad? idk. will employers ask it and then not hire me because it isnt 3.0?"
4965,"Nah man. C‚Äôs almost failed me out. Working my ass off after almost failing sophomore year and earning A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs for the first time starting junior year got me my degree. 

My degree was in Computer Science."
4966,[deleted]
4967,"General rule of thumb is to leave your GPA off your resume unless it‚Äôs 3.0 or above. Most employers won‚Äôt care, but leaving off your GPA may make them forget about it altogether.

For the most part, GPA only matters if you wanna do grad school."
4968,Congratulations  and I wish you well
4969,True but not everyone wants to go to grad school. But always good to have as a backup or possibility
4970,"Hey man it‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôm happy to explain. I was an awful student freshman and sophomore year. I didn‚Äôt do my work, I skipped class, and I didn‚Äôt participate in classes I went to. By the end of sophomore year, I was a mere 0.005 points away from failing out of school. I had a breakdown and realized, I didn‚Äôt want to fail, that I wanted to achieve this. So I started seeing a therapist, started taking medication, and started doing my work. It took a lot, but my professors noticed the improvement. I finally made some A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs, discovered my passion for using Linux (and earning my spot among my classmates as the go to for Linux), and was able to get an internship with a graduate professor in Iceland, who saw the improvements in my transcript. 

I may not have been the best student then, but I became a better person. I learned from my mistakes and I grew from them."
4971,I flunked out of CS my first year and switched to Family & Consumer Science. Good job surviving that program :)
4972,"Try to keep it as high as possible, you might want to go to grad school in the future and under a 3.0 won't cut it."
4973,">For the most part, GPA only matters if you wanna do grad school.

That's what I thought, but the try-hards on here are like ""YOU'RE F\*\*KED IF YOUR GPA IS ANYTHING BESIDES 3.9999999 WHY EVEN EXIST?"""
4974,Congrats! Cs get degrees haha. What was the degree?
4975,"This seems crazy to me as someone going to college full time, working full time 2 hours north and keeping up with a family. I have a 2.77 at this time, have a good reputation at work for being able to absorb and deal with any task asked of me. Never miss. But all a company might see is that I have a questionable work ethic."
4976,Good luck! And early congrats!
4977,"In due time. My degree was in computer science. I‚Äôm taking a gap year to earn field experience and I‚Äôll be able to find my passion then. If I decide to teach or research, then I‚Äôll go for a PhD. Other than that, I‚Äôll try for a Masters."
4978,Let‚Äôs not gpa shame now.
4979,I hope so too.
4980,"Oh for sure, CS is so competitive that you need A and Bs, I‚Äôm looking to change my major to CS, still unsure tho. Good on you to maintain higher grades in upper div classes!"
4981,I feel like CS and engineering are like sibling majors lol
4982,Congratulations!
4983,It‚Äôs also good to have field experience of your GPA or transcript aren‚Äôt the best. Hence why I‚Äôm taking a gap year.
4984,"Not if you want to get accepted to a good grad school. 

For every C you get it needs to be offset by an A to balance your GPA."
4985,"2.66 is B-, 3.0 is B, 3.33 is B+"
4986,well if u list that u also work on ur resume then they might take that into consideration right? idk how you an communicate the 2 hour distance and other things tho.
4987,Good job dude! College is a long and hard-fought battle to succeed and pass through.
4988,My school isn't going to see a cent from me after I graduate. If I manage to come into some money I'll donate to organizations that help underprivileged students pay for school. But the university it's self can suck it.
4989,"Trust me, they call the alumni list if you donated or not. If you really want them to stop calling just clearly ask to be removed from the call list for all future semesters and to speak to a supervisor to confirm you were taken off the list for future calling and not just for semester calling. 9/10 the people calling you is a student with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and we've been trained to ask for tiered donations after chatting up the alumni for a while."
4990,I keep thinking of the John Mulaney bit- ‚ÄúYOU SPENT IT ALREADY?‚Äù
4991,I remember my college doing something like that and I just deleted the email. It's in poor taste.
4992,"It is fairly common, but normally the amount is fairly low. The idea is to build a habit of donation that continues after you've become an alum.

At many schools the cost of full tuition doesn't cover the actual cost of each student. At my school people paid about 60K a year, but the total cost was more like 100K. So even people who paid full ticket were getting some benefit from the college."
4993,"Admission for their child.

( :P )"
4994,I GAVE YOU MORE MONEY THAN THE CIVIL WAR COSTS AND YOU FUCKIN SPENT IT ALREADY?
4995,"I‚Äôve never looked into it but I can‚Äôt imagine that‚Äôs the case at my school. I wonder how much it matters if you live on campus or not. 

In my time I hardly used campus resources (for better or for worse). Genuinely the only thing the school needed to supply was the classroom, the professor (which I pay tuition for), and lab materials (which I also had extra fees for).

I don‚Äôt want to sound rude but schools don‚Äôt get to be the way they are by losing money on each student"
4996,"Your friend learned a lesson that day.  If you offer free stuff to college students they will come, take the free stuff, and leave your event immediately.  I had a similar experience involving pie rather than wine - a swarm of people came, ate all the pie and left."
4997,"Thank you for being a mod that doesn‚Äôt pin every single one of their comments.
Good mod"
4998,LOL ‚Äúsenior gift‚Äù expected from someone who had to pay to graduate
4999,My private high school did this after dishing out $100k+ for four years. They thought we should give every year as alumni bc they ‚Äòhave us the foundation to succeed‚Äô lmao nah I‚Äôm good
5000,"The only place I‚Äôd donate to for my school is the athletic department (I go to a small D2 school so this isn‚Äôt a big department) as I have been a part of the XC team from its resurrection in 2017 and have had a job as a student worker in the department. 

So i would be contributing to the XC program mostly but would give some to the general AD fund."
5001,What would you need from your school that would cause you to donate?
5002,WHAT KINDA COKEHEAD RELATIVE-
5003,"After I graduated, I got a letter asking alumni for money before they actually got my diploma mailed to me.

Like, you just ate up 4 years of my life, sucked out my soul, and charged me thousands of dollars for it, and now you want me to ""gift"" you more money???

Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me."
5004,I remember at my high school graduation practice they made us show up at 8 am on a Saturday where they gave us an hour talk about the alumni association and passed out blank checks where we could make donations. Many people straight up laughed at them. After that was done we ran through a 30 minute practice and went home.
5005,Isn't that just tuition with extra steps?
5006,[deleted]
5007,"For admission? Its bribery, actually. Though depending on how you deliver the bribe it can be legal.

After admission? Then yeah its tution."
5008,"I feel like this is more of an argument for schools to stop spending money on stupid shit.

""Oh no, we're broke because all your tuition money went to a bowling alley and hiring Imagine Dragons to play music at homecoming! Please give us a $400 gift""

Maybe universities should tighten their belt a little and have an emergency fund."
5009,"Can confirm. I currently do this as a job, and if you don‚Äôt explicitly ask to be removed from the calling list, you will be called again in one week."
5010,"Our senior gift went to the student emergency fund for COVID. I didn't donate anything but they sent me a ""thank you for donating (X amount)"" email so that shows how much my class officers actually know anything about me. Instead of asking us to donate to the student supply closet and emergency fund all the time my school could lower tuition, but instead they beg us for money. I don't trust how my school uses money, there's been financial issues in past years, so if I want to help my friends I'll buy them food directly."
5011,[removed]
5012,"I work in a call center asking alums to donate so I am pretty familiar with the senior gift and it's commonly the last amount of money people give to their school. I've been one of the top complainers about cost of tuition at my school, (and my scholarship package is ridiculously good in comparison to others)  but working in the call center and seeing how difficult it can be to convince the few alumni who do donate to and  the fact that my school used all of its funds and endowment on an emergency fund for students after campus was closed showed me how much we overestimate what these schools bring in. Yes, the cost of college in this country is ridiculous, but many private schools offer crazy good financial aid packages to students which can drive up the sticker price. We also end up utilizing more school provided resources over the years than we realize. I was a commuter at my college but I still  have access to every free Microsoft, streaming, Google suite, ect platform they give us and at least for my school we'll be able to continue to utilize all of those services after we graduate until we die.  Just because we don't always see or choose to utilize the services our college offers us doesn't mean they're not still dropping money on it. it depends on the school overall, but it can help to be a little more understanding and truly look into what your college is providing you to better understand the cost associated. Also don't forget the scholarship kids! Even if you don't want to utilize the offered services the money still helps with financial aid and I know at least for my college over half of the students would be unable to attend without the generous support of the few alumni who do give back. (Also you can write off whatever you give on your taxes if you decided to take that route)"
5013,They deadass gave us ugly $5 t-shirts if we signed up to pay like $5 a month for 5 years but I know they said most alumni are still doing it like 30+ years later ????
5014,They also don't have to distinguish the comment. But baby steps I guess.
5015,"It likely does vary school to school. This was a well-endowed Ivy, so that extra money generally comes from the draw on the endowment. At a school with a smaller endowment obviously that number would have to be much smaller.

My school also had a lot of people on financial aid, many on full rides, and generally senior class gifts are targeted for scholarship for the class that is about to start in the fall."
5016,"The Alumni Association is a union for graduates. You don't have a choice about joining and they won't use their resources to promote or support enrolled students. Their only jobs are gluing their name to successes, distancing the school from unpopular graduates, and fundraising for themselves.

Edit: What I meant to say was support your alma mater."
5017,"I will certainly donate when I have the means, given that I got a full ride from them. Otherwise I probably would not unless I wanted my name somewhere."
5018,Wtaf. Ur a machine! I got this one C+ and it dropped my grade to 3.8 sadge moment
5019,"Always take
Your time , always do extra credit ( you never know when you‚Äôll need the points ) , at the end of the semester always look back and evaluate if you still wanna continue studying what you‚Äôre studying :-)"
5020,30-35!
5021,That's very impressive.
5022,3.8 is fucking awesome. Be proud of that!
5023,Actually. It's better to have a near 4.0 GPA than an exact for 4.0 GPA. I know multiple recruiters that have mentioned that they don't want to hire someone with an exact 4.0 GPA because they are not sure how well they deal with failures or setbacks.
5024,How many hours do you work at your job and at your internship?
5025,Congratulations üéâ
5026,"Congratulations!!! If possible can you share your tips? I‚Äôll be a freshman this fall !

Edit: Thank you for the responses <3"
5027,"This helps me feel better about my 3.8 GPA, thank you."
5028,"Reevaluating what you're studying is great advice! After my first semester at college I realized I didn't really care about my major, but I was too scared to admit that I didn't have my life figured out at 18. Now I'm almost done with my sophomore year and super behind in my major because I just changed it. The earlier you can change majors the better!"
5029,Congrats. What did you major in? What do you want to do as a career? Do you plan on going to grad school?
5030,Also never miss an assignment. One missed assignment can kill a 4.0 very fast.
5031,Thank you!!!
5032,Thank you!
5033,3.8 is pretty good. That's supposed to equate to 95% which is a solid A. You are an A student
5034,Psychology! And I‚Äôm currently debating on it !
5035,Ayyyyy!! Congratulations üéâüéâ Keep up the good work!
5036,"In the same boat. One class got a C in and dropped me to a 3.8... And it was some of the biggest bs too, but whatever. I'm good with graduating with a 3.8, got one final semester with a small load to finish. Its funny because I was a 2.1 gpa high school student."
5037,"I don‚Äôt know much about the career paths for psychology, but what I‚Äôve been told is that a BA or BS alone is unfortunately very competitive."
5038,Ah. So me graduating with my 3.4 and finding workarounds to graduating with my major is what they want.
5039,"I can totally relate to you. Doesn't matter how many times you change your major, just try to do it in your earlier years! That way, you don't waste time and your money"
5040,Congratulations!!!
5041,U done good OP
5042,"Yes..... I've ""learned"" this too many times. I write this as I procrastinate doing assignments due yesterday."
5043,"This is awesome, OP! I love it. Congrats to you on this amazing accomplishment! Giving me something to strive for (just ended first semester of undergrad with a 3.5)."
5044,"Lol, then there‚Äôs me that checks out at some point every semester to run around, smoke weed, and travel"
5045,Wow! Incredible! Never forget to maintain the same effort after graduation.
5046,Thank you!
5047,Nah :)
5048,honestly i thought i was a pretty average student which is why this was so insane to me. this was my first ever philosophy class and i ended up really liking it so i always did the homework and the readings. this def helped a lot because i was able to refer back to past readings and philosophers in class discussions. every now and then i'd ask a question after class or send him an email. just being an active participant üëç
5049,Yup this is the professor you want to write a reference or LOR if you applied to like medical school which allows a non science professor letter.
5050,What did you do that got them to write such an amazing recommendation letter about you to the chair ?
5051,I‚Äôm out of college and regret not speaking up in class. I would‚Äôve learned more but I was scared to speak up :/
5052,"Whenever I get nice emails or feedback on homework, I save them in a folder to read when I hit slumps or burnout. They‚Äôre the greatest thing, always remember them!!"
5053,"im sorry you missed out. i was the same way all through high school and that made the whole experience suck. im still scared whenever i speak out now but i've found that professors are usually just happy if you make an honest attempt at answering/adding something to the conversation.

it's def something im working on and i hope that despite being out of college you're able to speak up when you want to"
5054,These emails and little messages I get from my profs are the only thing keeping me going with this degree lmao. All the dopamine and endorphins when you get praised for what you thought was just average work (or getting congratulated on stuff you worked really hard on)
5055,[ur reply made me seek this out from the beginning of the semester. takes a lot of work to talk in class](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q17ywb/participation_in_class/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
5056,that's such a good idea !! im gonna start a folder hopefully i get to fill it out more ü§û
5057,Bruh what
5058,this wasn't even a brag. ur just weird
5059,"Hell yeah, great job! Keep it up."
5060,"Y‚Ä¶you‚Ä¶ actually read the litterateur? 
Cries in teacher."
5061,That's pretty insane. Keep up whatever the hard work.
5062,hell yea! good job!!
5063,amazing! well done!!  so proud!! ü§çü§ç
5064,Yeah nice idea.
5065,I'm taking my first ever philosophy class (a gen ed ofc) next quarter. Very much looking forward to it (even though it's 2 hours long)
5066,"Stay in touch a time or two each semester, you never know when a nice LOR may be helpful in the future."
5067,I think my professors email about how disappointed they are.
5068,"I was scared it was something bad from the title, but this is awesome! love it"
5069,Wow! That is really impressive! Congratulations!
5070,Congratulations!

5082,"Hijacking top comment because this is a safety tip.  My university's most recent alcohol education tells us that if someone has passed out from alcohol and cannot be awoken or is super out of it, you go into checking if they have alcohol poisoning mode.  If they dont have alcohol poisoning, you stay with them incase they start to get alcohol poisoning and make sure they are breathing and not showing symptoms of worsening.  It is important they are on their side but you STAY WITH THEM, even if you are really tired.  If they do start to show symptoms, call 911, check your town's amnesty laws.


They key takeaway is: if they're passed out from alcohol and you have difficulty awakening them, the situation becomes much different than if they're going to sleep."
5083,"I‚Äôm surprised their letting freshmen move in with the pandemic, but I guess the college needs money lol. I added some tips below for anyone that cares. 

Most major universities (i think) will have you take a drinking/sexual assault seminar. If you plan on partying with friends, You should give the keys to a designated non-drinking driver so that nobody has to worry about who is/isnt drunk when it‚Äôs time to go home.

I personally put my flat screen tv on my desk and I enjoyed it ALOT. I don‚Äôt have cable at home, because my family didn‚Äôt really use it when we had it. However, it was kind of cool watching tv til like 3am.

DONT BE AFRAID TO MOVE! If you dont like your roommate(s) then MOVE! There is no need for you to be miserable. I moved twice my freshman year. 

Use free resources! My college realized that nobody was showing up to events so they started to offer free food like Pizza, Caprisun, Soda, and a gift card raffle to those who attended. Free shit is Free! 

Lastly (and this is VERY biased), but fuck the bookstore. All those books and items are OVERPRICED! You can save a ton by using Chegg or by simply using other websites to download textbooks for free. Nothing is more embarrassing than a professor saying ‚ÄúYou dont need the access code, a used/rented book will work just fine.‚Äù and some student replies, ‚Äúwait...what???  I spent $300 on this book and I can‚Äôt return it because I opened it.‚Äù 

On a final note. Most of y‚Äôall are paying $10k+ to get a degree, not to party. 

TL:DR : You can bring a tv, if your college offers cable. Attend events that offer food and prizes. Drunk Driving and rape is illegal. Save money by using Chegg/Amazon."
5084,"Agree with all of this. Bring earplugs though my freshman year the people above me were very... passionate, sometimes until 3am"
5085,">On #10, you can put a backpack on your drunk friend which pretty much forces them to sleep on their side.

As a don for 3 years, I cannot believe I've gone this long without that snippet of advice... thats so fricken smart"
5086,If you‚Äôre living in a dorm or with a new set of roommates: bring ear plugs. You never know how thick walls will be and how loud others will be. It‚Äôs better to have them and not need them then need them and not have them.
5087,"I think I disagree with the whole ""you know what you use"" bit. This is a time in which your environment drastically changes and most people change a lot with it."
5088,I drank a lot in college too.
5089,The fact they don‚Äôt drink water almost discredits the whole lskt
5090,Yes! I did mine once a week
5091,I disagree with the printer to an extent. Some professors may require you to scan work in/ do the work on specific sheets. I had a professor who required us to turn in the test and I didn‚Äôt have any way to do the work but pencil and paper
5092,I brought two water bottles and filled it up before every class. I drink a lot lol.
5093,"Its also a time to put in the effort to make changes and improve yourself, such as drinking more water!"
5094,Don‚Äôt touch your eyes and wash your pillow cases frequently! I got pink eye 3 times my first semester freshman year
5095,"Hijacking again because this is a safety tip.

Backpacking is only helpful if you stay with them consistently because they can still puke and it can get caught in their throat, even of they're on their side."
5096,"Also mini advice, Im an RA and have been so for 4 semesters now, know your RA and make friends with them, it really comes in clutch! This way, you'll have a chance of knowing ahead of time about possible room checks, info about on campus employment, ResLife employment, and hopefully if your RA is chill, alcohol and/partying wont be joined with the stress of being caught :)"
5097,Having cold water with you at all times will help you stay awake in class! It‚Äôs helpful to have it in arms reach whether you‚Äôre on the computer or in an actual classroom.
5098,"I will say re: moving rooms that my school at least isn't letting us move for the duration of the fall, so definitely check on that

granted, I would still think there'd be a resource to complain about roommates"
5099,[deleted]
5100,"1. Treat your mental health seriously
2. Have fun"
5101,"That‚Äôs fair, I used an iPad for scanning/writing on sheets. All circumstantial!"
5102,Totally second the meds and clothes points!
5103,"Adding that if you‚Äôre moving to a place with a completely different climate than where you are from, make sure to ask people who come from similar places what kind of clothing or shoes you need. I moved from a warm climate to a very cold one and I wasn‚Äôt as used to the cold as the in-state students. Asking in-state students what winter coat to buy is not the move because they didn‚Äôt suggest things that were big/warm enough as what I ended up needing."
5104,Same!
5105,My RA was a stress baker so whenever exams popped up she had brownies to hand out!
5106,[deleted]
5107,"I dress like this and no one cares. HOWEVER, college campuses are nasty. You will probably get them dirty even if you are ridiculously clean. You have nowhere to hang nice coats or jackets so you have to shove them at your feet or hang them over your lap, and they hardly fit in the tight lecture chairs if you try to wear them through class. 

So it‚Äôs not too dramatic, but colleges just aren‚Äôt designed for stuff like this anymore. I just wouldn‚Äôt wear anything too expensive."
5108,If you have the energy to maintain this level of classy go for it. I started my college career trying to look cute everyday. I gave up in my sophomore year and embraced the sweatshirt and comfy pants look. I found sleep and classes were more important than the time it took to look good.
5109,I‚Äôm in sweats and a hoodie damn near every day. I just like to be comfy in class. But yeah it doesn‚Äôt really matter what you wear. Only time I care is if someone has on a nice outfit and it catches my eye
5110,"No, no, the baguette is important for sustenance during hackathons."
5111,99% of students are in sweats and hoodies.
5112,I didn‚Äôt think of that! You might be right. I‚Äôll try adding more practical stuff to the mix! Thanks.
5113,"lmao I feel ya. I‚Äôll try to for as long as i can ig‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really like going to public situations or school dressed too casual honestly. I loved my middle school uniform of skirt, tie, belt, mary jane shoes and everything. Highschool was too laid back and I didn‚Äôt like the whole pajamas vibe. I hope I can continue dressing well through the stress of college tho lol."
5114,More Info: I‚Äôll be attending college in the New England region. I really love this style but am not sure if this is too over-the-top. Does anyone dress like this? I‚Äôm an international student and really don‚Äôt wanna look like a clown. (Also CS major so I kindda expect being surrounded by sweatpants+hoodie type of people but how‚Äôs the situation overall?)
5115,Cool thing about college is that people really don‚Äôt care what you dress like. Some people get really nicely dressed and others show up in pajamas and everything in between. Nobody is judging each other at all
5116,"Yes, it's over the top. But you need to dress for you, not for others. That means if your doing this to impress others. Stop.

If you are doing this because this is what you like, then fine."
5117,"As a CS major in New England, yes you will be surrounded by sweatpants+hoodie people. But no one will really care about what you wear, so don't worry about this at all.

I've recently started dressing more nicely and I've gotten a few comments, but mostly compliments or remarks about how my style has changed."
5118,I‚Äôve dressed up like this all throughout college so you‚Äôre good. Feeling ‚Äúput together‚Äù helps me focus if that makes any sense. Plus I really enjoy dressing up so it doesn‚Äôt take much energy at all for me!
5119,Then you get to be known as Baguette Girl on campus.
5120,"Don‚Äôt mind me, just joining the other replies to this comment in responding to an obvious hyperbole by taking it literally."
5121,"Of course!! The coat issue particularly bothers me lol. I love my dark academia vibe, but I look crazy with my huge checkered coat sat like a blanket."
5122,"I‚Äôm not doing it to impress anyone. I like dressing up, I enjoy wearing ironed shirts over hoodies. It gets me in the whole ‚Äòyou‚Äôre not chilling and are here to work/study‚Äô mood."
5123,"Then do it. To me these are strong, powerful outfits, that does show you are here to kick some ass. Be bold and fierce.

Do you."
5124,And many of those in sweats showed up freshman year thinking they'd dress like OP's pictures all the time. You just get too tired and lazy to make the effort.
5125,"Completely fine, but understand if you end up dorming:

1. The dorm laundry machines are absolutely disgusting and WILL mess up your nice clothes

2. You‚Äôre likely not going to have a closet or a big one at best, so you‚Äôll have to bring stuff that folds/ find a way ti put all of it

3. You WILL be tired one day, enough to not have time to put all that on. (I dress too) Have some backup beater clothing. 

4. Do NOT trust your surroundings, it‚Äôs 10x more disgusting than you might think."
5126,more like 50%
5127,"Wait, y‚Äôall don‚Äôt always attend lectures in your pajamas?"
5128,"I mean if people wanna wear pajamas or dress casually, I don‚Äôt assume they don‚Äôt value their education. Everyone should wear whatever it is that they‚Äôre able to focus best in without having to worry about judgment from others"
5129,There's always some person who dresses really strangely who is famous on campus.
5130,"I go to a liberal arts college, I can 10/10 say the people who show up in my classes (STEM) have a variety of outfits, ranging from grunge to casual to OP's style. I also work in the library, so I come into contact with people very often. So no, not 99%.

In case you didn't know, 99% means only 1 person out of 100 people is *not* wearing a hoodie and sweats. That's ridiculous lmao. It's much closer to 50/50."
5131,That‚Äôs honestly a good question. They probably are more willing to keep them at their feet or shoved under chairs because they‚Äôre not as nice and don‚Äôt mind them getting dirty. Not sure though.
5132,def not 99%
5133,"I live in a state where winter is harsh and sometimes unexpected. Colleges are still designed like this. üòí you have to get creative, claim 2 seats so your coat gets one, or stuff it on the floor and hope there not a melted snow puddle there. It sucks."
5134,"I go to a liberal arts college, I can 10/10 say the people who show up in my classes (fine arts) are almost always in sweats/casual comfy clothes‚Ä¶business students are typically the only people on campus that wear suits and formal wear. So yeah, about 99%."
5135,"People say no one cares what you wear. That's bs. How you dress leaves an impression and changes how people address and approach you. 

I still remember the first time I wore a suit and how it felt like I was a different person because everyone treated me with more attention and respect. 

Some people are consciously aware of their biases based on looks, others are not. Either way, the bias still exists. 

I say wear whatever you want but be aware that it changes how people see you. If you're up for dressing like this daily, I say more power to ya."
5136,tbf whenever I see people dressed up on campus I either assume they are a business major or that they are going to work/internship/job fair. So while you might stick out a bit most people either won't care or will just assume you have somewhere to be.
5137,The skills to be able to conjure up the other 90% with a quick google search. It's all about knowing what questions to ask.
5138,Thank you quizlet for this degree
5139,[deleted]
5140,"I'm sure there are geniuses out there that are able to learn and apply mass amounts of information, but imma be straight with you. You only sit in these classes to get that piece of paper that let's you apply for experience to get a job. The vast majority of what you're taught in school you won't use in whatever job you end up in. You might actually be surprised when you do end up gainfully employed that you learned more than you thought though."
5141,[deleted]
5142,You can‚Äôt generalize that with every major and field of work. I hope a doctor or engineer has actual knowledge in their field before getting hired.
5143,"Yeah that's normal. You're not actually going to remember everything. But you are learning and you are understanding, and because you've remembered it before and understood it before, then you'll be able to pick it up more easily in the future. For example, I have to use calc 1/2 knowledge in a lot of classes. I haven't taken calculus since high school, 2 years ago, but it didn't take my long to remember most of the rules and methods. It didn't have to be ""retaught"" to me because I picked it up again easily. And a ton of this stuff you won't need to apply in real life, but if you ever need to, you can easily relearn it. That's the point. 


It's important that you understand and not memorize, and this is especially important for majors that require little memorization and more problem solving and understanding (engineering, math/physics, some sciences, computer science). If you try to memorize your way through the class and the major you'll end up performing extremely poorly in the future.


I personally feel very uncomfortable with just memorizing content; if I panic on an exam I only have my memory and my hours of studying to fall back on, and if I forget somehow then it's over. I need to have an understanding of things to feel prepared. That's probably a good habit to get into: forcing yourself to understand concepts.


For example, take a mathematical formula. Try to understand why exactly it makes sense, or why you're performing a specific computation, rather than spitting out the formula. For Chemistry, try to understanding why molecules interact, how the electrons and polarity will favor certain reactions over others. When you are about to learn something new, try to predict what will happen based on what you already know."
5144,"I kind of disagree with most of the answers here. If you‚Äôre not learning, then seriously try to learn instead of just memorizing. Spend time with the material. Do more research, approach it from different angles. Learning takes actual effort. If you want to LEARN as opposed to MEMORIZE, really dive into things and attempt to master it. Watch youtube videos, spend your free time reading a book on the subject. College was supposed to be about developing your intellect, not getting a job. In the job market there are NO guarantees- treat college as its own experience that requires its own mindset. If you genuinely want to come out in four years as someone who has a genuine understanding of your subject, it‚Äôs going to take more than making A‚Äôs on quizzes. Which is a good thing by the way! There‚Äôs nothing wrong with putting effort into something y‚Äôknow?"
5145,"But you sorta can? Both of those fields, mine included, you specialize. An orthopedic surgeon has some knowledge of how your heart works because he studied it in school, but a cardiologist is going to know far more because he works with it every day. You learn what you really need to know when you get a job."
5146,"If I‚Äôm a cop, there would be a huge difference in me retaining:

10% remember: ‚ÄúArrest people for violating the law‚Äù

OR

10% remember: ‚ÄúUtilize my understanding of sociology to analyze -> consider options -> use discretion that productively helps the individual/community‚Äù

(Ex. from cop I rode along with‚Äî 19 yr. old poor man steals bread. Instead of immediately arresting as he was taught in class/academy he **could**, he also thinks about what he learned w/ discretion+sociology, so he talks to shop owner. 

Owner agrees to allow cop to connect the man with department‚Äôs resources, they connect guy with shelter and that org helps him with jobs. never have an issue out of him again. 

better outcome than arrest -> give a permanent criminal record -> poor guy keeps stealing -> gives up on finding a job because of record, etc). 

Not a perfect example, but moreso to touch on how there is an important ‚Äú10%‚Äù to retain and how consequences of treating it as disposable information ‚Äúlearned in class‚Äù may not be good. There also isn‚Äôt time to google in this situation and gain a full understanding of my options as an officer in 5 minutes."

5151,Yeah this is very dependent on your major I can tell you for a fact that if you don‚Äôt learn anything as a CS major you won‚Äôt even make it past the phone interview.
5152,I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt learn with experience in those fields. But you essentially said that the stuff you learn in school is essentially worthless as ‚Äújust a piece of paper‚Äù. I would be very surprised if you are some sort of doctor or surgeon and you don‚Äôt know a thing about biology.

5154,"i think the point of getting your degree in the area that you are isn't only learning how to memorize. what sets university apart from high school is that it (or at least my university) teaches you how to think critically within your field. sure, memorization is important, but i think not having an outer purpose to tie to your classes and the things you're learning can make college feel the way you described.

tbh that's how i felt in my classes in my first semester, and i changed majors to something that would specifically push me in the direction of something truly fulfilling. maybe thinking about what you really enjoy in your field, or what you're passionate about and actively taking time to make those connections to what you're currently learning could help?

i'm sorry if this doesn't help. it's a hard situation to be in, and i'm wishing you all the luck in the world"
5155,"Your last paragraph is spot on. Learning WHY is so much more important than learning a long list of facts.  It‚Äôs hard to get to the point of truly learning, but once you do, you‚Äôll know it. For me, I learned how to learn the first time I took adderall - I had planned writing a physics lab report that I didn‚Äôt understand and ended up reading the textbook for about twenty hours and just thinking and thinking until it finally clicked. I could see how the entire world could be explained by a set of equations, and it set off my ability to actually learn about things."
5156,"I don't disagree that you need to be knowledgeable and qualified to land a job in your chosen field. But you can't tell me you used even 50% of what you learned in your college classes in that phone interview.

Taking biology for instance, since that's my wheelhouse, they were obligated to teach me about genetics, chemistry, statistics, ect. They rounded it out with a ton of electives; for me ethics, Spanish, and that random film making class. There's pre-reqs, there's required general knowledge like writing..

My point is that for your undergrad they have to cover doctors, nurses, clinical staff, laboratory workers, ect all under the header ""biology."" But we all have a specific role that makes the world go round. So all the stuff I learned about genetics or in O chem II was fascinating, but pointless to my current position. Therefore mostly forgotten because I've had to take it upon myself to learn a ton more about the things I'm responsible for day to day, so I don't, you know, accidentally kill someone. üôÉ

If we're gonna get philosophical, college is about learning all those less tangible things; how to meet a deadline, being self reliant, getting good at networking. But like anything in life, you get out of it what you put in."
5157,a test where ur allowed to look up the answers
5158,"I think memorizing and learning go hand in hand tbh. I mean if youre just reading off powerpoints then ya i guess youre just memorizing it but its what you do with that material that helps you learn it. Look up videos, read the textbook, do your own research so you can actually learn the material more in depth. When you go into your career field you should be able to pull everything you have memorized/learned in classes and apply it irl and then as you gain more experience you will learn even more than what you were taught in classes."
5159,"I would agree. Memorization is less common is more heavily critical thinking based undergraduate fields, a philosophy, engineering, math, or science major will likely learn a deeper way of thinking that will stick, while someone in say, psychology, will lose a lot of the random facts. It‚Äôs very dependent on the field and your future."
5160,My little pieces of paper say otherwise. üòÇ I'm surely not a doctor or a surgeon. But I did major in Biology. You assume a lot about this stranger on the internet that was just trying to be honest with you. You're taking it much too literally/seriously. But you'll find out for yourself. No worries.
5161,I'm five years out and use my knowledge pretty much on a daily basis.
5162,This. All of this. I'm a bio professor and I need my freshman to realize PDQ that they get out of college what they put into it. If you want to learn you have to actively engage with the material.  You need to take charge of your own learning. We (profs) are here to explain complex topics and help you learn how to critically examine evidence and use the facts you learned + new evidence to solve new problems.
5163,I honestly believe that college just teaches us to do research and find verifiable resources to back up whatever claim we're trying to make.  #IveBeenInTooManyFacebookArguments

5228,"That's about the same course load as Harvard allows and significantly lower than Dartmouth allows. That's approximately 17 credit hours (assuming 5 classes worth 3 and the labs are worth 2). Harvard limits students to 16 credits without a waiver or 20 with a waiver. Dartmouth allows students to take upwards of 18 credit-hour-equivalents per *trimester*, which is significantly shorter than a semester."
5229,"I took a total of 5 classes at my college each semester, 2 summer courses to graduate early, now I am in a block schedule for my masters."

5231,I have seven classes as a freshman at uiuc.
5232,"Darthmouth is on the D plan, the standard calendar is a trimester system but they do offer classes over the summer so they technically have a four quarter system but is has a weird structure to it (source my friend when he was taking about having to be on campus for his sophomore summer at Darthmouth)"
5233,bruh I had to take like 18 credits üò≠ during a pndemic and for my first year. Thats around 5 classes plus labs
5234,yep. its still 50 hours a week like it or not. the number of units dont mean shit.
5235,"Yeah 7 was the most I took, most of them were 7 week courses so they staggered nicely. I needed to take advantage of the tuition cap. If 12 credits cost the same as 21, you bet your bottom dollar I was going to take it haha"
5236,"I asked this yesterday here. I take 21 credits in seven classes (which is about the average of what a student takes in my university), and it doesn't make sense that you barely get time to work \*properly\* in each class' material. Like sure, I can get it all done, but I barely get to deepen what interests me, and in my opinion college isn't some sort of ""all you can eat (study in this case)"" place, it should be like a properly catered place. To write a paper you ussually have to read a lot, and investigate properly, that takes a good amount of time, but you almost never get the time to do so.

I swear, the semester I felt I learnt the most was one when I only did half enrollment, so only did 10 credits. I did a couple essays I was actually proud of, having read a lot of material, and learnt a lot from each class. I nailed my grades, and in general, had a lot of time to explore extra-academic things that interest me.

So my guess is that Harvard knows that a student needs freedom to explore her/his interests, and also duties related to classes. Because otherwise it's just pretty overwhelming. Plus knowing that this amount of credits per semester won't even help me graduate faster, but in a total of 6 years, is just annoying"
5237,If they have 3 semesters per years they program get the same amount of classes done per year as the rest of us

5251,How did it go lol
5252,"Very true. During my university days here in the Philippines, I had 9-10 classes every semester, and oh my god what a ride. I had to be at school every week from 8 am to 6 pm, finish online assignments, create presentations, submit proposals, study for exams and surprise tests, etc, etc. I had to endure all of these for four years. Now, I am currently enrolled in a college in Ontario and I was shocked that I need to take 8 classes for the fall semester but these classes only fall on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and these classes are from 10 am to 1 pm. What a stark contrast from my previous 8 am to 6 pm schedule! Although, I don't know how different the class delivery will be seeing as I know that Canada and the Philippines have different systems, but hopefully it won't be as hard and frustrating as what I experienced years ago.  Wish me luck!"

5259,"Yes. Welcome to the not for profit, yet for profit model"
5260,Oh shit thats a good idea
5261,"The honest answer is because you're still getting the same course credit as if it was online. My school has seperate fees for the things you mentioned (technology, the shuttle service, parking, lab fees, etc). If you can show because you're off campus then you can get a waiver for those fees."
5262,"I‚Äôm even being charged a parking fee since I commute to school. I haven‚Äôt been on campus or even driven to campus in 2 years, yet every quarter I am charged. Absolutely ridiculous."
5263,How did you guys do that? That's actually really smart
5264,"I‚Äôm not defending any of their tuition practices, because the whole system is broken nation-wide, but online classes do cost the school more than in person classes. I can find an article to support this but basically the cost of infrastructure is insane in virtual learning compared to brick and mortar classrooms that are - for the most part - already there. It‚Äôs not fair, of course, but it is true, online learning costs more."
5265,"Even better when they charge ""financial aid fees"". For using financial aid....."
5266,"Not to rain on your parade, but there are at least a dozen 100% free LMS tools. Beyond that, there are also a *ton* of very low cost options, and in contrast to the traditional model, it's very very easy to estimate total costs for these. Check google classroom's pricing, it's basically industry standard. 

But by all means, if you'd like to validate your argument, I'd encourage you to iterate some actual numbers for what you imagine these costs to be. Also bear in mind, schools *already* have most of these tech stacks (like Microsoft or Google products) for their in-person classes, so those aren't additional costs - you would need to demonstrate additional costs, **beyond** those they were already paying.

>the cost of infrastructure is insane in virtual learning compared to brick and mortar classrooms

This is also incorrect, the cost of maintenance of large scale buildings is incredible. You should see the electricity and HVAC usage for a small, local community college."
5267,"I did this for my university, I got 1k+ signatures and not a single thing happened smfh"
5268,I pay extra for online and hybrid classes -_-
5269,"My school didn‚Äôt asses those fees for online classes unless they were part of the Learning 365 (distance learning pre COVID) program, and the fee was to cover the testing center. Your school may have something similar where they waive the fees for not typically online classes (eta: not classes part of an established distance learning/online course program), or you might be able to get a waiver if the course has an in person component (like chemistry with an online lecture, in person lab). It doesn‚Äôt hurt to double check class info and reach out to the bursars office to ask about the fee!

ETA: my school also didn‚Äôt shut down campus completely when we were mostly online, so the amenities that we were charged for were still available to students, which most of my friends schools also did, so double check to see if those are completely off limits or just operating under limited hours as well!"
5270,Its not profit if you spend all the money on salaries
5271,Fuck that.
5272,"Be careful what you wish for, some universities are looking at reduced credits for online courses, so they may be cheaper, but you have to take more."
5273,Last semester of jr year
5274,"That but also, demand is very inelastic. The number of people that will go to school is pretty much constant. The cost of the services received has gone up (since fewer services are being received for the same price), but very few people have dropped out or taken a year/semester off -- and those that have, likely are doing so because of the pandemic, not the price tag. So with demand the same, there's zero incentive to change the price -- especially because people really don't like massive price increases like would be necessary after the pandemic."

5285,As a College Staffer‚Ä¶ I appreciate your acknowledgment.
5286,"Yet you're still paying. You need to start a petition and/or threaten to transfer.

Most colleges understand students want either in-person or reduced tuition, but they have their own constraints and also don't want to just lose money."
5287,"Building on your points, the article states: ""He pointed to the significant price differences between some online and in-person classes as examples of the lower costs of providing online instruction. For example, he noted that tuition for Drexel‚Äôs online bachelor‚Äôs degree program in business administration is 40 percent less than the rate for the on-campus program.""

If the difference between in person classes and online courses is a price difference of 40%, then students should get a 40% refund."
5288,"For folks saying tuition shouldn't be refunded:

Imagine you hire someone to paint your house, and you pay upfront, and sign a contract for the house to be painted. You meet with the painter and go over color choices and pick out a nice shade of blue from the color swatches.

Then halfway through the job you discover the painter has switched from the blue you agreed on to a horrid shade of puke green.

You run up to the guy in charge of the paint crew and yell at him ""What the hell are you doing!?! That's not the color we talked about!""

He replies, ""They ran out of the blue and the next shipment is held up in customs probably for months. It's puke green or nothing.""

You'd be right to tell him to stop what he's doing right now, he's fired, and you want a refund.

Now imagine the painter says ""Look, I can't give the money back because I've got a crew to pay, I have to pay rent on the office, I'm paying down the work van. And besides, it'd cost you the same to have your house painted puke green, so it's really the same value.""

There'd be a lot of folks grabbing the ladder and threatening to send the guy flying away from your house.

That's basically what universities are doing, and there is no other industry where this kind of thing would be tolerated."
5289,My campus gym is $500 per semester. They refuse to give us a a refund as they‚Äôre still paying a ‚Äúportion‚Äù of the staff. The kicker is that most students got laid off and they won‚Äôt reveal how many people are still employed.

5291,Exactly or those nap chairs no one ever uses.
5292,"Tuition is a stretch, but we got fuckin scammed out of food and housing"
5293,"Agreed, but that‚Äôs for online programs vs in person, not individual classes. My university didn‚Äôt charge differently per credit hour for in person vs online classes."
5294,Yeah. As part of our student services fees. Our state legally requires that public schools provide in depth information about where tuition go to. Oh and part out $75 fee on student engagement we had a bouncy house party. Yes. A Bouncy house party that we are forced to pay for. For people over the age of 18 and in their twenties.
5295,This is a perfect analogy and if I wasn't paying my school for the puke green I would give you an award right now.
5296,"""Liberty and Arizona‚Äôs coronavirus responses were unique among others because they made the ‚Äúsame bad decision‚Äù to leave campuses open and left it up to students to decide whether to return, Miller said.

He said it is ‚Äúindefensible‚Äù for universities to hold on to fees for services which they are not providing.""

Exactly. You shouldn't have to pay for parking, wifi, gyms, etc. if you aren't allowed on campus."
5297,"Holy shit... Ours is 140$ for a 12 month membership for students, and it's not even a part of our tuition, so you only pay it if you use the gym. Do you go to the school in the USA?"
5298,I‚Äôd like at least my Economics class to be refunded. The second my school went to the real time virtual style of class my economics professor just gave up. He had us all meet once online and told us to make sure all of our work was turned in by the last day of the semester. He still had ‚Äúclass‚Äù but it was like 10 minutes and consisted of him asking if we had any questions and if we didn‚Äôt he said class was over. What a waste of money.
5299,"I was expecting something along the lines of the painter leaving halfway through the painting, and telling you you‚Äôll have to finish the job yourself.  But all the paint and supplies are there for you.  And if you need to ask about how to use the paintbrush you can call. 

Schools will have to adjust their next semester curriculums and be sensitive to the fact that many students will not have the proper pre-requisite training.  None of my students, even the ones who are now doing better than they did in class, prefer me teaching my class online than in person.  

If schools just refunded students and canceled their classes, this would delay many students graduations.  I don‚Äôt know exactly how it would affect their loan situation either.

Edit:  holy crap an award!  Thank you kind stranger!  To aid my own students in painting their house, I‚Äôve setup a groupme where they can ask questions.  It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs easy access to me, and when several of them do the homework last minute they can find eachother if I am asleep."
5300,I got lucky that I didn't have to fight for refunds. I received alot of fees back and my off-campus apartment even refunded me for the second half of the semester. Good luck to anyone fighting their universities. That's got to be hell.
5301,"Yeah, I attend a CSU in CA. The fees that we pay to maintain our sports program is insane too."
5302,Refunds sunk our school. They are looking to close three Vermont State Colleges and consolidating. Tread carefully.
5303,"The problem is that this is not a national determined difference. Idk what it's like for everyone in the US, but in the UK an online masters I was looking at was ¬£12,000 while an in-person masters from a university of a similar calibre was ¬£8,000. My argument has been repeatedly the same against why it shouldn't be refunded - the value you get out of your degree (value being whether that degree gets you a job or further higher education) is unlikely to go down whether you acheive the degree on-site or remotely"
5304,"As well as the gyms, the sports teams, the wifi fees, the green energy fees, the SHS fees, etc. If you aren't getting those services you shouldn't have to be paying for them either."
5305,"I am very lucky in the sense that I can learn online well. I have a good WiFi connection at home, and I only live with my dad, who is working during this pandemic so I have essentially zero distractions/issues at home and all the time to get work done. I have 6 classes this semester, and my entire time at home is dedicated to keeping up with them. WITH THAT BEING SAID,

the same is not true for most of my classmates! And they go to university specifically because they need the structured setting to study in. In our zoom class, one girl in my class has had to drive to the nearest McDonald‚Äôs and sit in the parking lot to use their WiFi to do homework because she doesn‚Äôt have internet at home. Another classmate can‚Äôt always be present in class because their younger elementary aged siblings are in e-learning classes as well and need the internet for that. Some have had the added responsibility of caring for younger or older family members. Some have big families that impede studying and they don‚Äôt have the school library to escape to when things get loud. I also know one girl who lives on campus and does not have a home or family to return home to, she is crashing at a friends house because she was kicked out of the university housing.

The bottom line is, part of the reason people are paying for tuition is to have access to resources like the library computers, the WiFi, the food/dining, and all of the resources included with tuition that we no longer have access to. I understand these amenities still need to be paid for whether we are there or not, but it‚Äôs just not fair that have already paid for them seeing as we don‚Äôt have access to the things that so many students NEED and rely on to get work done and have the educational experience they signed up for. We pay a lot of money for tuition, and I can almost guarantee people wouldn‚Äôt be willing to spend the same amount to learn at home. 

My professors have been really understanding to the situation luckily and they aren‚Äôt being super strict on deadlines, but that‚Äôs not an entirely enriching education experience by any means either. I don‚Äôt want to be graded based on tough circumstances, I want to be graded based on my ability to do things that are ultimately going to help me in my career. 

I‚Äôm not saying we deserve all our money back, but the monetary amount we‚Äôre losing out on should be factored in to next year at the very least. Some kind of compensation should be given, especially considering most of us college students won‚Äôt be getting a stimulus check."
5306,I would go in and bounce in it. My school had inflatables on the green about once a semester- think wipeout style big balls- but we never got a bouncy castle lol
5307,"However, the quality of education has decreased in this situation as students and professors alike are struggling to translate classes that were previously structured as in-person classes to online classes. For example, my university has never offered our business communication class online as getting the full value out of the class depends heavily on the feedback you receive on your interpersonal communication, presentation and professionalism skills. I'm not in that class this semester, but in the classes that I have given presentations, most of us have just been reading off of scripts which we would not have access to in an in-person setting. 

Secondly, I've heard some students whose professors have stopped lecturing and have just assigned more homework and papers. How is this going to help students learn the material? An online program may be fine and dandy when people have time to prepare for it and can conduct it well; here, this is not the case."
5308,"No. It's more like you hire a guy to paint your house. You pay upfront.  Then when he's halfway done, a tornado comes and destroys your house.  You want a refund.  But i've got news for you, force majeure (act of god) clauses means you lose in court."
5309,"I understand, but I mean, it seems fair. All this happened mid-way through the semester. The buses and housing were in service full time until then, so it makes sense (to me) that we're only getting partial refunds. I'm glad we're atleast getting that, instead of nothing like a lot of schools are."
5310,Nap chairs?
5311,For whatever fucking reason my Econ professor decided were going to have an exam every week now and class every day. I think most of the students (including myself) have given up now because out of like 80 students he only has 5-10 in his zoom calls.
5312,"As a professor, I can absolutely assure you that the education I'm currently providing is nothing at all like what my students signed up for.

The service universities are offering is the education, not the diploma."
5313,Left my info. Hopefully schools get sued so we can get some money back. This is ridiculous.
5314,"Same for my university. The housing refunds were different depending on whether you received financial aid or not, which I thought was fair. They also gave students who had work-study an extra paycheck depending on how much they were estimated to have made with the rest of work-study. They also did this before any of the lawsuits or protests for refunds happened. It opens me eyes to how well they handled this so I'm kinda baffled by how some universities are straight up not refunding anything"
5315,Why get a full refund when you utilized 70% of the service?
5316,"But in that case, it's not a ""refund."" You didn't pay into housing beyond what you were refunded already. If anything, the financial aid you previously received was the ""refund,"" you want. This would just be a grant, or loan, from the school to select low-income students given out of the goodness of their heart."
5317,"That‚Äôs the spirit! I definitely understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôm doing mechanical engineering, working towards dreams I‚Äôve had since I was in early elementary school. I hope everything goes well for you!"

5324,I am a dreamer as well. My dream is to become rich‚Ä¶. And to buy this house üòÇ
5325,"The price of the house depends on the price of the land. In the middle of a cornfield state it‚Äôs probably cheap. A waterfront property in miami, it‚Äôs probably like $10 million"

5327,Thank you! One day at a time.
5328,Lovely draft. Thats the reason im in college too but im becoming an architectural engineer. Thinking of switching to plane architecture but the coursework will put me here for 6 years instead of 5.

5330,"Everything is perfect with the exception of that long ass path to the door, that'd drive me crazy! Really nice work my dude."
5331,"Depending upon where you live it can be really important to have a south facing window in the rooms you spend the most time in. For me it's the kitchen. I bought my current home based almost solely on this criteria after living in several great homes - none of which had good southern exposure - and I wilted, just like my plants. Super important if you live in the northern hemisphere year round. Please think about this when you build someday.

TLDR: Put a compass on your plans."
5332,Thank you üòÅ
5333,Wheres the sex dungeon?
5334,That‚Äôs really cool. So do civil engineers also design houses? I thought they worked on city planning and other stuff like that.
5335,This is amazing.
5336,"Civil engineering works on a much larger scale than Architecture. Also, I really like the idea of being responsible for projects that help everyone in their everyday lives. Fixing roads, creating canals and bridges just feels more rewarding on the large scale."
5337,damn it looks nice! you're really talented OP
5338,"I‚Äôm glad you actually enjoy engineering. Too many people go do engineering because of job security and money but if you don‚Äôt actually enjoy some aspect of it, then you‚Äôre going to suffer through school"
5339,Keep on grinding buddy. You‚Äôll get there.
5340,Why civil engineering and not architecture or architectural engineering?
5341,Your dinning room is a separate room. That is uncommon today. Do mind if I ask why?

5343,Fair point üòÇ It's aestheticly pleasing but not physically.
5344,That's a secret

5377,"Got frighteningly close to losing a relative to alcohol poisoning because her college buddies, all close friends including a sober designated driver, were more concerned with getting back to the dorm without getting in trouble than they were with making sure that she was really okay. Not a malicious act, but an inexperienced one. Play it safe."
5378,"WATCH OUT FOR YOUR FRIENDS 
When I was a freshman I remember doing 10 shots of grey goose very quickly
(cause I‚Äôm stupid ) 
Anyway my friend was trying to keep pace even though she‚Äôs half my size. She got sick threw up everywhere and passed out. I wanted to call campus police but the people I I was with wanted to leave her in the hallway. I decided that day that my friend was more important to me than being cool and made the call anyway and gotten a ton of trouble but my friend is still alive and one of my very favorite people in the world."
5379,"It's not uncommon for freshmen to be drinking because older friends gave them some, but if you're caught drinking underage, the punishment depends on how strict the police are in your town, city or university are."
5380,"Coming from a country where it's legal to drink even in high school, how punitive is the drinking age of 21 as a freshman? How easy is it to obtain alcohol and get away with it?"
5381,"Also, keep an eye on when, where, how much, how often, and why you drink. Alcohol abuse isn't limited to party animals or binge drinkers and it's a lot harder to quit than it is to catch yourself."
5382,Many states have laws specifically protecting people who call EMS from arrests or charges related to things like drug use or underrage drinking. Check your individual state laws but they're pretty common and very important to know in an emergency situation
5383,Yes! I learned how to drink with my parents and I'm very thankful for that.
5384,">not uncommon 


That is an understatement. Even the nerds drink a decent bit."
5385,No punishment is worse than watching someone potentially lose their life. Good on you
5386,"Absolutely. I never drank or smoked in high school, college changed a lot of things for me. I‚Äôve had such a great experience but I can not stress enough, POUND THAT WATER! Hell, eat some bread. If you can, even before you go to bed. Hangovers suck, but you‚Äôll survive. Honestly nothing like a good glass of OJ.

But everyone‚Äôs different. If it‚Äôs you‚Äôre first time like it was for me and if you‚Äôre curious, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt abstain. College is for trying new things. But of course, drink responsibly!"
5387,"Ya‚Äôll, I work with an org who mentors college students essentially. We work with a fairly large student population and every. single. year. someone dies from a drinking accident. We almost went a year without a drinking death until a student was struck and killed from a drunk driver. The worst will happen, don‚Äôt let it be you. And notice I said drinking accidents, because that‚Äôs what they often are simple accidents. So be safe, be smart, and do those best practices like knowing what drink you can handle and how many, sleeping on your side, having a buddy, etc etc etc. trust me, drinking is wayyyyyy more fun, when you‚Äôre not having accidents while pushing the limit."
5388,"As a college prof, I started my kids out young and will continue to permit them to drink alcohol in moderation in the house. When they get older, I'll may get them drunk before they move out. (And may get me drunk after they do :).)

I've seen what binge drinking can do to ruin a student's life, and while it isn't always the case, it seems like those who have come from very restrictive households can end up with the worst of it, since they are new to everything."
5389,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helpful to shun drinking completely. Most people will drink in college and most adults will consume alcohol through their lives. I think it‚Äôs more helpful to develop responsible drinking habits when you first begin doing it, around college freshman age"
5390,Usually called a Good Samaritan policy. Many universities have them too if you report to their security/public safety.
5391,Decent bit? I'd be surprised if they weren't getting more plastered than those who go out to party.
5392,stupidly easy to get stuff. couple skeezy liquor stores don't ID and everyone has fakes or older friends.
5393,"I live in the neighborhood of a mid-sized state university and have worked there for several years. On more than one occasion, a new freshmen doesn't finish the first semester because they get drunk and walk out in front of a car on a busy road. Parents send their precious child to school and their freshman is dies in the first two weeks of their first semester. 

I get the coolness of drinking and partying and sometimes it feels good. But think of it this way: if you are 18, you will be 21 in three years, and then will be over 21 for the rest of your life."
5394,"This. Learned with family, had a little humiliating of an experience, never got that drunk again. Served its purpose."
5395,"Waiting till 21 defeats the whole point. Half the reason kids drink is to break the rules. 

Edit: pissed off the mormons lol"
5396,"Yep. There‚Äôs a massive difference between drinking when you‚Äôre out with your friends and drinking alone because you‚Äôre bored or stressed or upset. Drinking alone is not a good sign, even if you aren‚Äôt binge drinking."
5397,Yes and most (?) universities have some kind of amnesty laws so that you won't get in trouble for being drunk/high on campus if you call for help
5398,"Why does this sub treat drinking and partying like the biggest taboo ever? 

You can tell a college freshman all the precautions you want, but they won‚Äôt know their limit or know the proper cautions to take until they‚Äôve actually drank and partied a few times. Hindsight bias plagues this sub, and unfortunately, many of us were warned of the dangers of hangovers and blackouts before college, but like most teenagers, it‚Äôs meaningless until we actually experience it."
5399,It's not that deep people just fuckin' send it
5400,"Not just for college students but please tell your health providers (EMS, doctor, etc.) if you drink alcohol regularly or do street drugs. It really helps with treatment, medicine can conflict, and like most people said, I don't believe they can tell police."
5401,"My college was super strict. You could lose your financial aid if you were caught drinking and if it was a repeated offense you would get kicked of campus. You could also still be fined a $100 dollars for merely being in the presence of others underage drinking. However, it does not really deter drinking just makes people less likely to reach out for help in iffy situations."
5402,"Also, as a residence life professional who serves on duty and enforces policies against underage drinking I can tell you that if I get a call from someone worried that their friend/ roommate/ whoever may be in physical danger of possible death, my first thought isn‚Äôt to make the person who called recite the alphabet backwards or walk in a straight line while touching their nose to test how drunk *they* might be. 

My priority is to get help to the person who needs it. I likely would only interact with the person who called to get all relevant information, not to interrogate them or ‚Äúget them in trouble.‚Äù

We want students to make the call to help each other. We don‚Äôt want a death on campus. If you make that call, it‚Äôs so unlikely you would face any repercussions at the vast majority of universities. 

And even if you did, it would likely be one online alcohol safety course and that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs a lot better than letting a friend die.

I really can‚Äôt stress this enough. Please call to get help for friends and peers in need, even if you‚Äôre scared."
5403,[deleted]
5404,"Last paragraph is unbelievable. I don‚Äôt really know a single person my age (under 21) that doesn‚Äôt drink regularly, or at the very least hasn‚Äôt drank before. Did you have any friends whatsoever? This is very alien to me to hear someone actually follow or believe in the over 21 rule."
5405,"For real. Sometimes I see people so drunk that they are taking a shit out in public, an ambulance transporting someone too drunk, people being used as a dart chart, etc.
If your gonna drink at least respect yourself and your dignity."
5406,You should also at least understand your schools policies related to underage alcohol and or drug use so you know what your consequences might be if you get in trouble.
5407,Honestly being at home as destroyed my sense of self discipline. I thought I was way better at getting things done than this
5408,I absolutely knew being home was going to destroy my discipline and I was right. One of our professors even gave us all an extension for a section of a paper we're supposed to be writing and I still haven't started. I can barely focus on anything that takes more than a few minutes. This is really going to hurt a lot of people. I kind of wish they'd just made the rest of the semester simple assignments or let people choose to get the grade they had when we switched to online.
5409,"My classes have been giving way more work than usual. I‚Äôm taking 21 units and I was doing okay before the switch, now I feel like I‚Äôm going to fail all of them because each class is giving 8hrs worth of assignments a day in videos, reading, discussion boards, etc. (and that‚Äôs without counting the 6 hours just spent in zoom classes 2 times a week- 12hrs total). I have 6 classes and they‚Äôre all adding more work."
5410,"i take so many notes online. I read it, take a note, read it again and make sure my note matches and makes sense and that I CAN READ MY OWN HANDWRITING. yes, this a problem. 

so many more notes than if i was in a classroom."
5411,"Yeah, in my case. New things like ‚Äúengagement‚Äù quizzes in my chem and my anthro classes as bonus assignments that we didn‚Äôt have before. Because showing up to class and doing weekly quizzes (chem) wasn‚Äôt good enough engagement ig."
5412,"It's not more work, but a different kind of work in a similar vein. For example, a discussion board prompt in lieu of actual in class discussion on the topic."
5413,"One of my professors is adding more work to class. But, other than that, nothing much has changed. (except for my mental health and lack of motivation)"
5414,For me it‚Äôs double the time. All of my classes have pre-recorded lectures to watch (that are our normal full lecture length) before we meet for live lecture at our scheduled lecture times (which are also full lecture time) to go back over it and answer our questions. So it‚Äôs double the lecture time for each class
5415,"Yeah, especially with an online video that you can pause or just lecture slides it gets easy to take way too many notes. The one thing about a live lecture is that it forces you to determine what's important because you dont have time to write everything down."
5416,"I‚Äôm telling y‚Äôall if this keeps up ya boi taking like 2 summer classes and then taking fall 2020 off. I‚Äôm not fucking with these online joints, I woulda took classes online in the first place if that‚Äôs what I wanted."
5417,I wish that was how it was but it makes sense that its not like that. Alot of my courses are prerequisites for upper level courses and I need the second half of the curriculum. It just kinda sucks all around
5418,"Same here. I‚Äôve always made myself go out to do school work because I know I won‚Äôt do it at home. Even on days I didn‚Äôt have class, I‚Äôd still drive the 40 minutes to school to do homework in the library. Worst case scenario, I‚Äôd take my laptop and backpack to a Starbucks or McDonald‚Äôs and work there. 

Now everything is fucking closed. There‚Äôs no Starbucks, McDonald‚Äôs, school library, public library, or park I can do my work in. Literally everything is closed so I have to work at home. It sucks"
5419,If you actually are failing i would drop those classes and retake them in the summer if possible if not then in the fall. My college is offering refunds if you need to drop the courses and take another time. Hopefully your college/university is doing so and if not good luck to you online classes are tough imo.
5420,My classes haven't really changed workload wise but I just have a hard time focusing and being motivated.
5421,"Tests are different. One professor made my exam extremely hard and gave us a day and a half to do it. I stayed up all night working on it. Another test i just finished made the anti cheating and online accommodations so challenging to work with that i spent half the exam just trying to take the exam. 

I have never felt shittier about my academics. Trying to take an exam with some rando with his mic on, my dog barking, and the professor not answering test related dms and changing the test questions near the end of the test is stressing me out so much i can feel it all over.

None of my professors are relaxed about the online setting and are pilling work on. I suspect because it's easy for them to forget that we are people when they can't see us. One of my professors whose class had a mandatory attendance policy hasn't had any online lectures. She instead has a plethora of assignments due at various times on most days of the week. She also uses two websites for the class so checking what's due requires checking around."
5422,"I'm giving more/different work.

I had to scrap an assignment that only worked in-person, and now have discussion board participation as a replacement.

If all my students did was post 2 moderately thoughtful comments each week, they'd sail by with an easy A for that grade. ...Median participation level is 0 comments per week."
5423,"Yeah this is it. Maybe I get like an extra few pages or more questions to answer before class but that's not really noticeable since I don't know if that would've happened regardless.

But I feel so disconnected from college. When I'm home, I don't think about school, that's just how my brain works. Now that I have to write papers and study for quizzes and tests it's become nearly impossible to see why I'm doing it. The end is no longer clearly defined and the means to get there seems so much more strenuous."
5424,"so many professors at my college have been loading work onto their students, who then complained to the college, that the college actually sent out an email to professors telling them to chill and stop overloading their students during such a difficult time."
5425,Oh I know. This is a really terrible situation and there are no right answers. We've all just gotta make it to the end of the semester and hope it's better by the fall.
5426,My professor gave us 15 minutes on a 156 question test.  That basically sums up my online learning experience.
5427,"Some more, some less. Really depends on the professor, and how well they adapt to the online curriculum.

For instance, one of my professors basically just scrapped the entire in-class portion of the class, so it's literally just half the work.

Another one of my professors has taken all the in class stuff and turned it into at-home research, that's definitely more work.

Most classes though, kinda just feel the same. Although even with the same amount of work, some classes have gotten harder just because the professors aren't good at teaching online, so I'm having to spend more time trying to understand the material."
5428,"Dear god, YES.  I feel like some professors are thinking that just because we don't have to commute and that we're home all day, it's okay to give more work.  They're out of touch with the fact that our circumstances have drastically changed.  Some of us have no way to get distraction-free environments.  Some people's jobs are still considered essential so they're working or some have lost their jobs.  Some have utter garbage internet.  The fear and depression are real and the extra work for a grade is just rubbing salt in the wound."
5429,"Me too! I‚Äôve even taken online classes before but with everything going on, my classes feel minuscule in the grand scheme of things. Also online exams kill my disciple I used to have to study a lot before them :("
5430,"Can‚Äôt say for sure, but it certainly seems like it. 

I‚Äôve found numerous classes giving 2-3 assignments per week, when the usual is 1 if that.

Granted it‚Äôs just busy work like writing and responding to peer discussion posts, but still. It does feel overwhelming in the sense that I always feel as though I‚Äôm forgetting to do something."
5431,"I‚Äôm not sure exactly where I stand right now because all the big point assignments are still coming up and I‚Äôm hoping I can score high on those, it‚Äôs just these small assignments here and there that keep bringing me down. I just got accepted to SDSU and this is my last semester before transferring so I‚Äôm really trying to not have to drop anything because then I would have to stay at this community college for another year. Thank you tho!"
5432,that independence forcing you to police yourself is a massive part of college for pretty much everyone
5433,15 minutes for 156 questions? Your prof is literally insane. I would def fail that exam
5434,"Yeah exactly, environment is such a big factor into success. Same with working out, when you‚Äôre at the gym you can‚Äôt do anything but workout. At home there are so many distractions that it‚Äôs really hard to have the same level of discipline as you would if you were actually at school. Right now my routine is all over the place, I will be trying to plan out my days in advance so that way I can fall into a daily schedule which may help."
5435,"I experience this all the time, the lack of any urgency regarding the assignment. The due date could be fast approaching, right on my doorstep, even, and yet I still feel no sense of worry. No stress, pressure, nothing. Consequently, I find it difficult to get started on anything until the very last minute, at which point I usually pull something out of my ass. I'm still not sure whether it's apathy or if something is genuinely wrong with my mental health. It's gotten me this far in life, but college is kicking my ass so far. It's kinda relieving seeing others going through the same thing. 

I hope you kick that project's ass. It probably deserves it."
5436,I have way less work I feel like I'm the only one lol
5437,"We have a concern system at our school. We get them if something seems off or if a student misses class without an explanation for more than three days consecutively. It's to help prevent issues such as suicide, because unfortunately that has happened before. I recently more or less found out they are usually a joke. I've had a few because of chronic illness. I got told to ""grow up"" and that ""I needed to be more responsible"". Like okay is this like being sent to the principal's office or something? I guess someone said something because now campus safety will basically barge in on anyone missing for more than three days."
5438,"Wow those two incidents could have been easily resolved by your neighbor or roommate talking to you. It's weird they just reported you w/o saying anything

Also, in my experience some people tend to over exaggerate when they file complaints/reports so staff takes it very seriously or more urgently. It really sucks that pushy  ppl cause trouble for others like that"
5439,"We had some weather issues last week, light snow but LOTS OF ICE. Instead of cancelling they delayed classes till 10 AND THEN cancelled classes at 11. After everybody already bumped/wrecked into each other driving here. They closed the library at midnight but didn‚Äôt think to cancel classes later on till we all got there in 14 degree weather >:("
5440,My fraternity was suspended because we brought a pledge to the hospital after he got overly intoxicated in his dorm room. Good Samaritan policy didn‚Äôt apply because we didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcall‚Äù an ambulance. I was President of the fraternity.
5441,So there was an incident on MLK day a few years ago. A group of students decided it would be funny to put nooses and cotton on the doors of black basketball players ( they all stay in one wing). The dean of students thought the dorm‚Äôs director decision to kick them out of them dorms and basically bar them from reapplying  was too harsh. I was on call when this happened. But after threats of withdrawal of funding from the rich folks from the islands they were expelled.
5442,Props on getting the job tho
5443,"Yeah. She really thought that shitting in darkness and then calling a psychiatric SWAT team on me was easier than like...saying something so I knew she was in there?

Honestly the scariest part of this is how I didn‚Äôt even know these procedures/departments existed within the school until I was in them. Mental health services is pretty open about having counselors and appointments but it seems like they‚Äôre intentionally hiding the more aggressive disciplinary branch of their operations."
5444,"Dude. Last year when the Midwest had those -40 degree days, we ended up having a petition passed around to cancel school. They didn't cancel school until like 3 hours before classes were supposed to start and it left people stranded who were commuters. My friend crashed in my room for three days. There were a lot of colleges in Indiana who were threatened with lawsuits for endangerment if they did not cancel classes."
5445,"So this past semester was easily one of the hardest I‚Äôve had to deal with. I had a late class on Tuesdays from 5pm-8ish with my day starting at 9am. One day I found myself to be extremely tired and was yawning a little more than usual in class, my teacher called me out on it called me disrespectful even had me leave the classroom to talk ‚Äúmore in private‚Äù as we were outside she faked yawned in my face to show me how to properly yawn in public, she asked me to either do that, stop, or leave the class whenever I had to yawn. I told her that was a lot and if it was distracting I could happily just leave class altogether. Which I did. The following morning I started receiving emails from the Dean of Students about meeting with them and discussing why I was tired and what I was doing that was making me so tired. Unnecessarily but whatever I kept it pushing until the next class she gave me a 23/100 evaluation allegedly based on 3-4 weeks worth of classes. When I spoke to her about it I got no real explanation and she said I disrespected her on multiple occasions in a matter of minutes the one day."
5446,"I signed up for nighttime classes 3 months before the semester. A week before they start they get cancelled due to low inrolment. But they offered me the same classes except in the mounring.... and those classes where full. So a week before the semester starts I ended up changing community colleges completely. 

My parents got a full refund and now I‚Äôm going somewhere better, yet cheaper. So it all worked out in the end."
5447,"My school didn't give me my financial aid plan (including federal aid, etc.) until 2 weeks after I started classes and then tried to tell me I had to take out more loans to make up for it and then threatened to drop me because I hadn't paid the full amount. I'm just glad they finally figured it out"
5448,No longer allowing internships during the summer.
5449,I hope you threw hands with your advisor.
5450,"I got told by my spanish department that they wouldn‚Äôt allow me to use my iPad in class for notes and textbook. I‚Äôve had two surgeries (nuss bar for severe deformity) and I can‚Äôt carry more than 5 lbs, I cannot carry the textbook or a notebook at all."
5451,Holy shit that‚Äôs horrible. Glad they were expelled after the intervention of the money holders but shouldn‚Äôt have taken them intervening in the first place.
5452,"The first time I went to college my friend nearly got a public intoxication ticket because we decided to walk him from our residence to the hospital when he took some bad  MDMA. It was litteraly the next building over, with only a bike path between the two parking lots. 

A bike cop happened upon us and when we thought we found help, we really just hit a brick wall. Cop called back up, back up took 15 minutes to show up before they started searching us and all that because we had someone who had admitted to taking drugs. 25 minutes after the cop first found us, my friend started having a seizure and the cop at first accused him of faking it.

Solid night. Luckily we managed to bring him to the emergency room and he was okay after some IV fluids and being monitored."
5453,That's bullshit. I'm glad I live off campus.
5454,Was this recently and in the US? You can totally get help because of a disability and teachers/school have to follow suit.

5457,Holy shit your prof is crazy
5458,"Charged $300 for a mental health visit. Also I'm an RA, I have to submit my hours electronically AND in print/signed. I took my hours to the HR manager, gave them to her by hand. Then the next week when my pay didn't go through she told me I never handed them in. She made me fill out a time adjustment form (which apparently those make her super super pissed), then that paycheck took 3.5 weeks to arrive"
5459,Thank you!
5460,"Idk if this counts but I was in a serious car crash my first semester and it took almost a month to get an appointment with the disability center to talk about letting me park closer to my dorm so I could walk to the car I was borrowing. 

The first week, I ate the only food I had in my dorm (chocolate soy milk, dried seaweed, and Malto Meal). By the second week, I was brave enough to venture outside for classes and managed to make it to a convenience store where I would get a bag or two of chips at a time because I was too weak to carry anything yet (including my backpack). By the third week I made it to the parking lot and just brought the car up to my dorm lot. They ticketed me almost every day that week totaling up to over $200 in fines and wouldn‚Äôt revoke it when I did get my disability accommodations. 

Did I mention I was in drug withdrawal the whole time, attempted suicide, and had my OCD onset? 

A lot of people tell me ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs fine, the first semester is always the hardest‚Äù and I just smile, but no one really understands how bad it was for me. I felt really isolated from my peers"
5461,That is so crazy. How can they control what you do over the summer?
5462,"I went to disability services, I‚Äôm having to have my disability form rewritten and re-emailed to every professor specifically saying I can‚Äôt lift more than 5 lbs and I won‚Äôt carry shit to class but my iPad and a super light notebook."

5465,"Advisors are so useless. I made a one-hour appointment to talk to mine so we could plan out the rest of my degree (3 semesters at that point) and I was asking what order to take some classes in cuz of pre reqs. 

This lady had no idea what I was talking about. She started saying some BS about ‚Äúoh, general ed classes are easier, so maybe work those into your schedule‚Äù cuz I had my upper division gen ed classes left. I was like wtf, that‚Äôs not my question. I ended up leaving literally 8 minutes into the appointment, looking up the university catalog, and mapping out my degree myself üôÑ"

Education is the way forward. Finally, we can bring it under the microscope and out from under the boot of the government."
5482,My school has an extremely vocal ‚Äúpagan club‚Äù. They all seem nice and to be fair they try reeeaaally hard to be inclusive. But all of posters say things like ‚ÄúSeveral of our practicing members are catholic or Jewish!‚Äù And I‚Äôm not so sure that‚Äôs how that works....
5483,That is correct
5484,We have camper park with trailers for students if thats what you are talking about maybe

Also with clubs and stuff I know I personally have been in clubs that I may not *belong* in (I was in BSA for 4 years, I am for sure very white) but people join for a curiosity and to learn different perspectives. Even if they do not necessarily practice or *belong* there."
5497,"I did this for highschool in the 2000s. We had the benefit of being able to email with a tutor from the institution though, so at least there was that. My mom did most of her education this way before emailing was an option."

5510,"Is it unreasonable to think that we are approaching the point where kids don‚Äôt know what AM/FM radio is, Due to the popularity of streaming services like Spotify and iHeartRadio?

5512,You're 100% right!
5513,That's so interesting. History I guess does repeat itself.
5514,"The Covid 19 Pandemic has certainly changed a lot when it comes to schooling.[EdTech](https://www.valuer.ai/blog/edtech-trends-and-notable-companies-to-watch-in-the-years-to-come) has also transformed what education looks like nowadays, however I feel like some of these changes are here to stay. What I think is that a lot of these technologies have saved students from having an education in these crazy times and if you think about it this would not have been possible just ten years ago!"
5515,At least teachers read to them. There are some classes where we depend on YouTube and have no slides nor lectures üò≠üò≠
5516,Wow they actually had live people teaching them back then. My classes just have power points and random YouTube videos that don‚Äôt even help.

5520,"The saying 'if it aint broke, don't fix it' doesn't mean 'don't innovate'. It means 'don't address problems that do not exist'. A lot of UI changes are addressing problems that do not exist."

5523,"I always hated that saying. It's called innovating which is something good for us. They just executed it poorly.

Edit. Wrong word used"
5524,"Yeah I sent one in.

""The UI stinks please change it back to include the important stuff too and not just emojis. It looks like you mated the Neopets website with AOL online and they had a disappointment child."""

5533,What?
5534,"The group who paid them off to do it wrote a big check. Probably from private and high end state run universities. Remember, college is about draining your family for every penny possible to give you a paper that would never get you a good job unless it is super practical. It's like church. You put faith that your money ain't going to waste. But that's their whole scam"
5535,Just sent them a heated message.
5536,Did they also takeaway to filter reviews by which classes the professors teach because I can't do it anymore?
5537,Beautiful.
5538,It's been pretty accurate in my experience and is quite helpful in saving your gpa
5539,It‚Äôs almost always accurate.
5540,"My first thought post-redesign was: ""this looks like Urban Dictionary"""
5541,"Innovation should not be solely defined by the number of new additions it brings but rather its nature of attempting to solve problems.

With that being said, just because it‚Äôs BAD innovation doesn‚Äôt take away the fact that it was an attempt at innovating. (But then again, could bad innovation even be considered as innovation at all?)

To play devils advocate for a moment, one could argue that sometimes UIs need a redesign to stay fresh and relevant-looking, i.e. Reddit‚Äôs UI redesign. Which is also why we can see that they are looking for feedback because they made it look pretty, now let‚Äôs put back in the functions we accidentally shaved off."
5542,Thanks for including the link to complain! I sent one in too!
5543,[deleted]
5544,yea idk why the had to change the UI as well. its so horrible now
5545,I was in the middle of picking classes when the redesign went live and I fucking hate it
5546,Honestly there should be a rate my boss
5547,This is what I said about the reddit redesign.
5548,"How so? Though I think it‚Äôs a bit exaggerated he/she does have a point. One of my classes used material created in 2010  to ‚Äúteach‚Äù. That‚Äôs essentially a ten year old education at a 2019 price tag. School is pretty much automated now for basic subjects. All a school does is reuse the same programs and send you on your way while simultaneously raising the cost of attendance each year. 

I know people with masters getting paid $16 /h. 

Yes education is important and is intended to give you a well rounded experience for you to go out into the world. But it does not reflect the steep price point it carries."
5549,My schedule for this entire semester is work work work 7 days a week. Everyday there‚Äôs something I have to do that it school related and it‚Äôs usually something that requires lots of effort to even get done. No break days at all this semester.
5550,All my assignments are due Saturday and Sunday which I think is the most unfair thing because my weekends should be mine
5551,i just never stop. I smartly decided to take 5 classes for 18 credits. there are no days off. im dying already.
5552,Fuckin same man. It's frustrating but oh well.
5553,"I do school 4 days in a row, work three days in a row and do school after work. My breaks are eating, showering and when my brain is so fuzzy even watching TV is too intricate for it to process."
5554,Couldn't you just turn it in on Friday?
5555,"Posting this to procrastinate on an essay I'm in the middle of writing, due tomorrow for an online class :( lol"
5556,Do them by Friday.
5557,"Every prof thinks since we're ""just sitting at home"" we can do all the assignments plus some more. Any objection and they say ""What else you gotta do now?"""
5558,Uhh... I don't even get Sunday off from schoolwork :(
5559,"Oh my god me too, my profs decided to just add assignments and projects due on the weekend since it‚Äôs all online and ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to be in person to hand things in anymore‚Äù"
5560,"I never had a Saturday off from anything the whole time I was in school pre-corona because of work.  I took a mix of online and on-campus classes.  If you don't want to overload yourself on certain days, Saturdays are just another day."
5561,Dude I understand how you feel. Dam 18 credits!? I'm taking 6 courses and yet it's only 16 credits. I feel bad for your chief. But we must survive‚úä
5562,"No break days, I have something due every single day too except Mondays when I usually need to go in person for a class. There‚Äôs no breaks every other month which the thought alone is killing me because I ALWAYS get exhausted around the 5 week mark as it approaches time for break but it‚Äôs 5 week mark and no break is coming for two months. How this is affecting college students emotionally doesn‚Äôt seem to matter."
5563,yes! I have one class where our Zoom classes are scheduled on Saturday mornings and another that has everything due on Sundays. i‚Äôve done online classes pre-covid and they just seem to be structured in a way where weekends are not a consideration in the same way that they are for in person classes. it‚Äôs honestly so draining.
5564,"In case any of ya'll are thinking of becoming a teacher (college or otherwise), I don't think there's been a week in the last 6 years where I haven't had to grade/lesson plan on a weekend or use at least one weeknight for the same.

I lesson planned/put shit on the LMS for 8 hours today. I'll do another 3 tomorrow, then go to a 4-hour required meeting for the writing center where I work.

I wouldn't recommend it!

P.S. Is UIC in your tag UIC in Chicago? I taught there for a term."
5565,[deleted]
5566,my weekends now have no meaning :( they just feel like a regular weekday
5567,Yep. Assignments due every Wednesday and Sunday so constantly working on the weekend and throughout the week. It‚Äôs rough.
5568,Drop a course. Don‚Äôt hate your life.
5569,Very understanding does not equal accepting missed deadlines. Every prof who uploaded HW or assignment at least 3 days in advance (and typically in mine they are available at the beginning of the semester or a good week ahead) will just assign zero and move on.
5570,This should be against college policy everywhere
5571,Had 3 classes today... so yeah :(
5572,"didnt know other people were feeling like this too! 

i just started doing all my hw for the next class/week during lectures and primarily mon-tue-wed so that thur/fri is more chill and weekends are free. its honestly hell but I think it‚Äôs worth it (otherwise I would literally die.,, not even joking)... but I still feel like I risk missing assignment due dates ü§Ø"

5576,I'm doing 6 courses for 18 credits!! Good luck :( my classes start tomorrow and reading this thread makes me terrified
5577,"definitely, i have assignments for 3 of my classes due on sundays and sometimes i have saturday classes so i‚Äôm literally always working, plus all our vacations have been cancelled so we don‚Äôt get any days off outside of weekends ://"
5578,"Does every professor think they're the only one to have the idea to increase workload???? ""No, the history department would never do that so we, the math department, will!"" except everyone's doing it and students are drowning."
5579,"Yeah, fair point. 

This semester I‚Äôve got two courses with Slack teams, one on Piazza, one on some self-hosted web chat thing and now one on Discord.

Discord feels a bit out of place, but if it works well, I don‚Äôt mind at all."
5580,"I'd say what you described right there is a bigger issue than anything else. Having stuff spread over so many different platforms is going to cause nothing but pain for many students. 

I know that it's sometimes hard to enforce, especially with tenured professors, but a standard messaging platform (doesn't matter which) should be decided on, purchased, and admined by the university IT group. Just like a standard LMS, everyone uses the same email platform, etc."
5581,"Completely agree. 

I‚Äôm a CS major and this is a mandatory course, so you‚Äôre right that they seem to have really understood their audience."
5582,i had a class this summer that was run on discord. the prof was very active on the server and also used bots to do in-class polls and questions. i thought it was really helpful because you could ask questions whenever and the prof got back to you quickly.
5583,"CS I'd bet 95% of your student body has discord lmao.

Maybe a Chemistry or biology would be less, but for CS it just makes sense."
5584,Absolutely it should. Half my time is now spent jumping from 12 different platforms just trying to figure out what the assignments are. It really makes me reconsider switching to completely online university like WGU where most of their software is ubiquitous
5585,You sound like a miserable fuck.
5586,Some friends in the Computer Science department at my my university have told me that every single one of their classes used Discord instead of Zoom last semester once we went online.
5587,Discord is the best free conference call software so that's not too surprising.  The admin features blow zoom out of the water
5588,"Discord did a very good pivot towards what you might call ""general audiences"" after this whole covid thing forced everyone online. It is also, in my view, one of the best conference-call-chat applications out there as of now."
5589,You can disable that in the Settings.
5590,The sneaky bastard can tell when you guys are gaming instead of studying.
5591,"As a STEM student who games, it honestly surprises me just how much better Discord can be for meetings and things of the sort than Zoom. Maybe not in every case but there are a lot of cases where Discord is just so much better. Basically in my school each Engineering/Math/CS major has a designated discord server with each channel being a group. It's entirely student run and not tied to the university at all, but some professors are in it and some TA's are in it. Much easier to manage than a bunch of separate GroupMe's or something.


It also surprises me just how few people use Discord. If I talk to anyone who isn't part of that Engineering/Math/CS/Gaming circle, there's a very high likelihood they've never used Discord let alone heard of it before, despite probably having used Skype before and Discord being Skype but objectively better."
5592,"Discord announced that they raised the limit, I‚Äôve been in calls with 99 others"
5593,Didn‚Äôt Discord up the video limit just so schools and businesses could be supported during this time?
5594,No he‚Äôs talking about your brain and your emotions. They seem quite fucked up ngl
5595,I wouldn't be calling anyone dumb when you can't even put together a proper sentence.
5596,This is a certified reddit moment
5597,"I took a philosophy class on discord and since the professor actually knew what he was doing with it, there were significantly less problems then those who chose other options"
5598,Well it was for the video participants. I don't know if they ever had a limit on non-video participants.
5599,My anthropology class is all on discord. The professor is like 70+ years old so I was a little surprised that she knew what discord was and how to use it. I asked her and she said that she has been using it for years because she is a guild leader on World of Warcraft. I honestly think that‚Äôs so freaking cool.
5600,"Yeah, I had a course that started on zoom/canvas and switched to discord because the conference call and streaming features worked way better."
5601,You are paying tech fees for Canvas or Blackboard. Using the platform the school has adopted should be mandatory
5602,"My brother goes to one of the best public universities in the nation, and his whole program has a discord that professors use to help students."
5603,like 10 to 25 i think.
5604,Chemistry professor. I own a Discord server and have for years. Play TTRPGs on it with my gaming group that's been together since 2013.
5605,"I had a class that was pretty much entirely over discord last semester once everything went online. It made communication way easier, I honestly wish some of my classes this semester had the same setup"
5606,I go to Berkeley and we had an online graduation in Minecraft for seniors in 2020 and our data structures class uses edstem (a modern piazza) along with discord. Our lectures are also streamed through twitch (from zoom)  but discord especially has been very well organized and Professor Hug here definitely deserves his ratings as a great professor
5607,"> philosophy class on discord

Imagine my disappointment when I realized you meant the class used Discord and not that the class was about the philosophy of Discord"
5608,That sucks. All my classes use d2l and then my one course also has a google classroom so it sounds like I got lucky.
5609,"Wow couldn‚Äôt even get an A in Ballroom Dance?! Just drop out. 

/s great job **wo**man "
5610,"Well if your in engineering, above a 3.0 is actually pretty solid"
5611,"To be completely honest, if that class had a letter grade it would be one my lowest. I feel bad for every single one of my dance partners. So many bruised toes. At one point the instructor said, ‚Äúyou know, you‚Äôre almost okay at this dance.‚Äù She meant it with love though, she was a massive hardass. 

Also, I‚Äôm a woman :) "
5612,"Thats amazing! Congratulations, I have yet to achieve a straight A semester. This is an amazing way to start off your college career, since your GPA is nearly a 4.0 you have some leeway in the future to do poorly in a class or two and still be in the green. Let this fuel you to be motivated for the upcoming semesters!"
5613,"Tibi gratias! 
Honestly, I love Latin but the class was an 8:30 with a dull professor, so my performance was subpar haha. "
5614,"I‚Äôm not, lol I‚Äôm poly sci so not good"
5615,Congratulations! I know how amazing it feels. I walked out of high school with a 1.93 cGPA. My mom passed away my freshman year and i bounced around from house to house and had a really rough time with school. I finished my first semester of college with a 3.1 GPA. i honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it. 
5616,take some philosophy classes to boost that gpa
5617,"Latin was fun. I took it all 4 years in high school and now as a junior in college, I miss it so much. Except Latin 2. Never EVER again.  Not to discourage you if you are going to continue because it was 100% worth it, especially as a STEM major. And a B in Latin is an A in my heart :)"
5618,Lol im also taking dance classes at college since we couldn't afford thwm for child me and its hard but still fun! I took modern and ballet so far with this semester being a technique class combining both. Stick with it!
5619,Poly Sci gang
5620,Thank you so much! I‚Äôm definitely banking on these balancing me out for when I take my math requirement haha. 
5621,"What's your major? I am not much for politics so those political/history sort of classes you took aren't my cup of tea lol. The Phil+Latin class would be up my alley, however."
5622,"I‚Äôm double majoring in politics and philosophy. I took Latin because it filled a requirement, but also because I took it in high school and love ancient history. "
5623,"4 is the number of credits, not the GPA. My gpa isn‚Äôt in the screenshot, but it‚Äôs a 3.875. "
5624,"90-100% is A is 4.
80-89.9% is B is 3.
70-79% is C is 2.
60-69% is D is 1.
<50% is F is 0.

3.0 means B average. I think that's pretty good.

I think what the other commenter is saying is:

> It's good, but not uncommon. If the major area of study is not an area in demand, or is an ""easy"" (liberal arts) degree, the student should at least have a high GPA to help set them apart from all the other B-students with degress that say only ""I went to college"""
5625,you take such cool classes! wish my schedule looked like that 
5626,"Honestly, the key for me was studying things that I‚Äôm passionate about. Being from a low income background I understand the desire to get a major that will automatically lead to a high paying job. However, if your passion isn‚Äôt engineering or accounting there are other steps to take in college to ensure you‚Äôll have a career on the other end. You won‚Äôt do well in things you hate. Doing readings and writing papers isn‚Äôt a miserable chore if you like the subject matter. 

My secondary advice is participate in class a lot and go to office hours, so the professor knows you and can help you succeed. Also never skip class. My one B is the result of habitually not showing up because the class was boring and early in the morning. 

Also there is no one path to success. My girlfriend is a hyper organized type A person, who takes notes in five different colors and reads every page she‚Äôs assigned. I‚Äôm extremely disorganized and a massive procrastinator. We have virtually identical GPAs. Don‚Äôt let other people psych you out of doing well, because you have a different learning style. "
5627,"I had a friend like this.
He barely graduated high school and went to medical school (in my country you go directly after high school, everyone is admitted but the first year is very selective, only 9% of all students pass it and you only have two tries, also there was 2800 students).

Everyone thought he would fail because statistically only top high school students make it to the second year.
I think now he is on his 4th year of medical school. 

Congrats on turning it around ! Keep up the good job ! 
"
5628,"Hi! I‚Äôm OP‚Äôs gf that she referenced. She gave really good tips but here are some of mine (note that I‚Äôm a history major, but these are applicable to many fields, especially social sciences/humanities):

1) go to class. seriously. even if you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdoing anything important‚Äù you always are. it‚Äôs class. 
2) learn which readings you need to go over (perhaps more than once) in detail, what readings you should skim, and which you can skip. If you‚Äôre in a major like history, you won‚Äôt have time to do every page of the reading, so you need to figure out what‚Äôs most the important information for your time 
3) participate regularly, or at least enough that the professor knows who you are
4) try your best not to put thing off. Even if you‚Äôre someone who writes best at the last minute, try to think about a topic a few days ahead of time so you talk to your professor if you run into any problems
5) use the resources available to you! go to your writing center, study with a friend, or go to office hours. you don‚Äôt *always* need to do these things obviously, but doing them enough will make your work improve that much more
6) know yourself. Are you the kind of person who would browse the internet throughout all of your class if you won‚Äôt be caught? Are you someone who is better off studying in the morning, afternoon, or evening? And are you really going to be more motivated to do this work tomorrow? If you can answer all of those questions truly honestly and work best off of that, you‚Äôll do well"
5629,Me looking at how some schools at least in canada use a 9 point scale so I have no fucking clue how good 3.0 is.
5630,Ballroom dance!  Woaaaah now
5631,Thank you! Congrats to you too! I know how hard it is to deal with an insecure home environment and I‚Äôm always happy to see people work through it. 
5632,Makes perfect sense. Best of luck :)
5633,"I should really read the whole title lol. I thought it was one semester, not a year "
5634,"African American history was multicultural, my politics classes are social science, philosophy is humanities, and Latin is a language. "
5635,Congratulations! The thing about college is you choose what you want to study. Even the core required classes to some extent. For example I suck at math so I am substituting my math with a psychology course on data and research. It seems like a pain to have to learn all the basics in high school but once you are into college your entire schedule is curated around your interests.
5636,Polisci represent. Nice work OP
5637,I was barely a B student in high school and my college let me in because they let everyone in and I had good test score. I'm still barely a B student lol. The worst part is I intend to go to grad school with my shitty grades
5638,A year has 2 semesters and maybe a summer/intersession
5639,The way fall semester is looking #2 might be the only one applicable
5640,"Not a girl, but thought I would also chime in on one key rule of thumb. 

\-Trust your intuition. If something doesn't feel right with you, your location, and you feel you should get out...do it. Many times people go to a frame of mind thinking something can not or will not happen to them so they disregard that feeling in their stomach or the thought that passed their mind. It is best to listen to it and see why that feeling happened. This applies to men and women. 

Great list, and one that should be given to every individual!"
5641,"Number two should ideally be ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be alone with a stranger period‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel particularly safer if I am alone, even in the confines of my own home or apartment. 

Assaults can happen anywhere, and even innocuous gestures may be taken as an invitation to activities that one isn‚Äôt interested in."
5642,And you'll never know who does or doesn't have self-control until it's too late.
5643,"Can confirm, most college guys are indeed thirsty. Do not trust us. Don't trust anyone besides your close friends, and even then, make sure you truly know your friends."
5644,"I want to add about meeting someone from a dating app or website, just meet in public somewhere on campus. Whether it‚Äôs the local coffee shop or a park, it‚Äôs better than your housing because someone can still take advantage of you in that situation, especially if you are alone. It happened to someone on my campus last semester, they met someone online in their dorm room and were assaulted. Please stay safe."
5645,"Another tip: Always bring a drink with you in a plastic bottle that you can close. (I always did a low sugar Gatorade with some liquor to keep me hydrated and hangover free.) Also, at a bar you can take a napkin and put a straw through it to cover your drink- you may think it looks dumb, but it is always better to be safe than sorry. Many girls have come up to me and told me it was such a great idea. 

Stay safe, it is fucking ridiculous that girls need to do all this."
5646,"Optional: get yourself a self defense tool like a stun gun or pepper spray. Nowadays there are some that pretty discreet and compact!
Also learn a few self defense moves. Doesn‚Äôt hurt to know a few moves in case you ever find yourself in a tricky situation.

Edit: I would to add that most if not all colleges have various safety phone lines. Add them in your contacts or see if college give them out onto a freebie item (ex: my university gave out these phone pockets that have a list of some safety hotlines)"
5647,"You can also get the pepper spray that has dye in it, so when you spray someone with it they'll have a bunch of blue dye all over their face and its hard to get off. That way its easier to identify your assailant"
5648,"To add to #3. (This should be obvious) but don‚Äôt leave your drink unattended. Even if you need to go to the bathroom, bring it with you!"
5649,Why does being thirsty mean women should be wary? Someone can be thirsty and also have basic self control / understanding of consent.
5650,"Another tip - **Do not be afraid** to reach out to campus security - their job is to protect the campus, faculty, staff and most importantly the students. If **anything** happens - you see something suspicious (Campus police are all over that shit (or should be anyways)) - report it and document it **immediately**.

If you are not comfortable talking to campus security - talk to a trusted professor. They will help you.

Also, if you're scared to go somewhere - your car, class, dorm etc. - ask campus security to escort you (Not sure if every campus offers this but it is worth asking - they should do it everywhere) or go with a friend."
5651,"i know this is well-meaning, but it‚Äôs incredibly depressing to think that i have to be instructed not to trust my male friends. damn. society has really failed men at large in teaching them that masculinity is all about control over others."
5652,"Nobody should be going on tinder dates during fall semester anyways. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt have fun, but that‚Äôs just idiotic to do during a pandemic and is making it take longer for the rest of us. 

People who are going out to bars right now, or going on tinder dates, or even going to house parties just aren‚Äôt doing the right thing. period. Despite the fact that if you‚Äôre going to one of those right now it show a tremendous lack of self control and intelligence, what do you think it says about the guys doing those things.

Your post essentially alludes to not being able to trust *any* of your male friends, whether or not that‚Äôs good advice is debatable, but if that‚Äôs true, why are you going on tinder dates during a üí´ *fucking pandemic.* üí´"
5653,"I meant alone with another stranger, even in my own home. It‚Äôs a confined, private space sprawling with valuables, after all."
5654,wait how do u do that
5655,"You can also buy this thing called a NightCap! Its a little cover for your drink that has a straw hole in it, and the cover comes inside a scrunchie so you can carry it with you easily even if you don't have a bag/pockets! [Here's the link if anyone wants to check it out.](https://nightcapit.com/)"
5656,#3 is really emphasized this year for so many reasons
5657,"so sorry for the girls that these kinds of posts are necessary, please stay safe!!"
5658,Good one that should be added. Thank you
5659,\*abusive boyfriend or girlfriend
5660,"of course not all men are rapists or perpetrators of sexual assault. but the fact that i am being told by the previous commenter that in their experience, the risk of a male friend to commit assault in this particular scenario is such that they advise women in college to not be alone with them is upsetting. of course women can rape, and i‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs being recognized more as of late; i do hope that when we as a society recognize the event of female sexual predators we can change attitudes and encourage all genders to come forward about sexual assault by women. 

it‚Äôs not so much that i feel as though, because of the prevalence of rape on college campuses, that i cannot trust men at all, but rather that someone else‚Äôs experience has been that someone of my gender *should not* trust men, even those with which i am close that disturbs me. men don‚Äôt get told not to trust women if they‚Äôre alone together. regardless of the observed amount of female on male assault, the fact remains that most men don‚Äôt fear rape by women. again, it‚Äôs not to say this isn‚Äôt an issue, but that creating a less toxic portrait of traditional gender roles and reforming consent education to encompass all genders and relations would benefit everyone."
5661,"i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs sarcasm, but that is not true. Rape culture is just extremely infuriating and largely targeted against women. Men need to be just as careful, women can be abusive rapists as well."
5662,Gotta be honest are campus security really sucks. If I had a real problem i would call the police never them. I‚Äôm at a small school so it may be different at a big school.
5663,I have a hunch you‚Äôve never been to a party or hung out with girls before
5664,Go back to the incels subreddit
5665,"We notice more things than we are consciously aware of, and if something is off, it creates that gut feeling. Always. Trust. That. Feeling. 

I‚Äôve identified and avoided many bad situation and sketchy people with that feeling and its helped me stay safe."
5666,A girl at my university was raped and murdered just 4 years ago when she was leaving class to go back to her dorm (she was on campus the entire time). It doesn't hurt that much to take precautions if it could possibly save your life.
5667,"Dear college men, please don't rape women."
5668,"Also if you feel unsafe walking somewhere, you can get the app Noonlight. You press on the button the entire time you're walking to your destination and if you let go of it and don't enter your PIN in the allotted time it will notify the authorities of your location and I believe it will also notify your emergency contacts if you set that up in the app.

I honestly didn't use it too much this last year but it was still nice to have, since my dorm was pretty far from the central area of campus and there wasn't a lot of lighting.

And look into if your school has any sort of free/discounted ride service! Mine had a student run service where they would pick you up and drop you off anywhere on/near campus for free from 9pm-2am. They also had a deal with Lyft for off campus housing."
5669,"Are you certain there is no curve or anything along those lines which might even out the grade distribution? Sounds like this is a fairly common occurrence for this class, and I can‚Äôt see them aiming for a D average - especially if the majority of students completed all work well for the full semester."
5670,"The professor made it clear that he won‚Äôt curve. One student started a petition, but I‚Äôm not sure that will do anything. The final was apparently made to be difficult to prevent online cheating, so I guess this is a pretty new thing."
5671,"You‚Äôre getting a lot of bad advice that will work against the outcome you want. You go straight to the dean and they kick it down to Dept chair then the Dept is pissed you went over them. Just don‚Äôt do that yet. 

First, discuss this and document this with your professor. Get stuff in writing (email). Air your grievances with the grading and content but make sure to be respectful and kind in doing so. Anything else makes it very easy to write you off as a hysterical student and your legitimate case goes in a pile of cases that include students outright lying outrageous lies to get their way. 

Second, if that does not work, escalate to Dept chair. Explain it all methodically. If that does not work then it is time to visit the dean. Go they proper channels and work your way up. It will make you look reasonable and if your story and evidence remain consistent it will be more difficult to ignore you. 

Third, if nothing changes, file a grade grievance. It is in your uni‚Äôs OP. Build the case and explain without getting angry. 

I am sorry you are having to deal with this. It sounds stressful and unfair. Good luck."
5672,"The first thing you need to do is figure out what's actually happening. Otherwise you're just going to be groping around in the dark.

So for starters, why was the head of the department administering the final? Was this always the plan, or did he step in to do it?

What I'd guess is happening is that the department has standards for what is supposed to be covered in pre-calc, but your professor was falling far short of that. So, the department chair stepped in and gave an exam that would hold the class to the department's standards, but which the class was predictably unprepared for.

Again, just a guess, but it would explain why the professor isn't answering any e-mails as well."
5673,"This. A syllabus is a binding contract, of sorts. Always hang on to these, until you graduate. 

You may need them in the future if you ever transfer and need to petition for credit instead of having to retake a class. I had to do this when going from a quarter school to a semester school."
5674,"You can generally appeal grades through your school within the year you got them, much school allows students to contest grades they feel are unfair"
5675,"I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. Definitely keep trying things for now, but don‚Äôt be totally surprised if your final assigned grade is higher than you‚Äôre expecting. If you showed you were a top student all semester, and came out with one of the higher scores on the final, your professor may look on you favorably. I had a class which did not announce a curve (if anything, I was expecting to be curved *down*), but was pleasantly surprised on the date grades came out, and even made sure it was not a mistake. 

It‚Äôs possible your professor is avoiding confirming a curve because of the constant attention from students he would receive - those who may be on the edge of a certain grade, seeking to know their exact standing before grades come out, appealing their curved grade, etc. - all of which would be greatly decreased if he just assigns a grade. It‚Äôs also possible none at all is coming, in which case, again, I‚Äôm very sorry. My advice is to stay as professional as you can in any efforts to fix the situation. 

Even if things don‚Äôt go well, you will absolutely be fine.  Based on the level of effort you put in to earn your previous mark, you seem to be a good student and I‚Äôm sure you will do well in the future. And you‚Äôll have this story to tell if anyone asks about this specific class on your transcript. 

Sorry for a very long-winded reply, but I hope this may ease some of your anxieties about this. It‚Äôs totally natural to be stressed, but once there is nothing more you can do, it‚Äôs not worth your energy. Make sure you have explored every reasonable route your school offers, then try to direct that energy in a positive direction until your final grade is posted."
5676,"I had something similar happen to me six years ago in undergrad. We had a final exam with course books allowed, and apparently someone tried to cheat by writing a piece of information in their book. The professor failed the entire class and his argument was that he couldn‚Äôt be sure if anybody else cheated or not. We had to go and retake the exam in the middle of freaking July, exactly a month after the initial exam. Reported the fuck outta him, but even the dean said that he had some strong ties to people in power and there was nothing we could do about him. He also liked to use a lot of material from his students in his research papers, without giving any credits of course. Fun times..."
5677,"This was my first instinct as well. 

My other was that maybe there was a mix up with exams and you were given the wrong exam bub the proctor if they were given the wrong exam."
5678,This. Your university‚Äôs Dean of Students office will help you with this process.
5679,[deleted]
5680,How does making the final difficult and focus on material not covered in the course prevent online cheating? That's some of the dumbest shit I've heard from any professor.
5681,"He's not a math major, he's in precalc. I would expect a test in precalc to have a lot more questions with standard approaches, and a curve that's much more forgiving to the students."
5682,[deleted]
5683,"That‚Äôs a great point. Professor failed his class (literally) by taking it easy on them all semester and not teaching them the hard stuff. SMH. No ‚Äúgood‚Äù deed goes unpunished. 

* ‚Äúgood‚Äù is in parentheses because it was nice of him to give them easy stuff but in the long run by trying to help them out, it wasn‚Äôt so good"
5684,That would only make me *want* to cheat.

5686,"> A syllabus is a binding contract, of sorts

It's not a binding contract of any sort."
5687,"In this sub, I routinely see people talking about how ""great"" their professors are for cutting students breaks, but... in the long run, if you're not learning what you're supposed to be learning, the professor has done you no help."
5688,Talk about racist.
5689,It's a plan.
5690,"I‚Äôd find another school then.

5691,"Yeah that‚Äôs not a very credible source, plus it states a syllabus is intended to mimic a legal contract. A professor can tunfortunately do whatever they want within a course, and if they‚Äôre tenured, even gross incompetence  cant really save your grade. In OPs case, it seems either the Test was on something else which should be reviewed by faculty if it was a fair evaluation or the prof was teaching incorrectly (unlikely but it happens) and the test was on precalc but you learned trigonometry or something like that"
5692,"I would contact the dean without a doubt. If an ENTIRE class failed the final then something was terribly wrong with that test. I recall in my school if that ever occurred the department would pop a blood vessel and intervene. 

If you went for a 99% to the 70s, imagine people with low 90s, or in the 80s or were passing. That‚Äôs pretty much majority of the class failing."
5693,That is exactly the case.
5694,"Lol, in the graduate class that I dropped earlier this semester, the professor switched up the grading composition to 45% for the Final Exam midway through the semester. A lot of students had cheated on his weekly quizzes, so he decided to address this issue by raising the value of the Final Exam. Sure, a genius plan. This class is also considered to be the hardest in the department. Also, he does not curve."
5695,"As an Asian myself I've always found this statement funny and not quite ""conventionally racist"", *but* the only part where I feel offended - stereotyped, archetyped, at that - is when everyone starts using the merit of ""being Asian"" to automatically negate the fact that any hard work or application of ""innate intellect"" was put into getting achieving well.

Yes, intelligence plays a roll into it, but more often than not I would think that something of the ""Musk rule"" does as well - to aim to achieve what takes 10 years in 2, ultimately achieving 5/10 years, which is 3 years greater than that standard pace nonetheless.

A neurotypical Indian student versus a neurotypical, say, American student, mostly have different expectations and/or achievements per their national educational quota but because of that ""Musk rule"", more often than not, not being able to get a seat in a prestigious Indian Tech Institute still means that that individual has an understanding of Sophomore-level Physics/Maths during their later years of high school as compared to the American student of similar intellect. The tradeoff, however, is being a ""less well-rounded student""."
5696,"Sure, but it's not a binding contract or anything like that."
5697,"Plans can change. Every syllabus I‚Äôve ever written has included ‚ÄúThis syllabus may change at my discretion‚Äù at the bottom. I don‚Äôt want to change the syllabus. I want everyone to know what the class is going to look like from the start. But there are exceptional circumstances that require things to change and I‚Äôm not about to ask the students if it‚Äôs ok to change things. I will change it by my judgment from over a decade of teaching. I‚Äôm not out to screw anyone over grades and I don‚Äôt want anyone to be in the position of ‚Äúwell I would have passed if only Professor shellexyz hadn‚Äôt whatevered!‚Äù But when things have to change, they will."

5730,"I have a professor who has over 100 items in one folder, one who changed the way we were taking the final three times in the 24 hours leading up to it, and another one who locks materials at the end of the week and has just deleted everything off of d2l DURING FINALS WEEK. Having everything organized and predictable is a fucking godsend."
5731,"It's very bizarre reading some of the posts in this Subreddit.  In my classes I have lecture videos posted for every topic, I have instructions posted for every assignment, I grade all assignments within one week, I post an announcement every week, and I respond to emails within 24 hours.  My professor friends I'm in closest contact with are doing the same things, so I wouldn't consider my teaching as going above and beyond.  Then I log on here and see horror story after horror story.

I assume part of the issue is survivorship bias (if that's the right term), because we don't hear as much from the students who have good classes.  In some cases I'm sure there's also a dose of hyperbole in the stories.  But due to the sheer volume of posts I see about bad classes, I have to conclude that a decent number of professors aren't doing well at online teaching.  It's very frustrating to see, and I know it's even worse for the students in those classes."
5732,"For most of my classes, a fuckton. Announcements on Blackboard two to three times a week, emails at least once a week, GroupMe messages almost every fucking day. Notifications don‚Äôt even register in my brain anymore. It‚Äôs kind of overkill at this point. I think a once a week email detailing what is due that week is plenty as long as you are accessible for further questions."
5733,Sometimes it is that bad. Many refuse to respond to emails and lots of other things. When we have profs who care about the students it is like a gift from heaven. So thanks for being a great professor!
5734,"> deleted everything off of d2l during finals week

Excuse me, what the fuck???"
5735,"Yeah, certainly, people don't feel the same emotional urge to spell out in-detail what's happening in their 'meh' classes or even their pretty good classes.

And my professor friends tell me they do basically the same thing you and your pals are doing. So this was a surprise to me too.

What's probably happening is there's some segment of our profession that was never very good at teaching to begin with, and putting them online with all the uncertainty that being online adds has just made that worse."
5736,"Okay, and see that's what I thought was actually happening, and I was trying to hold back from burying students in emails. Good to know once a week is about on-target. Thanks!"
5737,"As an adult (42) sophmore in computer engineering, I cannot emphasize enough how amazing it is when professors organize their Canvas material. Since I download most of the files to my OneDrive, it's even better when the professors have a consistent filename nomenclature.

My schedule is a damn nightmare trying to work full-time, attend university 16-18 hours, and not completely ignore my wife and kids, so when I have to hunt the material on Canvas, or spend time renaming files so that they're easier to locate later, I'm losing time which impacts my grade."
5738,all of that mess just for college algebra?? that‚Äôs insane. like I get the summer was kind of a whirlwind but that‚Äôs just messed up
5739,I mean it doesn‚Äôt make a difference because it was all locked anyway but yeah. This is the same guy who‚Äôs threatened to drop 10% of your grade for an unexcused absence. Surprisingly nice enough while teaching but his policies are shit.
5740,"I am gettin no help from the professors in my course. They‚Äôre all just phoning it in and refuse to stop for questions. There is no guidance, I‚Äôve learned nothing this semester, and I am desperately just trying to pass. I am adrift without any help, and any time i try and bring that I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in the class I‚Äôm told that it‚Äôs apparently my fault, even though i‚Äôm doing everything i‚Äôm told."
5741,"By and large? Fuck all. If its late at night? I get it. If its the weekend? I get it! But if its 8am in the morning and I dont hear from you for a week on how much this assignment that you just added is weighted because its not reflected in the syllabus? No, I dont get that shit."
5742,[deleted]
5743,I just want to say that is a whole-ass *schedule* and I rly hope you‚Äôre able to make it all work going forward
5744,I had a professor like that as well. The guy literally automated the entire course through email.
5745,"I think you're right that some professors really aren't good teachers, and online teaching exposes that.  I also think it could be a generational thing.  I would consider myself a younger professor, and for similarly-aged folks in my field it is normal to have taught online before.  When I was on the market, many of the job ads asked for online teaching experience.  I do have older colleagues who've taught online, but that isn't as common."
5746,"On average, next to none. My current two professors actually cared and posted videos!! finally!!  but this year over 3 spring courses, 5 summer courses, and 2 fall courses I've had next to no communication or even lectures (prerecorded or zoom) with the instructors."
5747,"I had a concussion earlier in the year that put me out of school for about two weeks. I sent a professor the documentation from my school's health center that I put off school for a couple days, and the explanation of how it hurt my brain to look at a computer screen. It was a very professional and well worded email. All I asked was for a two day extension on a singlr homework assignment. He sent a one line response that said, ""The assignment has been open for a week, so no."" He essentially implied i should have done it before I got my concussion. I did it that night crying from the pain from my headache. You have no idea how bad some of these professors are doing."
5748,"You might check your college‚Äôs policies and regulations. I know some have restrictions on when changes can be made to finals, e.g., https://catalog.gatech.edu/policies/grading-gpa/examination-term-grades/"
5749,I was in a graduate level analytical chemistry course by someone in the top of the field and he responded to email within a day
5750,Piss poor.
5751,"Lol, having lurked there for awhile, these are people attentive enough to teaching to care. They are (mostly) I would bet, not the problem.

I'm sure they'd fly into an even bigger tizzy than students because they're imagining that one guy in the department they all hate who they know has been phoning it in for years, and with whom they're still pissed off about the Great Student Club Bake Sale Fiasco of '07."
5752,deadass all he gave us was one zoom link for class at the beginning of the semester and he doesn‚Äôt even really lecture. he just monologues and sometimes types in the chat
5753,"It's insane, I wouldn't recommend it. I took my last final yesterday evening from 7:00-10:00 and I bombed it. I was exhausted and it just wasn't clicking. I kind of want to give a good old grown man cry sometimes.

But, my university has a 4+1 Master's program and that's what I'm striving for. I can't say that I'll make it, but I'm giving it all that I've got.

Also, my wife is phenomenol. Without her managing the household predominantly, I couldn't keep the pace I'm currently struggling with."
5754,"I had a professor that literally didn‚Äôt know how to use blackboard

He was going to open a unit back up and I checked and it wasn‚Äôt there so I emailed him. 

The dude emails me back saying it‚Äôs there and then I send screenshots and he tells me to take it to tech services even though opening units is on his end."
5755,[deleted]
5756,"I had a professor I never saw or heard from a single time this entire semester. They made exactly zero content. No lectures, no videos, no slideshows, nothing. It was statistics and all I did was read from the textbook and take exams. I got an A but I learned nothing. It was pretty disappointing not gonna lie. My other two professors were fantastic and made my semester enjoyable despite difficult classes (o chem and plant biology). I appreciate them more than they know."
5757,Mine was asynchronous so all he would do is send notes and assessments and you would have to email back the right answers in the right format or else you‚Äôd be wrong because he set up a bot to grade the assessments
5758,Actually many of us professors are doing pretty awesome and trying really hard and we too get really pissed when we hear about the shitty ones. I believe that a majority of professors really do care and are trying their best.
5759,It‚Äôs literally the same feeling though! Same with closing all of the research tabs.
5760,"I love closing all of my tabs at the end of the quarter, sooo good!"
5761,It‚Äôs grad school so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs on the short end of things. I‚Äôm writing about the impacts of working from home (while working from home - it‚Äôs killing me a bit).
5762,"Oh yes, totally! For me there‚Äôs also like an actual feeling of weight being lifted when I can finally close all 20 tabs I have open when doing research for a paper. Or when I can delete all the random stuff I end up downloading throughout the semester."
5763,I‚Äôm a tab whore. Six windows all of them with 15+ tabs. Hitting those x‚Äôs feels better than sex.
5764,Just closed all my tabs for my English final essay and I'm probably fucked for that class because I submitted it like a week late but it's so cathartic finally submitting it and closing the tabs. (It shouldn't have taken this long - it was only two pages - but I kept pushing it off)
5765,100+ page???? THATS INSANE? What‚Äôs the major? :D
5766,"Not effective-click but my master thesis was 200 pages including appendix (lots and lots and lots of figures!), bibiliogrphy, list of tables/figures, all double spaced. 

It adds up quickly and you're in triple digits before you know it haha."
5767,"You should make it a case study.

""u/Effective-Click8952: A Case Study on Working From Home"""
5768,"Short End? Dang the longest essay I've ever written was 12 pages, but I'm in high school. Is the 100 pages double spaced, does it include sources page, etc?"
5769,"The 100 pages is just writing of the main body. So not including preface, abstract, title pages, bibliography, appendix, etc. it‚Äôll be closer to 200 with all of those things added."
5770,"LETS GOO OP!!! YOU FUCKING GOT THIS FAM JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE !!!! 

Fr I'm excited for you just by reading this, best of luck completing it and fucking kill it in the remainder of your studies :D"
5771,Right there with ya. Such a satisfying feeling.
5772,Finishing up mines right now üòÇ it‚Äôs a literature paper on Shakespeare
5773,Seriously it‚Äôs like a bunch of 20ish page essays that make up each chapter so it‚Äôs not too bad.
5774,"Yeah, after finishing my undergraduate thesis I closed like 8 word tabs and 3 separate chrome browsers with a solid 50 tabs each and it was incredible"
5775,Another one for me is mass-deleting emails from my classes at the end of a quarter.
5776,"See I wasn't actually saying, ""you don't know how to use file systems"" 

I was saying, ""A few years ago I literally didn't know how they worked."""
5777,"The most satisfying this is closing over 30 tabs you had open to write the paper. No matter how short the paper is, I always have to do outside research üò©"
5778,"I use to do that when I was in my early 20's and I didn't really understand how file systems work. Back then I used a mac because it was simple.

But starting in my mid 20's, I took a vocational education course on how to properly use windows 10 in an office setting (its also how I learned windows 10.)

And I just never stopped using the principals they taught me. (and this is against them.)

You are in college now, so don't really worry about this. Worry about the great migration.

But keep in mind that if you work in an office (or school), an ENORMOUS amount of your work is going to be managing files.

And this would screw things up for people. 

(In work, other people need to access your files and figure out what you were doing, so its better to treat them like paper in a filing cabinet. Take them out, use them, then put them back)"
5779,It‚Äôs the best thing ever! It feels very satisfying
5780,"You aren't doing anything wrong now. The file is only for you.

If you are on a shared network or something, you should close MS office files when you don't use them. It can prevent other people from accessing them or getting the updated version.

I also personally found that I would leave the documents open because I wasn't good at navigating to where I saved them. Thats why I wrote the bit about the class."
5781,"lol I just keep it open because it's easier to access that way, plus it reminds me to do it. If I see the word icon on my taskbar it's easier for me to remember that I need to do an essay."
5782,"I'm more of a, quit the entire app all at once guy"
5783,"I'm in the same boat. I've had my thesis open for months, and it's also past 100 pages. 

But yeah, a thesis is a collection of papers of various lengths. An introduction, a literature review, a methods explanation, a findings explanation, and a discussion about how your results contribute to current scholarship. 

Once you've spent months (or years) working  on a single project, it's really not that hard to write that much. A genuine term paper is often 20 or more pages, right? Well, I've been building to my thesis for almost two years now. That's like four semesters plus summer semesters. I've got a lot to say. 

That's not to take anything away from a thesis. Theses are huge undertakings, and mine is the biggest and most complicated thing I have ever done. But if you've done a good job up to the point of beginning writing, the actual writing shouldn't be that big of a deal."
5784,"Imagine if you went to submit, only for the instructor to bounce the paper back.

""Sorry, this isn't long enough, I asked for 500 pages of 8 point font. Please have it back to me by end of day tomorrow."""
5785,"Me too, seriously. Day in, day out at the laptop"
5786,"Not the longest actually, 53 pages including references, of which there were a solid 50 hence all the chrome tabs, and appendices"
5787,In my field the dissertation is regularly around 250 pages
5788,12 days? I only keep it open for a day... Because it's due the next day.
5789,I do my best even when i hate it
5790,I'm pretty certain I had at least one that said at least a 50 on the final was a requirement for passing
5791,"A lot of classes say you must get a certain percentage on the final to pass regardless of your overall grade. Good piece of advice, some people need this reminder."
5792,"I disagree with ""you deprive yourself of an important educational tool"". I've never gotten a final exam back so I don't know what I got wrong and therefore cannot go back and use it as a study aid. Also once the final is done, my grade is locked in anyway. The focus should be to pass all your classes. If you can pass without the final, focus on another class that you may have less comprehension on."
5793,Most of my math classes required at least a 55 on every exam
5794,Honestly tho. I truly don‚Äôt understand how someone can be okay not trying at all. You don‚Äôt have to like it but just do it. The effort you put in reflects back on you as a person
5795,"Yeah, in most of my classes, if not all, this has been the norm. I don't get why you would skip. The least you can do is fill in random answers and turn it in a minute into the exam. What's driving to school just one more day? You've done it all semester."
5796,"That isn‚Äôt just burning a future letter of rec bridge, it‚Äôs napalming it."
5797,"That‚Äôs facile. Reddit is dumb and a waste of time, but here we are."
5798,I unintentionally skipped my Physics final twice (neither one my fault). Also managed to come in halfway through two Chem exams (both of them my fault lol).
5799,You have a lot to improve in regards to your emotional maturity. Good luck
5800,You might consider taking the final anyway so you'll know the kinds of questions and which topics are on it for when you retake the class.
5801,"Idk, planning to skip my math final. I already failed. Can take again next sem and they‚Äôll replace my old grade with new one."
5802,Office hours after finals do not exist
5803,"I say this with discretion, but honestly there's times where it's alright to skip an exam. For example, this semester in my economics class, my professor drops the lowest exam grade (including the cumulative final). So I did really well on 3/4 exams and scored above marks and ended with a 100 in the class. So there's no point going above and beyond on a final since I already have the highest grade possible. I say this with discretion because this is rare but I think it's good to point out that NEVER is a hard word."
5804,"You should have a pretty good idea how well you comprehend the material based on how hard you thought the exam was, regardless of whether you see your final grade or not"
5805,I skip them if the lowest exam score is dropped and I know I won‚Äôt beat out my previous low score or if my lowest score is high enough for me to keep my A.
5806,That much is obvious. Now tell me how I use that information to improve my learning
5807,Yall both sound like some educational tools ^/jk
5808,"I guess that would depend on your definition of tool.  To me, feedback is a tool"
5809,"Well Physics not initially, had to retake the final over the summer. They were nice enough to let me the class for free though. 
Somehow managed to pass Chem even with the misses."
5810,"I was just talking with my therapist about this yesterday. I'm the type that doesn't miss something I promised I'd be at, and is always 10 minutes early. I also happen to be bipolar.

Have you lost a pet before? Imagine waking up feeling like you just lost a dog or cat that you've had for 10 years. But now imagine that your life is going great, and there is no reason for you to feel like this. This adds another layer of ""Why is this happening"" that makes it even harder to handle.

For me personally, the ""inner critic"" becomes my main voice. ""Why the fuck are you such a lazy piece of shit? Sleeping for 15 hours isn't going to do anything for you"" yet I can't do anything but lay there. The energy level is so low I can't even get up to make myself a cup of noodle so I don't eat, leading to more problems.

This is just the beginning and a very small example of how it starts for me. In lucky. Because usually my episodes don't last *too* long... but waking up in tears for literally no reason and not being able to stop crying, again for no reason, takes a toll on a person even if outwardly they appear fine."
5811,That sounds super annoying. The problem of students asking questions about things that are literally right there in the syllabus was something I thought would fizzle out after my freshman year but I‚Äôm a senior now and it‚Äôs still rampant in my 4000 level courses. I don‚Äôt understand if people are legitimately stupid or just lazy. Laziness is an especially terrible excuse in the age of control F.
5812,We are required to show up for final exams even if we don't have a final. If there is no exam we sit there for two hours and work on any past due assignments or projects. It's kind of silly but that's how my college does it. You have to show up for the two hour final period but they could care less what we do in that time. Most of my professors give us final projects instead of final exams.
5813,"My son's professor literally told him not to come for the final because his grades were good enough and he drops the lowest anyway. He told my son he never tells students not to come, but there really is no point for him to show up. Obviously there is no requirement to show up for the final. It's great because he commutes so it saves him a lot of hassle and time."
5814,"Lol if you already failed just skip it, it serves no purpose.

I might get dropped from a class cause of absences (depression hit and it was online and just easy to ignore) but the teacher is still considering since I completed every single assignment- but in case I am dropped I‚Äôm not touching a single assignment until I get the news on Thursday. 

Either way I‚Äôll just retake it, I don‚Äôt mind."
5815,why are you even on this sub
5816,FYI your old grade will still be on your transcript. The only thing that changes with retaking courses is that the first attempt isn‚Äôt used when calculating GPA.
5817,"Dude, the questions on the final are valuable. Get as familiar with the test as you can. You'll be taking it again."
5818,Well done exams absolutely can be very instructional.
5819,"Fucking yes, I‚Äôm literally teaching myself and I can‚Äôt stand it. The big problem in my opinion is the shitty school website I use, teachers can customize way too much of it, and this leads to every class having a different layout, and no easy or consolidated way to find all the work I need to do. So for example, one class has a ‚ÄúHomework‚Äù tab, where the teacher posts all the homework due, but a different class has all the homework in Lessons -> Week x -> Homework. This leads to me having to basically search through EVERY class site in order to find the work I need to do, it‚Äôs infuriating and I‚Äôm genuinely terrified I‚Äôm missing shit every day.

I wish it was all just the same, every teacher would get a website with the same basic layout, and they‚Äôd put all the homework in the Homework tab, all the quizzes in a Quiz tab, all the tests in a test tab, etc."
5820,"Honestly, any concerns you have about this semester are entirely valid. Nobody in college right now has taken classes amid a global pandemic, recession, and climate crisis happening all at once. Even if classes were delivered in the exact same way as last fall, things would still feel different and more challenging. Don't be so hard on yourself.

If it makes you feel any better, I'm having similar issues. My lectures have been okay, but my professors have been bombarding me with Zoom links, Google Drive folders, and assignment files, and it's definitely been more difficult for me to be organized and feel 'on top' of things.

What's been helpful for me is connecting with classmates. I'm part of a Discord server and GroupMe chat for one of my classes, and many people in them are just as lost and overwhelmed as I am. You're definitely not alone."
5821,I‚Äôm currently taking 4 courses and they‚Äôre all 8am online classes. I oversleep through most of the zoom lectures and I could tell my professors are slowly giving up. Online classes are the worst lol
5822,God yes so many tabs and sites to keep track of!
5823,"My professor just keeps trying to make an online class the same as physical classes and I think that's what making it so difficult for me. But he keeps trying anyways, trying to adapt to this new age"
5824,And your sanity too looks like it
5825,[deleted]
5826,"My school has the layout problem PLUS we use canvas, blackboard, and Moodle. I have to check canvas and BB for my classes, and navigate each one differently like you said. Some are ‚Äúassignments,‚Äù some are ‚Äúcourse outline,‚Äù some are ‚Äúweek 3 module.‚Äù Plus McGraw hill, Pearson, cengage, all those websites they use for homework. It sucks. Just checking to see my assignments for the upcoming week takes forever."
5827,I feel like my professors are compensating for not having normal classes by giving more work than usual plus homework and it‚Äôs been killing me especially since I‚Äôm a senior now.
5828,Group me‚Äôs have been super solid for remembering to turn stuff in and prepare for exams
5829,"This is what happens when teachers who aren‚Äôt taught how to teach online classes try to do, and it doesn‚Äôt work. Next semester if you‚Äôre still doing online learning, if possible, check to see if your professors have taught online classes pre-COVID, whether that‚Äôd be seeing if they‚Äôre an adjunct at a different school somewhere a ways away, or ask advisors if they know. The ‚Äúonline‚Äù classes that professors are teaching are not actual online classes, and they‚Äôre trying- and failing- to copy the exact class format for in-person to online.

If you can, try to get in contact with some of your classmates to try and reason with him and explain your concerns. There‚Äôs power with the masses."
5830,"My university faculty admitted that they‚Äôre front-loading the semester so if we‚Äôre sent home again, they can let us kind of ride out the semester since we‚Äôll have had so many assignments already"
5831,We use canvas and some of my prof use the assignment tabs and others all the assignments are under the modules and others are under syllabus lmao its so unorganized
5832,"I was having almost this exact same problem this last week. What I did was find a friend who had taken the class with the same teacher in a previous semester and asked if they would share the notes they took. That way, I have everything written down and can follow along with my prof's lectures without getting bogged down trying to take notes."
5833,"What could your professor be doing better, to try and not just try and make it a physical class?

I'm trying to think outside the box for my own courses, and it's tricky for all of us. Many instructors have zero experience with online pedagogy. Please bear with us!"
5834,"It baffles me that professors are assigning MORE work because it's an online course. I don't get this mindset. I think maybe the dinosaurs are having difficulty understanding how hard it is to juggle everything while also being stuck doing things at home. 

This makes me feel a bit better. My course is set up just like your prof's, except I don't do weekly discussions. There are more written components, because I can't have students leaving my first year social sciences class without knowing how to compose a basic argument and find sources.

That said, I'm making sure that they have the tools they need to do these things (having a librarian give a talk, opening up lines of communication with our subject librarian, having a Discord server so they can ping me and talk to one another, etc).

I had my class take a vote via Zoom poll on Wednesday, and to my expectation, the vast majority wanted entirely synchronous classes. So that's what we're doing. With recordings uploaded afterward, of course--I wouldn't expect everyone to stick to the same schedule.

I hope that as a collective this forces academia to engage in some critical self reflection. However, for all the theorizing that goes on in the academy, precious little of it is oriented towards the student experience and pedagogy. Best of luck with your term!"
5835,"YES! Like omg can‚Äôt we all just use canvas or something! I have 3 classes on canvas, 1 on blackboard, 1 on moodle, and one teacher who EMAILS us our freaking material! Those are just the base platforms too. That‚Äôs not counting all the sites they have us use and branch off of to find all kinds of other assignments. It‚Äôs so hard to keep track of. You‚Äôre right everything is set up so differently for all the classes it‚Äôs so hard to keep track of where everything is and where to find the actual assignments!!"
5836,"Online classes have been around for many years and for some reason a lot of college teachers refused to adopt that model. It used to be mandatory for online teachers to build their courses in a similar manner and the schools offered trainings to teach them how to do it. 

I‚Äôve taken several over the years at different schools and they all looked almost the same: most work due on a single day of the week (Monday by 8am was popular and so was Friday by midnight). The best classes kept two modules open at a time so we could work ahead. Usually there was a weekly quiz, a discussion post/response, two midterms, a final, and a paper. Each module had a lecture of some sort, assigned reading and any other materials were included in the module. It was all so simple.

I don‚Äôt know why more teachers didn‚Äôt just go that route. Synchronous lectures are stupid. Students should be able to ‚Äúattend‚Äù on Zoom if they want to discuss the material or ask questions but there is no reason for it"
5837,"that‚Äôs pretty similar to how mine are going :)

it fucking sucks"
5838,"From the number of posts I've seen like this it seems like this semester/school year is going to be a wakeup call to both higher education and k-12 about not only the technology they are requiring instructors and students to use as well as a wakeup call about the technology skills of their instructors.

All I can say is fill out the evaluation at the end of the semester and make sure you are honest on it."
5839,"Yup. My professor is old and can‚Äôt utilize tech well. At first, he refused to screen share at all. So he‚Äôd print out the PowerPoint and lecture off of there. Then people complained, so now he screenshares the PowerPoint occasionally. 

But most of the class is doing examples, and he refuses to show work. Like he‚Äôll verbally go through problems without writing them down, which is how most people learn things involving numbers. Instead of writing it out, he‚Äôll just say ‚Äú500,000 times 10% times 6 years.‚Äù If you miss him saying one number, you basically miss the entire problem. You can‚Äôt keep up. But it‚Äôs too much work for him to write on a piece of paper in real time ‚Äú$500k x 10% x 6 years‚Äù. He has us keep our video off, so now I just turn on the zoom meeting and go do something else. At least that way it‚Äôs not a complete waste of time. I don‚Äôt learn in that class anyways."
5840,"I think part of it is feeling like everything we have to do is homework (I mean it is technically if your all online). Like usual it's a couple hours of classes where you do the learning than some hours of hw to really get it down/ do projects. Now it's just all hw it's so tedious especially if your boxed into your dorm all day like me. 
Good luck though"
5841,"1.	 Not everyone has acclimated or is especially disposed to learning or teaching in the online format. 
2.	elevated stress and unique circumstances are inevitably going to give a bias towards thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs more work‚Äù. 
3.	without scheduled class time, it takes a lot of self management and commitment. As a result, that creates more work just in figuring out how to manage time. 

I‚Äôve noticed that even though I‚Äôm assigning the same quantity of work, and same or easier level of difficulty on tests, students are saying the workload is more. 

I think we are used to dividing up ‚Äúgoing to class‚Äù from ‚Äúdoing homework‚Äù. So when everything falls into the home work category now, it feels like work has doubled. I, sure many students, especially in lectures, were accustomed to passively sitting in class. Having to set a time to watch videos isn‚Äôt the same, and in a way can be more difficult to stay engaged. 

Also, classes often inherently get more difficult as one progresses in college. So a lot of sophomores or juniors probably are taking harder classes than last year, but that would have been the case anyway. So the virus and online learning isn‚Äôt to blame.  Unlike faculty teaching, students don‚Äôt have a large sample of years in college to draw from for reference."
5842,"Same! My professors can‚Äôt even keep up with their own lectures. I‚Äôve been getting assigned powerpoints with hundreds of slides for each class. My two video lectures are just them reading off said powerpoint as slow as they can, or getting caught up with questions in the chat. My other online classes don‚Äôt even follow a schedule, due dates are wrong, professors are assigning homework that starts and is due a day that the original classes weren‚Äôt even signed up for. I have work those days. It‚Äôs all so difficult to keep track with and my professors don‚Äôt even email back."
5843,"I have a professor who‚Äôs answer to every email I sent is, ‚Äú GeT wItH yOuR sTuDy bUdDy‚Äù even though the website says contact professor to unlock/release report. He won‚Äôt acknowledge the issue till the day of the lecture which is once a week. So yea it‚Äôs more annoying than hard, I apologize for the rant."
5844,"Try bookmarking every useful page you need under a new folder just for that class c

For example make a bookmark folder titled ‚ÄúEnglish 101‚Äù and bookmark every relevant page for that class in that folder.  

This way you never need to navigate the site again, just open the bookmark."
5845,"I wish I could do that but it seems like the last semester this Professor has taught in general was Spring term. The term when all this started üò¢

So glad you found a solution tho!!!"
5846,An online class over email?  That‚Äôs rough.
5847,"I have been looking for a post like this for the past 3 days and I found none, which led me to the conclusion that I was overreacting and being a lazy bum. It has been a real hassle to keep up with even individual assignments, let alone group work this semester.

Some of these subjects and projects just don't translate as well virtually as they would in a physical lecture, imo and it doesn't help that the online resources are ALL over the place. I'm particularly worried about the fact that we aren't having any breaks this year, so there will be no chance to ""reset,"" which is going to make this semester even more challenging than previous ones. And I swear that professors are assigning more work to make up for the lack of face-to-face interactions. 

I hope and pray that I'll be able to catch up soon and everything will end up being okay, but navigating through the storm that is this semester has definitely been a difficult process."

5850,"If he deducted a point from a traditional term paper for missing a period, then I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs being fair. But the casualness of an online discussion post should allow for the occasional punctuation mistake and/or grammatical error."
5851,Sent from my iPhone
5852,"Typos happen, even after you proof read sometimes. I doubt missing a period is enough to totally throw off the meaning of an important message. Meanwhile, I've had papers graded where the professor themselves missed bad spelling or grammatical mistakes I caught after the fact. Also most of my ""professors"" have been lecturers or assistant professors. Most tenured professors I've dealt with don't even give a damn."

5856,"Depends on the subject. If this is a writing class then sure. If this is like bio 101/sociology/psych, and the grammatical error didn't impede the message of the post, then this is dumb. Errors like a missing period don't mean anything. In real life, people look at your writing and say ""oh, gotcha there's supposed to be a _________ there""."

One time, in a math class, I answered a question, showed all my work, and at the end, circled ""3 = X"". 

I got 0 points for this question because I should have written ""X = 3"".

I'm still bitter about it."

5863,The implication of a discussion post is that it is a casual assignment. I get where this is coming from but a student shouldn‚Äôt be graded on punctuation for something that is not intended to be proof read

5866,"Perhaps, but she does this even without equation editors, and there is a preview before she submits. And she has never once typed in a sentence in the class forum without a typo or some weird caps/punctuation.


Weirdest prof ever. Pre-recorded four 2-hours lectures for the semester and that was all of our lessons, but they sped through the material so no one watched them. Quizzes were open note, take home, and she reused old questions that were available on her site, so it was essentially a free A."
5867,This is my greatest fear as a professor. üòÇ

5871,[deleted]
5872,"I fail to see why ""casual"" assignments (and I rather doubt that the distinction between casual and formal here exists anywhere other than in the student's perception) shouldn't still have an expectation of proper grammar usage. 

The prof making a mistake themselves doesn't negate the fact that the original post should have been correct. It just highlights that mistakes do indeed happen, and that it behooves people to check for them."

5875,False equivalence. Students have one post they have to work on while professors need to evaluate and leave feedback on at least 15 posts.
5876,"I am going to be the devil's advocate here for a minute. The professor has not much to lose from their grammatical mistakes or gain from their perfect grammar. They already have a stable, probably tenured, job at a respectable institution. You, on the other hand, paid for that class and should expect the utmost perfection in the professor's service to you. If this incident prevents you from missing a period at the end of a sentence in the future then it was totally worth it. This could potentially save you from miscommunicating something important in real life."

5878,How about people with Depression?... Cuz I have one... It's hard to function and thinking about suicide every day... Called the hotlines already It was bad.
5879,"Yeah aight, ig I‚Äôll start my hw. After my nap tho"
5880,"I‚Äôve been there, and I quickly realized that a lot of professors could care less. Unfortunately, I failed a chem class that semester that I later took when I was at a much better state mentally and scored a couple of 100%s on the same exams I previously failed. What I truly wish I had done was to not take classes that semester and try to figure out a way to relax and calm myself down. If that‚Äôs not an option, or if taking a break may put you at risk of never going back to college, another thing that truly helps is to take classes with friends or at least try to make some in class. I know it‚Äôs extremely difficult when you‚Äôre battling depression, but when you have someone you can rely on in class it makes it so much easier to go through with it and takes off some pressure. Wake up early and shower. Put on some positive music and only think of *this* moment . If you have a goal like graduating or traveling for example, make a mood board. I also found that journaling helps a ton when my mind is cluttered and I have no one else to talk to. The key is to do what you have to do *despite* the circumstances. It‚Äôs tricky with depression because I know there isn‚Äôt a barrier there physically but it can literally feel like it sometimes. You‚Äôve got this, so many people in academia suffer from depression and they accomplish great things. You can too. The key is to not make depression your identity because realistically you are so much more than your depression. Not to sound cheery or over simply depression because of course, one post won‚Äôt cure it but some of these methods have helped me in the past. If you‚Äôre seeing a professional that‚Äôs great and I hope you see improvement, but I know some people may not be able to afford that."
5881,"I‚Äôm on the same boat my friend, let‚Äôs be great and accomplish our goals! :)"
5882,"For me I think its less about me procrastinating on physical work and more procrastinating on learning. I just haven't liked sitting down and watching a video lecture, it just feels too long. My lectures for math are like 55 minutes and yet they still feel too long. 

That's not to say that I don't procrastinate on physical schoolwork, but I certainly think I procrastinate on learning more.

I've also found that I'm super inconsistent with what let's me focus. One day I was listening to some music and it helped me focus on an assignment. Next day I try listening to the music again, and its a distraction. I can't seem to find what works for me.

I'll also add that there are legitimate reasons to procrastinate: if I can, having fun first so I can be satisfied prevents me from being distracted of the thought of wanting to do something."
5883,Yeah it‚Äôs not about not being capable it‚Äôs about every fiber of my being wanting to do literally anything else
5884,"Let‚Äôs not perpetuate the idea that you can just ‚Äúget over‚Äù depression and recommend actual steps towards coping with depression, such as free university counseling!"
5885,"This person was asking about how to function in school with a challenge like depression, and all you offered was to ‚Äúget over depression‚Äù without actual ways to ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù Depression doesn‚Äôt equate to laziness."
5886,"I schedule time specifically for tasks and work to complete to help me stop procrastination and it really helps especially since I am someone with anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Keep a set time to work on tasks is perfect and keeping small manageable goals is best. I try to focus on the now, so I don‚Äôt cause myself unneeded stress or anxiety. Small manageable goals or baby steps. They add up and eventually you‚Äôll get there."
5887,"literally any thing else, even just laying in bed lmao"
5888,Lol
5889,Better make it a quick nap lol
5890,"I've struggled with my own depression and how it affects school for awhile. On the day I get the assignment I just tell myself ""I'll only write two sentences"" or ""I'll just do two questions"" and I find that sometimes once I've done that I have the motivation to keep going, and if I don't, I take a break for a bit, and come back to do two more. It really helps to break down tasks, especially if you're drained and just want to sleep.

For longer assignments like essays, if you start right away, you don't have to do too much all at once and it makes it much easier. You do need to keep yourself accountable to an extent, but it doesn't feel so hard when instead of beating yourself up for not ""doing better"" (which I did to myself) you acknowledge that it's difficult but that you are still able to work around it, even if it's not as conventional."
5891,No
5892,"This. Ever since things started going online only, I've been staying in bed later than usual."
5893,Idk how much times I‚Äôve heard stuff like this. I know it‚Äôs bad but I‚Äôm still gonna do it lol. I‚Äôve just given up on not procrastinating now cuz my mind just won‚Äôt let me focus until 5 minutes to the deadline
5894,"I'm the same way with music, sometimes I find it increases my focus while other times it distracts me. 

You may find that listening to sounds may be more helpful. Things like rain, beach waves, birds, crickets, fireplace, coffee shop, etc or some combination."
5895,I‚Äôm just so burned out man :(
5896,Yes! Very important to note that many people may be suffering from mental health issues that they aren‚Äôt aware of also.
5897,">I quickly realized that a lot of professors could care less.

I don't know if I have been lucky or it's the fact that I am a social science major, but most of my professors have actually been understanding. I have treated my mental illness like any other illness because quite frankly depression is much more debilitating than the common cold. I always try to email professors before my mental health tanks my grades- it shows I'm willing to put in some effort and also demonstrates it's not just an excuse for a missed assignment. Also, having a letter from your therapist as documentation is always good!"
5898,"I going for it. I needed to hear this. The part where procrastination stems from fear speaks to me. I want to apply to nursing and ace that HESI but I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll just fail and maybe nursing isn‚Äôt really for me.

5959,"You can't do everything. Some things have to be prioritized and some things have to be sacrificed. This is how it is for the vast majority of students, no matter how well your classmates hide it.

I'm pregnant this semester and it's rough as heck. I'm also planning on applying to grad schools, and an older student (older than you by a few years). My grades are suffering because they are the thing that has to give this time. There is absolutely no reality right now where I can stay healthy enough, maintain straight A's, and not have a mental breakdown. I had mental health problems before, and I was barely keeping them in check and now I'm actively struggling with them. It is a daily effort to not beat myself up over my inability to continue to maintain straight A's, because I just feel like a failure. I'm not, and you're not, this shit's just hard, and the only thing you can do is your best.

I would recommend prioritizing your health though, mental and physical, as much as you can. With that, everything else does come easier, despite how much you feel like you don't have time for it. For how much I have to say ""Fuck it"" and just go take a nap because I'm falling asleep doing hw, my grades aren't suffering nearly as much as I thought they would."

5961,"> Who can work 30 hours a week, take anywhere between 12-18 hours, properly investment in interpersonal relationships/friendships, eat healthy, workout and engage in hobbies. How do people do it?

They don't. It's not possible to balance full-time work with full-time university studies unless you make ridiculous personal sacrifices that 99% of people can't, unless you're on meth 24/7. The occasional anomaly doesn't mean that it *should* work. It *doesn't*. It's like saying - how many people can run a 2:00 marathon? Well, a few people, maybe, under the right conditions. But essentially no one.

There is no solution. You need to stop working in order to focus on studies, but that means incurring enormous quantities of debt you'll never escape from, essentially negating the project entirely. If you sacrifice school performance for the sake of work, what are you actually getting out of it?

Re-evaluate whether or not you actually need grad school. That's the only practical advice I can give. You almost certainly don't, so at least eliminate that pressure from yourself.

5965,"Nah, this is the sort of reply I wanted to preempt by pointing out the fact that anomalies exist. They always think that their stupid anecdote is a meaningful rebuttal. It isn't. You're the exception that proves the rule. *At best*, it lacks any sort of considered nuance concerning other people's circumstances and how they differ from yours. At worst, you're making people feel like shit for struggling without understanding exactly what those differences are *while working exactly as hard*, or even harder, than you are.

I'm also an adult learner and we have it *way* easier, just by way of having more developed organizational skills, general maturity and resistance to stressors, and you and I both seem to have long-term partners that presumably do a great deal in terms of emotional support and support in terms of household management and finances. It's absolutely absurd to think that your circumstance represents some global maxima of adversity compared with a lot of other, even typical, university students. You aren't that.

Like, just be more self-aware next time you post here. Kids are struggling for real. You make it worse with this shit."

The stress and worry about the future is sooo relatable. Best you can do is to do what you can to answer those worries so they stop nagging you.

You're worth way more than your grades or your debt. Don't let them make you feel like you're not."

I‚Äôm thankful just because my professors have been understanding but at the same time I feel constantly bad because I feel like I‚Äôm letting them down if I can‚Äôt completely something. 

I just feel like a complete failure and feel like I can escape it. I feel like I‚Äôm letting everyone in my life down. I know this semester will end soon and I‚Äôm planning on only going part time (I‚Äôm 23 too!) until I am mentally prepared for full time so I kinda just keep holding on to that."
5979,"Thank you, that means a lot."
5980,"On mobile so forgive formatting please.
You can't possibly do all of the above without sacrificing mental health. As a current student I will talk about my experience and some of my classmates experiences. For a year and a half almost exactly I worked 25 hours a week and took 5 classes a semester. At this specific job July 2019 - Decmber 2020. Then during both summers I worked full time. During semester hours I would attend class Monday - Thursday, then Friday's I would only have class in the mornings but go to work almost immediately after. I worked Friday - Sunday which I find myself fortunate but still I would go months at a time without a day off. My coworkers became my social group, I didn't have time to see my school friends at all due to school and work obligations. My friend group dwindled down to one friend that I would see MAYBE 1-2 times a month for a few hours. Before covid my work closed at 11pm but closing procedures took 30 minutes if it went smoothly so I wasn't off until earliest 11:30 pm in a rough neighborhood. Since I was the college student with the restricted schedule I exclusively got all of the closing shifts. As you can imagine my sleep schedule got screwed over as well. Once covid hit we started closing at 8 pm and my school schedule permitted my coming into work early as to not lose out on hours, so it got better. But then my sleep schedule was still messed up. Once the gyms reopened I would go to the gym after work so after that plus taking a shower and having dinner I would still be going to sleep around midnight or later. The way I coped with school was just doing the bare minimum to get a decent grade. Forget actually trying to learn anything, just do what the rubric says and cram as much information for the test and then purge it out after. I didn't do additional readings, just show up to class and take detailed notes to compensate for that. This style isn't sustainable obviously and I was burning out BAD by the end and during finals. I quit shortly after this last Thanksgiving having saved up a respectable amount of cash. The only reason I was able to do this is because I live at home and am fortunate enough to have a parent that is supportive of my education and wanted me to quit and focus on school. Things have been going much better since then, I am actually learning and retaining information now lol. I graduate at the end of 2021 if all goes well.

As for other perspectives I have friends A and B. They are both pre-med. Friend A has been working full time since we both started at the university in 2016. He typically has done 4 classes a semester and gets about 6 hours a sleep a night. He currently wakes up around 4 am and goes to the gym fist thing in the morning 6-7 days a week. That being said he's had to retake multiple classes due to not getting high enough grades for medical school. Friend B also works 40+ hours a week takes 5 classes and goes to the gym 2-3 times a week at night. I met her at my work, she basically had the same work schedule as I did but with 2 additional work days. Out of both she's the one that you see is most stressed out/burnt out/depressed/anxious. Friend A is more laid back in his personality but is self disciplined. He gets his work done in advanced if possible. Friend B doesn't have the opportunity to do so, so she's constantly doing things last minute but she does have the better grades. If you see a reoccurring theme here is everyone mostly does work and school, gym if time permits. Social life is non existent.

My recommendation, stop trying to balance everything at once because it's not possible/sustainable. Work, school, social life...pick 2. Hopefully school is one of them. I went from work and school to school and what is possible during covid for social life. Good luck and remember that it isn't going to last forever, your time to graduate and be done will come."
5981,Are you me? (Switch pregnancy with juggling a two-year old full time) I swear **ANY** job I ever held previous to this is only fractionally stressful compared to the combination of college and watching a toddler 24/7. I fall asleep at my desk more than my bed.
5982,"I think this is it too because I've never felt quite this stressed/mentally fatigued over school. 

I'd have taken an earlier start to the semester over no breaks any day."
5983,"I hate when people play the ""no, I have it worse!"" game. If you're trying your best and still not doing as well as someone else, then how can they just tell you to try harder? Clearly the circumstances are more favorable for them one way or another, be it because they have simply had more time to figure their life out and get into a rhythm or because they don't struggle with the same psychological problems. I don't take pride in the things that I'm able to do simply because I was born with the right genes or had a different upbringing. I'm proud of the effort I put in."
5984,Every single one of your professors.
5985,You seemed to be in a toxic routine. I am glad you got out of it! I hope it's going better now.
5986,"idk ik a lot of people who do all four. they find ways to blend them a lot of the time. school and friends (studying together). self care and friends (spa days - usually in-house just face masks etc) some people are just better. and that‚Äôs ok. I am not one of those people but they are not as uncommon as people like to think. 

I think it makes us feel better to imagine that there are few people who are able to balance everything and be happy but i think its a selfish coping mechanism. they are better than us. it doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt be successful or happy. and it doesn‚Äôt mean that balancing those things is not hard for us. but they can do almost everything and discrediting that is stupid."
5987,"I feel that self care is the formation and practice of healthy habits to improve one's overall quality of life, face masks just don't really improve one's overall quality of life"
5988,You can‚Äôt do it all. Simply put. You have to pick a few things to excel at
5989,I was just about to comment this. Plus if it keeps happening campus police will stop showing up and will tell them to stop calling.
5990,"My dad did this when I was in the Military. Called the bad commanders office and all. I texted my dad once telling him he has absolutely no right to do that to me as an adult, and if he did it again I would file for a restraining order and tell my CO. Showed my boss our text conversation and he never did that shit again. We have a good relationship after I set my boundaries I hope you can do the same"
5991,thank you! I'm getting in touch with housing today.
5992,"If you want to cut off your parents you'll have to cut them off financially, too :( Get yourself a pay-as-you-go plan and start using wifi instead of data."
5993,"It's just a very small, very religious, strict community. I am a girl as well, so that makes them much more strict on me. My priest is weird and creepy and has called my parents before asking where I was when I missed church. He told them he was going to try to come to my dorm to see me since I missed mass. üòï"
5994,thank you so much.
5995,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è I contacted my RA already but I think my dad just turned off my phone data because my texts stopped going through to her :/ I can see her in person later though and email some people who work in housing. Thanks again.
5996,"Serious question:  does your parents' church have cult-like tendencies?  I ask because you say that others will come looking for you and are passively aggressively trying to control your behavior outside the confines of the church ""and things.""  If so, staying away will be the best thing you can do to retain your autonomy.   Of course, it could be just a community that is a little too ""tight knit,"" but it wouldn't hurt to check out [this website](https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/) to see if it's a situation that requires even further distance."
5997,"one more thing: my dad just turned off my data and i'm assuming took me off the family phone plan. but i can still see ""verizon lte"" at the top right of my phone. it's just that my data isn't working. does this mean i'm off the family plan or did he just turn off my data? I want to get on my own plan now but how do I go about that when I don't even know if I'm still on the family plan? also, another thing they do is track my phone so they always know where I am lol so switching will be good for me. And likewise, I'm sure I will be taken off of the family car insurance. But my parents are the ones who bought my car. I believe it is now in my name because I paid it off, but again, my dad was the one who handled a lot of this so I'm confused. How do I go about any of this and getting things in my name when they're the ones who originally handled it?"
5998,"Geez‚Ä¶ yeah talk to housing and make sure campus police are informed that they are harassing you and you have no contact with them. This is harassment and a waste of police resources just so your parents can feel like they matter. Best of luck, sorry you have to deal with this"
5999,"First of all, the fact that you are asking these questions, wanting to take the necessary steps to start distancing yourself is huge. It is not easy I know, and a lot of people are afraid of even asking for help so props to that. As for the insurance and all that other stuff, take it one step at time, call the insure and ask if you are still insured, and just switch, as with everything else, getting your own phone plan, your own‚Ä¶ well everything that can tie you to them or they can use as leverage to make you feel they have power over you. You will start to realize, its a big world, losing them or your toxic community does not mean you will end up alone. Theres a community for you willing to help, starting with this sub ‚ù§Ô∏è"
6000,"No, they're not"
6001,Are they paying for your college?
6002,Sounds like a very unhelpful small community. Only asking about you when they want you to go to church
6003,"I have two jobs already. One at a law firm and one on campus. I have a full ride scholarship that covers my dorm and tuition. Why I haven't been paying for these things is because my parents wanted to control them. They know where I am because they track my phone, and possibly my car as well. They wanted to control these things. I have tried to get off of the family phone plan before. Don't tell me I ""need to get a job"". Have some respect."
6004,"Former cult member and current college student here. My family tried to send missionaries to my dorm once, I just had a quick conversation with my RA and later the person in charge of our res hall, and I never heard from them again"
6005,thank you! I'm working on this now.
6006,"I see in a comment that they are not paying for your college.  Good.  Please, cut ties with them.  Your mental health should be number 1.

get a new phone, don't give anyone your number that you don't want contacting you.  Talk to the school admin office about blocking your parents from your school records.  If you can change to a different dorm on campus, do that.

 get a PO box if you can afford to and have all your mal sent there.  Get a brand new email address and don't share it with anyone in your tight knight community and close the one they know about."
6007,Good luck I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with that situation!
6008,"I got my own bank account earlier in the year because my dad was controlling the joint one too much, so no, not anymore."
6009,this means so so so much to me. thank you. I really appreciate it. I have been emailing different staff members on campus I know I can trust all day and have been researching how to get on my own plan so I am trying to distance myself
6010,"Huge red flag.  Any visits should be by invitation or mutual consent only. Creepy church leader trying to visit unannounced to ""check on you""= stay far, far away.   I wouldn't step foot in that church or any of its related activities again with such a leader.  That doesn't mean giving up your faith if it's important to you.  It means having perfectly normal boundaries when it comes to how you wish to practice that faith.  You also said you have abusive parents.  You didn't elaborate on that, though trying to intimidate you by proxy with an unnecessary visit from police and removing your data access when they didn't get their way certainly qualify.  If they are genuinely concerned for your well-being, they would support you in other ways besides just trying to make sure you come to church.  I hope you have a support system outside of your family and church community.  I suggest you utilize your campus counseling services, even if it's just for a little while to help empower you to set good boundaries with your parents and church community and build a support network apart from them."
6011,Fin Aid Office can help with special forms for those who are in this situation. Loans are the norm though.
6012,I recommend mint mobile for cheap options.
6013,"Red flag. Full stop.

There's a difference between someone coming over to check on you due to valid concern for your wellbeing  vs. Someone coming over to check on you because they're creepy. Trust your intuition. This priest is giving you bad vibes. Alert your dorm RA about potential people who might come looking for you. Give a list of names of people who you don't want to see. I suggest doing something similar for your friends, professors, and classmates (if your comfortable). Let them know not to give any personal info like when you'll be back for work, your class schedule, etc. so that it'll be harder for people to trace you. Sounds like common sense but you'd be surprised that some people just believe random strangers claiming to be family and casually drop an acquaintances whereabouts.

I'm not trying to scare you. Your post reminded me of an experience i had that could've gone wrong had I done things differently. One of my old coworkers was having family issues, but she never mentioned it to any of us (I was a new hire and we weren't close). When we first met she made a passing comment about how I reminded her of her sister and said, ""it's just me and my sister"". One day she called out sick so I filled in for her. Customer- a young man walks in asking for this coworker, when is she coming back and that she normally works this shift. He said he was her brother, there was a family emergency and she needs to come home right away. Asked me whether she'd be on shift later that day. I said I'm not allowed to disclose work schedules with customers. He got mad at me but I just repeated what I said and he left. 
The next day I met her at work and told her what happened. Turns out she called in sick to avoid possibly running into her family, who she had contact with before things went wrong and that they'd likely know her routine since it didn't change. She was okay though. Our manager had a meeting after that and had asked us individually if we had any stalkers, restraining orders, or abusive family members that might come to the workplace to look for us.

On another note- if you have social media, set your accounts to the highest privacy possible. That aside, i'm sorry you're going through this. Stay safe."
6014,But OP needs to consider FAFSA information they will no longer be able to get from their family and fill out the proper forms to become an independent student
6015,"Yes, although walmart target etc also sell mobiles and sim cards you can install to your phone and and charge money on via the internet, if you don't want to wait for shipping."
6016,thank you so so much.
6017,"The best way to get a phone plan is to buy a cheap Android phone and get a plan that you pay month to month. That way if you can't pay one month then it won't affect your credit. There's different plans out there that cost around $35/month. As far as the car is concerned I would guess that your father is the owner on the cars title. If you have a copy of the registration it will probably say on there. If that is the case you can still insure it, but just know that he could come and take it and there's nothing you could do about it"
6018,"so I have been looking into it, and (I'm clueless about this so I'm sorry if this comes off dumb) but it seems like I will have to wait for a sim card to get shipped to me. Is that right?"
6019,You can‚Äôt be serious
6020,Wait what?
6021,i'm fine with not having big thanksgiving gatherings but what the fuck? that's insanely cruel.
6022,Felt this lol eating pizza rolls for my Thanksgiving dinner
6023,I wish I was joking...
6024,Oh that‚Äôs fucked. I understand not wanting kids to be around family right now but an assignment now???
6025,"Yeah, I have a paper due this Sunday as well, it‚Äôs a 5 pager."
6026,"Thank you! My mom and I havent spoken in awhile. She was physically and emotionally abusive. This was the first Thanksgiving where I wasnt forced to tolerate her. Just me and my boyfriend today, and I have to say I'm pretty happy.

Hope you have a good Thanksgiving as well."
6027,I tried 8 different Chinese places before I found one that was open. Otherwise it was going to ramen with an egg to make it ~fancy~.
6028,"You should report that professor to your college. Trying to encourage students not to celebrate Thanksgiving or take the holiday off is bogus, and I don't think they're allowed to do that seeing as Thanksgiving is a national holiday."
6029,My professor messaged me in zoom because he knew my family life was iffy and offered to drive a plate to my apartment. He then emailed me again today to ask how I‚Äôm doing. I nearly cried twice.
6030,Happiness comes from within yourself first.
6031,"It's just me, myself, and I for dinner tonight and I hate it.  It's also crunch time because I have my own assignments due soon, have a ton of grades to catch up on, have to do all of my data analysis, and create a seminar presentation, so the sad dinner is being accompanied by a bottle of wine and a laptop.

My semester doesn't end until right before Christmas and our winter semester starts right after New Year's, so yeah...this blows."
6032,"same, ten pager legal discourse.

we got this, I believe in all of ya"
6033,I'm lowkey fasting lmao
6034,I‚Äôm actually not happy I‚Äôm kind of forced to have a family party
6035,My thought exactly. One of my profs tried to give a take-home exam this weekend but had to change it since our university doesn't permit university exercises this weekend. Idk if that varies by school though.
6036,Damn I wish we had a stuff your face day before Christmas.
6037,"I don‚Äôt have a great relationship back home, so I completely understand. I just wanted people to know they weren‚Äôt alone! Happy thanksgiving to you!"
6038,"That‚Äôs fucked. I didn‚Äôt see family, but I did a video call, made turkey for two (me + gf), watched stupid Christmas movies, and had a strict no-work policy (even though part of me was like ‚Äòoh well I think that topics interesting‚Ä¶). 

You can still celebrate a holiday without spreading COVID. TBH yea I would report him, at least at my uni it‚Äôs against the policy to do that and would absolutely be enforced."
6039,I‚Äôm confused
6040,"Honestly, my extended family is in China. As a result they usually don't come over during Thanksgiving. So every Thanksgiving it's just me, my dad, my mom, and my brother."
6041,"Yeah i got lab reports, finals, tests (cries in assignment as well lol. üò≠üò≠üò≠. Don't let it consume you. You control your day. School is a fraction of your life, not the whole pie. Do some now, and then some later"
6042,Very good argument. Thanks for the downvote.
6043,"Yeah, wow. I celebrated Thanksgiving today by facetiming my family and giving myself the day off work (on campus job that lets us schedule our own shifts). I'd be so annoyed if a teacher assigned a lot of work today and didn't let me have this one day of relaxation."
6044,"Thanks, I really appreciate this. This is my second year since leaving home and spending the holidays alone, and Thanksgiving was much easier this year, but it's still a bit rough. My day was overall pretty good though! I hope your day was good as well!"
6045,That is so incredibly sweet!
6046,Yo this is exactly what I do for  homework heavy nights
6047,"I got a 6 pager on the ADA ( Americans with disabilities act, the equivalent of the civil rights act but for disabled Americans) lol"
6048,"Although I was able to celebrate with my family, mine was still depressing af. My dad has cancer and he developed an opioid dependency because he's supposed to take them as needed, and he needed pin meds. He didn't take them today so he got withdraw.

He wasn't hungry for dinner. This is the first time in a long time he didn't gorge himself and devour multiple plates of food. He just had a few bites and left because he didn't feel well. It was honestly heartbreaking af and he's probably just going to get worse from here. He probably has a max of 3 more years and I don't want this to be his last ""decent"" Thanksgiving."
6049,Put something in your morning routine that you look forward to!! Something that really makes you want to get out of bed
6050,"Bed at 9:30pm, awake at 6am every day."
6051,Go to bed at 10pm and wake up at 10am
6052,What if I have nothing to look forward to?
6053,sleep at 5am wake up at 5pm*
6054,Procrastinate and force yourself to wake up early in order to finish your work
6055,Serious question though... do you sleep for 12 hours straight or is that 12 hours broken up into various naps? Genuinely curious
6056,"I can stay up as late as I have to, but I can NOT trust myself to wake up at the ass crack of dawn to finish stuff. It also makes me nervous because what if I run out of time before class in the morning?

I don't know how y'all do it."
6057,"See I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs about being more productive. Someone who concentrates better at night can be more productive in the late hours. 

For me I am just a simp for sunshine. The sun‚Äôs up, I‚Äôm up. And I‚Äôm happy"
6058,IDEAL OMG LOVE IT
6059,"Parkinson's law: work expands to fill the time available for it's completion. 

I used to stay up late to finish something, but I found myself working slower as the night went on. Now, I convince myself to sleep at a reasonable hour (a bit of melatonin helps) and force myself to get up 2-3 hours earlier. I feel refreshed (after coffee) and the time limit makes me work a lot faster. I used to be scared of oversleeping the time, but when you know there's something you have to get done, you'll wake up (given that you aren't fatigued)."
6060,"curious - what are other people‚Äôs motivations to wake up early other than just ‚Äúbeing more productive‚Äù ?

for me it was just like engrained into my lifestyle by my parents / having early sports practices from a young age that you wake up early (5-6am) and sleep early (10-11pm)"

6064,This is my current schedule
6065,I honestly just love sleep...... sometimes I‚Äôll go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 12-1pm. Pure love for sleep is strong.
6066,I typically go to be around 6-8pm and wake up around 3-5 am. So 110% feel ya
6067,a ‚Äúsimp for sunshine‚Äù oh my god i love that
6068,I always feel like I don‚Äôt fit in with other college kids because I‚Äôm a total morning person. But I work best early in the day and like getting to bed pretty early. Finally! There‚Äôs someone else!
6069,Midnight is not considered ‚Äúlate‚Äù in college‚Äîat least in mine. One of our coffee shops closes at 2 am.
6070,"For me, I have to eat (decently) healthy, be somewhat active during or throughout the day, and feel like I‚Äôve done whatever needed to be done for the day.

That means a good day can consist of having a grilled chicken salad for lunch and a peanut butter on saltines for diner. Going to the gym, riding my bike several miles, or just having a long day of classes and walking several miles on my hilly campus. And finally, I have to do all work due the next day AT THE MINIMUM. Procrastinating and putting off work that will fuck me over the next day stresses me out, makes me feel guilty, and undermines every other task done during the day to make me feel lazy.

At points I‚Äôve become apathetic towards my grades, assignments, friends, health, body weight, etc. Mental health is very important and should be your number one priority. If you keep your mental health in check by prioritizing what is important to you (for me it‚Äôs keeping myself as stress-free as possible), you‚Äôll be freed from a lot of the demons that plague your sleep. I still don‚Äôt go to bed at 9:30, but I also don‚Äôt go to bed at 4 or 5 am like I did freshman year.

PS: Pick an arbitrary time and don‚Äôt drink anything but water after that set time. I chose 10 pm, but some people choose like 6 or 7pm. I used to literally go to bed drinking stimulants and wondered why my sleep was wonky."
6071,I don't always love early classes but 10pm to 11pm bedtime even on vacation  is what I am about. It makes partying very hard since most start around my self-imposed bedtime :(
6072,Sleep 12+ hours in one go. Depression gang rise up
6073,Bed at 5am. Class at 8am. Then back to bed at 1pm-Until 6pm. Then back to bed at 5am. Repeat
6074,Yes! Societal norms have enabled and continue to reinforce the night owl culture. But here I rebel!
6075,"FACTS... there gave been multiple occasions were I‚Äôve gotten ready to go out with friends but by the time the pregame started, I was yawning after every sentence. At that point I would change my mind, take my makeup off, and go to bed."
6076,"You gotta force yourself out of bed!! People who hit snooze a bunch of times are the reason they feel so groggy in the morning. My GF is a super heavy sleeper but still has a morning routine and just sets enough alarms that she wakes up. Once she‚Äôs up? She‚Äôs out of bed within minutes, tea on, face washed, contacts in. No hitting snooze, no dozing for 25 minutes. 

Once you get this routine or get used to getting up and getting moving you‚Äôll notice that after the first 5 or so minutes of being up it feels way better than you‚Äôd expect!! You get the satisfaction of having a routine and want to keep it going!"
6077,"I so want to be an early riser since I can get so much stuff done. It's just hard to get out of bed when the urge to sleep longer is so incredibly strong. I do commute to college and take morning classes which forces me to get up early, though. I also get up early when I substitute teach. Once we get back to normal, I'll have a lot more motive to have a good sleeping schedule!"
6078,"I really like seeing sunshine during the day, cheesy as it is. There's not much I can do outside at night and still feel safe walking about."

6095,"I use C rings, it's a different kind of squeeze. I don't feel like it cuts my flow, just restricts it some. My experience with Crown condoms was that they were tight all around. I had to stuff my thingamajig in there, and it would squeeze from bottom to top. Post sex was painful. I just started shelling out money for Trojans that fit me a bit better.


Also I'm average in size, I was surprised by how tight they were vs comparable condoms of the same size."

She told me I was in, like, organic chemistry 3 or something, and since I was in the right room, i thought I might as well stay. After that lecture a different professor came in and started talking about hurricanes, and I freaked out and double checked which room I was in. Turns out, I was in the right room, just *two* hours early."
6110,"I did this once, stay for the lecture, it could be fun trying to piece together the subject matter and maybe learn something lol"
6111,It's even better when you're the professor and get set up to teach in the wrong room. Had that happen when the registrar switched a classroom assignment after I printed off my roster for the first day. I put up my intro slide and every kid in the class started quietly freaking out and planning their escape.

6116,How much weed do you smoke?
6117,Yep I did this on the first day. I showed up an hour early and sat through the lecture. Luckily when the professor took attendance he just called everyone‚Äôs names out and had them say here. I just didn‚Äôt say anything and nobody seemed to notice. (Even the girl I was sitting by!)
6118,"I knew a guy who fell asleep towards the end of a lecture. At the end of class, the students left without disturbing him. The students for the next class came in, sat around him but did not disturb him.

6122,"I once went to my chem final exam room 2 hours early on accident and only noticed when I was given a stat exam. I walked up to the professor and told her I was in the wrong room. She said thank god I thought you were giving up! I wondered how many people do that and I guess enough

6125,"First semester of my freshman year of college, I got to my first-ever final exam (it was the last day of lecture, at the regular lecture time/place) early. I knew that there wasn‚Äôt a class before ours, so I settled in to get some last minute studying in. People started to fill in around me and although I didn‚Äôt recognize anyone, I wasn‚Äôt particularly concerned. No one went to this class anyway, so seeing new people during an exam was normal. As we got closer to the start time, the professor failed to appear. Instead, a TA that I didn‚Äôt recognize got up to the front and began organizing exam materials. As he began to hand materials out, I started to get worried. Right before he got to my row I had a moment of realization‚Äîthere WAS another class before mine, but only once a week...and I was not only early to my class, I was an hour and a half early. In a slight panic I stood up and left the room with my stuff to some muffled laughs from the back. Fast forward an hour or so and people began to the leave exam. I was sitting on a bench outside, waiting for the room to clear so I could go back in. Lo and behold, my roommate walked out of the room and over to me. It turned out that we had (despite having each other‚Äôs schedule on our phones) never realized that we had lectures in the same room, one after another and he had seen me stand up and leave and begun to laugh. So i‚Äôm not sure about a walk of shame at the start of class, but I very nearly took my roommate‚Äôs final exam without realizing it and he laughed at me for it."
6126,"On my first day of class I got my time mixed up and sat through an entire lecture on a slightly different type of chemistry than what I had signed up for (the difference was subtle enough for me to not notice) and I was surprised to see that I had a substitute teacher on the first day. Then, 50 minutes later, my actual professor walks in and starts setting up, and I finally realize I've just sat through an entire lecture for a class I wasn't taking. "
6127,"The two year school I went to switched class rooms all the time, I've done this a couple of times"
6128,Ted Mosby? 
6129,"I once arrived early at the auditorium and there were people I had no idea who they were and they were looking kinda weird to me, but I thought ""there are a lot of people who failed genetics, that's why they're here"". They saw me sitting down, and a minute later, I got a message on my whatsapp group of college friends saying ""3rd row, auditorium 1""

I picked up my stuff and climbed up the stairs as the other students looked at me thinking I was a lost freshman..."
6130,"I did this once, it was during freshmen year and I even came in early in the morning to check and make sure which room I was suppose to go to. Later that evening I went there 10 minutes early to wait outside the room because there's classing going on before our class time. 

Classrooms opened and I was focused texting my friend, so I accidentally followed people who were also waiting outside going into a class but into on the opposite room of the hallway. 

I introduced myself and started making a few friends. It took me 10 minutes of the professor going through the syllabus until I realized I was a chemistry major in a programming class. I ran out of there as fast and I could."
6131,https://i.redd.it/ol28rkmr4tk11.png
6132,"Worse if you're a professor who walks into the classroom, starts writing on the board and loading up a powerpoint, only to realize you don't recognize any of the students. And then a college comes in and says ""Uh, hi! What brings you here today?""  Turns out one classroom looks pretty much like another in the same building. Oops."
6133,"one guy walked into my 75 minute class about 60 minutes in, went straight to the front of the room, and only then did he ask the entire lecture ‚Äúam I late or am I early?‚Äù

he was very early."
6134,You could get some work for your other classes done in that time though. Or maybe grab some lunch or coffee.
6135,"I sat through intern orientation at a big software company. I came in the wrong door and missed the sign saying the software class had moved (I was transitioning from IT to SRE so I was taking company classes). At first I was like, man software engineers are getting young! When the speaker started I figured it out. I was in the middle of the row though, so I thought I‚Äôd hang out, wait for a lul and peace out. The speaker was so interesting that I sat through the whole thing."
6136,Or on the first week back to school and you attend a class to check if the professor is accepting any waitlists and he says that there is 20 people on the waitlist
6137,"I did this with my math class last semester. I showed up, saw a couple of friends, and sat next to them. We chat for a bit until the class starts, and the professor came in giving the usual first-day spiel. Soon enough, I realized that I was in a precalc class, not not calc 1 like what I registered. Telling my friend about it, she encouraged me to walk out without giving an explanation, and I did exactly that. 

Flustered, I saw that my classroom was diagonal to the one I went to, and after getting over the embarrassment of being in the wrong class and showing up late to the other, I learned that we had a placement exam. After going home and taking it, I did so poorly that I figured it wasn't worth continuing Calc 1. I dropped the class, switched to precalc, and sure enough, it was the same exact section that I initially attended by accident.

Tl;dr: Thought I was in Calc 1 when I actually showed up to a Precalc class, left to go to my actual class, only to bomb the placement exam and find myself in the Precalc room again."
6138,What class was it that you went 3 weeks before realizing it was the wrong class? Was it related to the class you were really supposed to be in?
6139,What classes are you in that your book are only $75???
6140,"Also adding a screw you to the professors who have multiple required readings and use them for only one section each. If you‚Äôre not using a decent portion of the book, it‚Äôs not worth it!

I know some of my professors this semester have only a couple required books and scan the texts that we‚Äôre only using a few sections from because they don‚Äôt want us to spend so much money on a lot of textbooks. Thank you!

Also, had a class where there were five required expensive texts, and two written by the professor only found at the bookstore. Yeah, I switched that class before the semester even began."
6141,Never buy the textbook until a professor has you use it or says ‚Äúbring your textbook next class‚Äù 
6142,"Aww cmon dude, the new edition has chapter 1 and 2 swapped!"
6143,Professors who send you PDF links to the textbook are the best!
6144,"Exactly this. Until a book assignment is due, I‚Äôm keeping my money"
6145,[deleted]
6146,Freshmen level gen ed courses that everyone has to take. Those are the only cheap books I recall. Used ones at that.
6147,[deleted]
6148,I had to buy a textbook for my class for $34 which wasn‚Äôt bad at all but then I had to buy a $106 code to use his special website.
6149,Yeah and if you do have to buy..[Textbook Spyder](https://www.textbookspyder.com) is a great place to compare prices from all the different websites.
6150,"$120 is still on the cheap end for a new book. I could say that I paid $240 for one of mine, but I didnt. I got it online for free instead. But, somebody would come along and one up me as well."
6151,$75 is pretty cheap for a textbook. I had to pay $120 for one of mine. 
6152,For some of my classes you have to pay $200 to do homework online...
6153,"My Calculus book was about $10, but I think that was because the author of the book was retiring and wanted to give the world a gift. The $10 is to cover the printing and shipping costs. "
6154,[deleted]
6155,"If your professor wrote a book, why would they use someone else's to teach the class? They literally wrote exactly what they want you to know.

Every book is written by a professor somewhere. "
6156,My professor for winter session had us buy $100 worth of books for a 2 week course
6157,"My least favorite thing was when professors would use a book that's just not widely available. I remember needing a book not available on Amazon, not via Barnes and Noble, and the campus bookstore had it on backorder."
6158,And shoutout the professor who don‚Äôt require book for the class 
6159,Let‚Äôs see. $275 for a loose leaf binder book for Spanish
6160,You gotta pay exorbitant prices for everything in America. I gotta pay to live and I gotta pay to die. 
6161,Get your books off of the website lib.gen.io. Never bought another book again. 
6162,Does anyone know of a website that tell you the differences between book editions? It would be a great service to have!
6163,"I had a CS prof that wrote the book for the course, but then in the syllabus provided the link for the PDF. Super hard class but he was an old Chinese dude that was funny as hell. Really easy to get along with and super understanding."
6164,"Cheers to that! :)

Also, here's to professors who don't make you buy textbooks and only provide free YouTube/Vimeo video tutorials for lessons. 

As a visual/spatial learner, and a Graphic design/3D modeling student,  this is very helpful. "
6165,f*ck Cengage
6166,"My peeves: 

1. Some textbook decisions are made at the department level and faculty are told what book to use. 

2. Publishers want to kill off the used textbook market. How they are doing this is by telling Dept Chairs that they can offer the E-Text cheaper then the physical book. So take MyMathLab......they offer the e-text for $126 while the actual print book costs $150. It seems like a deal until you realize you can't buy the damn book used anymore. 

3. Some colleges are using the publisher systems (MyMathLab, Cengage Mindtap, etc) for online courses while bundling the e-text. The only problem these systems do not give you access to the material without paying the publisher. So if you buy a used textbook, you are still locked out of the system until you pay $100 to the publisher. I don't know how this is legal if you paid tuition for the course. Fucked up. 

4. I have a firm suspicion that some dept chairs take kick backs from publisher sales reps for adopting their textbooks. When an A&P textbook costs $250 and the fucking subject has really changed in 20 years......WTF?!?!

5. Some faculty (ones forced to use a certain textbook) don't bother to read the assigned book. 

6. Some faculty download the textbook test banks from the publisher and then throw them into Blackboard or Canvas and don't bother to actually read the test....they just tell the system to throw out 50 out of 100 questions at random. Come on....."
6167,Because some people write better books than they do! Or because they write one on a really niche topic and need a book on a different topic. I feel like you should try to vary where your info/course material is coming from 
6168,"Access codes are the biggest scam ripoffs of college. I don't even have a problem with textbooks themselves because I can find most for free online. However, when an access code is required, you're screwed."

6199,"thank you for taking the time to post this, I'm sure it will be very helpful to many people :)"
6200,My prof wrote a book for our gen ed class and she repeatedly told us in the first few weeks to make sure we pay full price for the book and don‚Äôt buy used/find a pdf. I found a pdf and sent it to everyone
6201,That‚Äôs so stupid of her to tell her students not to buy a used copy. Most people aren‚Äôt rich and they can‚Äôt afford to buy new shit for everything.
6202,"honestly i find it odd when professors require their students to purchase their books. like they‚Äôre profiting off of their students, it feels unethical"
6203,"It really should be on the college to pay for the textbooks they want their students and instructors to use. In the case of my broke ass department, open source it is."
6204,[deleted]
6205,you are truly amazing. thank you for being a kind and caring professor. we need more professors like you during these troubling times.
6206,"I took a weight lifting class one time. The only way to participate in the class was to turn in a permission form. The only way to obtain the permission form was to buy the class text, authored by the instructor of the class. We did a similar thing with the class group chat"
6207,I really hate when it‚Äôs a book written by the professor and they charge $100+
6208,"Madlad

Fuck that prof"
6209,"In non-plague times, I try to always put a copy of the textbook for each of my courses on reserve in the library, so check the library, too!"
6210,Most colleges have policies in place about this.  Usually the book has to be appropriate for the class and the same price or lower than alternative textbooks that are available.
6211,"My professor made us get 2 books and asked us questions on 1 tests from the books 

When we told him the price if the books he responded ""Not my problem!"" He had copies of the book but couldn't lend them out to everyone in the class.

Of course we had one person get the book from the publisher. It was a construction equipment book and we couldn't find it anywhere online."
6212,"I doubt she lost much profit. Academic publishing isn't really profitable for authors.  Professors write books for the prestige or to help further their careers, not for money."
6213,"It often feels unnecessary to have to buy a book if there are free alternatives. After all, there's nothing that distinguishes a free book from a book that costs money besides the fact that a free book is most likely an online PDF.

I've only ever needed to buy a book once, but that class taught me that people will not hesitate (and rightfully so) to ask if an older edition is fine. If you're not the author of the book, not a colleague of the author who wrote the book, or you are teaching a course that may not have many books out there that teach the content of that particular book, I wouldn't see the point of making students purchase a book. That's just how I see it, and I'm glad your department does open-source: it really saves both sides money."
6214,"I do it every quarter for one or two professors. About 40% of the time they give me the book or tell me it's not actually necessary. The rest of the time the conversation goes something like:

>Dear Dr. [Name], I have no money and struggle with affording food and rent, and I definitely can't buy this book. Any chance you know where I can find it for free?

Response A:

>I don't know, ask your classmates and maybe someone can help.

Response B:

>Check the library

Which I proceed to do only to find that all the permanent copies are checked out and all the temporary loan ones are taken almost all the time. Or, the book is too obscure for anything except interlibrary loans which blocks requesting assigned books.

Response C:

>I'm sorry, I don't know how to help you. Maybe Google around, if not, I would either buy it if you can or consider retaking the class at a later point when you can afford the course material.

Entirely unhelpful for a senior a quarter away from graduation who has never had a quarter where I could afford the books.

Definitely students should communicate with their professors but it  really often doesn't work unfortunately."
6215,I love this!!!
6216,"also, head to the library and check out those books (if they are available). Some schools will even have interlibrary loans between other universities. That's how I survived grad school."
6217,math from the 1800s and for some reason they need 5 editions from the 2012 to now
6218,"I remember a student early this year in my class interrupting class because he was so upset that the several required books were too costly. I'm not even sure the professor was able to help. In an English class, not even STEM!"
6219,Yea i've definitely gotten a few 'suck it up you poorscum piece of shit' responses in my four years
6220,"Seconding this! I teach a large assortment of students from various walks of life. No matter what I will always do what I can to help them. And you should always tell your professor ‚Äî even if they seem rude about it ‚Äî it‚Äôs better to let them know your situation and show that you want to do the work, but you can‚Äôt get the texts right then. 

Everyone deserves to be able to participate with the necessary materials regardless of personal circumstances."
6221,"I've had many professors across different departments encourage students to find the books online. I even had a professor who told us, ""I don't care what edition you get, just get a workbook."" 

The best are, ""I had to choose a textbook but don't buy it. I provided links that provide the same information you need, it's just not a traditional textbook."""
6222,"What, you don't want them to change all the skeuomorphism designs to flat designs for only $250?"
6223,"The responses seem very careless, and honestly if you‚Äôre paying so much for college, the least they can do is give you a book. This is why I wish when you pay for college they give you the books, (it doesn‚Äôt even have the current one, but the most relevant one)"
6224,"You‚Äôre AMAZING. I can tell you, as a student who just had an EXCELLENT learning experience with my literature prof, I so appreciate instructors who CARE about their students. We never forget profs like you üôèüèΩ"
6225,"That's interesting. At the very least, I'll have a professor suggest ""Find these books online, but I strongly recommend these,"" and the content taught will not be from the books or anything. Rather, they're supplements to your knowledge in case you're stuck on something.

In the mathematics department under which most of my classes are, professors will most likely have you use an online textbook written by a colleague or even them. For my calculus classes, it was the free OpenStax textbooks. Perhaps I feel that professors will only make you buy textbooks if their knowledge revolves around the textbook or the subject is best explained by the $20 textbook."
6226,"I've had a lot of professors flat out say not to get the from the bookstore. 

I did have a professor make us get his book (that he wrote). He encouraged us to buy it but did say it was available in the library. I was hesitant about buying it but it was less than $20. So I did. 

One of the best books I have."
6227,"I remember there was a time when some kids visited our university (Spring 2019) and walked into the bookstore. As I talked with some friends at a nearby table, I overheard a kid brag about how much he spent at the bookstore. 

The book I have that cost money is actually not that bad, either, and I don't regret spending to get it. Perhaps it's the fact that it was used often and sparked my interest, too. Maybe I'll check out books or textbook sections my professors have written and learn a bit more about them like that."
6228,"Thank you for being a kind and caring Professor. I always say that we should act in a way where at the end of the day we can face our own conscience, our own reflection. But too many people just don‚Äôt care. 

Strive to be better is the only way forward!"
6229,"I love the Hate series. He Hate Me, She Hate Me Too, Everybody Hate Me, I Hate Everybody. What a story arc."
6230,I actually got enough confidence to write and submit my first short story because one of my English teachers open talked about being rejected by publishers. It‚Äôs a massive boost to know that it happens and isn‚Äôt a very big deal. You write more and try again.
6231,Tag yourself I‚Äôm ‚ÄúNot even the bloody flowergirl‚Äù

6235,Yup. You can have extremely successful professors published...most universities do....
6236,"Im ""The futility continues"" "
6237,"I'm somewhat curious what some of these say to get the reaction they get. Like ""Baffling Rejection"" or ""Cow Manure"". I know he wanted to write bullshit but what, exactly, is the bullshit being called on?"
6238,So this is what it's like to be an art major
6239,"Should post this in r/writing, too.  (Edit) What downvote this? The folks at r/writing can see it as the professor never quitting. It could be inspiring. "
6240,"I haven't seen it, but I'm guessing the writer blew their brains out all over the wall?"
6241,Yes. A *ton* of highly influential stuff is published by university professors.
6242,Lol. The ignorance is real with this one
6243,"Required reading for one of my Creative Writing classes in college was ""On Writing"" by Stephen King. Great book, has a similar concept, where he had a train rail spike in his wall that he put every rejected submission on, violently. Some of them he went back to and salvaged, edited, and molded into better short stories."

6246,This is amazing.
6247,I'm interested in the bigots one. 
6248,i‚Äôm BAH! HUMBUG!

6254,Oh my god I need to make this too. Thanks for the idea. 
6255,"I recently got rejected from a college within my university. I spoke to my counselor about it and I learned that I was two spots away from getting in. It‚Äôs tough to know that I was so close and now I have to do a summer semester and an extra semester. I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôll make it in next time, but I take comfort in that Stephen Spielberg got rejected from film school too."
6256,Right? It's a great thing to see.
6257,Well now they'll have to put on his plays!
6258,Yes. My theater teacher has gotten plays accepted and performed before. It's not some sort of super lucrative thing you can retire from. Nor does it last more than a few months or however long the play runs. And it doesn't guarantee he'll get more plays accepted in any way. So why not keep the day job??
6259,"I'm the third respondent to this thread, and would have to give a third opinion.  Its generally best to keep the first answer if one is \*unsure\* which answer is correct.  If an alternate answer makes more sense, however, one should make the change.

On an accounting test a few semesters ago, my grandson changed 4 or 5 of his answers.  It turned out he was initially correct on all of them.  He would have scored 92 instead of 72 if he kept the original answers.  That was a downer, but it happens sometimes."
6260,[deleted]
6261,"This is actually very poor advice. Don‚Äôt trust your first instinct. If you think you need to change the answer, change it. You‚Äôre falling for a common fallacy. You‚Äôre remembering all the times you‚Äôve changed a right answer to a wrong one but you are forgetting all the times you‚Äôve changed the wrong answer to the right one, and it‚Äôs just that the more painful one is the one you remember better. This is a commonly studied and well known psychological phenomenon. Moral of the story: DO change your answer if you think you need to. Don‚Äôt just trust your first instinct blindly if you think you‚Äôre wrong."
6262,My rule of thumb is to never change your answer unless you know for an absolute fact the one you picked is wrong.
6263,"Yeah, and I'd even say that most times if there's doubt, my first answer is wrong. Although like you said I probably don't and cant notice how frequently changing got me the wrong answer."
6264,"If you read the question too quickly and misunderstood it, that's a good reason to change it. Otherwise leave it."
6265,"This is always the last thing I say before the exam begins.  And again when I see the stragglers poring over their answers for the last 30 minutes of class.

Trust your gut unless you have a good reason to change in, not just a, ""Maybe...."""
6266,At my university some professors use scratch cards for MC. You know you have the right answer when you uncover a star. But you can keep scratching off the letters and you get partial based on how many attempts it took.
6267,"I hate to be the ‚Äúwell actually‚Äù guy here, but the Monty hall problem doesn‚Äôt really apply here because by design the game show host will uncover a wrong answer for you after you pick an initial guess, whereas in a test situation that isn‚Äôt happening at all so randomly guessing on the second attempt is the same as randomly guessing on the first in the long term. Not to mention the fact that there‚Äôs a human element here with information involving material learned from a class which makes it more complicated.

Nonetheless the Monty hall problem is a very interest situation and I think everyone should give it a read. :)"
6268,"There's nothing ""acktually"" about this comment at all. People shouldn't be afraid of being corrected."
6269,"You're not taking into account the problems that you later changed that *were* incorrect the first time. Almost every single time I change my answer, it's the correct one.

I don't think you should always just trust your gut instinct."
6270,That's one of the coolest test-taking procedures I've ever heard.
6271,or when everything you did to get the answer was correct but you had the wrong number of sig figs
6272,It makes sense to change your answer if you misread the question. But often I find myself staring at the question and rationalizing poorer options the more time I spend on it.
6273,What if your instinct is to not follow your instinct?
6274,I‚Äôll never forget this because in fourth grade I erased a circled answer and picked a different one. Teacher marked it wrong and wrote ‚Äúyou had it‚Äù next to my answer in red pen.
6275,"Actually, statistically, your first answer is more likely to be wrong. We just remember these incidents where we changed it to the wrong answer more often."
6276,good point
6277,Yeah my professor only used it on quizzes. It does get annoying scratching off spaces and if there isn‚Äôt a star you panic haha.
6278,"That‚Äôs why I use this method of test taking. Answer every question in a fairly quick manner, but circle the ones I‚Äôm unsure about. Then I go back and ONLY review the ones that are circled. If I was confident about the answer the first time through, I don‚Äôt look at it again."
6279,"I hate that, but it is said that reviewing your answers is good"
6280,That happened to me today lol
6281,But my instinct said to change the answer
6282,"It's funny, they teach to go with the first answer in college success courses. But usually when you change your answer, it's changed from an incorrect to a correct answer. They only teach not to change it because the distress caused by this exact scenario is much greater than if you leave it and still get it wrong."
6283,Haha I did this for THREE questions on my exam yesterday. So mad at myself.
6284,"This just gave me Nam flashbacks, I‚Äôve done this on both of my bio quizzes so far this quarter"
6285,Niiiice.
6286,Any sources for this? This doesn‚Äôt seem realistic to me since it‚Äôs also just as possible for someone‚Äôs intuition to be incorrect by misreading the question or just by framing the question in a manipulative manner
6287,It's entirely made up.
6288,I don‚Äôt know... kinda sounds like you‚Äôre talking out of your ass... any peer reviewed psychological research to back you up there?
6289,start beating off louder to assert dominance
6290,"My roommate in the military use to rub one out nightly. He would put headphones on and spank his meat.

He didn‚Äôt know he was beating his meat so hard that you could actually hear fap fap fap.

He did this for a few months before one day, while he was mid fap, I asked him what he was watching loudly.

He never faped in bed again."
6291,"""hey dude not to make things weird or make u feel bad but when u beat ur meat u shake both our beds. could we set up a time or whatever so im not in the room when ur doing it?""

something along these lines. casual but straightforward"
6292,He does it at like 2 am and I'm too lazy to get outta bed by then
6293,Ohhh act like i feel the beds shaking but not what he's doing. I didn't think about that. I'm dumb
6294,"Why don't u just say ""bro chill what are you doing"" or something"
6295,Wake up at 2am and be like hey bro stop moving so much if you can‚Äôt sleep go for a walk. In a sleepy voice lol.
6296,"‚Äúbro can you just get comfortable already? I need to get up early.‚Äù

or 

‚Äúdo you feel that? someone above us must be gettin‚Äô it ON‚Ä¶‚Äù"
6297,"Him, doing his thing.

You, with a loud yawn and sleepy voice:  ‚ÄúAre we having an earthquake?‚Äù

You‚Äôll make your point without awkwardness."
6298,damn who's routinely up at 2am going to town üò≠ if ur good friends im sure he'd be willing to change his schedule for u or go to the bathroom
6299,That's not a bad idea. He usually does it like 2 am tho
6300,The non confrontational method would be putting in your headphones and playing ocean waves. Now you‚Äôre being rocked to bed by your thoughtful Roomie.
6301,"Yes the harmonic oscillations will cancel out. Genius idea, OP consider this."
6302,"Climb up next to him and say, ""Need a hand partna""."
6303,Gotta be #1 lol xD
6304,Damn. I might have to try this one
6305,When‚Äôs he rubbing one out kiss him on the lips and tell him that‚Äôs how you make me feel when you masturbate at night. My roommate did it to me haven‚Äôt  beat it since
6306,"LmafoüòÇ ""hmm. The current is pretty rough today"""
6307,He does move around alot so that might work lol
6308,I am a physics professor.  I wonder if I would get in trouble if I made a homework question out of this.
6309,"Idk. Maybe he tries to wait till I'm asleep, but I'm usually still up. And I think he knows I'm still awake too so idk."
6310,"nah, lean INTO it, yell ""EARTHQUAKE!!!!"" And leap out of bed! 
""Get to shelter!! Doorways and stairwells!!""
""Wake up!!"" 
Repeat as needed."
6311,Too risky. What if he says sureüòÇ
6312,First one is better

6314,At that point I think you have to commit.
6315,if he knows you're up then i doubt he knows how much he shakes the bed so no matter what you're gonna have to let him know about ur bed shaking. if u don't wanna live with ur roommates masturbation vibrations u can't avoid this conversation. just gotta hope for the best ü§û
6316,‚ÄúHere are some links about restless leg syndrome. I think you might have it because I keep getting woken up up at 2am by the bunks shaking.‚Äù
6317,"Bro such a underrated comment, holy shit I‚Äôm crying tears!üò≠ comedy skit worthy"
6318,The real question is: why is this person jacking off while your in the room dude lol. I think you should address it and have some weird ass schedule unless if your in to it?
6319,"Of course!

I included a bonus question asking what is my dog's name. Most students got it correct."
6320,Do your students know of your co-professor?
6321,My cat likes to jump in my lap and walk across my laptop during my Zoom classes. I have to put her in another room when I take a test that uses respondus and records me.
6322,"That is so cute that you‚Äôre worried what your dog thinks of you lol don‚Äôt worry, he loves you no matter what :)"
6323,I have a 18 month old son and this is exactly why I can't work from home. He thinks I'm there to play with him all the time. Breaks my heart to hear him in the living room asking mommy to play with me.
6324,No. We do not lewd doggos.
6325,How are you going to post this and not post a dog tax? WE NEED A DOG TAX
6326,Beautiful üòå
6327,he‚Äôs so cute ü•∫
6328,Aww. You sound like an awesome professor. Your dog probably thinks he is lead teacher and will only give students an A for virtual pets.
6329,"Yes!! My dog will bark at me and if he‚Äôs not in my room and my door is closed, he literally scratches the door so loud. I always feel so bad but make sure to give him  love afterward"
6330,I can relate sooo much. my kitties meow at me like ‚Äúmom pleeeease play with me!!‚Äù so sometimes I put my laptop on the ground and play during class/school work but if i‚Äôm too busy to even do that I feel so bad :( like pls don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt wanna play!! haha
6331,"I think I'm going to need to see a picture of your dog to understand the story better ;)

On the other hand, I understand but with my cats who love sitting on my computer and on my lap, wanting attention the whole time."
6332,"It took some time, but my dog has adapted and figured out that me being home does not necessarily mean it's a weekend time for going for walks and whatnot. he also figured out that when I'm talking on the zoom I am not talking to him, lol."
6333,This! I have a corgi who barks whenever I'm on the phone so when I'm in class he goes crazy. I have to leave him in the living room while I'm in class or working on a group project basically.
6334,My cat learned that can he scratch and knock over my papers and pencils and mew at me to make me feed him.
6335,Cute! What does donut weigh?
6336,Awwwwwww üòç
6337,"> (He‚Äôs a Husky pit bull mix.)

LOL a *very* demanding breed when it comes to attention"
6338,"I do a lot of extracurricular work that has me doing things like sitting on important committees or running meetings and on three separate occasions I‚Äôve had to deal with a puppy trying angrily to get my attention by trying to yank my sock or my sleeve off my body while literally in the middle of speaking. He‚Äôs a good puppy most days but if he feels I‚Äôm not paying enough attention, he will *force* me to engage with him and I can‚Äôt just keep him in the crate all day."
6339,"40 y/o here. Colleagues at my school put together an impressive series of online meetings to discuss in small groups the effect climate change was having on us, on our worries about the future, etc. A comment that kept coming up was that the combination of those worries plus the bizarreness of life during coronavirus has made it incredibly hard to stay present with the people closest to us.

Three times my kid came to the door and asked if I was done and could I come play and I had to say no, I was too busy talking about being present."
6340,well I laughed
6341,75lbs üòÅ!
6342,"This but for kids. :) My older kids get it, but my poor 5 year old gets to hear 8-10 times a day: ""SHHHHHHH! Mommy (or Daddy) are in a meeting."" Hope he's not scarred for life."
6343,My dog kept jumping on my lap during my math final with my camera on. so there i was trying to do precalc with my dog trying to aggressively lick my face. I got an F.

6347,Agreed I love it hahaha
6348,The students are fine with it so why do you care?
6349,"hahahah i actually checked to make sure but it‚Äôs not, so it‚Äôs a legit offer he‚Äôs making to his students lol"
6350,"...I don't want to be that guy, but this is giving me big ""Dan schneider making write-on-your-feet challenges"" energy..."
6351,"smart idea, the only problem is i‚Äôm not sure if i want to send a video of me eating a lollipop to my male professorüòÇüò≠"
6352,"Not a live bug I guess, but they make candy with whole bugs in it (like lollipops)."
6353,it‚Äôs my geography lab class which isn‚Äôt the weirdest but still doesn‚Äôt exactly make sense with the whole eating a bug thing lol
6354,This lowkey sounds like something he gets sexual arousal from... that or he's bored out of his mind.
6355,What class is this ? Entomology?? Environmental sustainability?? Lol if its a totally unrelated class that‚Äôs even weirder.
6356,[deleted]
6357,"yeahh idk the idea for eating a bug for extra credit was from a student i assumed was joking, i just didn‚Äôt know the professor would actually make it a thing"
6358,"30 points out of 300,000. Deal."
6359,Do something without wings like a worm so it doesn't buzz around. Close your eyes and pretend it is ramen. Swallow and done. Easy peasy
6360,"100% real lmao. here‚Äôs the extra credit assignment details from his canvas page

‚Äú10 points per bug up to 20 points for two bugs.

A single live bug (pet store cricket, worm, etc.) gets you 30 points!!‚Äù"
6361,What the hell lmao
6362,"Sh*t, never thought something like this could happen. Is this real thing?"
6363,"Just eat one of those fried crickets you can get in a bag. They're apparently delicious, they taste like potato chips if you can get over the mental aspect."
6364,"I‚Äôm pretty sure I had the same professor, LOL. It was epic."
6365,"Eat an ant. Take the easy way out. I accidentally drank a can of soda after ants had gotten to it... I‚Äôd only put it down for a second I swear. Anyway, a little ant wouldn‚Äôt hurt. üêú"
6366,So uh...we‚Äôre just not gonna talk about how he calls his students ‚ÄúMinions‚Äù...?
6367,"oh god the ant soda hahahah. but eating an ant was my first thought, but sadly he wants it to be at least the size of a small cricket or worm and idk if i can make myself do that lol"
6368,Good thinking üòÖ
6369,You could even set it in a container of ground up graham crackers so it won't taste like dirt
6370,hahahaha oh god idk if i wasn‚Äôt so terrified of bugs this would be the easiest 30 points ever but i just don‚Äôt think i can do it lmao
6371,ive tried them. they aren't too bad but they are not even close to even the shittiest chips lol
6372,"The easiest I can think of is crickets. They sell them as snacks, they come in different flavorings."
6373,Don't eat crickets if you have a shellfish allergy btw
6374,"it‚Äôs a physical geography course, so kinda makes sense kinda doesn‚Äôt lol"
6375,Boy you guys uhhh don‚Äôt get out much
6376,Tequila worm
6377,class feedback gone wrong
6378,I guess I'm the only weirdo who would report this to the Dean and probably the President of the school. If it is real it is wildly unethical.
6379,"Moreover, in person tests *require* that the professor answer any logistical questions or clarifications of what the test is asking that you need. That‚Äôs non-negotiable. 

My engineering professor told us ahead of time to feel free to hit him up on Teams or an email during a 90 min exam he would be available for the duration of, as a way to cope with the online situation. There is zero reason this professor should have given a zero when the student used the device the test was taken on solely to communicate with the instructor."
6380,"
The wording just seems so bizarre here. What do they mean ‚Äúbeing on an electronic device‚Äù when you literally have to take a test online? Are there written instructions for the test you can reference? Maybe the prof have thought open book meant print only (no online?). 

The whole thing is super nonsensical, especially since by your account you emailed the professor after the exam was over. Therefore, the only thing you did ‚Äúwrong‚Äù during the exam was take the screenshot - emailing prof on your own time after you were done really should have no bearing on this. Might be an angle you can use while fighting this."
6381,"THIS RIGHT HERE.

Edit: I do think you should be made aware anything that could be screenshot/considered a cheating method shouldn't be used. In the future, if you're given an open book exam, just write down the question and email if to your prof that way - as if you remembered it, not verbatim. That way they don't have evidence you may have cheated.

That's going to be the issue here - she'll say you ""cheated"" and you'll have to defend yourself. You'll need to talk to the dean of the department and give solid reasons why you didn't think that was cheating and that you haven't shared the info with any other student. Just tread carefully, but definitely talk to her again, escalate to the dean, and escalate further as needed until someone does something. Make it clear you did not cheat and you need to be allowed y graduate on time."
6382,"I find the situation bizarre as well, the test was online on the compuer so I had to be on the computer. The test involved accessing databases to collect information, the professor even mentioned it being allowed. 

I am willing to accept punishment for the screenshot if it really effects my professor that much however, I don't see how a 0 is justified."
6383,"Damn, what a prick! I can‚Äôt help but I Hope you manage to get this sorted out!"
6384,[deleted]
6385,"Definitely try to appeal it, maybe email her again? Not sure if emailing the department head is appropriate"
6386,"I'm going to guess the line here was taking a screenshot, which you could then share with others to show them what's on the test. Most schools or professors have some kind of restrictions in place for that. However, taking a screenshot should not earn you a 0. Being caught sharing them with others is what should be punished if that is in fact what you're doing.

Furthermore, from the sound of it, this test was designed horrendously. A test that wont let you go back and change an answer is ridiculous. Answers should never be locked in until you submit the entire test. Imagine if you were taking the test in person and you weren't allowed to use your eraser."
6387,"Wait, if you couldn't backtrack to change your answer, how could you go back to take a screenshot. I'm confused. Am I missing something?"
6388,"Ok, but in what world are you allowed to go back and say ""hey after finishing the test, I realize I got an answer wrong, can I change it?"" That's not how tests usually work. And I have noticed that tests have some pretty strict technology rules since they're having to do them online. They don't want people cheating or giving answers/questions away. Taking screen shots of tests questions has the potential to compromise the test. It's weird to me no one here is thinking of these things. It's not a free for all. It seems obvious to me you shouldn't be taking screen shots of test questions."
6389,"It‚Äôs likely that the syllabus states that if you make copies of any questions, your entire test will be invalidated. 

The teacher may believe that you took screenshots of every question, posted them on Chegg, and emailed her after you found out from someone else that your answer was wrong. 

You can try pleading your case to the department chair, but if the question turns up on Chegg, it‚Äôs going to be bad for you. 

If you are really worried you‚Äôll fail the class, request a meeting with your academic advisor first and ask how to proceed."
6390,Nope you are right I worded it wrong. I took a screenshot of the question after it telling her the previous question I had put the wrong answer.
6391,I would do this + CC the dean on the email. Some professors won't take action unless they know their supervisor is aware of the situation.
6392,Might as well CC President Trump too
6393,[deleted]
6394,"It‚Äôs not the manager at Arby‚Äôs. There is a proper procedure for tackling this. First, I‚Äôd talk with the prof. Good chance we aren‚Äôt getting the whole story or there was a miscommunication on one side or the other. Verify this. 

Then, it makes sense to speak to the dept chair. I‚Äôd hardly call this ‚Äúreporting this‚Äù but the department chair will seek to resolve it. 

If that doesn‚Äôt lead to a satisfactory resolution, then speak to the dean. 

Idk, saying ‚Äúreport it‚Äù makes it sound like retail, not academia.  Students aren‚Äôt customers and faculty aren‚Äôt employees tasked with serving students."
6395,"Perhaps the professor, like you, does not understand the difference between a screenshot and a photo."
6396,"You‚Äôre making a fair point. OP needs to really make sure they were no violating any policies stated in the syllabus or otherwise before escalating the issue to higher authorities. Also 
just wanted to let you know there is a proctoring program used by my school called lockdown browser. It doesn‚Äôt let you go back to the previous question once you‚Äôve moved onto the next one. You can‚Äôt even view the previous question let alone change the answer."
6397,"and biden too, just in case the issue takes a few months to resolve"
6398,keep us updated on what happens. i feel bad for you bc it definitely doesn't seem like you had any bad intentions & that you just made a mistake & honestly i can see myself doing something like this.
6399,Make the United Nations aware of the situation incase you have to escalate
6400,That‚Äôs sort of what I was wondering too. You can‚Äôt screenshot questions because that opens up the potential to share the answers and whatnot with peers and online. I‚Äôve never seen a professor that would be on board with this.
6401,"Am professor. You are getting a ton of bad advice. You are in a position that is inherently less in power than the professor you are at odds with. That‚Äôs why you need to use the system to fight rather than an emotional appeal of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not fair.‚Äù Escalating immediately to your dean will make you look reactionary and petulant. 

First, look into the process to how to appeal class grade/individual grades assignments. 
Second, use that avenue to pursue this to the eventual end. That is the only way you could possibly get what you want. 

I highly recommend that you meet with the professor to ask why your specific actions were deemed cheating. Might also request that the department chair be present. If they don‚Äôt have a valid policy based reason they are caught and will have to change it. But be aware that you will be burning a bridge with this professor the more you push this issue. That is not to say don‚Äôt do it but keep it in mind that they could also cause you problems later if you take them for another class."
6402,"I think you‚Äôre being overly critical. ‚ÄúReport it‚Äù to me means exactly what you said, and I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôve already tried to clarify this with the professor.

Also, if professors aren‚Äôt employees there to provide a service to students, then what exactly are they? Those students are paying a lot of money to be taught by that professor. This isn‚Äôt a fast food restaurant, but they are definitely customers. Students are paying a company/institution for a service, which the company/institution is fulfilling via the labor of one of its employees."
6403,"Exactly this.  Yet again, /r/college's default response is ""complain to the manager"" rather than acting like an adult and having a discussion with the professor.

Talk to the professor and ask what you should have done in this situation.  ""I realized I had incorrectly marked an answer and the exam doesn't allow returning to a question and changing it... I took a screenshot of the question so I could include the image when I contacted you after the exam for guidance on this matter.  I don't understand your comment about 'being on an electronic device', as the exam was administered online, so every student was on a device.  Could you explain your reasoning for the 0 score you gave me and how you would have preferred I handle this situation?""

Be an adult; use your words.

edit:  AH! from another comment, it appears that the student is told their answer is wrong after moving on to the next question.  So AFTER being told the answer was wrong, then OP decided she wanted to change it.  At that point, you just have to let it go.  Talk to the prof about reverting the zero, but you have no basis to request being allowed to change an individual answer after you've been told your answer was wrong."
6404,I would say if the prof is being unreasonable it isn‚Äôt wise to try email again. I would go the academic chair for the course in that case.
6405,"the issue is that you are taking screen shots of questions on the test, although its not cheating, it is def not allowed there is a reason why you cant go back on the test. 

try to appeal but in my eyes your in the wrong, you cant take pictures of a test . ever"
6406,"She probably assumed you were taking pictures to send it to other people. 

It‚Äôs also probably against the rules to take pictures because some teachers reuse test questions (even when we took paper tests many professors didn‚Äôt let us take the test home or take pictures of it). 

I would try explaining the situation to her, and telling her that you took a picture of only that question with the sole intention of sending it to her and that you hadn‚Äôt realized it was against the rules. Then you might ask her if there is anything you can do to fix it."
6407,Thats not what a screenshot is.
6408,"My question is, why did you think it'd be ok for you to change the answer in the first place? If other students can't do it neither should you"
6409,"That's the funny thing. They aren't going to put a single cent towards my education. They always jump me for not being financially responsible enough in their opinion, but when I try to save myself thousands of dollars they are displeased with me."
6410,"I saved so much going to community college, even having to pay for it. Nobody cares where you go just where you get a degree from.
Tip: if you're planning on transferring to a 4-year, make sure all the classes you're taking will transfer!"
6411,"i have seen it so many times, unreal.  here is whats really going on.  your parents dont really care about school.  what they really CARE that you go to big name school so they can brag about you to their friends.  your step mom def has someone she hates and that persons kid going to big name school. thats eats her from inside. welcome to ""keeping up with joneses"" world.  the worst thing here is, noone gonna help you pay your student loans later on.  after 4 years you will be left alone.  so dont borrow a single dollar. your step mom just wants to rub it in to someone at your expense.  no no no"
6412,"As a CC professor, you‚Äôre not alone. I hear this same comment from so many of my students, BUT they easily transfer to 4 year universities and get the same prestigious degree but half the cost. Fuck the haters. You‚Äôre doing the right thing for you.

That transfer institution will be happy to hear about that conference."
6413,"A good way to do this is know what four year you plan on going to and each semester contact the four year and verify (I say email is best), that the classes will transfer. That is what my friend has been told when she told a four year she is planning on transferring to them after a community college."
6414,"Bad idea, they'll stop after a few semesters and tell op to care of it himself cause he's an adult otherwise he would have wasted money and time on the few semesters already"
6415,Sue your parents if they don‚Äôt pay for your college. Only on Reddit do you find this advice lmao.
6416,"It seems like they have a bias against community college. I'd simply ask them to research community colleges to understand that they're a viable option for education and at the end of day, you're no worse off going to one. Saves money, similar education, goes towards the same degrees. It seems like they heard a few bad things about them an based their entire opinion and knowledge of them off of that."
6417,"Bruh someone at my community college managed to transfer to harvard XD

&#x200B;

Going to a community college doesn't really define how smart a person is or how sucessful somebody will be. I have friends I went to high school with earn 4.0 gpa or higher and they are in a CC. 

I have an associates degree and some credits and I will be starting pharmacy school this august"
6418,"Constantly verify, this is good advice."
6419,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with attending a community college. I would actually wager that there are some benefits of attending one vs. a university aside from financial reasons. 

1. Better faculty:student ratio. At CC my gen eds had at most 35-40 students per class. Office hours were accessible for everyone who utilized them. Use them. My best recommendation letters came from the relationships I built with faculty at my CC. 
2. Opportunities were not nearly as competitive. I joined several clubs and received officer positions in 3 of them during the 1 1/2 years I was there. 
3. Opportunity to finish associate's degree quicker. I finished mine in 1.5yrs 
4. Tutoring is accessible and far less competitive for time vs the university i'm at now. I spent several hours a week with chemistry/math/writing center tutors at my CC which really helped me out. 
5. Associate's degree transferred seamlessly to my in-state public uni. (this requires knowing what degree you'll pursue at uni to make sure you're enrolled in the correct program at CC). Some classes that have funny transfer rules are usually math/major specific courses. 
6. While I was currently enrolled in CC, I was accepted (for the next summer) at a competitive internship with the federal govt, and I won an award from the well known professional society in my field that was quite prestigious. It later became obvious that because I was at a CC I was given slightly higher consideration for these things because of diversity/inclusion etc. If you truly are making an effort to be a good student and achieve something, having a CC on your transcript is NOT going to hold you back from achieving those awesome things. Instead it makes you stand out from the others who chose CC because that's the only place that would accept them. (if i'm being truthful my HS gpa was a 2.7, CC was my only option). I did not let it hold me back from being successful later on. 

In summary, i'm graduating with my BS this may, and have been accepted to grad school. If I had the choice to go back and change anything, I would still have gone to CC. The benefits are worth it."
6420,"I did not know there was still a stigma. I did 2 years of community college (well, many more than that, but that was my pacing), got an associates, entered university as a junior and it cost me almost nothing on either side. Is your mom paying for it?"
6421,Community college is honestly no different than regular college or university. It‚Äôs just significantly cheaper. Education is exactly the same for the quarter of the price.
6422,"Dude I regret my decision to not do what you‚Äôre doing so bad. Don‚Äôt listen or let their judgement bother you. It‚Äôs the right thing to do, especially if you are paying for it yourself. Just think of the debt you are saving yourself from having. That alone is more worth it than anything they can say to you."
6423,"My friend graduated from CS at CMU. The boy can be unemployed for a year, but will still get a job at a drop of a hat. That too at any of the big companies"
6424,"If your community college has a strong relationship with the school you plan on transferring to, there's also a good chance that there's a dedicated transfer advisor who can help you with this. The community college system in my state has strong ties with the public universities, and they all have staff who exist to help you plan your courses to achieve a smooth transfer to most of the four year public universities in our state."
6425,"Specifically with email or in writing, and save the emails so 2 years later if there are issues (policies change sometimes!) you can forward those emails back to them and secure the credit transfer."
6426,This reminds of me of my dad lol
6427,True..but slightly unrelated to the comment you replied to
6428,"That's why I said email is best. If they have a policy change or change the course you can always ask for a waiver. Versus ""I spoke to John Doe and he said it should be okay... I think..."" you can go on this date as printed off John Doe and I communicated about my spring classes at Awesome Community College."
6429,"OP I was in an almost identical situation. I‚Äôve been struggling with financial stress/insecurity since I was 16 and got my first job because I understood the importance of financial literacy because I was going at all of this pretty much alone. I‚Äôm currently in my second year of community college (although, I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äúcollege floater‚Äù because I‚Äôve just been taking classes here and there to decided what I want to do, instead of taking classes with a specific major in mind), and I promise that you are making a really good decision. Not only are you literally saving money on two years worth of tuition, but you‚Äôre also giving yourself the chance to work part-time (more comfortably), save up for a car or whatever else you need, you age out of the dorm requirement (for my state) so you‚Äôll save money on living expenses. Not to mention the benefits of getting involved in CC, such as different clubs or organizations, honor societies, especially your CC‚Äôs Phi Theta Kappa chapter. 

People will shit on you and your decisions for the rest of time because they think they know what‚Äôs best for you based on their self-conceived standards if you. Don‚Äôt let this affect the plans you make based on what you believe is best for you."
6430,"Oh this is the dumbest unless that person is has a boatload of money waiting to pay for ALL your college tuition.  You'll be laughing all the way to the bank when you graduate.  Parents/adults of influence that pressure kids in the name of ""prestige"" are absolutely ridiculous especially when they don't have a dime in their pocket to back it up.

My kid dual enrolled at a CC for 2 years and is now finishing at a top 15 public university.  He says some of the best teachers and classes he had were at the CC.  Small hands on intimate classes, so great.   CC's are WAY under regarded.  My 2nd kid is dual enrolling right now.  There was just a story in their newsletter about a first gen CC student transferring to MIT."
6431,U will receive the same education for 2 years that u will at a community college lol so they are very materialistic or care ab ur image for whatever reason
6432,"It is sad, but I can 100% see this being the real issue with stepmom."
6433,"no really there are some really smart people who make these decisions because well  they think through and research probable outcomes. they probably realized something about harvard admission process (accepting say 2% of transfers from CC a year) and realized if they had a 4.0 in CC + their essays whatever they had a better chance at getting in then if they applied straight out of HS, which maybe they realized they wouldnt have.

if there is one thing about ivy league students it's that they are intelligent but also they study what it takes to get into them schools and develop a plan. i am not saying they aren't impressive but it was probably part of their plan all along."
6434,"I'm going to go against the crowd on this one, while the place you have a degree from is far more important in the eyes of a recruiter, it's the connections you make at a larger and/or more prestigious college that will take you further in your career. The same thing applies to Greek life as well. That is of course not to say you can't make connections in the two years you're working on a bachelor's degree after CC but it also means missing out on two years."
6435,So it‚Äôs really about what they tell their friends I guess.  Too bad for them.
6436,"Not only that but if you go to a ""real"" university your professor has other obligations such as research that they want/need to do. You'll often see them complaining that they don't have time to teach their students because of this. It's also not uncommon to have a graduate student teaching undergraduate classes. Either that or youll be in a lecture hall with over 100 other students and good luck getting into office hours. 

I don't think I've had a cc class with over 20 people in it and I'm doing all online asynchronous classes."
6437,"This is brief example I understand but your parents sound like they're trying to tell you what they would have done not what is good for you. Also your step mom saying you've chosen mediocrity and nothing is extreme. It's all or nothing thinking. It's also emotionally abusive.

Anyway good on you OP. Stay strong. I know it's not easy."
6438,"as a cc professor as well- I can tell you certain classes like Biology 102, Pre Cal 200, Huminites 150, French 103...those classes are the same content as big name 4 year school. Those lower level 100/200 level classes are going to be the same content regardless of where you take them.  

Yes, different textbook, you might learn z before x or content y might get a tad more coverage than content z...but at the end of the day- the content itself is the same.

The biggest difference besides cheaper cost at a community college?   CLASS SIZE.  CLASS SIZE CLASS SIZE.  I can not stress class size enough.

I can only speak for my CC-
At the CC I teach at- the average class size is 15-18 students.  Vocal Choir you might see 45-50.  Some of the harder classes- say Calculus 3- will only have 7-10 students.  Biology 100 with lab will have say, 18 students while Biology with lab 203 will only have 8-10 students.

Same class at big name 4 year school?  It's not unheard of for the same 200 level class to have 175 students.  A 100 level into to Psychology class have 350 (where at my CC, it's closer to 20 students) So your more likely to have the professor/instructor remember your name at a cc, and more likely to make a connection with him/her and get more one on one help from them than at big name 4 year school."
6439,"I was once walking out of my college apartment to meet a friend. I was turned sround locking my door and I felt eyes on me. I turn to see whos staring and this guy is just deer in headlights, totally still, half way salivating. Our eyes met and he immediatly turns to his friend and just says ""Bro, I thought that chick right there was hot until she turned around! Hahaha!"" And he walked away.

He said that shit 10 feet away, loudly. It was like once he decided I wasn't attractive enough for him I might as well not have existed at all. 

Another time I was walking back from class after no sleep that night, a very long, stressfull day and my acne ws flared up. A random guy on the sidewalk looks me right in the face, and without even passing me, points at me and says to his friend ""You guys see how ugly this bitch is?!""

I might be ugly, those two comments made me think so for a while, but even if I am, fuck those stupid assholes for treating me like literally garbage because a stranger didn't meet their beauty expectations."
6440,"Cat calling is such a weird activity. Hey let me yell my interest in random people's appearance. I wonder what goes on trough their mind before, during and after."
6441,[deleted]
6442,"Any kind of attention is seen as good attention by the catcaller. ""Oh she faked being mad, but she wants me, I can tell."""
6443,I wish I could beat the crap outta those people. That's awful ‚òπÔ∏è
6444,It's about dominance. They are fully aware that it won't make the person they are cat calling respond positively but it makes them feel better. Probably makes them feel like an alpha or something. It's a disgusting practice which's roots are equally disgusting.
6445,"I hate that kind of logic-- tone yourself, tone down femininity to accommodate men. Like the grown up version of ""girls can't wear spaghetti straps because if a boy sees a bare shoulder they're going to lose it."" 

Maybe I'm just mad since my department is very, very male. One of the only female professors I've ever had openly said that she just wore khakis and polos to try and keep from being ostracized, and I hate that she had to resort to that to be heard. Thank you for fighting the good fight!"
6446,Thank you.

6448,"It made me sad then but now when I think of it im just like ""wtf was their problem?"""
6449,Being masc just attracts a different kind of negative attention/shitty dude tbh. And I've been catcalled in a suit before so idk what this lady is on about
6450,This is more sexual harassment than sexual assault
6451,"Sophomore in college here, I had a guy last year messaging me on Snapchat and saying gross things and claiming he‚Äôs seen me around here... definitely made me uncomfortable to be on campus for a while afterwards.
Sorry some people are such pigs :("
6452,Trying to be alpha for the sake of being alpha is obnoxious
6453,"Ugh, how awful. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre able to see it as their problem instead of internalizing their terrible, stupid remarks."
6454,Its also extremely beta
6455,"This reminds me of bojack horseman‚Äôs episode about women having guns.

‚ÄúWhat are my constituents supposed to do? Not compliment random women on the street because they might be having a gun? We can not allow our lives to be dictated by that kind of fear!‚Äù"
6456,"The only response to catcalling is to scream as loud as you can.

Actually no, but I wouldn't blame you if you did that."
6457,"just a few days ago, I was riding my bike and somebody in a car revved their engine super loud as they went by...with the passenger holding a phone up to record.

On the same road, somebody yelled ""hey baby"" and another honked at me - both when I was wearing sweatpants and an oversized, shapeless sweatshirt - the least sexy attire I own. so I think I'll just avoid that road."
6458,Catcalling is about having the opportunity to make someone uncomfortable and not actually about sex.
6459,"It's not a gender problem so please don't apologize, people who are ignorant and don't learn to be critical thinkers are typically the reason of this behavior. It's not just guys who are like this, I've been verbally and sexually harassed by both men and women."
6460,"You really need to understand the difference between expressing interest and harassing somebody. Please, for the love of god, figure this one out.  Expressing interest is respectful. Catcalling, inappropriate remarks from supervisors, and asking your PROFESSOR out IN YOUR ESSAY are not goddamn respectful. And to frame it in more selfish terms, any interest that the person possibly could have had in you is going straight out the fucking window if you treat them like that. I feel bad for boys/men because they are taught a really dreadful set of behaviors. It‚Äôs forgivable to not know any better, but it‚Äôs unforgivable to be willfully ignorant."
6461,"I will never understand why people think it‚Äôs okay to comment on people‚Äôs looks like that at all... there was literally no point in them making you feel bad. Beauty is subjective; even if they legitimately did not find you attractive, they didn‚Äôt have to say it, and for every one douche guy that doesn‚Äôt find you attractive, there‚Äôs likely a half dozen more that do. I bet you those dudes are the same ones who stay up late at night comparing their manhood sizes in the mirror and dreaming about whoever the latest famous model/actress is. They‚Äôll never know meaningful companionship or emotional depth. At least you can take comfort in knowing you can have meaningful relationships if you desire one; all those dudes will ever know is what they pay forü§£ü§£"
6462,"thats fucking stupid

i hate cat calling as much as anyone here

but calling it sexual assault is just stupid and you clearly miss the distinction between actual sexual assualt and sexual harrassment.

it very much downplays what sexual assault actually is.."
6463,[deleted]
6464,"You‚Äôve got to be kidding me.....
You don‚Äôt ask your professor out in an essay. That is so many levels of inappropriate."
6465,"And the implication of telling a random woman that you find them attractive is that you have a right to say that gross stuff and make that kind of public declaration of their desirability to you, therefore an assertion of sexual dominance"
6466,"I remember one time I was walking to my dorm hall. I was wearing a hoodie and sweats, and a group of men catcalled me through their window. : | I could tell what room they were in so I went to their door, rapidly knocked on it to basically ‚Äúding dong ditch‚Äù them. And I heard them scramble and go ‚Äúoh shit that must be the RA, put it away! Put the drinks away!!‚Äù. So I got a little satisfaction from hearing I made them get a jump lol"

6470,"And if you're sick, just stay away from people"
6471,"But what if I have to feel slightly under the weather for a day after getting the shot? Or what if my arm gets a little sore?! Do you REALLY need your kidney that badly???!

6473,"I also just learned that some people can get the flu but not show symptoms, so... yyyyyyeah. Get your shots peeps."
6474,That‚Äôd be nice if my college didn‚Äôt take attendance...
6475,Not everyone has insurance. My school doesn't offer free flu shots so I ended up paying $25 at Walgreens after using goodrx.
6476,Btw only free for some insurance :( had to co-pay $20
6477,Target gives you a $5 gift card if you get the flu shot there :)
6478,ill pay for yours dm me just get a fuckin flu shot boi
6479,"Yupp, don‚Äôt try going to class because you don‚Äôt want to miss it. Get the notes from someone else."
6480,"Glad you said that! My friend has some kind of immunodeficiency, and she can't get any vaccine that contains a live virus or she ends up with the illness herself. She gets sick all the time as it is. It is important to me that people get their proper vaccines + the flu shot, not just to protect themselves, but to protect my friend and anyone else like her. I've also known cancer patients who wore a mask in public because any illness could affect them severely."

Sounds like you just paid for it and didn't even use your insurance."
6484,"If it‚Äôs been going on that long, they should go get checked for a bacterial lung infection. A few days‚Äô worth of antibiotics could clear that right up, and tessalon perles can numb the cough center so their lungs will finally stop freaking out all the time and have a chance to stop being miserable and inflamed.

(General rule of thumb: if a cough lasts ten or more days with little sign of improvement, and it‚Äôs a ‚Äúproductive‚Äù cough ‚Äî aka, gunky ‚Äî there‚Äôs a good shot it‚Äôs bacterial...which means it‚Äôs easy to fix!)"
6485,"God, I usually avoid flu shots since I always seem to get really sick from them but this thread has taught me that whatever sickness I get from flu shots is worth not getting the real flu. Guess I'll be getting my flu shot this year! Who knows, maybe you just saved my life."

It‚Äôs up to the professor to enforce it but most of mine have"
6491,Flu shots shouldn't be charged post-ACA. Did you possibly go to your doctors office and pay a $20 office visit copay?
6492,"That icky feeling you get isn't really from the shot, it's just your body doing exactly what it's supposed to. Vaccines are a kind of training program for your body, so it makes sense that it'll stimulate your immune system to respond. But there's no real threat because the virus is weakened or dead, so any mild fatigue, aches, headaches, or sick feeling is just your mild immune response. Your body is working hard to learn how to fight that virus so it can do a better job when it sees the real thing. It's just a military exercise. 

As long as you get some rest and let it do its thing, you'll be back to normal in 1-2 days."
6493,"Most people don't realize how bad the flu is.  Anything stronger than a mild cold or food borne illness is called ""the flu"" by folks who don't know any better.  The genuine flu is 3 days of shivering and sweating at the same time wondering how long it will take until you die while the muscle aches hold you down.  Get a shot."

Everyone else may as well stop existing once I exit class"

Your group did that presentation. My name is (name)‚Äù and then I give a description of how I look and how they might remember me. It‚Äôs kind of funny, honestly.

6505,same
6506,"Not really. I‚Äôve got 3 friends in my major that take the same classes, but now that we are juniors and branch out into our own concentrations, I only have 1 or 2 of them in the actual same classes as me now.

I can still consult them with questions when we aren‚Äôt in the same class though.

It‚Äôs really nice to have help from friends, but I don‚Äôt mind struggling through it on my own. Sometimes it might take an hour or two to reach a conclusion on my own without help, but it‚Äôs worth it because I‚Äôm learning. RIP my sleep schedule though lol"

6516,"I interact with less outside of class, or at least this year because of covid"
6517,"Ah, you say this as if I have any friends currently at school. All (3) of my college friends are online AND in a different major"
6518,Damn
6519,"Hey same here. I actually don't even have any friends in my major. Social anxiety really gets the best of me, so I like to work alone, and if I have a question, either I figure it out or email a professor"
6520,"I've been in a tiny ass department where everyone knew each other and every semester you had class with the same people. I don't think it actually made anyone friends with each other, it just made student/professor interaction more awkward"
6521,"Lol, no, that much math would kill me
I'm an American Studies major"
6522,How are people outside your major supposed to help you with stuff
6523,"I go to a fairly small school and am in one of the less popular majors, and I‚Äôd say I at least know everyone in the year above and below me by their face. We all tend to set up study groups and there‚Äôs a dedicated lab for only us to do work in. I think those steps help a lot to make us reach out to each other. Still, yes, I‚Äôve only helped at most thirty people in my major with homework or questions, and I‚Äôve only ever asked three people for help besides my professors."
6524,0 I don‚Äôt even know a name
6525,"By the end of my degree, I was just spending all day with the same ~30 people. All major classes so all people in my major."

6527,"It‚Äôs I, the one who does not interact with those in my classes outside of class."
6528,"I think it depends on the school. At first I went to a small college, so they would often host meet and greets for various majors, some of which were mandatory. Then I transferred to a state school and I only know other English majors who I have classes with or who are in leadership positions."
6529,"Well they‚Äôre not stopping using personal devices on cell data so if you just use a vpn on your phone they can‚Äôt prove it was on their network. Really simple fix they can‚Äôt do anything about

6530,VPN my dude. University can't see where your traffic goes if it goes through a VPN
6531,I mean what could possibly go wrong with downloading a backdoor for the CCP?
6532,"I have mixed feelings towards this. A part of me don't really care because it's just an app and it's not nationwide. (Yet.) Along with how I saw some of the most toxic trends start there.

Another part of me feel sort of bad for those who like the app. I myself grew to love the app because some of the content creators really do put their heart and soul into the content they make. I learned so much from people there in terms of relationship advice, signs of trauma (by experts of course), and stuff that generally either helps me in the long run or just brighten my day. Also, I discovered so much music on Tiktok that I never would have found without it!"
6533,I work in cybersecurity. I think TikTok should be banned from the US. It‚Äôs a thinly veiled tool to send unbelievable amounts of your data to one of the most oppressive government on the planet. You think the data Google is collecting is bad? You have no idea
6534,"Not when vpns are for the most part blocked. 

Proof: am student. Commercial vpns don't work. Have to use my own server that I setup at home"
6535,"The problem is that the Chinese government has a backdoor to it, and all your data gets sent offshore and put under their control.

That's why the US government is so concerned about TikTok."
6536,"I remember students telling me a few years back that the university banned the patch server for the game World of Warcraft.  Students who lived on campus couldn't update their game, so they had to go off campus to do it."

6542,"The problem is not your personal individual information, that that they have info on a huge amount of people. With this data they can make databases on, say, what political leanings are strongest in which age groups. With this they can better target propaganda and promote internal division of the country. They can do this kinda of research with age, political leaning, shopping habits, location, users and passwords, financial info, etc. The issue is having a comprehensive database on US citizen info that they can use to develop cyber warfare, misinformation, propaganda, etc."
6543,"I think the fact a large number of students live on campus puts this into a new context. What would you think of your ISP restricting certain websites on your home network?

I'm saying this as a long time skeptic/critic of Tiktok. I think this is an overreach by the uni. If you agree with the school, consider if you'd still hold that position if this was YouTube or some other platform"
6544,"According to the recent stats published, ""Chinese backdoor"" is a very popular search in the Midwest. Someone must be downloading it on purpose."
6545,"Any social media on government networks and devices should be banned. All of em are potentially data sponges for adversaries. Our adversaries had no trouble getting the data before TT and will have the same amount of trouble post. No business not explicitly for government function should stay off of those networks. IMO student networks should be physically separated from networks devoted to research and  government contracts and research could be pulled, one way, into the student network via a portal. Singling out TT without doing any of the other leg work is locking the door but leaving the window open."
6546,"This is weird as hell. I'm heard of highschools blocking certian apps and websites which makes sense because one, the students are minors and two, it's a strictly education environment. But banning adults- adults who are paying customers- from using an app anytime they are on campus (which for om campus students means always- even during free time) is completely ridiculous and insane"
6547,"I think you‚Äôre right. I graduated from the university of Oklahoma this week and I got the email about it being banned on university owned and operated devices, including all wifi networks."
6548,"My uni blocks VPNs, that's why I bought a yearly subscription in the summer when I'm at home. It can't prevent me from launching the app, only accessing the website."
6549,"As somebody who lived in OKC from the north east, it‚Äôs always been hillariously dumb to me that OU is the University of Oklahoma. Shouldn‚Äôt they be UO or U of O? 

The whole thing is so Oklahoma. Where local government officials campaign on making the state vegetable the watermelon."
6550,"It's not though. ""TikTok collects user data"" is not remotely the same thing as ""TikTok secretly records you through your camera and microphone outside of the app and sends it to the Chinese government"". 

""do some research"" isn't an adequate answer unless you're a flat earther or antivaxxer or something. You'd think a subreddit full of college students would understand the need for reliable and verifiable sources."
6551,Maybe Ohio University?
6552,"No it‚Äôs not. Trust me, YouTube shorts is BY FAR the worst. Tiktok has original content creators and content creators with uninspired content. ALL YOUTUBE SHORTS are uninpired and shitty content"
6553,No way they're a huge party school they wouldn't ban tiktok
6554,"I have yet to see someone at my college using tik Tok, but it was pretty much everywhere in high school. I think the same rule could pass at my college and students would be (mostly) happy"
6555,"You think they're doing this because they care about your data?  Zuckerberg probably gets the same data, if not more, and he's selling it off to the same Chinese companies. Banning Tiktok has nothing to do about privacy, but everything with the ""China bad"" narrative."

6559,Yep üò¨ that's why I came forward even though everyone is saying I was tricked. I didn't want to take the chance.
6560,"Disclaimer: I am not condoning cheating or advocating for it in anyway, that being said:

If you were smart enough to use a spam email and fake name, there is no way for your professor to trace that back to you and he or she was hoping people would come forward for that reason."
6561,"All I can say is. You did the right thing. You came forward. You didn't have to but you did anyways. Chegg is great for studying and what not but as you said you didn't go looking for answers but got them and used them. But you were upfront and honest. A zero is a better outcome than what will happen to those who don't take the step you did. 

I've heard stories about how people cheated and could've gotten away with it if they hadn't caused a fuss about a simple zero. They fussed and utimately got expelled for cheating and possibly criminal charges brought up (they hacked a site to get the answers to a open book open person open pretty much anything except the internet test) all because they refused to take a zero for the test and that's it.

So in the end you were a lot smarter than most people. And you owned up to your choice and mistake. And that's something to be proud of."
6562,"Chegg is a fuccing snitch. 

All my classmates in my stats class got banned from their chegg accounts for ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù when using it for literal help on how to do the homework. It sucks all around"

6564,What‚Äôs an XF? Like an Xtreme F? Like you ‚Äúsuper failed!‚Äù?
6565,I got rid of my chegg account so I wouldn‚Äôt get the urge to use it.
6566,"How would they get the info of those who accessed the questions? Unless the police actually contacts Chegg with a subpoena (which is really drastic) i don‚Äôt think that they would ever divulge that information, you were dumb for cheating, but even dumber for ratting on yourself when the ‚Äúcome forward‚Äù was clearly a setup."
6567,XF is used to denote a course that you failed for an academic integrity violation or at some schools if you withdrew from the class after the refund period lapsed.
6568,"I work on Chegg, Chemistry to be precise and I can tell mostly which questions are being asked because the student doesn't get the concept and which question is being copy-pasted. I write my explanation the same for every single one of the questions and I am very happy you took the time to read what was going on. About Chegg's part, Yes Chegg will release the list of people who either upvoted, downvoted the answer, or the one asked the question(I am not too sure about the access part). You may have been baited but don't feel bad. You felt guilty for cheating that's why you came forward and that really shows you are a good human being."

6570,"For those wanting to go to grad school, law school, medical school this is definitely still important. If you wish to get an internship at some places they will still look at your transcript if your a student, some first jobs will still look at your transcript (HR will) or scholarships that could be pending, list goes on...."
6571,"You did something wrong, you knew it was wrong, you took the consequences, you learned from it. 

Hold your head up. You‚Äôre a good person and a good student. Good for you."
6572,"check r/professors for similar threads if you‚Äôre curious. (please don‚Äôt post/comment/harrass them for this.) chegg will provide names, time stamps, and IP addresses of who accessed a given question if asked."
6573,"Ip address can't be used to identify an individual. Unless you buy a static one, ips change all the time."
6574,Never ever connect accounts where you might engage in ethically questionable behaviors. Use VPN technologies to access and post. NEVER give them your real name - you are under no obligation to do so.
6575,"It also gives you access to detailed solution manuals for textbook problems, which is invaluable for understanding how to do difficult problems. It has purposes outside of cheating."
6576,Ip addresses are useless to find you in a case like this. You got tricked into confessing. I'm not saying don't cheat... But you didn't need to come clean.
6577,"Chegg provides IP addresses that you access the site from. If you were on the school's network when you accessed Chegg, they will know exactly who you are. If you accessed Chegg from home or another network, the school IT can easily corelate your IP address to your school account from when you accessed any school systems (email, blackboard, etc)."
6578,"Haha yeah I didn't want to put any blame on the professor as this is my mistake only, however let's just say I was one out of like 30 kids that did the same thing. And if you cant tell by our exam averages, he isn't the best teacher üò¨ oh well."
6579,Cheating probably isn't an actual crime - at least not in my jurisdiction. There probably nothing illegal about it.
6580,"If you're on my network, I know what IP is assigned to your machine.  That is super basic network administration.

Furthermore, if you're not on my network (say at home) but if you user a username and password access my systems (e.g., Canvas), I know what IP address you're using at that moment.  And if I see that same IP address in a list I get from Chegg that covers the same time frame, I know that IP address belongs to you.

The only thing I can't prove is that you were the very human being sitting at that computer when Chegg was accessed.  But we're also not trying to prove the point beyond all reasonable doubt.  A preponderance of the evidence will suffice."
6581,This was probably because more than one person was using one account
6582,">  If my exams are not locked down, it‚Äôs implied it‚Äôs open note and they don‚Äôt report you for using resources

Ummm... no. It means that your professor is trying to respect your integrity and privacy. Don't abuse their respect."
6583,"That's very admirable of you to come forward and do this. Growth sometimes is painful, but necessary."
6584,I get paid a dollar and a half per question. Thats why when people post all the big assignments with 10 questions. Most of us answer 1 at the top. Because according to Chegg we only have to answer the top question.
6585,"> Chegg is a fuccing snitch.

A corporation has no obligation to protect their consumer if said consumer is engaging in an 'illegal' activity, that being cheating as it is against a school's policy.  Like, c'mon bro lol"
6586,how about a VPN?
6587,"Not true! Chegg can not disclose any payment information, including the cardholders name."
6588,I heard they can track VIA IP addresses
6589,"Take it this way: Yes, you do have to drink.  You don't have to drink alcohol, but just having a glass in your hand will make everybody feel better."
6590,"Why can‚Äôt one just say, ‚Äú I‚Äôm drinking water because I like water.‚Äù"
6591,"Get a cup, fill it up with water, drink that all night. If anyone questions why your drinking water just say your pacing yourself and don‚Äôt want to puke/blackout/be hung over tomorrow."
6592,"Can I add - if you DO become interested in drinking, learn some alcohol safety first. Learn how many drinks would get you tipsy then drunk based on your weight. Learn what signs are for alcohol poisoning and how to handle that kind of emergency (call 911). Drink your first time around people you trust, and just try to observe how you feel after a drink or two. Don't drink more just because you're feeling good, at a certain point drinking more doesn't increase the good, fun part of drinking, you just make yourself more at risk of getting sick or blacking out. Eat food and hydrate before you drink, drink water while you drink. Don't drink in college without friends around, it's really important to be able to look out for one another, especially at larger parties. Always keep an eye on your drink. Don't drink to cope with mental illness, instead seek out healthy coping mechanisms, therapy, etc. Never drink and drive, and never ride with someone who's had alcohol or is under the influence of any other substances. 

Those are just some basic tips. Good luck, and yes, you do not have to drink at all if you don't want to. Good friends won't care and will respect your choices. If you don't like being around when they drink, if they're good friends, they'll be cool with trying to do things other than party / incorporate some hangouts that aren't centered around drinking. (But if they're just having a drink or two, it really won't make much of a difference when hanging out with them. There is a difference in a casual drink and ""drinking"" as the main reason for the hangout)"
6593,"Join some clubs, make friends with your neighbors/dorm mates, reach out to people in your classes/major! Truth be told, it‚Äôs pretty rare that the folks you first meet at random parties are gonna become good friends. Not that they can‚Äôt, just that it‚Äôs rare.

And there‚Äôs also the safety aspect of showing up to these parties solo, especially if you‚Äôre female :)"
6594,That's basically every encounter I've ever had no one's going to pressure you to do shit .I have never seen that happen. And if you're at a party where people are pressuring you that is not the party you want to be at.
6595,"Recently graduated senior here (that still feels so weird to say‚Ä¶)

During my four years, I was never pressured to drink or smoke when I didn‚Äôt feel like it, nor did I receive any shit from anyone for turning it down. 

Obviously my experience isn‚Äôt the be all end all, but if you find yourself around people who are genuinely pressuring you or giving you a hard time over it, they aren‚Äôt worth it. 

If you do party, drink, or try any substances during your time college, do so under your own free will. And above all else, be safe!"
6596,This.
6597,"True and they also say ‚Äúgood, don‚Äôt start. It‚Äôs bad for you.‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ"
6598,"Because then you'd look like a healthy, responsible student üòâ"
6599,And realize the friends made partying are not always the best
6600,"This isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Most successful people in college are sociable, balanced individuals that do attend parties while still maintaining their academics. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with not partying, but most college kids do."
6601,"If you don‚Äôt have time to make friends, how are you going to have time to go to parties? Why would they invite you if you don‚Äôt have time?"
6602,But what if you have no friends or don't know anyone?
6603,You will feel included even if you dont party. I didn't party and I barely drank and I was very much included and had a good time.
6604,"Well, the best way to get invited is to socialize and make friends from people in your dorm, your class, or from you clubs. 

You spend a lot of time on reddit, so you could take some of the time you spend on reddit and devote it to socializing and meeting people."
6605,but but i want to feel included :(
6606,"No. I am selfish and want to see my friends again. I‚Äôve been fully vaxxed for a couple months and followed all precautions while my friends across the country didn‚Äôt give a fuck and partied. I‚Äôm tired of being in isolation. Now a year from the start of the pandemic I‚Äôm frankly tired of this, I‚Äôm going back to normal."
6607,"Asking the right questions.

The answer is: you can, and you should. You don't owe anyone anything."
6608,"And also learn the signs of [alcohol intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction), or ""Asian flush"":

> Nausea and vomiting.

> Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart palpitations.

> Hypotension (low blood pressure).

> Throbbing headache, fatigue and other hangover-like symptoms.

> Stuffy nose.

> Diarrhea.

> Worsening asthma.

Basically, if you feel like utter shit after only a few drinks, and feel sorta hungover very quickly, **stop drinking**. It's a genetic condition. Your body can't process alcohol properly and you're poisoning yourself - even more than is normal. If you keep drinking, you're at significantly higher risk of cancer. And your intolerance will never go away, no matter how much you drink. It will always, always suck for you and then you will get throat cancer. 

If you're East Asian, there's a 30-50% chance you have alcohol intolerance (hence the ""Asian"" part of ""Asian flush"")."
6609,"Yep.. or, ""naw man I'm still recovering from last night"""
6610,"A lot of my friends were people I studied and did homework with. If you do something similar then you should be able to have time for friends, even if you don‚Äôt hangout outside of academics too much."
6611,"If you do choose to party make sure you get a pair of shit shoes,  I mean a pair of shoes that look nice but you don't care if they get ruined because they will get ruined. There's a lot of spilled beer vomit and other things on various basement floors And you will be walking through it. on a side note Do yourself a favor if you want to wear heels wear boots with closed toes,  Just trust me on this more than one of my female friends has gotten unpleasant things on their feet because they wore heels to a party.. If you are going clubbing and not to frat party  You might be OK with the heels but just have a pair of flat shoes that that you think are cute but you don't give a crap about to wear to parties and that sort of thing because trust me by the end of your 2nd quarter there will be a great deal of destruction associated with o'shoes and they will be in bad condition you're probably just going to want to toss them at the end of the year and get a new pair for the following year if you choose to drink and party"
6612,"i so agree with this, it might be fun while youre at it but soon theyre useless as friends üôÉ"
6613,then you don't have time to party
6614,"because they surround themselves with garbage people. Any one with reasonable friends respect decisions of others like actual adults. I'm absolutely dumbfounded this post even needed to be posted. No wonder older people always refer to college students as ""kids"" clearly they can't even think for themselves."
6615,"Can confirm that I've been to a lot of parties where people were using drugs but never bugged anyone to try it and dropped the issue once I said ""I'm good"". Shit's too expensive to hand out like candy"
6616,"This is a good reminder. You can still go out and meet people, but just hold the same cup all night long or drink water or the chaser. People should not feel pressured to do more than they feel comfortable.

I went to a ""party school"", where just about everyone partied. But most people knew how to turn off the switch at the right time to get stuff done. Find your own pace and don't forget why you're at school in the first place."
6617,"Youll also be offered a drink a lot less, so if you're like me and you like to go out and you do sometimes drink but it's not really your thing you'll feel a lot less pressure/ uncomfortable not drinking."
6618,I was gonna say depends on the major too. I went to an engineering college and it was very much a party hard and study hard mentality those that couldn't balance it had to reevaluate. Some people partied way too hard but still got good grades with minimal effort. But still it varies from person to person.
6619,[deleted]
6620,we still have to buy the $100 online subscription to turn in the homework for the class
6621,"I mean atleast the watch will have a use after the class is over unlike the textbooks that sit in the closet. No but really thats super classist, but so is all of college."
6622,"As an instructor this pisses me the hell off (That they would require it). It reeks of entitlement, cluelessness, and privilege."
6623,Can't you just use your phone? I have Samsung health and the Nike running app and they monitor speed and time. Ask the professor if you should give them your bank routing number.
6624,Going off the syllabus it doesn't look like it. Why they wouldn't accept that as an alternative beats the hell out of me. I wish the school would just save time and drain my bank account in one go instead of giving me a million different things to buy.
6625,"Nah man, switch that class. Find a different section of the class. There has to be a different prof that teaches it that hasn‚Äôt lost their marbles."
6626,They gonna give you the money?ü§®
6627,"I didn't even realize gym classes were needed for graduation, let alone golf classes lol

What's the 90 degree cart rule? Also, what were your marked on? Accuracy or just participation"
6628,"I wasn't sure why this made me so annoyed, but your comment hit the nail on the head for me. It just feels like they don't understand some students are paying for college out of there own pocket."
6629,I understand requiring a pedometer which you can get for a fairly inexpensive price but I think buying a smart watch is a bit ridiculous
6630,"Lmao, that's a good one."
6631,"That the amount of money for it, books, etc is equatable."
6632,"Not OP but


‚ÄúThe 90-degree rule means that a golfer is supposed to drive their cart along the cart path until the cart has reached a point where a 90-degree turn would cause the cart to drive laterally across the fairway directly to the ball.‚Äù From Google

Essentially, you‚Äôre meant to park your golf cart on the same lateral line as where your ball lies."
6633,"Fair point, I suppose this is just leaving a poor taste in my mouth because you have to buy the Fitbit in addition to all of the other course material. Plus this is only required because of covid-19 so it feels like they're forcing us to pay more money for less instruction."
6634,"A lot of your statements aren't really all that true, and it shows since it's clear you haven't golfed before. I really don't mean to be rude to you, but maybe try changing your perspective a little bit. Yes, I agree for conservation it is quite horrible. Yes, I agree it produces some rich douchebags who only talk about their country club. Yes, some people roll in a golf cart only.

But look at things on the other side. Let me first say this comes from the perspective of someone who primarily plays basketball and trains for powerlifting. Some of the rules in golf are ridiculous, but they're there for a reason. The 90 degree cart rule, for example, is set in place so the course doesn't get completely ravaged and run over. Also, pros, and many other people walk 18 holes. I know you haven't golfed before, because walking 18 holes is absolutely brutal. That, on top of carrying a 20+ lb bag and being precise and exact with over 70 swings takes a huge toll on your body. It's not easy. I urge you to try going out and golfing with any friends who might golf. You might find some enjoyment out of it, and you'll also find that it's not just a ""skill-based game"". I've never walked 18, only 9, and I still get destroyed by it. I could easily compare 18 holes to a long 2 hour session of pickup basketball. It also works very many muscles you're not used to using such as your hips.

Finally - the real reason I wanted to comment this is because I love golf because of the people. There's something so special about getting on the course with your friends and hiding a 6 pack from the marshall. A nice little buzz, catching up with your good friends, and complaining about the golf-things that all golfers complain about is really good time. The first time I ever golfed I just hopped onto the course because my 3 golf buddies wanted a 4th for a foursome. I played horribly. But I look at this experience as one of my best experiences in my life. It was awesome."
6635,Get a $15 phone arm band and say you have a wearable. More than enough fitness tracking apps out there
6636,This is obscene. Especially since you already pay a technology fee to the school for Canvas or Blackboard which would allow you to turn in homework
6637,"[FitBits specifically start at $70 new](https://www.fitbit.com/us/products/trackers/inspire?sku=412BKBK). This definitely seems fair. For example, I had an embedded systems class that required materials adding up to about $70 in addition to the textbook, and my sister has some classes requiring multiple textbooks that add up to far more than that."
6638,"It honestly seems so insane to me! I bought a Garmin earlier this summer and it was over $200! 

I have homeless students, students who work to support their siblings and parents, etc...they'd never be able to pay for this. 

I'm not sure who you can appeal to but I'd look into if you can. 

For what it's worth, I had an older version of this a few years ago and it seems like it might fit the requirements: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T4ZH692/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_dpilFbGY8T09J"
6639,"There are *GOLF* classes? What the fuck, you learn something new every day i guess.."
6640,Welcome to gym‚Ñ¢ sponsored by Fitbit‚Ñ¢ ^all ^purchases ^are ^nonrefundable
6641,I didn‚Äôt know they had gym classes in uni...
6642,"I think they might have online homework/study lessons for that class and have to pay for access, which is dumb for a class already online and an exercise one at that"
6643,"Nah. Budgeting money is way more important than some useless overpriced accessory. Whatever that watch does, our phones can do and more."
6644,"Fuck the syllabus. Bring it up to the higher ups. This seems unreasonable. It seems reasonable to me to be able to your phone. As long as you are able to track your physical activity, what is the problem?"
6645,"Hit up a bst group on fb, pawn shop, or reach out to friends and family. They were trendy for a while, but typically you use them for a few months and then they sit in a drawer. You can get 2nd hand ones at a decent price.

Ebay has a bunch of used Fitbit's for $20 or less."
6646,"so the 90 degree rule basically says you're allowed to drive a cart on the fairway(basically main part of the course if you don't know), but you must drive as much as possible on a path,until you are even with the ball, then turn 90 degrees towards your ball. I think what OP is saying is that it was so flooded they couldn't have driven to their balls"
6647,"It's a requirement to take one for all degrees at my uni, and they're usually taught by senior exercise science students studying to be k-12 gym teachers. Also covers health topics in a classroom setting. Part of being ""well rounded"" I guess."
6648,"I don‚Äôt think this is necessarily true... Maybe it depends on the type of school, but I go to a large public university and there definitely isn‚Äôt a phys. ed. requirement, and my sister went to a very small private liberal arts school and she didn‚Äôt have one either. I‚Äôve personally never heard of any college having a gym class requirement (in the US.)"

6652,I know that feeling. And people saying AP classes are like college classes is a lie.
6653,Damn. Tough break. Good luck. I hope you‚Äôre able to withdraw those classes. Mental health is health.

6655,"I think we're in the same position tbh. I also used to be Valedictorian, 4.0, etc.. this is my 2nd semester of college and it's going terribly. Failing 2 courses, all my assignments are late, I had doing work, I have no motivation. I started going to therapy and am on some antidepressants. Idk if they are working or not. First semester went great. I had a 4.0, I made friends, I got out and did stuff. Idk this semster just isn't going well"
6656,"You need to talk to your therapist. After seeing your post history, the truth is none of us random redditors are really equipped enough to help you get through this. Seek help, please!"
6657,"I failed my last semester too, after earning dean's list the semester before.

Online school is a whack-ass piece of shit, and it's fucking everyone over, don't worry."
6658,"No doubt at all. It‚Äôs my opinion that the covid semesters have exposed just how dysfunctional and out of date these school systems are. It‚Äôs a money hungry, disorganized, politically-charged system with minimal regard for its students. I know this is a bit unrelated to the original post but I just loved your example."
6659,"The first semester I felt on top of the world, everything was so new and motivation was abundant. Once you realize you have to repeat that EVERY semester, it starts going downhill, at least in my experience."
6660,"I would also echo this and say take a semester off to give yourself more time to heal. I was in a situation very similar to yours (top of the class, started college strong, then an absolute nosedive). I ended up taking a semester off and working and it helped a lot. I was a waitress at a country club and one of the members commented that I seemed to be a lot better in October than I was in May when I started.

I'm also someone heavily influenced by my environment, so I had to learn how to manage my surroundings to facilitate my mental health. Maybe you can look for trends and correlations in your environment and mental health. It may be the pandemic, it may be something else.

Feel free to message me if you need or want to."
6661,"I do talk to my therapist about issues, but ‚Äúgetting help‚Äù really isn‚Äôt easy. At the end of the day, they pretty much say that I have to find the motivation to get out of the depression. It‚Äôs not like the medication is helping me get out of it, it‚Äôs all on me to make the right choices and I‚Äôm just exhausted."
6662,"in my opinion, AP classes (Chem, Bio, English Literature) had more work than my university classes - being a finance and accounting double major helped tho"
6663,"I‚Äôm the same way. I‚Äôve had a 4.0 for the last 3 semesters and now this semester I can‚Äôt get anything done and I‚Äôm scared I might not even pass. It‚Äôs gonna be ok, we‚Äôre gonna get through this. Just a little longer. Tripping on acid the other week helped me a bit so you can try that but idk what meds you‚Äôre on so might not be the best decision. Good luck!

Edit: I ended up withdrawing from 2 of my classes (1 of them I had to petition for a late withdrawal and it was granted) and the lighter load has really been helping so if you feel like that‚Äôll make you less overwhelmed then I‚Äôd consider it"
6664,"I don't believe that a therapist would say something as abstract as ""find the motivation"". If you're looking for answers, I recommend HealthyGamerGG on Youtube, where Dr. K explains many concepts including lack of motivation, burnout, depression. I felt similarly as you do and this channel helped me understand how my mind works. Either way, failing a semester may feel bad, but remember that your mental health should always be placed higher than education. Take some time off, explore how your mind works (and what caused you to lose motivation) and once you're ready, you can come back stronger than ever. Good luck, my man, you've got this."
6665,You have more time in class to work on the stuff though in high school. In college it‚Äôs mostly up to you to do the work outside of class time.
6666,"Some of my worst years of my life mentally were in middle school, but through all of it I pushed through, got good grades and tried to survive. High school didn't get much better, but I kept pushing. But once my senior year hit, and I was so close to the finish line, something in me broke and every study skill, every morsel of motivation, every drop of my ""keep pushing"" attitude dissipated. 

I deal with cyclothymia and trauma related anxiety (and im starting to question if i may have adhd) but somehow I figured out how to deal with it until I simply couldn't anymore. It's burnout on multiple levels - burnout from school and from personal maintenance - and i feel like it happens to all of us who struggle mentally.

If you can take anything off your plate, do it asap, and ask for help where its needed. I'm not gonna necessarily say that what you're going through is ""normal"" but it makes sense to me and you have nothing to be ashamed of. Ultimately, you'll be okay with time and a change of pace or scenery. Taking a break for a semester or maybe even a gap year if possible might be really beneficial.

I wish you the absolute best."
6667,"honestly I was in a similar spot when I dropped out, honestly I don't regret the decision, I got a counselor, got medication for my adhd, and honestly life has been going great, I found a pretty good paying job with upward potential even for me with my associates, I'm pretty close to a down payment on a house, and I have started saving for retirement. Honestly take a year or two to really figure out where you want to go and what you want to do if you can afford college later (as in you aren't relying on financial aid), maybe just live life for a bit. I was planning to go back to school last fall, but pulled the plug when I realized covid was going to make that miserable (I had some experience with online classes and found I don't like them), but now I'm in a position where I don't feel like I need to go back to college."
6668,i failed all but one of my classes one semester. I medically withdrew from the classes I failed. I'm still struggling with college but I'm trying. Wishing u the best

6670,"You might want to look into whether or not there is a way to retroactively withdraw from courses at your institution.  Typically this is reserved for student's who due to extreme circumstances could not maintain satisfactory academic progress, typically due to illness or incapacitation.  It's rare, and requires a lot of documentation but it may be a way to save your GPA and Progress up to this point.  Appropriate offices/individuals to speak with regarding this matter include Disability Services, Academic Advising, Counseling Center, and potentially the Registrar office."
6671,My university is counting F‚Äôs as fails due to covid so it luckily won‚Äôt hurt my GPA!
6672,"Bit of a same situation mate, had maintain a 3 gpa from past two years and now I am in graduating semester and there is no fucking will to turn up the midterms on time, I am even lacking on the extensions also, class readings seems like just words mumbling at this moment, I have read complex texts and worked my ass off before meeting deadlines and having social life....now everything is deteriorating.
Haven't submitted three of my subjects mid terms and it's been a month seen, neither have I attended those subjects class, haven't told nobody this but idk what the fuck am I going to do.... hopefully, going to yeet myself from this pit hole who's sucking me up and I hope the same for you as well.
Stay tight bud, an honest apology and hard work is all it takes."
6673,"Does your school have a compassionate withdrawal program? How about grade forgiveness? In two or three colleges I've found, and entire semester of grades can be wiped when there are problems like yours. Please call a counselor right away as this stops being a possibility fast. 

My brother got to where you are but insisted he could make it thru finals. Mom was really worried he'd hurt himself. He ended up with a gpa below 1 and took off a year. He could have gotten a compassionate withdrawal had he known. He was visibly depressed, not having showered in a while, not changing clothes, and goodness knows what else. The RA yelled at him for smelling for about 3 hours one night before and exam and my brother was so defeated he just stood there and took it. 

I am so glad you talked to your parents. Mine were really sweet to my brother. They told us all when we left for college that we couldn't come back, but when they saw what my brother went through they took care of him. I know you'll get better too. My brother started working on some open enrollment classes and then got a part time job and should graduate next year and has made it into the dean's list. He's made a great comeback and I know you will too!"

I haven't been socialized in almost a year and its making me lose my mind. don't beat yourself up just take it one step at a time. focus on one or two classes if you can I'm just focusing on calculus 2 for the most part. therapy is kind of a waste if your life is legitimately shitty at the moment. yeah I don't think therapy is gonna solve your job or you being isolated from society. unless you've got a decent amount of childhood issues or other trauma like true PTSD its not gonna help ye. depression and anxiety in this country is often just scapegoated as mental or biochemical issues without looking at it as ""yeah your life sucks and your basically trapped in a situation"" I haven't met a person so far where I cant attribute their depression to something like that."
6676,You should try to at least get Cs in your classes to pass.
6677,"I‚Äôm happy you got this sorted out! I have pretty bad adhd. Mixing that with my current online classes makes me miserable.

Keep doing your thing man!"
6678,My primary suggestion would be to find a good therapist who can help you. Definitely talk to your parents about everything and resolve that there. I'm thinking it's probably the fact that everything's online because i feel the exact same way. Used to be 4.0 gpa no problem and now I'm getting a C in math and B in chemistry
6679,I think most of the hate is directed toward majors that don‚Äôt lead to related jobs? It seems cruel to charge a 17 year old money to take classes in a field they‚Äôll never work in or that they don‚Äôt need a degree for.
6680,"As a STEM major, I think it‚Äôs because the two are almost always seen as opposites and pitted against eachother. STEM majors are criticized for being money hungry or uncreative, and humanity majors are held in contempt for being flighty dreamers. It‚Äôs unfair for everyone involved.

EDIT: Business Majors are in all of my math classes and they scare me."
6681,And what can make you enough money to pay back the education. You don‚Äôt need to go to college to learn more about a hobby unless that hobby is an employable one.
6682,"My brother majored in comms and literally has his dream job working for a professional NFL team. Follow your passion and build your network. You‚Äôre so right that if you are aware of your prospects and make yourself marketable, you‚Äôll succeed regardless of what degree you get."
6683,"There are plenty of STEM degrees that won't result in a specific job, either.

Unless you are in an ABET* engineering program, computer science, nursing, accounting...most majors are not vocationally-included. Even CS doesn't really focus on software development."
6684,STEM majors and humanities majors must join forces and defeat the business majors
6685,"Because they don‚Äôt make money, and unfortunately, we live in a society where realistically money has to trump passion (I have an MA in English and adjunct at the college level‚Äîmost people I teach will go on to make much more money than me).

Nevertheless, one of my favorite quotes from Dead Poet‚Äôs Society:

‚ÄúWe don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.‚Äù"
6686,"No one said you need to make six figs. But if you‚Äôre taking out dozens of thousands of dollars in debt to study a hobby without thinking about how you‚Äôll pay that back then that‚Äôs pretty shortsighted. And yes, you can study a hobby in your spare time, that‚Äôs how most people interact with their hobbies. If you‚Äôre saying someone can‚Äôt become a historian by studying history in their downtime then you‚Äôre probably right. But if becoming a historian through going into high amounts of college debt is your path to that occupation then maybe reconsider pursuing that occupation."
6687,"I feel like it's a stigma of the older generation. Some people aren't cut out for STEM and that's fine, I'm about to get my BA in communications and have no regrets."
6688,Something doesn't need to pay 6 figures to be employable. And if someone wants to be a historian they can't just study on their free time
6689,Business majors are money hungry dreamers.
6690,"I feel like a big part of the stigma, is people thinking that the only reason people don‚Äôt go into STEM is because they ‚Äúaren‚Äôt cut out for STEM‚Äù."
6691,"I think if you were to gamble on a degree bringing success then STEM is the way to go.

I‚Äôm a journalism grad and I‚Äôll tell you that the main worth is having the degree itself. With humanities, the classes are easier but that‚Äôs because you have to work on personal projects during school to be able to succeed when you graduate. A communications degree with no internships, research exp, or publications is pretty 6/10 imo 

Whereas with a STEM you could probably find your way to a decent job right out of college with little to no extra curriculars. 

We need to teach students how to go to college honestly. With a bachelors being the new high school diploma we‚Äôre leaving students way underprepared if they think they‚Äôre gonna get far just by going to class and getting a degree."
6692,Electrical engineering major here. Fuck people who talk shit about A&H degrees. A world without artists is not one worth living in. We need to band together to bully the people who really deserve it: business majors.
6693,"No. I was listing majors that are vocational in nature, not STEM majors specifically. You know, that whole point about STEM majors not being vocational.

Biology, chemistry, physics, math, all the variations from there...you are not getting some high-paying job doing any of those any time soon either, and most likely nothing in the fields at all."
6694,"Honestly, for me, I studied what I KNEW I would passionate enough about to make it through my degree. I do not work in archaeology, but I love it! Plus I got a cool internship to go with it! üòÄ"
6695,"yeah‚Ä¶ not true at all for STEM. Internship experience is pretty much a must for most programs. I‚Äôm in computer science and getting a good job requires quality personal projects, club participation, open source contributions, hackathon participation, research work and most importantly internships. Obviously there are outlier cases of people being able to get jobs without any of those but it‚Äôs extremely unlikely to get the great paying Software engineering jobs you hear about on the news with doing pretty much all of them.


edit: grammar and punctuation"
6696,"Yeh. There are lots of useless degrees, as a whole. People tend to forget that and focus solely on arts and humanities as unprofitable."
6697,Yeah so why shit on 17 year olds who want to study english isntead of schoosl for charging so much for a kid to study english
6698,It's kinda funny because many STEM people struggle to understand anthro.
6699,"Scholarships aren't a magic source of money. They don't give them out to everyone. I didn't get diddly squat for scholarships or financial aid, went to community college, and still got screwed over with student loans."
6700,">I feel like people shouldn't have to justify arts and humanities degrees 

You dont have to justify anything to anyone but yourself. Just like STEM is not for everyone, Arts and Humanities is not for everyone either. People are different, and different is OK"
6701,"I think there‚Äôs ‚Äòhate‚Äô/people look down on arts and humanities degrees because there often aren‚Äôt jobs available that are directly relevant to what they studied in school (content-wise, not life skills they learned). 

Idk but maybe some people think that if you‚Äôre spending thousands of dollars on education that you should at least study something which prepares you for a job in a field that has job opportunities. Like is it worth going into debt just to learn about something that interests you?

I was a history major, Holocaust and Genocide studies minor. A good number of people told me that this was impractical and un-useful, and frankly a waste of money, to study this subject as it isn‚Äôt directly applicable to most people‚Äôs everyday lives (in the US). To find a job in this field of study, I would probably have needed a Masters or PhD as well."
6702,"> With humanities if you do the readings and write the papers it is pretty hard to fail.

As someone in the humanities, trust me when I tell you I've had plenty of STEM major students do poorly - and yes, they did the readings and wrote the papers."
6703,"also, ease up on the ""community college is a joke"" and hate on community colleges.

Why?  If you attend community college and play your cards right- you leave with an Assoicates degree and little to no debt.  

In my state, 45 credits plus books plus fees at a community college will set you back about $12K.  And that's long before FAFSA grants and scholarships kick in.  

Most students at the one I work at end up paying roughly $800 to 2K out of pocket for every 45 credits. 

While you can and do take major specific classes- around 75-90% of those classes are gen ed requirments- the pesky ""I don't give a shit what your major is, you still have to take xx english xxx humanities xxx this xx that"" course."
6704,"That's true, but you don't just go to college to get a degree and a job. Some people feel general fullfillment from those majors to a point they would risk unfavorable job outlook. No hate to you, but I think it's equally cruel to dismiss 17 year old's passion just because they might have a lower chance to get a job on their field. Not to mention how a decent portion of people work in fields they didn't major in.

(Edited out the ""op"" because by op I meant the commenter not the original poster.)"
6705,Antichrist
6706,Thank you. People act like there is no such thing as an affinity for the arts and humanities. I guess only STEM takes skill... üôÑ
6707,My employer pays my rent. Haha.
6708,He‚Äôs in video operations. He films and edits footage that the team and coaches use in practice. He also helps with editing videos for their social media.
6709,Pretty normal
6710,Looks like you can bring the trampoline!
6711,"Lmao, you know that one must have a story behind it"
6712,"It's people stealing them and putting them in their dorm rooms as decorations, the same thing with traffic signs and barriers. After a football game at least a few traffic barriers and cones are gonna disappear because people just nab them and take them back."
6713,all of these things are on that list for a reason.
6714,"You could bring weapons to my residence hall you just had to check them in and they were put into a locker in a secure room.

I kept a bow in there but plenty of students had hunting rifles and such. Though they made it very clear that you weren't allowed to clean animal carcasses in the showers lol"
6715,Nooo they cant ban free weights üò≠ they're trying to kill ur gains
6716,I want to know what was crossed out

6718,"found [the original list](https://www.beaconcollege.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/What-to-bring.pdf), it‚Äôs porn"
6719,"ah fuck, I can't put my dorm room up for sale??"
6720,"Can confirm. Had a roommate my sophomore year whom I was not particularly close with. But about once a week he would get blackout drunk and go across the campus, steal a bunch of signs, and throw them in his closet."
6721,"i get most of these, but why not sun lamps üíÄ i have one that i use daily because i have SAD, it‚Äôs just a bright lamp"
6722,Yeah depends on the school. Montana state has a similar system in place and I frequently saw animals being skinned outside dorms.
6723,Probably a dry campus. My school sees any alcohol paraphernalia as a violation of the alcohol policy
6724,"No problem, just bring a smith machine"
6725,Are you even a college student without a stolen traffic cone or street sign?
6726,"I bet you could get a medical accommodation to circumvent a rule like that. Most likely, someone nearly burned down the building leaving one unattended at some point."
6727,If you're a music major there will be dedicated practice spaces that you can keep/use your instruments in.
6728,"And so that they don't find it, just bring it to the roof!"
6729,All of these are normal but I‚Äôm curious what happened to specify ‚Äúreal estate signs‚Äù
6730,Why no decorative bottles? I‚Äôve always used wine bottles as vases
6731,I‚Äôm warning you right now‚Ä¶ The amount of kids who will bring acholol and drugs to college will shock you. Irregardless of the rules.
6732,Yeah
6733,"I think they might mean the kind that gives you a sun tan, not the ‚Äúhappy lamps‚Äù the sun tan ones would be a fire hazard."
6734,Someone probably was crashing weights which fucked the flooring?
6735,"My campus isn‚Äôt dry, but they don‚Äôt allow alcohol in the dorms. They also didn‚Äôt allow decorative alcohol bottles. The reason they told us was that it was a violation of their recycling policy, but I think it really just makes it harder to tell if the bottles actually contain alcohol"
6736,"My roommate took a 20‚Äô long ‚ÄúMcPick 2 for 5‚Äù banner from McDonald‚Äôs and put it up in our apartment. It was awesome. We also had a ton of street signs, political signs, and even a fire hydrant"
6737,Seems like a reasonable list?
6738,RPGs
6739,"Yeah, this is seriously impressive! Having taken that class, I know how difficult it can be. Congrats!"
6740,"Probably no show, or students that withdrew"
6741,Who got the 0 though‚Ä¶
6742,"Uhh I think he meant he got a 91 on the final exam, on top of doing good in the quizzes and turning hw in, where it rounded his final grade to a 93"
6743,The fuck is going on with this account?
6744,"Sorry if it was a bit confusing. I scored a mark of 91 out of 100 on the final exam, but I finished the class with a 93% from the combination of the homework, quiz, and extra credit grade marks."
6745,"They passed the class with 93% overall and a 91% on the final‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs no need to be such a pessimist either way. If he‚Äôs lying about it to get fake internet points, oh well."
6746,I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt me!
6747,Some people just have issues
6748,Congrats!!! The same happened to me in my calc class. I bombed the first 2 exams so I studied extra hard and ended up getting a B+ on the final exam and an A in the class. I hope you feel super proud of yourself because that‚Äôs fantastic!!! Nice work!
6749,Thank you very much! I never would have thought I would have gotten a such a high mark on the final. Calc II was by far the hardest course I‚Äôve taken thus far in university.
6750,Damn that hurts. I needed an 87% in my calc final but ran out of time and ended with an A-.
6751,"I passed the final exam with a 91%, but ended up with a 93% final grade"
6752,"It was getting a 50 on my first test (that I really studied for) that enlightened me.

I learned that every hard class is an opportunity to for a study group- I looked around and found the faces that were disappointed like me - we gathered all the old tests we could get from our fraternities (etc.) and even did all the problems that weren't assigned as homework, dividing the work and sharing the methodologies we learned...

By senior year, I didn't even wait for a bad test to form a study group.


This is one reason I feel so much I feel so much sympathy today's students when deprived of in-person learning. I don't see how y'all can form effective study groups.

But, no doubt, y'all can find methods and opportunity we never dreamed of of.

BTW, unlike a lot of study methods used on academia, learning to build and use teams will be useful in a variety of professions"
6753,"Well, it is also calc 2 so they might have also had a garbage test"
6754,"They're a troll, don't feed them"
6755,"Nice job, I'm in a similar situation.  I bombed our class' first midterm (we had 3), and slowly crawled my way back up.  Took the final yesterday, and based on the answer key our professor released, I should get a B+."
6756,Sometimes those L‚Äôs whip you into shape. Good job!
6757,"Congrats on the grade. Find out what worked, what didn't work and use your newly acquired study skills to ace Calculus 3"
6758, let‚Äôs go! I ended up getting a B- in calc 2 this quarter after failing my first test and then losing faith that I could pass the class. If it wasn‚Äôt for my parents supporting me through this I don‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve done it. Enjoy this!!! I sure am!
6759,"Damn, congrats! After failing Calc 1 twice, I had to change my major to get me out of taking that class. That being said a 93 in that class is killer."
6760,"Congratulations! Your calc II experience sounds like my calc I experience. 

I bombed the first test, realized my study habits were terrible for what the class demanded and then proceeded to damn near ace the next 3 tests, quizzes and homeworks afterwards.

Sometimes bombing a test is required to pass the class the way we want to."
6761,I can't believe someone actually got a 0
6762,"Congrats on your accomplishment! And thank you! It was so much work, but I am very proud indeed!"
6763,Awesome! You got the highest score in the class too!
6764,"In my calc 3 test I got 96 on the last normal test, then a 98 on the final 8 days later. That pushed me from a B to an A in the class in that 8 day span."
6765,"After I bombed the midterm, I studied about 3 hours per day for 2 weeks. Maybe a bit overkill but it paid off for me!"
6766,Thank you! I‚Äôm majoring in Biology with a PreMed emphasis and minoring in Computer Science!
6767,"you uh‚Ä¶you hang around with a lot of grenades, huh?"
6768,Maybe the professor was nice and put a 0 there so a curve could be justified
6769,I used to practically live in the library. I slept there during finals.
6770,The library was the only place I could really get work done :(
6771,"yes!!!! I miss studying at the library!!! I miss the accomplishment I felt after printing out my work there!!!! I miss sneaking in food LOL,,, I miss listening to people being loud and eavesdropping on conversations when I got bored. I miss the international students dripped out in christian dior and balenciaga at 8 am while everyone else looks homeless,,,, I miss looking at people who had study groups wishing I had one for my classes too,,, I miss writing 3 words after being there for 5 hours and still feeling accomplished so I‚Äôd treat myself with food LOLL,,, I miss renting the library rooms with my friends so we could play uno,,, I just miss playing uno in the library :( omg also the mental breakdowns in the library ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è I literally remember setting crying alarms so I could cry for 15 mins then get back to studying ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è 

ugh I cant wait to be back in uni in the fall"
6772,I‚Äôve never been to the library
6773,"There is probably a book about digital photography in that picture, and I bet it has a chapter about color balance."
6774,"Just to save everyone else the effort, I believe the OP is being nostalgic. There‚Äôs nothing hidden in the image."
6775,I guess I should‚Äôve been more clear. I meant ‚ÄúAnybody else miss spending hours in the library?‚Äù My campus has not opened the main library ever since covid hit but thanks for clarifying
6776,"No, I'd rather do homework in the comfort of my bed"
6777,It‚Äôs open 24/7 during finals

6779,"As we all know, everything in Mexico has a yellow tint over it."
6780,Yes. So much so that I applied to my local library about graduation. Currently working toward a Masters in Library Science to become a Librarian.
6781,Looks like it‚Äôs in Mexico.
6782,THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS DRIPPED OUT HAHAHAH
6783,"absolutely not, college (really school in general) was the worst time of my life."
6784,Same
6785,Not being able to go to the library is driving me crazy
6786,The vibrant colour sofas ugh I just miss library so much
6787,U crazy!!
6788,My university library closed its doors at a certain time but it was almost always student ID accessible 24/7 during the school year. I also napped in the library overnight during finals week..
6789,"bold of you to assume I ever used the library pre-pandemic. 

And yet I still complain that it's closed lol"
6790,Same here!
6791,What is focus?
6792,I did all my HW in the library and I had no distractions unlike at home.
6793,Omg bro you gotta go when you can
6794,Don't they close in the evening?
6795,I can‚Äôt focus from my room
6796,"Sounds like a horrid existence, worth it for the A* tho, ig"
6797,"I rely on the library to actually get anything done. I just screw around a lot in my room, but something in my brain just knows it‚Äôs time to work when I get to the library."
6798,its the internet sweetie. I get good grades on all my papers bc I write properly and professionally ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ever heard of code switching? üôÑ
6799,"Omg thank you so much! I'm 3 weeks in into college, and I felt so behind and stupid because I just couldn't understand anything, especially since I also have ADHD. When I'm starting to lose motivation or start feeling less determine to graduate, I always end up coming on reddit to find similar stories or advice to see what I can do to keep pushing myself (‡∏á 'ÃÄ-'ÃÅ)‡∏á"
6800,Re-writing notes by the end of the day I have class has helped me soo much. I organize everything in my notebook and draw illustrations  then the next day I compile everything into a study guide.
6801,"The biggest difference between high school and college is the rate at which material is covered. You cover in a semester or quarter in college what you would normally have a full year to learn in high school. So they take 2-3 class sessions to cover what will get covered in one session (potentially at warp speed) in college. They expect you to do at least 50% of your learning outside class in college, whereas the vast majority of learning in high school occurs during class.

The people who were less efficient learners in high school (needed to review outside class, couldn't finish homework during class, etc) often do better in college because they are already used to taking notes and studying. I had a really rough time learning to study in college. Once I got in my groove I FLEW, but I definitely blew off and wasted about 2 years of college before I got my shit together. 

Now I'm in a PhD program and teaching college, so there's that. :) 

During my PhD program I'm re-discovering the ""joys"" of extensive note-taking. I have an iPad with a stylus and notepad where I can cut and paste notes and write notes or type them. I definitely remember many more fine details when I handwrite my notes rather than cutting/pasting or typing. Alas, it takes me twice as long to hand write them. \*SIGH\* So we end up having to make choices and prioritize. 

You'll find what works for you, as long as you put in the time. But you have to devote more time outside of class in college, FOR SURE."
6802,"Other suggestions - Treat school like a job. Schedule in study time and stick to it. That way when your time off comes its actually restful and refreshing rather than stressful about all the stuff you havent done. 

\-Do active reading rather than passive. When you read, take notes and ""play professor."" Each section think to yourself ""if I was the proff and I was writing the exam is there anything in here that I would put on an exam or in a review session?"" It serves a dual purpose, it makes sure you are actually thinking about what you are reading rather than just passivly taking info in. It also creates notes for you so that when its time to review for exams you wont have to read the whole book again. It also allows you to tease out any questions you may have so that if you go to office hours you know what you need. 

\-Break up study sessions to about 45 min of any one activity. Doesnt mean only study for 45 min, but dont do much more than that of any one thing. Switch it up, strech, do a quick chore. After about 45 min learning fatigue checks in and often the brain checks out so while you may be putting in time you probably are not actually taking in the information. 

Study smarter, not harder or longer."
6803,"The other thing is not to feel awkward about reaching out to your school's Office of Accessiblity.   It might go under another name, but their job is to provide what's called ""Reasonable accommodations.""

Things that they've been able to do for my students who have had ADHD are things like:  Providing note-takers, allowing extra time on an exam, allowing them to take exams in a location outside the classroom that will be less distracting.

It can be a big help!"
6804,"1 is why I love using my iPad or any sort of tablet that you can write on. While it is a screen, you‚Äôre able to write it down without using so many notebooks/paper youll probably throw out at the end of the semester.

Edit: not sure why it‚Äôs bold but ok go off I guess
Edit 2: I found out why it was bold thank you guy who gave me the suggestion"
6805,dude if i had an award i would definitely give it to you i was just talking w my brother about how to improve my study habits. Thank you so much!
6806,"In regards to number 4: I've gotten into the habit of skimming my notes at the end of every day, and trying to come up with one thing I learned from each class, or a ""TIL List"". It's not super comprehensive, but it gets number 4 done, and it also simulates ""explaining"" the topic to somebody else, which is also a good study technique."
6807,Thank you!
6808,"I‚Äôm a high school junior right now, how did you find time to rewrite your notes? I intended to, but I just can‚Äôt find time"
6809,"Of course!  It kind of breaks my heart to see you guys who want to do well but haven‚Äôt been told the ways that college is different other that non-helpful crap like ‚ÄúHey kid, you‚Äôre not in high school anymore- this is college.‚Äù"
6810,"The explaining thing really helps, I'll literally be in my room talking to myself pretending to explain something to somebody haha"
6811,"Of course!  And if you have more questions, just message me.

So question #1...  I am in the same situation you are.  I write slow.   When I try to write fast, it looks like ... squiggles.  So there's two things you can do:

1. write in the squiggles and immediately after class, go re-write the notes in normal handwriting.   (However, it sounds like you don't have much time after class, so....)
2. Write as fast as you can, don't even finish sentences if you can't.  Literally, if all you can write before the prof moves on is ""17th Century marriage thing is....""  
Now, I know that doesn't make sense, which is why you need to be doing the second part:  record the lecture.  Even if your school has a policy against it, they really can't tell if you just turn your phone on record.   Then, when you have time, you can FF to whereabouts the prof starts talking about 17th Century marriages, and figure out what ""thing"" was being talked about.   Even better, You can write ""17th Century marriage...""  then glance at your phone to see where the recording is (it should show you how long the recording has been going...) and then write down that time.   So, if it might look like ""17th Century marriage - 20:31"" That means that you can just FF to 20 minutes 31 seconds in, and that way you don't have to search all over for the place where the prof was talking about it.

The thing is, you'll have to do one or the other, and that takes time.   Now, if you can keep up with the note if you type on a laptop -- DO THAT!   Because looking at the study, the main problem with typing on the laptop is that students were just transcribing what the prof said.  The big thing is that you put everything in your own words.  That made the difference.

The most important is you set up a system you can actually do.  If it's going to take too much time to do the recording / re-writing then you're probably going to wind up not doing it, or putting it off.   

Question #2 - I don't think it matters.  In fact, I think if you have a morning habit (like drinking coffee, or eating breakfast) you can just make a habit of reviewing your notes first thing in the AM.  And I'm sure it's better to do it at a time where you're not exhausted, and you can concentrate."
6812,"Anecdotal, but I'd say using an iPad and Apple Pencil is an improvement - I switched in 2020 and saw a major boost in my habits. My notes look better (because I don't have to erase/cross out mistakes and can move stuff around if the prof backtracks to a topic), so they're easier to study, I can combine them with downloads/pictures of handouts right in my notebook (I use Notability, but my friends who use Goodnotes like it too), and organize them in a bunch of different ways without losing sheets of paper or buying organizing tools. Overall, it's made taking notes a hell of a lot easier and honestly kind of fun. Love being able to test out new methods of notetaking and not having to worry about keeping up with multiple notebooks for one class."
6813,"I re-wrote them during lunch, on the bus ride home (30-45 min) or once I got to the library in my neighborhood."
6814,"I like your advice! For the pure memorization classes, I usually just stick to typed out notes and then copy and paste them into flash cards. But for more conceptual classes, hand written notes all the way.

Another thing I would suggest: start studying for tests early! Just do practice problems every week, reread the main concepts, and use flash cards apps like Anki, which uses spaced repetition. I‚Äôm telling ya, it is worth your time."
6815,"As a 90s kid who dropped out of college at 18 and returned a decade later for Physics, I cannot deny the fact of taking notes on an electronic device is sooooooooooo beneficial and convenient. And back when I started, laptops and tablets were not the norm and we all had 500 sheet notebooks and actually used the print textbook lol. Now let me clarify, taking notes on your laptop or tablet can be beneficial depending on the course. Don‚Äôt write math notes on a keyboard (although I do ‚Äúre-type‚Äù my notes in Word using the equation function to make them pretty when I print them) and for the love of whatever god you pray to at night DO NOT get tempted to browse social media or YouTube or other distractions. I feel that‚Äôs the BIGGEST pet peeve for professors when students bring technology to class. I love writing notes on my Surface pro in one note. For programming, typing in Notepad++ was beneficial. For other gen Ed courses it was helpful. Heck, I‚Äôve even recorded my lectures live on my webcam (audio only though with the webcam off) so I can finalize my notes at a later time. But if you start getting distracted then all the pros of using tech for note taking goes down the toilet (and you potentially ruin it for others who actually use tech in the correct way in a classroom setting)."
6816,"Yes, this is smart. I really need to take the time to do this more. I've noticed I'll frequently get to the end of the week and not remember/be able to summarize what was covered in class that week. It's like it goes in, I do the work, and it just goes out again."
6817,"That‚Äôs probably because of my CRAZY ALL CAPS!  

I changed the formatting so many times because the post was soooooo long I thought ‚Äúno one is going to read this - I‚Äôd better make headings in all caps‚Äù

But now that you mention it, holy crap- you‚Äôre right- it looks like I‚Äôm furious!"
6818,"> They expect you to do at least 50% of your learning outside class in college, whereas the vast majority of learning in high school occurs during class.

Yeah, I wish.

Math classes at my university literally only meet once a week either virtual or in-class, just to go over questions from a chapter ago"
6819,Anki is great!
6820,My only problem with that is even the first set of notes makes my fingers hurt like hell.
6821,So basically on any spare time you have rewrite notes. Cool love it.
6822,Thanks prof; I've got 1-3 down but never heard of 4. Will begin trying it out.
6823,"This is a fantastic strategy regarding writing questions for the test. I'd add to it that you should try to write questions that you don't immediately know the answer to and study the hardest parts/the stuff that gives you the most trouble. If you finish a study session feeling like you know everything, you probably studied for your ego and not for your brain. 

A good analogy for sports people out there: studying should feel like practice or hitting the gym. You shouldn't be finishing feeling like you nailed it, you should be exhausted because you pushed yourself super hard. The test is like game day, it should feel easier than the practice because you prepped so hard that the actual event feels easy and natural."
6824,"The other big difference is that in high school, your teachers will force you to do 90 percent of what it takes to succeed with daily homework and whatnot making you study on a regular basis. Most college classes depend on you to know that while you may only be graded on the 3 or 4 tests/projects/papers you have throughout the semester, you have homework almost every day in the form of studying so you can actually perform on those assessments."
6825,thank you so much!
6826,Thank you for the helpful tips! I will definitely try these
6827,Thank youu. I don‚Äôt start my first year of college till October and this is pretty helpful since I‚Äôve never been the type to study for tests. I‚Äôm starting college pretty late because I had foot surgery so the corses I‚Äôll take are condensed to catch me up faster.
6828,Your passion to see students succeed is admirable. Thank you
6829,Seems about right. My university is at 800 or something and still hasn't pulled the trigger on closing :/
6830,My SUNY made it very known that nobody would be refunded at all
6831,"Arizona State University, they have handled Covid with very mixed success. Its a BIG university, so 800 might not be the same ratio as someone else's 300... but its still double the point where our state government recommends closing."
6832,Damn people out here are getting fucked over .  My school didn‚Äôt even bother going back and we started online.  They cut dorming and any on campus related costs out of tuition.
6833,"Not a lawyer, but I can't imagine a virus outbreak/hotspot during an active pandemic can be considered ""unforseen circumstances."" In fact, I'd go as far to say it is one of the most foreseen circumstances possible."
6834,"The parties are imo a lame way to pass the blame onto students, rather than administrators.

This was 100% inevitable. You can‚Äôt have hundreds of kids living in dorm rooms with ventilation during a pandemic. It‚Äôs the same fucking thing as a nursing home. All it takes is one person."
6835,"My SUNY made us re-sign our housing and meal plan contracts, with an added clause in there that states after 2 official weeks of classes, refunds due to unforseen circumstances (i.e. having to move home due to covid) are not allowed."
6836,Wtf? What state if you don‚Äôt mind
6837,"From the SUNY Oneonta website:

‚ÄúThe college plans to issue full housing refunds and prorated dining refunds for students who move out of their rooms during the move-out period.‚Äù"
6838,"Based on what you saw at your campus, do you think campuses will shut down if kids are still partying? Also how often were you tested?"
6839,2-3 weeks. Like clockwork.
6840,It's on schools for putting their greed ahead of the safety of students. Obviously it isn't safe for schools to go back fully but they want the money so they forced kids back even though it put people at risk.
6841,"Damn, I should transfer there. My school raised tution and forced everyone on campus (until students refused to come back). They are celebrating ""low case numbers"" - yeah, cause you aren't testing people. There have been parties since people have come back, plenty of people aren't distancing, and plenty off campus foolery.

I knew my school didn't care about us, but it hurts when it's this obvious. Not to mention the health care plan you have to pay for that the school won't help people cover..."
6842,The fucked up part is that you‚Äôre kinda not allowed to leave either. If you take the semester off you loose your scholarships/financial aid.
6843,Especially due to time of forced signature
6844,Idk why people are so surprised to be sent home tbh
6845,">the cases are now at almost 400 and we have learned everyone is being sent home for the rest of the semester.

GREAT! Let's send all of the possibly infected people back to their home cities spread it there! I really wish colleges would have thought about this more or planned better."
6846,"They're just banking, quite literally, on the sheer amount of students/families that won't be able to afford getting tied up in the courts over it. 

But hey, maybe a few class action suits can put these institutions back in their place."
6847,"Nailed it.

They got their tuition checks for the semester. Mission accomplished. Now the students can fuck off back home for a shitty virtual education at full price."
6848,I‚Äôm at UGA and we had 800 cases LAST WEEK and we still open
6849,"That's Northern Arizona University, not ASU."
6850,"The news stations are saying yes, but from what I heard the students don‚Äôt know anything about refunds."
6851,"We are coming to the end of week three and there have been 16,000 students and staff tested with only 249 positive tests. That is 1.57% positivity rate, I have a feeling we are going to stay open for in person class."
6852,It sounds like they did tho
6853,Awesome! Thankfully they weren't scummy about the situation
6854,"Lol, that's a good one."
6855,I think they were implying that NAU is better off rn... which I can't really disagree with.
6856,Right? I'm fucking tired of these posts. Like what did you expect with an active pandemic?
6857,"‚ÄúWe are absolutely shocked, *shocked*!‚Äù
-administration

‚ÄúWe are absolutely not!‚Äù
-anyone who has interacted with undergraduates

Sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this, glad you‚Äôre safe though."
6858,University of Alabama has 1.2k cases as of early this week and isn‚Äôt closing.
6859,I can relate. I too wish you the very best.
6860,"Y‚Äôall getting praised? I show my professor my paper before handing it in, they said it was ‚Äúpretty good‚Äù and then gave me a C+ lol"
6861,"I was cringing at the possible expectation of a bad ending, but I'm glad to see that your professor recognized you and your talents."
6862,aw thank you<3 to you as well.
6863,"Advanced techniques in 3d modeling instructor emailed me after our certification exam. ""Our university is lucky to have students like you"". It had been a tough year with other classes, I was definitely crying."
6864,If you don‚Äôt mind me asking what‚Äôs the essay about?
6865,Dude what are you on about
6866,dude u commented this on 2 of my posts r u ok
6867,that's great advice from your teacher. and thank you for the advice and kind words as well :)
6868,"Yall getting praised? 

the last time I got any kind of praise was when I was born and my father said ""well he is not THAT ugly"""
6869,Nobody cares about your girlfriend or virginity.  This is a college subreddit for questions about work and shit
6870,[deleted]
6871,Lmao what‚Äôs happening üíÄ
6872,"What the fuck is ""praise""? /s"
6873,"I am glad I‚Äôm not the only one that‚Äôs gotten emotional when someone has appreciated me, this reminds me of a couple years ago when i had this English teacher tell me my essay made his week"
6874,That was really sweet of your professor :) congrats and best wishes!
6875,Check their comment history - same thing pasted into a whole bunch of posts lol
6876,"omg reading it again I should've put (in a positive way) or something in the title lol, I totally see that."
6877,"Oh, good! The right kind of tears

Trust me when I say this: professors want you to flourish and succeed. We‚Äôve literally dedicated our lives to it. 

P.S. so glad you read the comments. Not all scholars do."
6878,Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs
6879,That quote had me in the first half ngl. Such good advice!
6880,"Going to college during the pandemic has been so difficult, so I can relate to your feelings. It‚Äôs nice to get a subtle reminder that our current stress is temporary and that we‚Äôre destined for bigger things. Wishing you the best!"
6881,what kind words :'). it sounds like you are a dedicated student that your college is lucky to have!
6882,"congrats! this is so relatable, academic validation really does something to bring out the waterworks lol. i‚Äôm sure your paper was amazing and the comment was well deserved!! you should be proud of yourself :)"
6883,good job
6884,Always remember that when you are feeling down. I had a teacher tell me in 6th grade that I ‚Äúhave a bright future ahead‚Äù and I cherished that so much. And it still means everything to me.
6885,"Honestly, the best case of this that i can remember was in my highschool chem class. I wasn't inherently good at chem like i was other sciences, like usually i'd get through them fine with a high B but chem really kicked my ass. 

I had a C- at the end of the first semester which is the lowest i've ever gotten on anything ever. I worked so, so hard to get my grade up, like really busted my ass for hours and at the end of the 2nd semester my chem teacher came around and showed us our grades and he showed me mine -  a 76.. 

I burst into tears right there and i'd never cried at school.

Turns out he was playing a joke on me and showed me my real grade..

It was an 87, that was pretty good for my books. He told me how proud he was of my grade improvement and told me i'd do great in whatever I chose to do in life."
6886,"oh definitely, when people remind us that they appreciate our contributions, it can be really impactful. I'm glad you remember that comment from your teacher :)"
6887,aw man the comment got removed. I'm curious what the dude said if he felt the need to comment on two of your posts lol
6888,It‚Äôs just a troll
6889,"1.)Erased all social media.
2.) stopped talking to ‚Äúfriends‚Äù
3.) Treated school as if life or death( literally)
4.) Held myself to higher standards
5.) Stop going out and used that extra time to study
6.) didn‚Äôt be afraid to say no
7.) relearned everything I was unsure about
8.) (most important)I didn‚Äôt rely on my professors to teach me
  9.) I BECAME EVERY  BOOK I READ
10.) i stopped rushing everything in my life and slowed down.
There are a lot more factors but this is my general ideology.
Also one last thing... I had to master English. When I mean master I mean be able to analyze. Being able to understand complex ideas in text books is really essential."
6890,I went from a 2.0 to a 3.0 ! ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IF YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT I PROMISE YOU!! 
6891,That‚Äôs what the fuck I‚Äôm talking about. Never stop improving.
6892,I really can't imagine how frustrating that must've been brother I feel for you. No pain no gain dawg thats what we out here to prove [https://media1.tenor.com/images/6d186c9a6d304a0cfeba5c05f85d9407/tenor.gif?itemid=5781863](https://media1.tenor.com/images/6d186c9a6d304a0cfeba5c05f85d9407/tenor.gif?itemid=5781863)
6893,Hey I go to Tech too! 
6894,"This is quite extreme. Did you always have this kind of discipline when you set your mind to something? 

Would you recommend this strategy to everyone who may be in a similar situation? "
6895,"So you took Calc 1 three times?  Got an F, then a C, then another F?  Why did you take it again after the C?

Also... what do you plan on doing as a career once you graduate? "
6896,"Extreme yes. But, no I really did not. I basically became very strict on myself during my third semester. It was my last chance to become something. The guidelines I posted can be followed but you have to mold them to your life in order for them to work. Please relearn the things you never learned or halfway learned."
6897,That A in organic chemistry! Good job OP! 
6898,"I thought I could get a better grade so I retook it and failed.  The next semester my advisor told i wasn‚Äôt able to get a better grade so I just stopped going. I was really lost

Ultimately I want to be a organic chemist but I‚Äôm going to have to work my way up. If that fails I‚Äôm getting another degree In business or eco"
6899,You know I had to do it to em
6900,How did you do it?
6901,"What do you mean by which one? As in class? 

Here‚Äôs something I commented earlier : 1.)Erased all social media. 2.) stopped talking to ‚Äúfriends‚Äù 3.) Treated school as if life or death( literally) 4.) Held myself to higher standards 5.)

6902,"I don‚Äôt want to harsh your mellow man. But it is really, really hard to make friends out of college. Please don‚Äôt put academics before everything. Make the time. "
6903,Wreck ‚Äòem !
6904," About 30 hours  per week. It was my job. I learned very pedantically. If I couldn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù that meant there was something wrong with my knowledge and did everything to find the gap in the logic.
"
6905,"I knew it! Those colors. The layout. The font. It‚Äôs like a little part of my lizard brain recognized it and gave me a little panic attack for old times sake.

Also, seriously OP you should be proud as hell. Turning your shit around is one thing but doing it at a school like Tech is really impressive. People like you make me proud to be a yellow jacket."
6906,"Messed up my freshman year and got a 2.6
I did summer classes and retook the ones I didnt do well in and I'm at a 2.8 now. I desperatly want a 3.5 but I've been told that It will be too difficult. I have 3 more years left and this gives me hope!"
6907,To be honest anything that comes my way. Albeit I still want to research a better way to determine molecular compounds than through nuclear magnetic resonance 
6908,i just went from a 2.0 my first semester to starting with a 3.16 junior year 
6909,My social life is near non-existent and I had the same thoughts as you. You really need your sleep I can‚Äôt stess how important it is... I do get lonely sometimes but I say it‚Äôs only temporarily every time . It‚Äôs worth it now to grind as hard as possible and make friends later. You‚Äôll always make friends but you can‚Äôt always redo college
6910,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6911,I really want to do that verbally but my cat will wake up
6912,"Wow great job! I couldn't do such a massive flip with grades like that unless I was not trying initially. Whatever the case may be for you here, I see an absolutely remarkable improvement in grades."
6913,"That‚Äôs so fucking impressive. First off, congrats. That takes way more discipline than most people will ever have. 

How is your social life now? I‚Äôm normally the kind of guy to prioritize the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù and ‚Äúschool‚Äù corners of the triangle (ignoring the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù triangle) but I realize that it‚Äôs horrible for my health. I change my mind literally every day about which one of the two to reduce more. Being an extremely social person, it‚Äôs hard to say no to things"
6914,An organic chemist doing what?  Do you want to for a chemical company?  Pharma?  Research?
6915,[deleted]
6916,At a 2.9 rn and seeing this made me believe it‚Äôs possible to go way up. Thanks for this and congrats!
6917,"Good on you for taking responsibility for your own growth. When I was an undergrad, I went from a 2.7 to a 3.4. It took three application cycles, but I was finally able to get into medical school. In a year, I‚Äôll be graduating from Texas Tech with an MD. Guns up!"
6918,To be honest I‚Äôve been an asocial person my entire life and i really don‚Äôt mind not interacting according the norm however i do connect with individuals to form a professional network
6919,"It's totally rational to be annoyed. That sounds really frustrating, and it sucks that we have to face the consequences of the mistakes of irresponsible people. But hopefully this whole thing will blow over soon, until then, hold on, you got this!

6920,"Yeah I don't blame people who enjoy themselves as long as they are not endangering others, just jealous I suppose."
6921,"Same to you, it has been very rough but I know we are almost there."
6922,"I think OP means the people who don‚Äôt necessarily need college to secure their future. I know for me while I would love to take a week off and just say screw it, that isn‚Äôt really possible for me. I don‚Äôt have the funds and if my grades were to tank as a result I especially don‚Äôt have the funds to deal with any of the consequences."
6923,There's always meeting new people even in this online world. I'm in the same boat with ya except going to start with therapy soon because nothing else has really helped. Like I pass classes but it's a what is the point anymore kinda feeling. Try making friends or at least getting to know ppl in your classes and doing hw or studying with them. I've been on discord the last year more than ever and it's kept me somewhat sane. Hope that helps but ya who knows when this will be over tbh.
6924,"I just wish my school had let us have spring break this year. It‚Äôs been so nice outside where I am and I would love to be able to take a break from my work and just go outside to the parks, take some small hikes, and hammock lol."
6925,Just curious but wdym rich people who could let themselves have a week off from studying? Anyone can take a week off...
6926,"Hm I think you guys are hyper focusing on a very tiny minority. The vast majority of people, wealthy included, cannot just drop out of school."
6927,"I feel this. We also don‚Äôt have a spring break and I‚Äôm so behind in my classes and tired. All of my classmates are so burnt out and stressed that our teachers have begun to notice. I feel for them too, not being able to have a spring break with their families."
6928,"I think OP means people that can afford a week off.  Afford in the sense that they have expendable income and the time to take off.  Not everyone can take a week off.  I got a Spring Break.  During my Spring Break my teachers gave me 2 writings assignments, 2 midterms, one test, 7 chapters of law to read and take notes on, and 2 projects to begin.  I spent my entire spring break at home, working my ass off everyday to try to keep up with all the extra work.  If I had taken that week off, I would have fallen behind in every class."
6929,"What can ya do man. I just want to let you know that I am very grateful for you doing your part and doing what we should be doing right now to try and ease this pandemic.  I realize it probably isn't gonna make you feel any better but I just want to let you know. I realized I haven't actually told anyone about my gratitude for quarantining, so you are the first I decided to let know"
6930,My university split spring break up and inserted those days into random parts of the semester but in the middle of the week so we don‚Äôt go anywhere. But this means that we still have to do homework that due at the end of the week on the days we are supposed to be off.
6931,Don‚Äôt cry to give up. Cry to keep going. You are already in pain. Get a reward from it. You need to go to office hours for the classes you are failing. I don‚Äôt care if you have to sleep outside their office in a sleeping bag. You do it. Stop making excuses on why you aren‚Äôt going and go. You have a little time left. Make it work
6932,"ha, glad I'm not the only one who woke up during what was supposed to be spring break thinking ""I should probably see someone, this is bad"""
6933,"This is so bizarre, I feel like I‚Äôm in the twilight zone. Sir or ma‚Äôam, I say this in the most respectful way I can: I think you are a on a witch-hunt to place blame on this imaginative villain, and are consequently disillusioned with the realities of what‚Äôs going on at college. It doesn‚Äôt cost anything to just relax in your home take a mental health days; play some video games, go for a run, etc. Take 3-4 days off won‚Äôt put you at a significant disadvantage in your courses. I say this as someone who cannot afford to retake courses, or to enroll an extra year. I say this as a 4th year who has a lot of experience in college."
6934,"Yes but the majority of us are broke af basically living paycheck to paycheck. We can‚Äôt exactly jet off to Colorado, Florida, or wherever there is a resort if you can barely afford rent. And a lot of us literally can‚Äôt afford to take classes again."
6935,Gentlemen's Cs are still a thing at some schools. Also helps if you have connections that can help you cheat and/or the money to pay people to do work for you
6936,"I write for my university newspaper and our inbox is filled with questions asking why are students going on vacations when we didn‚Äôt have a spring break specifically to keep people from going on vacations. This was specifically to protect our professors, immunocompromised  students and the surrounding community. And I‚Äôm a CivE major, I can‚Äôt just take a random 3-4 day break unless I want to fall behind on work."
6937,"Oh man, I have seven 90 minute lectures to catch up on before my next exam which is this Friday, and have an essay to write tonight for which I keep brain farting on as soon as I type one word. It is ROUGH."
6938,I‚Äôm in the exact same boat. I had to write a midterm essay but I just sat down and physically couldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm burnt out beyond belief and these ‚Äúrespite‚Äù days don‚Äôt help anything. They pretend to give us days off with no work but they really don‚Äôt help if we need to work on midterms and other projects.
6939,"That really depends on your classes. I'm in CS and the workload has increased from in person, and it's synchronous lectures so you have to attend."
6940,"Sure, they can't just drop out. However, they definitely don't have to worry about their GPA all that much if their next step (career, grad programs, etc.) is already set up for them. There's a big difference between ""I'm here because if I do well enough I might be able to find a good job"" and ""I'm here to get a degree before I start at my dad's company""."
6941,"Yeah mines got rid of spring break as well smh. My friends  from other colleges have their spring break and it's super unfair. What's the point of taking it away when other colleges still allow it? If it's to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it's not gonna stop the spreading. No point. I see people go out everyday there's no freaking point. It really pisses me off. My college instead gave us a longer winter break to compensate for it but they just made it worse....like I want to have a spring break, not a three month winter break"
6942,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in that headspace!!  That sucks dude.  Please get yourself some fresh air, sunshine and exercise.    Feel better.   And don‚Äôt concern yourself with other people.  Focus inward and heal.   When your that torn up inside anything other people do is offensive.  I know because I‚Äôve been there many times before.   And once you‚Äôve healed from it.  Healing from it again is easier."
6943,"Bro, maybe you just need a week off to have fun. I hope you feel better but maybe just try to let loose once in a while. Im not rich at all (I live in Beaumont, Tx the 3rd most dangerous city in Tx and top 25 most depressing cities in the USA) and me and my homies be kicking it even tho we have college shit to do. Just take some breaks once in a while throughout the day and just chill. Time for yourself will heal u up. Big ups to u man"

6945,"Same. I took a day off yesterday to cleany garage and just be outside. And now I'm swamped and overwhelmed today. 

Its finally nice here. I wish I could have gone out and gardened and built my raised bed. I wish I could go for a walk or go on a picnic with my boyfriend. I'm so tired of homework, but we're starting finals season in two weeks instead. I want to take a break. I want to breathe. I already had to drop a class to be able to make it through without a full blown meltdown. I just want to be outside."
6946,I know a lot of people who said we shouldn‚Äôt get a spring break because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre online anyway‚Äù or ‚Äúcolleges have always been online‚Äù. That‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs about! Yeah we‚Äôre online but this was nobody choice. Zoom University is the fucking worst.
6947,"It is really ignorant to just say ‚Äúanti-depressants are bad‚Äù. I agree that medicine alone doesn‚Äôt usually fix the issue, but if someone is on the verge of suicide, anti-depressants are essential for helping that person take the first steps towards help."
6948,"Discord! Make a discord for a class, share the link during class or something. Thats mostly what I've done and I've met like maybe 10 or so ppl or gotten to know some ppl better by doing hw or studying and whatnot together. Not the best substitute social life but gotten me to pass my classes up to this point last 3 quarters..."

6950,"This is stupid, most classmates on zoom and instruction meetings watch from their bed, couch, hell one time the girl was driving with friends (not practicing social distancing) and had her passenger friend hold the phone up like a selfie stick towards her to show that she was there.

There are better and more absurd reasons to give someone a zero (refusing to put on webcam, etc). If it becomes a problem where she some how noticed that you are on the couch or bed and give you a zero for that email and official. Take a screenshot of your self, provide proof, etc.

My solution is to drape an white sheet behind you and pretend to be upwards on the webcam"
6951,I feel like an email explaining the problematic nature of this requirement wouldn‚Äôt be bad - maybe she doesn‚Äôt realize it?
6952,Thank you. My thoughts exactly
6953,"i would tell them, i dont have a desk so its either my bed or the floor. put them in the position to choose"
6954,[deleted]
6955,That‚Äôs not right. Some people don‚Äôt have desks in their rooms. I‚Äôm thankful for my professor who are even nice enough to have students disable the camera or mute themselves when needed
6956,I‚Äôd contact someone higher up such as a chair or dean of the school.  That way the professor can‚Äôt take any anger out on you specifically.
6957,"Talk to the dean, hun. That's not right"
6958,"Thank y‚Äôall all for responding! I just wanted to make sure my concern was valid. I never planned on taking my exam in bed or the couch but as some comments have said, not everyone‚Äôs situation allows for them to be sitting prim and proper at a school desk like a 10 yr old. 
      
I actually contacted the department chair with a formal grievance about her for other insane reasons, 2 days ago. But this is just one more cherry on top of her shit show power struggle. I‚Äôll update when I get a response!"
6959,What if you don't have a webcam? (I've never seen a reason to have one)
6960,"Idk I feel this is definitely serious enough to be brought up to the dean, but to be a fair person give her a chance of changing this ridiculous rule. Then if she still says ‚Äúno‚Äù, even after such a valid reason, I‚Äôd show no mercy up in the deans office telling them every wrong she has ever done"
6961,"Most webcams are attached to monitor all in one pc‚Äôs, or Laptops (which is a must for students) so it‚Äôs probably a small majority but I am guessing you would need to let the professor know.

I seen some people fail not related to my school, my school told us that if we have no access to internet or laptops then they would provide one to us"
6962,"Honestly maybe only bring it up after the semester is over. I've seen firsthand how if a professor is pissed at you, it can really be a bad time as a student. Idk tho just my thoughts."
6963,Oh that‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm a prof. Who cares? I‚Äôm getting so tired of hearing about all these rules. Just get the dang work done.
6964,"One email to the department head and the prof would have no choice but to shut his mouth and 
Apologize. Profs don‚Äôt have any power"
6965,"Lol I wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice! Her dictatorship just does not sit well with me, however. Who are you to tell me where I can take an exam in my own home so long as I‚Äôm not cheating? *insert eye roll*"
6966,"I've never seed a webcam built into a PC monitor (except maybe the all in ones). Most laptops seem to have them, but not most PCs."
6967,Dean is a bit extream for a first step. I would contact in order escilating until solved: first the professor then the course coordinator then the department chair then the dean
6968,Don't contact the president of the school lol start with the head of the department maybe
6969,"What were the other two problems? Don‚Äôt have to be specific, but like a general idea"
6970,"Wait, why is taking an online exam in bed dumb?"
6971,Sounds like your prof is on some weird power trip and needs to get over herself lol
6972,"I second this. Try reaching out to the department chair (write a brief and concise email or detailed letter about your experience w the professor) who will take notes of the professors behavior/comments and hopefully meet with them or reach out about how they‚Äôre creating a barrier in what is already a difficult time for many. 

It‚Äôll be anonymous on your part and they can‚Äôt really argue the issue with the department chair if they see it as unfit. If all else fails, there‚Äôs always the associate dean of your college as well. Good luck! You‚Äôve got every reason and right to report the professor.

If the professor isn‚Äôt tenured, these types of reports go into their file and are taken into consideration whenever they‚Äôre up for tenure and can probably make or break their case. So do what ya need to! Student voices are just as worthy, especially when your time and money is going into it."
6973,"Nah it's not, I saw what another commenter said and I understand that some people don't have any other choice. I was quick to judge."
6974,"I actually don‚Äôt understand the hyper focus on ‚Äúcheating.‚Äù We live in a world where the right answer to most questions is a few clicks away; guessing in real life and being wrong is not good for a career. Most employers want you to seek answers and find the correct information‚Äîto solve your own problems. 

I believe all tests should be take home/open book/open note and in many cases collaboration should be encouraged. Working together to find answers and solve problems is what group work fails to teach, collaborative exams would address that very well. 

The world is a disaster right now and I have seen way too many teachers worry their students are ‚Äúcheating‚Äù and pretending to be sick or have sick family members. It is so disappointing. Schools should be giving students credit for the coursework they are doing and let it all just go."
6975,Keep that email to send to the dept chair
6976,Tbh I would love to see someone take the class from their toilet just to make a point.
6977,">Send it to the dean!!! 

No dean has time for this sort of trivia. That's what department chairs are for. (Like me.)"
6978,Exactly. That‚Äôs why this is so absurd to me...
6979,[removed]
6980,It has definitely given some profs ideas though.
6981,"I've got an unpopular opinion. Ready? When it comes to cheating, it is both the teacher and the students' fault. A small percentage of students cheat because they are genuinely lazy but in my experience, most college students cheat because 

1. they've studied hard but they feel unconfident about their knowledge and 

2. they didn't study well enough. Even reason 2 could be avoided if the professor built a trusting relationship with their students through shared discussions and study hours. Add in some weighted homework and we reduce the feeling of high-stakes-to-the-point-of-cheating in exams. We've honestly gotta quit this antagonistic dynamic."
6982,Maybe it's the last question? We can't backtrack in some of our online tests
6983,This has been posted like 3 times already. And I think its even been proven fake.
6984,Who would set their students up like that???? That‚Äôs devilish.
6985,Why would the exam question that's supposedly been created just for this exam appear before the exam was posted...?
6986,[removed]
6987,I don't doubt that it could be faked but how would it be proven that it was?
6988,"How exactly did he post the answer on Chegg? Don't you have to post the question and a certified tutor or whatever will answer your question? Additionally, he said that it's impossible to solve."
6989,"That's scary.
Edit because thread is locked:
No, I do not own a subscription to Cheggs and only used it (borrowed a friend‚Äôs account) once to complete a homework assignment I was struggling in for 2 hours. 

What is scary is what if one were to answer it ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù or somehow guess it without cheating and then be seen as a cheater?"
6990,"AYYY, my daily dose of this fake ass email is here! 5 days in a row so far lmao how much longer can this streak go?? hmmmmm"
6991,So a teacher planning this sort of thing would need that convincing evidence yes. Which is exactly why it wouldn't be released before the exam. That's just actively ruining the argument for them cheating.
6992,"This would be a little (tiny, tiny, tiny) bit more reasonable if the professor had sent out an email before the exam stating that this was a trick question. Still, giving those students a flat zero is completely fucked. Even if this is fake I wouldn't put it past some professors to pull something similar."
6993,Lol what if you just guessed?
6994,"Yes yes, but that's not what I'm saying. The person above said that if the exam question was posted on chegg before the exam then the teacher can't prove they cheated and weren't just studying.

That defeats the entire purpose of posting the exam question to catch cheaters using chegg to cheat mid exam in the first place and makes zero sense..."
6995,Meh just don‚Äôt cheat.
6996,"Take what you can, give nothing back"
6997,Its the same logic as police entrapment.
6998,"This has been posted about a bazillion times already all over reddit (including here) and every meaningful discussion that can be had, has already been had. I don't want unsuspecting visitors falling afoul of Rule 3, i.e. advocating or engaging in cheating services, hence thread locked.

No university that it has been attributed to over the last few days -- whether it's BU, Rutgers, Harvard, or Northeastern -- has claimed it originated within their university. No one knows where it originated. Chegg have said it is fake.

7039,Yeah. I agree. Docs is great for that in my experience. Easily able to tell if something was actually written. Profs are always requiring ms word even though the functionality is the same 99% of the time. Only problem I see with it is how the cloud and the sharing system could be annoying for profs who have large class numbers
7040,One time a system was registering that I was plagiarizing‚Ä¶ from myself‚Äî a draft I had turned in a few weeks earlier. The prof didn‚Äôt care (obv) but it goes to show how horrible AI detection is for something like grading and plagiarism
7041,"Download it as a Word doc and format it at the end. Your profs don't need to know that you wrote it on Docs. But if they accuse you of using AI, you'll have the evidence.

I think Word also has a tracking feature if it's linked to OneDrive. I'll have to check because I prefer Word."
7042,"What is the prevalence of false positives? Is it known? The product reflects the source material. When the internet and other writings of humans are the source, it follows that the distinction between source and product will be not be precise."
7043,">When the internet and other writings of humans are the source, it follows that the distinction between source and product will be not be precise.

.. yes, that's the problem. A student who did not cheat and did nothing wrong by not saving drafts may unfairly get a 0."
7044,"Am lecturer, came here to post this. It's not just good against shitty GPT-detection bots, it'll also save your ass when you inevitably need to check what you wrote in an earlier version and since deleted. Great for group projects too, it makes it incredibly clear who did what so if one of your groupmates plagiarises then you likely won't be punished.

Important edit: the major, major advantage of git or similar over Google Docs or anything that tracks changes automatically is that you control when you commit changes, so there's no risk of it capturing it when you write ""I hate this fucking project"" or worse at the end of a frustrating day."
7045,"There are no programs currently that can reliably grade assignments. Your essays are graded by a person, but when that person suspects the use of ChatGPT they run it through detection software. Your advice to save drafts is good. Writing in a cloud service like Microsoft Word online is better. Knowing exactly what you write about and being able to defend your essay is the best."
7046,I might use the google doc idea but I never have drafts :(
7047,"Wow. Glad I'm wrapping up undergrad right now, before this becomes a widespread thing. I cannot imagine the pain and sadness of turning in say, a 5 page paper just to get a zero and have an unyielding professor turn it down for ""AI plagiarism"". The fact that it has happened already to someone, somewhere is horrible."
7048,">leaves room for instructors to assess

Yeah and sometimes professors are assholes. I've gone my whole college career thinking some students were exaggerating but holy shit no, Ive recently found some professors really are just there for their research and teaching is an annoying obligation, like a gnat. Tenure is legit. You can try to go above their head for certain things but you might get told ""I can't help you, thats within the bounds of them running their classroom"". As with anything the introduction of AI will improve some things, but adds another level of error in a way."
7049,"you can look at edit history on google docs. i don't think you need to have a draft exactly, just proof that you were working on it"
7050,"OneDrive I believe will track changes if your paper is saved in the cloud. Always preferred MS Word to Google Docs anyway, Google Docs just can‚Äôt keep up with Word‚Äôs error detection/autocorrect. When I wrote papers with Google docs it was constantly missing incorrectly capitalized words, multiple spaces between words, and grammatical errors. Couldn‚Äôt be beat for convenience, though."
7051,"It will be interesting to have a prof. kick a paper and the student proving at tribunal that the paper was their own. The issue I see with prof using these detection programs is there is no penalty when there is an error. The student needs to defend their innocence while the prof hides behind the program. A student is proven to turn in work that is not there own, there are ramifications. If proven that it was a false accusation, there is not even an apology. Professors if there is any doubt, do not accuse unless all the fact checks are manually made. 

I save all my drafts by making a new copy and sequential file numbering with each revision."
7052,"Good advice, but this contains an unwarranted accusation that is going to mislead some people. You say, ""meaning that professors are no longer grading their work by themselves, but instead with the helping hand of an unreliable and inaccurate software,"" and that is almost certainly impossible and not true. 

As a history teacher for nearly 50 years (yes, old), all paper have to be read, either by you or by your teaching assistants. No paper can possibly be graded without being read. What you mean is that the papers are ""also"" compared to the results on Chat GPT or a plagiarism detector, something nearly all teachers now due regularly. I required all paper submitted to me to also be submitted to a plagiarism detecting website. Only in rare cases, was there a problem and often it was very minor stuff. 

But you cannot make a claim that teachers are ""no longer grading their work themselves"". It's simply not at all true and is kind of insulting. Please be more careful with what you say. Plus you can't restrain yourself and next you say, ""internet tools they aren't willing to understand"". No, they do their best, but if their lifelong subject is English Literature, how excellent at computers are they going to be, really? Have some understanding of this. If there were a ""magic paper grading machine,"" it might be nice, but I'm not holding my breath. 

As for saving drafts of your work, yes do that. Also save your notes. I always suggested that my students save each day's work as a separate file -- from initial notes and ideas through each newly-edited version of the paper until the final draft. By the time you're done, you might have a couple dozen different versions of the work, each one growing longer and better over the days and weeks. That pretty well shows you doing your own work. 

How do you do this? Just ""save"" each draft or each day's work under a slightly different title such as ""2023 History Paper 1,"" ""2023 History Paper 2,"" ""2023 History Paper 3,"" and so on. Or maybe you can think of an even easier way to do this as I'm not Mr. Computer Science Guy."
7053,"on google docs you just need to start typing and it automatically saves everything you do every step of the way. you can go back and find a previous version of the doc at any point. at the top you should see a little message that says ""last edited at 4:34"" or whatever time, you should be able to click on it and see all the past work and changes you had made"
7054,"Nahh, that just shows your prof was refusing to correctly use the tools at their disposal. A high level of similarity doesn't necessarily equals plagiarism. The software might detect the former, it's the professor's job to evaluate whether it's also the latter."
7055,"""I hate this fucking project"" is what a comp book on your desk is for. :D"
7056,Not sure what you mean here.
7057,Not sure if a post got deleted but someone had mentioned that the plagiarism checker can pinpoint down to the sentence. That level of granularity leaves room for instructors to assess whether it's a legit case of plagiarism or coincidence.
7058,"you misunderstood their comment, the professor saw it obviously wasnt plagiarism and didn't care"
7059,I agree except for the last part. Because sure it‚Äôs good to know your subject well and be able to defend your paper but like we‚Äôve seen on this sub many professors are assholes about it and won‚Äôt change your grade without hard evidence so I doesn‚Äôt replace the Google docs advice
7060,"This would work if I didn't do every large writing assignment in 1 sitting right before the deadline

No joke though google docs has saved me this way. Strangely enough, Google maps location tracking saved me from failing a course due to attendance because it proved I was there for the specific amount of time"
7061,">Should I point out that some students are also ""assholes"" as a good reason not to even go to college? 

Where did I say some professors being assholes is a reason not to go to college? What? And yes you can go right ahead and call certain students assholes, they are, so ..

Some people are jerks, how does that add to the discussion? Are you serious? We are talking about ChatGPT and the tools professors use to curb that type of cheating, and ways that can backfire on students who did nothing wrong. You're very defensive and I'm not sure why.

>maybe avoid enormous research factory universities?

My school has about 2k students, you might want to check your assumptions."
7062,"The problem is that with the rise of ChatGPT, these detectors try to check if the work was created by an AI both rather than a human. They're not looking for identical work anymore. And many college students' level of writing is similar to a bot, which can lead to false positives."
7063,"I agree with what you said. I apologize if I offended you by my remarks, the last thing I was trying to do was insinuate that teachers don't take the time to grade papers, or that they don't have the capability to understand how AI works. Neither of those things are true. 

I was only trying to explain the dangers of not saving your work as a student in this day and age, because currently many teachers and professors have incorporated a brand new software when checking the legitimacy of student papers to combat the use of ChatGPT in academic settings. This new detecting software is not as good as it should be, as it has been proven to output entirely inaccurate information, telling instructors that human-made writing was in fact made by a robot. This can be dangerous to students when lazy instructors (unlike yourself) who do not have a willingness to investigate false positives (inaccurate predictions) in the software can simply ruin a student's grade and GPA without regard to their pleas of innocence. 

Teachers like yourself who take the time to deliberately check the legitimacy of a student's work (in comparison to simply relying on a misleading tool to determine which letter grade a student's paper will receive) should be having no problems of giving out wrong grades, especially if you remind students to save their proof of work. As a teacher, you are doing the right things here, and if all instructors did this, my post would be irrelevant."
7064,"Wait, you guys are writing drafts?"
7065,I always save every few sentences in Word where I know there will be a history of what I‚Äôve written. Even for discussion posts. I write it in word and save it to my computer before copying and pasting it in canvas. I never want there to be an issue with a professor thinking I am cheating or using any outside source to get my work done
7066,"I agree. Oftentimes in education the power dynamic between a student and the professors/administrators leaves the students at the mercy of everyone above them, with no power to defend themselves. Sometimes in university students are allowed to present their innocence of cheating in front of a panel or board, which is nice. But many times, especially in undergraduate programs and high school, the administrators have no obligation or regard to protect the student, and the student has no grounds to defend him/herself. I hate that. I can't think of many other institutions where these situations happen."
7067,I'm a high school teacher and I use the Google docs feature to go back in a doc's history to figure out if students are using AI. Save your drafts it really helps to see who's writing their own papers and who isn't!!
7068,"This is misinformation. Professors aren‚Äôt using programs to grade papers; where are you getting this idea from? There have been programs developed, that are similar to plagiarism checking programs, for trying to track ChatGPT use, but my understanding is that these are unreliable. Also, many universities, such as mine, ban the use of plagiarism checking software, because it violates students‚Äô IP. 

If you get accused of using AI software, yes, showing your drafts is a good plan, and the burden of proof is on the professor. But stop spreading this idea that we are somehow getting software to grade papers - it‚Äôs not a thing. I can‚Äôt even trust my GA to grade the papers."
7069,This is part of the reason why I'm against exams. Students should do projects instead. I only understand tests in languages and med school.

7077,"I'm also a History major, and I've come to find that becoming a historian is less about memorizing dates and facts, and more about truly *understanding* historical events, including why those things happened and how they shaped and continue to shape to world.

For example, I really couldn't tell you anything about specific battles of WW1. I couldn't tell you dates, casualties, hell I couldn't even really name many significant WW1 battles off the top of my head. There's simply too much information to memorize. However, I could probably talk for an hour about why WW1 happened, the consequences of the war, how it went on to shape the rest of history, etc.

I think that's what being a historian is really about: understanding the how and why rather than the where and when. Sure, learning dates and people/places involved is important for the sake of context and chronology, but the world simply has too much history to memorize every single date or event, even if you focus on a single area of history. Plus, all that is surface level anyway. A true historian focuses on deep understanding and research."
7078,Same here. As a history major it makes me feel inadequate when I constantly have to look stuff up to verify. The funny thing is that a lot of times my gut feeling is right but I never have confidence that I remembered something right
7079,">Students should do projects instead

it has been tried. Doesnt work. That is why we have both."
7080,It does teach you how to learn fast which isn't entirely useless
7081,"As a cs student, I‚Äôve always been told it‚Äôs a good idea to have an idea of what you learned. Like if you stumble across something in the future, you can be like ‚Äúoh I remember learning something like that in the past‚Äù and make a few google searches and quickly find an answer. Whereas if you never learned it, you wouldn‚Äôt have any clue how to locate the solution. Professional engineers are just very good googlers. Can‚Äôt make us remember all of that shit"
7082,"source is 40+years in the education industry.

We have tried several experimental methods for college learning over the years. There are several studies in this area.  For now tests have statistically proven to be a big part of education and learning. But so have projects and internships. Both go hand in hand. Tests arent going anywhere friend. Atleast for the next couple of decades or so."
7083,"‚ÄúAm I the only one‚Äù posts are always answered with: ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre not‚Äù."
7084,"I've found that making stuff completely open book leads to a reasonably significant portion of the students using that as an excuse to not bother studying at all, thinking they can just figure it out during the exam. Spoiler alert: they don't."
7085,"Source?

At the very least tests(again with the exception of languages and med school) should be made open notes. Memorization does not indicate intelligence. And don't have tests for every single class. For example english classes should be primarily projects and essays."
7086,For the most part same. If it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not interested in like math and biology it‚Äôs all GONE. But the stuff I kinda liked like English and history and stuff sticks a little better. But those I had to write essays on so that really helps for me when it comes to remembering anything.

7089,"If they're not going away, then they should focus less on memorization. Make them open notes. Tests shouldn't be regurgitating information.

Also it depends on the class. I don't see why tests are necessary in english for example. Or computer science."
7090,I actually got derivatives and integrals confused on a test lol.
7091,"The right triangle is your best friend. I set it up before I begin the problem to determine which functions I should use.

Professor Leonard demonstrates exactly what I do to make trig substitution easy in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6JwTGpG8b4&ab_channel=ProfessorLeonard) on it. The example begins at about 36:54. I've also used these three statements as a basis for which trig function I want to use and how I'll set up my triangle to get x.

Where a is a constant:

sin(Œò) = ‚àö(a\^2 - x\^2)

sec(Œò) = ‚àö(x\^2 - a\^x)

tan(Œò) = ‚àö(a\^2 + x\^2)

You also want to assign x and a to the sides where you will be able to obtain x with ease. For example, for sin(Œò) the ‚àö(**a\^2 - x\^2) would be the hypotenuse**, **a would be the adjacent**, and **x would be the opposite**. That way you could find **asin(Œò)=x**, its derivative (**dx=acos(Œò)dŒò**), and **acos(Œò)=**‚àö(**a\^2 + x\^2)** all according to SOHCAHTOA. And these can be directly substituted into the integral.

Again, the video will do a much better job of visually showing what I mean as I'm not that good at explaining how things work to others."
7092,"Yeah, especially with scholarships that have GPA requirements. I have to keep a 3.5 or higher to keep my $21000 transfer scholarship"
7093,Definitely not the only one. It honestly scares me how I literally have forgotten like every single thing I‚Äôve learned all throughout college.
7094,I agree with what you said but grades still count.
7095,L + ratio
7096,this is why I‚Äôm so so so glad most classes for my major usually do essays/projects for midterms & finals. I learn much better from researching and reiterating what I learned in my own words.
7097,Same but with Philosophy. Like I knew some noteworthy folk and their ideals but man there was so much more awesome shit buuuut I did keep ALL my notes. I love the subject so much that I couldn't just throw them out after I graduated
7098,"Yes, this! I feel like in general I remember the feelings or experiences best but dates and specific names are completely lost at the end of the semester. Although when I need the information I'm typically close to right at least. But Google helps me more often than not."
7099,"It sounds like he got a talking to and is now spitefully overreacting and is basically saying ""if they want to tell me how to do my job I'm just going to completely give up on the class."" Kind of pathetic really."
7100,Some people are still going to not do even that. Or just lie and not actually read or learn anything. It is what it is I guess. Seems like a waste of money to take that class at all.
7101,Probably both
7102,Rate my professor review: ‚ÄúReading is required to pass the course. Don‚Äôt recommend.‚Äù
7103,"Oof, I would have definitely dropped this class. That professor seems unprofessional, and not very level-headed honestly"
7104,"I don't even think he's trying to save his job. If I did this with my classes, I'd be fucking brought up to the department chair within a minute of that email going out. 

Wonder if this professor has tenure and just doesn't give a shit."
7105,"""Unprofessional professor"" is such a hilariously ironic way of putting it."
7106,"Umm that‚Äôs a little extreme. I‚Äôm doing that for one of my classes. It‚Äôs a 400 level class and you are expected to read about 4 books, write a reflection and do a project based on those books."
7107,"I'm a high school teacher and if my admin saw this, they'd probably make it school policy and try to force all of us to run our classes this way."
7108,There **will** be students complaining if a straight A isn't possible.
7109,[deleted]
7110,"This is EXACTLY what happened. And he's making his own life easier, with nothing to grade, while also not caring if any of you learn anything or not."
7111,Its been a dramatic three days. Glad we wont need to write 5 page essays on 5 different books with 300-700 pages. Thanks reddit for the support and advice. Didn‚Äôt think this would blow up as it did.
7112,I was thinking that! It's gonna happen
7113,Shii easy A. I ain‚Äôt complaining lmao
7114,"As a teacher, someone absolutely will. And the professor will assume that they just didn‚Äôt care at all until they show up at office hours in tears and begging for a second chance.

The first time it happened, I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. After that, I just realized that you cannot out-idiotproof a dedicated idiot."
7115,"eh, free A. not their problem to take some sort of stance and fuck up their curriculum"
7116,"He's literally saying you just have to upload a document that says, ""read"" for each book title. That's it. That's all you have to do for the class."
7117,He's gonna tell all his students next year about you guys üòÇ
7118,"OP forgot to mention this class is a required course, so for people who are saying to drop the class, I‚Äôm sure most of us would‚Äôve"
7119,Yeah. They're having a mental breakdown. Drop the class.
7120,"Professor‚Äôs acting like a child. Guy probably has something going on in his life don‚Äôt be too harsh.

Easy A anyways."
7121,"There is no reflection or project for these readings. In my first year college writing class we read three, maybe four different books. Granted one of them was Night which is like a 8th grade reading level."
7122,"Students gonna Karen. I see now that college is a breeding ground for Karens:

* Don't do the work
* Don't turn work in on time
* Don't do the readings nor respond to the prompt
* Still believes they deserve an A."
7123,"Not sure. If professor was an adjunct first year, the incident could have been a deal breaker, if tenured, job is secure forever."
7124,"""if tenured, job is secure forever""

I take it that you've never experienced an Academic Program Review that wipes out majors, departments, and tenured faculty?"
7125,"According to OPs original post, it's a Gen Ed Art history class. Unless OP is majoring in Art history, then it's likely not a required course."
7126,">. Seems like a waste of money to take that class at all.

Reminder: It only came to this due to students whining about the course work. Idk why people are acting like the professors the dick when all he did was have expectations from college students, and those college students decided to act like high school students, complaining and whining about the course work."
7127,Actually it looks like it‚Äôs impossible to get an A.
7128,[deleted]
7129,Yes!! Literally every friend I've talked to since we started online learning has been struggling with the sameüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
7130,"you‚Äôre definitely not alone. i think that most college students are feeling this way right now. i‚Äôm a senior and school will be online for me until i graduate. and i also just transferred a year ago. but i‚Äôm trying to look to the positive side in that i‚Äôm glad to have experienced the days where did i live away from my parents. even though my parents and family can be annoying, i know that my siblings will move out one day, and that i‚Äôll be wishing i was still living with my parents. try to make a list of positives and focus on those."
7131,"I'm literally living in the center of my campus, and I've never felt so disconnected. I have a ton of friends and classmates nearby, but because everyone is so busy ‚Äî and probably overwhelmed with their own loneliness and lack of motivation ‚Äî I haven't been able to see too many people outside of my roommate. 

Before COVID, I considered myself pretty introverted. I didn't realize until very recently how much of my well-being depends on human contact, and I've been struggling a lot lately."
7132,Calc II is definitely a big step up in difficulty from Calc I and other freshman courses. I used to consider myself a 4.0 student until I started my sophomore and my classes were actually hard.
7133,"I‚Äôm struggling right now too. I‚Äôm living on campus with mostly remote classes. 

I got a concussion two weeks ago, and because I‚Äôve had many before, it‚Äôs affecting me especially badly. My mind is all over the place and I‚Äôve become gripped by anxiety and lethargy, and the screens which give me headaches are now the only medium for the doubled load of work I have to do once I return. 

Idk. I just needed to tell someone. I fell in love the first day I got here but it feels like the bubble I‚Äôve been living in is collapsing."
7134,[deleted]
7135,"I've absolutely given up on performing at my usual level. I'm just trying to knuckle down and grind it out. 

Don't be too hard on yourself if you need to let some balls drop, no one is going to look at bad grades from 2020 and say ""oh, you did poorly!"" They're going to see them and say ""man, 2020 was the worst fuckin year, right?""

Can't really tell you what to do about loneliness, unfortunately. I don't get lonely.

Editing to update y'all: I have a paper due in 18 minutes that's only half done. When I turn it in several hours late, my professor is getting a note saying ""Sorry, I overestimated my mental state"" and that's *it*."
7136,"Yup, you are not alone. Loneliness is easily the biggest struggle as it has just led to so much malaise in my daily life as a student. Doing any assignments is a complete struggle and learning material is damn near impossible"
7137,"Bro you are not alone. I have been feeling so down, like every morning when i wake up i have this weird worry about school work and everything. I got a 3.9 last year but this year college have been hitting really hard I already have bombed two big exams which i worked so hard for but i was so anxious that I forgot everything minutes before exam. And i have never felt this loneliness before but one good thing about this loneliness Is that i am turning it into something like i have started a diet and go to gym and really seeing some physical changes so for loneliness i would suggest to listen to music, go workout of whatever kind. If there is a rooftop near by get some redbulls and airbuds and just go sit their at night and call someone you like. Also don‚Äôt let school bother you much. Every human knows this isn‚Äôt a normal semester at all and even kids with 4.0 are struggling. Just take it step by step nothing is more important than your mental and physical health. We all are struggling and colleges should take this into consideration but professors are stacking up the to do list with assignments. Its hard but hopefully it would payoff and remember it‚Äôs temporary and everything would be much better in upcoming years of college."
7138,yeah im pretty sure my schoolwork to depression nap ratio is 20/80 right now and somehow im holding on but i am just waiting for finals to kick my ass
7139,"The worst thing is I totally feel like I can ace it, but just not with all this other stuff going on (and 5 other classes, 4 of which are stem, oops)"
7140,"I‚Äôm feeling this exactly. I just moved out for my first semester of college and am quickly realizing that I lack the self discipline to perform well in an online environment and would much prefer an in-person experience- but unfortunately we can‚Äôt. It genuinely is worrying me a bit so I‚Äôm trying to work on it, but sometimes it‚Äôs just so mind numbing.

I‚Äôm starting to get incredibly lonely/bored being holed up in an apartment all week. I‚Äôm about an hour away from all my family/friends and it just costs too much money to commute back and forth. My roommates and I also keep to ourselves and typically I would play games or watch shows to pass the time, but I can‚Äôt even find joy in the little things right now. It‚Äôs really hard.

Trying to find new things to do. If anyone has any ideas I am more than open to suggestions :)"
7141,Have you told anyone about the lasting effects of the concussion? You probably should get that checked out
7142,"Yeah this semester is worse than the previous Spring semester. Professors were lenient in the Spring semester with deadlines and my college offered a P/F option for a week after final exams. Now, they aren't offering any of the leniency even though the situation imo is far worse than it was in the Spring semester."
7143,"Hi, prof here trying to figure out ways to help students. I like the Discord idea- is your professor on it?"
7144,"None of our professors are, but we sent it through the LMS so I'm pretty sure they have the link as well to join if they'd like. Originally we were planning on inviting them directly as well (mainly because we were afraid they'd think of it as a way to pass answers around and wanted to dispel that thought, but also because having them to answer questions in an easy way would be nice). However, we never got around to it and so it's just us students. It's a really, really excellent platform for communication and I think having a server with professors on as well (one per class I'd assume) would be great. Definitely recommended."
7145,"Just an idea, you could poll your students weekly or something. I wish my profs were asking how we are, what our workload through the week looks like, etc. I have lots of profs who have been helpful this semester, but I think a lot of them don‚Äôt realize how we have other classes so the work/stress adds up beyond their one class. Not to mention some people‚Äôs home challenges."
7146,You can Pm me if you want a friendüíñ I'm in the same boat
7147,"Yeah. I'm terrible at online courses, it's near impossible to study at home and I can't go anywhere because of COVID.

I still have my As, but I have 4 exams this week so expect that to drop."
7148,I feel the same way. Alcohol and comfort food has been my saving grace lmao.
7149,"I don't necessarily *want* to drink most of the time, but knowing that I couldn't if I wanted to is killing me.

I'm relying on a lot of chocolate."
7150,"I feel like I‚Äôm drowning this semester. I started grad school after being out of college for a year. I‚Äôm finding it so hard to get back into the swing of things and zoom classes aren‚Äôt helping. I‚Äôm trying to learn R, Python, and Linux on my own so I can keep up but I‚Äôm having trouble doing that while working 30 hours a week at my new job. It‚Äôs my first job since I lost my last one when pandemic started and the hours are all over the place. My parents also found out that we‚Äôre being evicted so I have to find time to sort through all of my belongings and pack everything up. On top of all of that, I experienced a death in my family. This has all happened within the past few weeks."
7151,"I've been struggling a lot too with this semester. Little to no socializing with others at the college has really left me feeling super lonely. You are not alone in this feeling. 

I'm still doing my schoolwork and stuff but it's hard to continually study by myself. Trying to set up zoom study sessions is difficult because people either dont want to or something comes up and they aren't able to."
7152,"Its been tough man. I feel unprepared for the classes I was given and having to study mostly on my own with youtube videos. Got some profs really trying their best during remote learning, but also others not really caring at all to the point they dont want anyone to talk to them and dont read the chat. No time for questions just ask the TA that monitors that chat and barely responds. Also my internet went down in 2 occasions for a week each time because a guy mowed over the internet line. Switched to a different company and while they were putting the internet they fell through my roof from the attic. Just gotta accept everything is gonna be harder than normal this school year and do your best at trying to pass."
7153,I miss working on campus because it helped to get my brain in the game. But I‚Äôm actually doing *better* this semester compared to all of my other ones
7154,I‚Äôll be lucky if I get all C‚Äôs this semester been forced to skip a lot of assignments lately.
7155,"I completely agree with this. I have one class where the professor has sent a questionnaire out but I have another class... my midterm is 3 flyers, 3 posters, 3 website layouts and 1 1000 word memo."
7156,"Things are extremely difficult this semester. For reference, I'm a campus admin and a grad student. So every day I work with undergrads who talk to me about how difficult the year is and all I can do is try and be supportive and say yeah.... this semester really really sucks. It's impossible to focus, classes are disorganized, and everybody is depressed. I constantly feel behind in my own classes. The best thing anybody has is solidarity, and maybe a calendar that will make you feel good as you cross off the days and assignments until winter break."
7157,I think majority of students are struggling rn lol
7158,Prof here. I am also struggling. I normally get a lot of my social needs met through work. Now instead of connecting with my students i get an ocean of circles with initials in them and little mute icons. I'm putting in more work than ever to create an inferior learning outcome.
7159,As someone who is in nursing school and drowning. I am very proud of you! Fuck this pandemic. Fuck bills. You rock!
7160,My gf just got all A‚Äôs for her first semester. Congratulations!
7161,Meanwhile I did the worst I‚Äôve ever done. Online school was an adjustment and I‚Äôm so happy that you managed to make this COVID Schooling Work!! CONGRATULATIONS DUDE
7162,Beasting
7163,"I want to say i am jelouse of you, but i only know about your achievements and do not know about your hard work. I didn't do any hard work so i have no right to be jealous of your achievements. Congratulations, you are a great inspiration for us. I hope you get cured of you depression and anxiety and have a bright future. Just a small advice at the end, take one step at a time, so fix one problem at a time. Thats it good luck."
7164,Therapy. I'm not kidding.. having a space to vent about my issues and be uninhibited made it so much easier to concentrate in daily life.
7165,Congratulations! can I ask if you‚Äôre in any medication for adhd or depression? or if you have any tips on how to deal with pre-exam anxiety? really happy for you!
7166,"Haha. Good job. I had all A's mid semester, but now I'm like: ""Hmm. A couple B+'s wouldn't hurt""üòÇ"
7167,I‚Äôm at 8 classes and I just wanna pass lol
7168,Ok
7169,Thank you yeah this means a lot I barely graduated high school started college in some horrific circumstances and had to drop out and then dealt with things as they came. I just transferred this year and it‚Äôs like my fifth year in school so I‚Äôm just happy I‚Äôm finally getting my shit together. Honestly stability makes a huuuuuuuuge difference and this is the first time in my life that I‚Äôve had that.
7170,"I got covid the week of lab practicals and fell further behind than I already was so I felt like I had no choice but to drop my one and only class. This semester sucked for me. It started so strong, too."
7171,"What tips do you want? There are internal and external, and I think a lot of people will give you generic ""external"" (i.e. manage environment, not mental capacity - which is internal) advice like ""make a list of stuff and break it down!"", ""time management!"", etc etc.

Having (m)any mental health issues can typically negate the external advice, rendering you with the same level of functionality/productivity as before the advice: if not a temporary fix."
7172,Congrats! You did that shit!
7173,Nice
7174,haha i have a final due tn and i‚Äôm still procrastinating hahahaha this is a cry for help
7175,"Likely talking about how their grades usually range from a to c. If you don‚Äôt know, what when someone says they are an ‚Äúa‚Äù student or a ‚Äúc‚Äù student, then they believe that they generally get and are really only capable of getting a‚Äôs or c‚Äôs."
7176,I‚Äôm incredibly happy for you!! You are capable and have proved it to yourself! You‚Äôre going to kill it next semester!
7177,"this right here is my inspiration of the day. good job <3 (also may I ask what you meant by ""I am an ABC student""?"
7178,Congratulations üéàüéâüçæüéä That is a hard thing to do a big accomplishment!! Be very Proud :)
7179,Woot woot ‚ù§Ô∏è congratulations!!
7180,nice!!!
7181,Helll yeah man!!!
7182,I love to see it!! I may not know you but I am very proud of you! I have ADHD/anxiety/depression/AllOfTheAbove and im taking 7 classes next semester (my final semester) and this just inspired me so much!
7183,Keep that shit up bro. Good shit
7184,"I also just got all As for the first time ever and I‚Äôm a senior with 1 semester left lol. Took me a while (made one B my first semester freshman year and basically gave up chasing a good GPA at that point) and I made a lot of Cs and a couple Ds along the way, but slowly making progress. I too suffer from functioning depression and have been dealing with heavy issues at home and with friends but we made it! Just keep grinding it will be worth it at the end."
7185,Please some tips!
7186,Ayee keep it up!!
7187,"Happy for you!!! 
Good shit!! I have an anxiety disorder and have been on meds for years now, I understand the struggle! You have a strong will power, keep it up!!! 
I‚Äôm crossing my fingers to also get straight As, maybe one B wouldn‚Äôt be bad either but a boy can dream!"
7188,Congrats!!!
7189,Got eem
7190,Wait we can fill out the Fafsa any time of the year??
7191,Yeah! The sooner they go to your school the better aid you‚Äôll get though
7192,Has to be this
7193,This is great üòÇ
7194,If you can't get in and you get locked out you can always call FASFA and verify your identity over the phone and they will send you the link to change your password to get back out. So it's not the end of the world. Just make the necessary changes and update your phone number and email address so if you get locked out again getting back and will be easier.
7195,"Maybe include ""Ha"" in front of it?"
7196,Thanks so much! I'm on it
7197,"I used to hate filling out fasfa, it would be so time consuming. I didn't remember the password or the questions asked."
7198,Could have been custom security questions
7199,"Well, Deez Nutz didn‚Äôt run for president till 2016, so you can probably rule out Politician"
7200,"check ur school's specific needs, some of them will only accept it after a certain date because their system is re-setting. if you fill it out too early, the system will reset and delete your work"
7201,Gottem. That's funny asf
7202,"I had an email from when I was 12 that I've tried to recover so many times throughout the years. The question I can't answer is ""Who is my favorite uncle?""

I only have one uncle. His name is Mark. It is not the answer. Lol."
7203,somebody found ‚Äúinspect‚Äù
7204,"Next time, use a password manager and treat those fields as more passwords. The password manager solves the issue of remembering the password, and treating the stupid security questions as more passwords prevents people from being able to get around your password with very guessable information."
7205,"It was ‚ÄúHa, gotem‚Äù and ‚ÄúBruce Springsteen‚Äù"
7206,Who was your first boss? Boss Baby
7207,"Please update us, I'm so curious"
7208,"""...look good on your chin.""

7209,Maybe it‚Äôs someone from a tv show. Like uncle Joey or Jesse from full house or something like that
7210,I had to create a new username and password when something similar happened
7211,ur mom
7212,You know bofa?
7213,"I'm crying laughing at this. üòÇ I missed almost the entire internet in 2014, so I can't help, sorry!"
7214,"""in ya mouth""?"
7215,Lmk if it works cause that was a rly popular commercial so that was my first thought
7216,How? If i may ask. Coma? Living off the grid in the wilderness? Prison stint?
7217,And if you believe that you‚Äôll believe anything
7218,"Weremadeforfucking

Me!"
7219,[deleted]
7220,Yeah I‚Äôm kinda in the same boat. Never realized how introverted I was until I thrown into this completely new world
7221,Same here. I tried to hang out with a girl in my class but her friend made me feel like a third wheel.
7222,[deleted]
7223,"College loneliness has been dramatically on the rise for a few years now. I have to do a project on it, and it‚Äôs super fun because I can relate. Apparently it hits hardest after thanksgiving."
7224,"I understand. I think the reason why it‚Äôs so difficult for me is that I‚Äôve always had close friends. I‚Äôve never really struggled to fit in anywhere and I also like to go out drinking and what not but this week it really hit me that I‚Äôm feeling alone and don‚Äôt really know how to handle it. I‚Äôm seeing people with their friends and I hear people talking about parties they went to the previous night and I just feel so left out.

As for you worrying about wasting crucial years, I also feel the same sometimes. I tell myself that that‚Äôs just the way it is or that sometimes these things come later and you just have to wait. Hopefully in a few years we can look back and have something great to compare these years to."
7225,"I just transferred from a school where I had a ton of friends for nonschool reasons. Now I have not a single friend. Constantly lonely, always sad. :( hopefully it gets better for us loners, all you need is one."
7226,I try to do this but there‚Äôs always that little voice in the back of my head telling me that I‚Äôm being annoying or that they don‚Äôt like me etc. It‚Äôs just a little more difficult right now considering I‚Äôve never really been in this position before.
7227,I had that same problem my first 2 years in college. I ended up transferring to a different school and ended up liking the social climate better there. Every school has a different energy to it and certain schools will have a better environment for you to thrive in than others.
7228,I‚Äôm feeling the same way. I‚Äôm friends with my roommate and one or two friends from back home. But I can‚Äôt seem to make any meaningful connections with anyone to do stuff on the weekends with or hang out with after classes. I‚Äôm hoping joining this new club will help. I just go to a HUGE school and I am very introverted. It‚Äôs my sophomore year so most people already have their group of friends they stick with
7229,"College is lonely and it kinda sucks in general. People really hype up college as the best years of your life, but that cannot be further than the truth. You got this, get good grades, talk to people in class, join a club you care about. Don't try to live up to the hype, just try your best"
7230,"Yeah, I find I have people I talk to at school, but not outside."
7231,"Thanks for the response.  You communicate really well, by the way.

I wonder whether there are more like us, especially given the constant news about our generation feeling lonelier and lonelier.  But I don't quite feel lonely, though I do often feel left out‚Äîjust like you said.  Does that make sense?  I think that I've just come to terms with the university routine, seeing as I'm a junior now.  It doesn't depress me, but it gives me little to be excited about, either.  I kind of just want to move onto my professional life, as I've always for some reason had a better social time in work environments.  I sometimes feel like I'm almost too serious all the time, expecting others to meet me the same way.  Of course, they don't, and that's okay, if not better for them."
7232,Aw :( I hope you can spend some time with her without her friend around
7233,"Great, so this shit's gonna get worse for me?"
7234,"Try committing to people.  If you just talk to them passively, they probably won‚Äôt have much interest in inviting you anywhere.  Next time you‚Äôre with people, ask direct questions like ‚ÄúAre you guys doing anything tonight‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan I get dinner with you guys‚Äù.  As long as you‚Äôre friendly, most people are in your boat and are looking for new close friends too, and would be happy to hang out more."
7235,"The number of times I've heard that College is the best part of life, partying, going out, making so many friends, new love interests, and lots of freedom.

However I'm finding myself in a problematic situation at the moment in terms of social problems. People seem to have already divided eachother into groups and I don't seem to fit in.

But I wall try my best on my academics, thank!"
7236,"Go home, see family, remember what a close relationship is, and go back to the place where no one checks if you disappear for day or two. It hits hard. It's not necessarily like no one cares either, but they don't know you well enough or have the time to worry about someone else. Eventually, you get used to it or find a close relationship. Or become the person who is never without a significant other for more than a couple weeks."
7237,"I‚Äôm a senior and I still feel this way sometimes. I think it‚Äôs part of the experience, unfortunately. My best advice is to meet people where and when you can. Getting involved in things you‚Äôre interested in helps, and I think it‚Äôs harder if you‚Äôre introverted or more quiet. I don‚Äôt have a great solution to the problem, but I think you can do things to try to find friends."
7238,"First day I look around everyone already has friendship groups because it's sixth form, I'm not going to just but into an entire group so what do I do"
7239,I‚Äôm the same way. Have never felt so alone before. It‚Äôs so hard to make friends here
7240,Me too.
7241,Me  like seriously and I‚Äôm the nicest person ever and people don‚Äôt like interacting with me
7242,"Thank you, I appreciate it.

I‚Äôm sure there are a lot more like us even though I haven‚Äôt met any, they‚Äôre out there somewhere. I feel the same. I have friends from back home that I can talk to but for me, real in-person conversation is what‚Äôs important, rather than text. I think college is fine, I don‚Äôt hate it or love it but even just having that one friend who I can connect with would really make a difference. When I was in school, I just wanted to move on quickly and get to college similar to how you feel about working professionally. 

Sometimes I think that I don‚Äôt quite know myself yet, perhaps that is interfering with how I communicate with people. Hopefully when you reach your professional life it will be how you want it to be."
7243,"Im mostly alone but I get why and dont mind as I consider myself an introvert, I do want some interaction which I can get in my classes, obviously I'd like friends and an SO but I have pretty high standards for people I'm with so I'm just chilling rn"
7244,"Why would it be weird to ask someone to join a study group? In my experience with difficult classes, most students struggle or at least want to talk and work out study questions together."
7245,"What the actual fuck, everything you just said there is exactly the same as me"
7246,"I'm doing a few RSOs and have an on campus job, but nothing's clicking. I don't understand it."
7247,"Same as myself. I'm really shy and quiet, although I try and push myself out of my bubble and try communicate as often as I can. Although the longer I go there the more awkward it feels to introduce myself this late."
7248,"Feel you bruh, came from the west coast over to the east coast as a transfer and ik nobody"
7249,Lmaoooo i love this comment
7250,Spent 2 hours trying to write a single paragraph today. Just couldn't find the right phrasing.
7251,"I just woke up and poof! It's 7pm!   
The courses keep pouring... I wish I could replicate myself to study many modules at the same time."
7252,"yeah I've got something due tomorrow morning that my classmates have been working on for days.

just gonna go full send on the time crunch I guess."
7253,"I wake up at about 10ish, maybe I'll start waking up at like 8 now"
7254,"What helps for me is getting up early & going to sleep early. I set a 7:30 am alarm every day and I force myself up at that time. Really helped my productivity. Also going to sleep on time, having a hard limit makes you more rested and help you manage time better. Sounds weird but ALWAYS if you get better/longer sleep, you will be able to do your work faster and with higher quality. Even if that means spending 30 min less on work, the extra 30 min and routine will pay dividends back and allow you to do what would normally take an hour in 45 or even 30 mins. 

Whatever you do, the #1 thing is to work on self control, being honest with yourself. Only when you are truly honest with yourself can you make leaps and bounds of improvement"
7255,"Honestly i don't think it's as much if a time issue (for me at least) as it is a motivation issue. Because i spend alot of time on work, i feel too mentally drained to do other things, like read, or play videogames. Honestly the pandemic has made it more difficult to work efficiently, so it is harder to do stuff i enjoy. The worst part is that unless they get their shit together, we are going to be dealing with this for alot more time. Fuck"
7256,To avoid this I usually spend some time word vomiting on my Word doc. Sometimes just spewing things onto the paper can get the words flowing.
7257,"Last night I turned in my paper at 11:58 pm and ironically, the final countdown was playing in the background"
7258,Every! Single! Day! The only solution is staying up late and that gets exhausting.
7259,"absolutely, and my professors always tell us to take 2 hours for every credit hour or something like that. i have work, i have other classes, i have a life, howwwwww?"
7260,"I have a huge window in my room (basically an entire wall is window) and I sleep with the curtains and window open. I go to sleep around 10/10:30pm and trained my body to actually get sleepy around that time so it comes naturally. No more late night movies - I can‚Äôt stay awake more than 10 mins in. In the morning, I can‚Äôt stay asleep when there‚Äôs light, so I wake up naturally around 7:30-8:30am without an alarm. 

It took about 1-1.5 weeks of sleeping earlier / waking up with the sun to get my body into the habit."
7261,"Yeah that is what I have been doing. I have been staying up late because I have a lot of work to do, which makes me wake up later feeling tired which makes me take long naps. I end up having less time in the day because of that. It's an endless cycle lol."
7262,Yup but it‚Äôs probably because every time I take a break I‚Äôm like: ‚Äújust one episode of Killing Eve and I‚Äôll go back to studying for this stupid stats test.‚Äù Approximately 5 hours later: ‚Äúwait why is it 1 Am already?‚Äù
7263,I have to remind myself to just keep typing so I don't get stuck up on things.
7264,well I wish you the best of luck :)
7265,YES I have so much work and not enough time to work
7266,"That‚Äôs why for every paper I have a ‚Äúbrain dump‚Äù where I write a bunch of stuff with zero structure. Half of it it paragraphs, half of it is bullet points. Sometimes I just copy paste parts of an article I wanna write about. Eventually I take a few sentences over to a new document and I can start writing it."
7267,This is the way
7268,Never enough time. Too much homework.
7269,yes because posting on reddit is an extremely time consuming act lol
7270,"This. Changing my writing style to something like this changed my life. I type whatever comes to mind, throw in graphs, pictures, copy/paste relevant paragraphs. Then at the end turn it all into cohesive writing (obviously I remove the copy/pasted stuff)."
7271,"Right? They might as well be saying ""Pfft fuck taking a few minutes to vent for your mental health. You should be killing yourself to live right now just like my glorious self."""
7272,"I've always had to pick and choose what I do, what I study on, what I focus on i.e. I know there's things I can't learn in the time between test and there's things I can, but if I try to learn the hard stuff I won't and I will fail the stuff I can."
7273,SAME! Legit I get up at like 7-8 am and work till like around 5-7 pm. I spend my entire day doing work and will still have work to do the next day I couldn‚Äôt finish.
7274,"Especially with classes being at home, I feel the need to spend more time on household chores + cooking, which means less time available for coursework üôÑ"
7275,This is something all working adults can agree on. Its especially harsh on people who for one reason or another aren't as quick and energetic as others might be.
7276,right there with you lol
7277,Secret your classmates don‚Äôt tell you: they were also procrastinating.
7278,"seconding this. I've started ""micromanaging"" my day into one hour slots. It helps me manage my productivity bc I know that I have to be working on something at a given time. I do plan for lunch breaks and a couple breaks in between

Highly recommend the Forest app if you're struggling with screen time!"
7279,"Unless your professor takes attendance at the beginning of class, showing up a few minutes late is nbd. There‚Äôs no need to email them - they may not even see it before class."
7280,Glad to see it will be understood.
7281,"He does, and it impacts my grade. I‚Äôve seen people say show up late. I believe that means just talk to him after class if need be."
7282,Ahh I‚Äôm a long tenured professor and this is what these emails mean? I‚Äôve always wondered haha
7283,[deleted]
7284,Thank you for the advice.
7285,"I have a bunch of professors who have told us to let them know. 

Then again, our class sizes are small."
7286,"Oh you're a professor?



Quick name all the dumb answers to the questions we have about the exams."
7287,It‚Äôs in the syllabus.
7288,"*oh you're a professor? name every answer*  


\[gru with gun image\]"
7289,Prof here. Probably not necessary but always appreciated.
7290,I assume that means something more like showing up halfway through class. If a professor gets overly angry about someone being a bathroom breaks worth of time late they really need to get over themselves
7291,Who gives a shit? Just show up a little late.
7292,I always wondered too! I just assumed they didn‚Äôt wake up on time.
7293,"I'm probably paranoid based on the number of things that have happened to my students this semester (4 relatives dead from shootings, 6 COVID quarantines, 1 car accident, 1 mental health hospitalization), but when I read things like ""personal reasons"" or ""deal with,"" my brain goes to someplace more serious.

Just a simple, ""I'm sorry! I'm running a few minutes behind but I'll be there soon"" would suffice and let me know that you're just peeing, not arranging your grandmother's funeral or preparing to have a mental breakdown."
7294,Spent an extra 15 minutes in the shower or 15 minutes looking for parking
7295,My freshman mindset must be real
7296,"Furthermore, I think a professor like that won‚Äôt be swayed by an email"
7297,"Don‚Äôt listen to this person. Some professors care, some don‚Äôt. If you care then send the email and they will either 1) ignore it or 2) appreciate it. If they ignore it, no big deal. If they appreciate it, win. As opposed to just showing up late ‚Äúwho gives a shit‚Äù mentality and the professor does care, sees that, and takes points off."
7298,Truth. Doing shit like this gets ur cred points amd your professors will round ur grade possibly.
7299,The limit does not exist.
7300,"My class size is about 25-30. He‚Äôs not super strict but he likes a heads up. He responded and said thank you as an acknowledgment, that‚Äôs it."
7301,Yeah that‚Äôs cool.
7302,"At the same time, actions speak louder than words. If you show up to class on time 99% of the time, engage in in-class discussions and other participation, they will not care one bit about that one time you showed up 15 minutes late."
7303,"I would only email in the event that you‚Äôll miss class completely but if you‚Äôre going to be late, just show up and then tell the professor after class (if he takes attendance). If the professor doesn‚Äôt take attendance and it‚Äôs just a lecture, there wouldn‚Äôt be a reason for an explanation if it‚Äôs just a few minutes."
7304,"Agreed‚ÄîI‚Äôd say something like ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt feeling well but I‚Äôll be there soon!‚Äù I‚Äôd only email about it if the prof was super intense about tardiness. Otherwise, I would probably just say something brief after class, like ‚Äúsorry I was late, it was just a minor personal thing and I try to make sure I‚Äôm on time to your class‚Äù"
7305,"Sounds like you nailed it, I have enjoyed this tiny adventure!"
7306,"If someone is habitually late, I'd assume they are bad at planning.

If someone is late a few times, I'd give them the benefit of the doubt.

If someone sends notice that they will be late, that says some good things: they consider it an exception to be late, they care."
7307,"I have a bunch of professors who have told us to let them know. 

Then again, our class sizes are small."
7308,"As an instructor (and one who does not grade on attendance), I disagree. I would rather not receive an email. 

The way you build up a reputation as a responsible student is to show up on time consistently, participate in class, complete quality assignments, and ask intelligent questions. If you're the type of student that is on time almost every day, the one day per semester when you walk in a few minutes late is no big deal. I realize everyone has an emergency every once in a while. 

If the instructor is taking attendance and grading on attendance, or if they are the variety of asshole who locks the door at 11:01 for your 11:00 class, then it's a different story."
7309,"The problem with being a recent graduate in the last ten years is that there are no true ""entry level"" jobs anymore. Upon graduation you are either over educated for jobs that don't require a degree, and they won't hire you for fear that you'll leave soon after, or you are inexperienced for jobs that do require your degree. That then brings up the question of how to you get experience when no one will hire you."
7310,What is his degree in?
7311,[deleted]
7312,"Companies: ‚ÄúNo one wants to work anymore! Everyone‚Äôs lazy and getting welfare instead!‚Äù

Also companies: ‚Üë"
7313,"Can confirm. I have a STEM college degree and over 10 years work experience (been working since I was 14) and I applied to over 200 job openings here in FL- even entry level retail and service industry jobs- in August and September and received 4 responses asking for interviews. 2 rejected me after the interview for other candidates, 1 offered only $11/hr which isn't reasonable for my situation, and then I finally gave up and accepted a job at Lowes again after quitting 3 months earlier."
7314,[deleted]
7315,"It's a joke about people studying very niche (often pointless) fields, so when they graduate, their degree isn't applicable in any college level position.

The typical punching bag for this joke is gender studies, but can be anything from egyptology to fashion design."
7316,[deleted]
7317,"you do not state what the degrees in. and I (27f) have been telling my friends about non profits who are helping with job readiness. 

I would tell him to work with his undergrad career service department on his resume as trust me there are differences now.

I was told it will be awhile but I had 2 interviews at a Fortune 500 company two different departments and I am just glad I had practice interviews.

But my backstory sounds similar, and yeah I feel behind despite graduating in 2018 (BA history, minors in computer science and business). I was gig jobbing (covert store audits ie see if they card me to buy cigarettes) until end 2019 (internship databasing photographs for a library) that job should have ended summer of 2020 and they kept me until end of 2020 (to be kind but because of boss sickness) then 2021 been doing vending for walmart (travel to 3-4 Walmarts cleaning up boxes make sure sections are set correctly (management sends me the papers) and put coupons on products- district manager for brands) I also have a quarterly job (\~$10k) price auditing airport as a contractor.

Obviously I am getting my cpa license as well. 

But since I have so much open and new its hard to find a better role at once."
7318,"""Wages shortages"" is what the mainstream media don't want to tell the whole truth. They only show one side argument that fit their point of view and script."
7319,"idk why anyone's laughing 

they're already qualified to be a pilot in the military"
7320,"The problem is it's a catch-22. If you don't get any internships, then you don't get any work experience because you don't have any work experience and you're giga-fucked"
7321,"I'm in the same boat too. Graduated in June 2021 as a mechanical engineer with decent grades. Been applying since mid January.  I've had about 20 virtual/phone interviews, 1 in-person interview, of which 11 of them have gone onto additional interviews. About 5 of these have given me test to perform.

Every ""entry"" position has required 1-3 years of engineering work experience, like how the fuck am I going to get that experience if you're a fresh graduate???

This weekend, I had an in-person interview. The company held a group interview where about 5 of us were interviewed at the same time. They had us do a 30 min test in SolidWorks. After the test, they called out 3 names and told those 3 to go home. I was left with one other guy. Moved us to an interview with the manager. I explained to him my situation and work experience and pleaded him to give me a shot. After he was done with both of us, he asked me to stay. Then he had me interview with the owner. Owner told me that he was looking to fill in two positions, but that I shouldn't get my hopes up. He said that last week they interviewed 3 other people and had to consider the two best for the position. 

Shit like this makes me super anxious and nervous. Another company that I interviewed for two weeks ago said that they had 3 other candidates and two positions available too. Idk if it's just a coincidence or WTF. Still waiting on their call. I just hate how companies ghost you though. Like they don't even bother to tell you that you aren't being considered either, just ask you to wait one to two weeks for notice."
7322,Put less focus on the degree and add some focus on not doing any internships or networking. You can go find people on r/resumes with a good degree and no meaningful work experience.
7323,"Good insights. The kids degree was in something like film, so not much value there. Too bad he has $50,000 in debt."
7324,"it's totally broken. You go into $80,000 debt minimum if you don't get any scholarships, then if you can't find a job you're SoL because you can't discharge student loans. Even if you declare bankruptcy your student loans are stuck to you."
7325,"It's not college not preparing job training, but that the labor market has shifted.

The kind of jobs that were available to you 20 years ago are not longer viable for most of our new graduates."
7326,"Exactly, in a mentorship my mentor told me you can only play the student card for so long. People are more likely to help a student than a fresh grad after 6 months."
7327,This is disgusting. I'm really sorry to hear that.
7328,"Fucking hell I hate this. No one should have to study something they do not like for years and take on loads of debt to get a job they hate just to survive. 

It's not a bad idea to get a film degree. It's a bad idea to think that having a degree in a useful market is more important than passion or satisfaction with your life. Being in film is not a bad place to be. There are countless avenues to take where someone can be successful besides making a multimillion dollar blockbuster. I'm a film major. Three years deep. While I'd rather go into production, I could also go into critique, scholarship, theory, education, exhibition, collection, preservation, reporting, etc. 

What is ridiculous is paying an obscene amount for any education, especially so if one's survival depends on it. Or dedicating your time and effort to your passion and being ridiculed because your passion is wrong. The market ebbs and flows. STEM students may be highly in demand, but they're also highly competitive. Getting a STEM degree can put one under an insufferable amount of stress and doesn't guarantee a job for shit. 

It's always better to do what you do not out of necessity but out of choice, and choosing to follow a passion will always be better than choosing to suffer for material wealth."
7329,Atleast I make a big ole whopping $13.50 at Lowe's ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Still looking and applying to jobs every day. Still haven't been offered an interview for anything since then.
7330,"Your concerns are valid, I see the same thing not uncommonly.  Other posters taking about 'bad choices' made by the individuals, etc., are also correct.

I would make a larger point - if the US govt funds loans, and allows loans into the permanent life-damaging level, lets them be marketed to under 18-year-olds who can't even drink alcohol or vote  with no option for bankruptcy?  The boundaries of personal responsibility are at the very least HEAVILY blurred.

Voters who ultimately determine policies, schools, and individuals getting these loans, all have a role on this social policy debacle, and all need to contribute to the solution in some proportion."
7331,"Ya I see that too where you need a minimum few years experience. I applied to a job at a restaurant and they said that I needed an year experience in the restaurant industry. The job was part time and was either a waiter, dishwasher or bus boy."
7332,"if you could give any advice. I would say to him, look into marketing and see if he could get into creating marketing campaigns for brands. Surely there is some cheap classes (coursera etc) towards that.

I have started getting into the brand/merchant need to make sure the stuff on shelf looks good. So I am in the stage its in the store. people want to buy it (or push them physically) rather than the campaigns. So I restock the walmart sample machine to do the 10 second ad etc. so after listening to the ad you get the product.

I knew of a girl who was insta influencing. So she's creating the ad campaign. She quit but she is making you want to buy. I didn't know her personally and her bf good friends were friends of my college friends so someone I dont talk to much.

Creating the ads for a business shouldn't be that bad or something similar with that angle. 

but everyone is different in their 20s because of this pandemic. I know I truly am 2 years behind. and it hurts seeing people my age get married and stuff."
7333,"I think this is more common than people realize. I had a degree in finance and limited experience. I ended up working for a construction company and cutting grass on the side. I eventually got a entry level job at a bank, making even less money than the construction job. Now I finally have a job at a large company, I think it‚Äôs just incredibly hard in the current market."
7334,[deleted]
7335,So happy i live in a place where unpaid internships are illegal. Thats literally slave labour
7336,"The number of degree holders has gone up significantly over the decades.  Just by simple demand and supply, this makes the degrees less valuable.  A master's is the new bachelor's and a bachelor's is the new high school diploma.

It also depends on what the degree is in.  Certain degrees are more valuable than others, and this may be location-dependent. 

While I still think college has value, it is not the guaranteed path to financial success that it was in the 80s."
7337,"I hate saying this but it seems like he made a bad choice. If you wanna get a film degree, great, Im not gonna shit on that but paying 50k for it is pretty ridiculous. You can get a bachelors for a lot less if you go to a state school and only take out money for school, meaning dont use your loans for living costs. Did he do an internship or get any sort of hands on experience? Did he research the job market for film graduates? The system is fucked but, we know this, so you have to be proactive"
7338,Cause Joe Manchin has to think about his rich 1% donors.
7339,"I'm taking my entire degree online, some from schools that are mostly traditional, so I can totally confirm the ""some professors have no idea how to teach online"" thing.

This is going to be a bit of a disaster for a lot of people because online school requires so much more self-control. Also, schools that suddenly switch to online-only are going to have problems with lack of online curriculum. I question how they are handling that.

How I handle school, even a full-time course load, is to do school in the morning and evening and leave the afternoon for my own stuff. Gives you a break and prevents burnout."
7340,"> go to your local coffee house

I do love working from a coffeehouse, but this does go against the whole ""quarantine"" idea."
7341,"To be fair, some students do not have access to vehicles so leaving to go to say a park is easier said than done. But otherwise, you are absolutely right. Online classes should be held to the same standard as in class classes. Get the work done to the best of your ability."
7342,"Going off of all of the comments about non-lecture courses (labs, acting, art) we have to realize that it does not help to panic or stress about the classes as a student. Hundreds of universities are now moving online and many professors are going to have to figure out what will happen. Everyone is going through the same thing though so everyone will be understanding."
7343,"Yes, many courses are going to be a disaster. My school is doing what it can to make online curriculum development tools and best practices available, but we simply don't have enough staff for such a massive switch. Folks without experience will likely try to hold their normal class via Zoom or something."
7344,I'm really concerned for my uni's upcoming switch to online classes as I go to an art university and ALL of our studio work is physical and done in class. How on earth are we supposed to showcase our massive module furniture assignment through skype??????????
7345,[deleted]
7346,"These are the tough ones. I literally just heard from our admin that exceptions will be granted for things like this on a case by case basis. But yeah, you might have to just show it via Skype or something if you're 100 percent online."
7347,My major is carpentry. All of my classes besides one are entirely lab time. I‚Äôve got no idea how this is going to work as I do not have almost any of the tools at my disposal at home as I do at campus.
7348,"I completely agree with you and didn't even think of this! As someone who lives on the outskirts of my town away from these local areas transportation to these places can sometimes be difficult or impossible. For people with transportation this can be easy, but without I can suggest sitting in your yard, finding some shade under a tree, sitting on a deck/porch, or visiting a friends house to study/do work together (if transportation is available). Even switching rooms if your really are unable to do these things can help you feel less confined, i.e. working in the kitchen, living room, bedroom, etc."
7349,"What I don‚Äôt get is online exams. Unless they‚Äôre gonna use video recorders(which is hard to set up for classes with hundreds/thousands of people in a few days), everyone will simply cheat. I can just have two PC‚Äôs and use the other PC to look up answers. A video recorder might not even solve that tbh."
7350,This is the exact reason one of my professors was testing out Zoom to teach class yesterday. We all figured out how it worked so we world know how to use it when it was time for classes to start again without all the confusion.
7351,Agreed. I wouldn't be too worried about it somehow affecting grades. It's going to be different and sub-optimal but no one should be holding it against students (as I hope they don't hold it against faculty who are struggling to adjust).
7352,"A lot of my online exams are on things you need more than just the answers to complete. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre online or ‚Äúopen-book‚Äù, because you need to be able to do research to answer the question properly.

But yeah some science and math classes are going to make it very easy to cheat on exams"
7353,"I'm taking five courses this semester. Two of the professors have taught online classes before. Two of the professors don't even use the online gradebooks that the entire university is supposed to use. The two that have taught online already set everything up in a typical online course format with discussion boards, quizzes, etc. broken into weekly modules. The three that haven't taught online courses before are, indeed, planning to just do their regular classes via Zoom. We'll see if that changes at all after the first week or two."
7354,Yes. I have heard from some fellow students who said they were worried because online learning is difficult for them. I told them that this time will not be held against them at all.
7355,Honestly even the colleges don't know yet. They're trying to figure it out.
7356,"If your institution uses Zoom, you can use it for free through them"
7357,"I actually teach an intro class. I just make up some story and ask people to apply a concept. Maybe you can Google the concept, but you can't Google it's application to the story or the story itself.

The parent/friend thing might work depending on the content. I know people have done this to me so I also have a pretty strict timer and now use Webcam monitoring, which I HATE."
7358,"For very difficult classes I can see this. However, for introductory classes like we have, even if I can‚Äôt copy and paste the question, I can google similar problems and deduct how to solve it. It‚Äôs easier than you think, especially if you already have a somewhat solid grasp on the material. Also I could have a parent help me, a friend, etc....."
7359,"Autocaptions are not sufficient. There are many videos on why autocaptions don't work.

7361,"Ah yes, that could be an issue. Although...

That sounds suspiciously like learning how to actually do it to me."

I swear, I've never learned content better than I have when my content was all presented to me at once, in a format that respects my time. School is made to be so much harder than it has to be.

At least at my school, no one gave a fuck about how rigorous the course loads were, but we were up in arms about paying 70k a year for 10 zoom calls a week and no opportunity to bond with professors and classmates. 

Our uproar only got us a 10% reduced tuition, but if your financial aid covered more than that you were ineligible for it, and they opened up a virtual writing center. Money well spent, I guess."

And the amount of students who just log in and walk away drives me insane. If I ask the class for a reaction (like give me a 1-5 in the chat how well did you understand what I just went over) and only 1 or 2 of 30 respond, I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm supposed to do with that. Do I go back over what I just said or...??? It sucks all around."
7423,"Thats absolutely not true. Like yeah, it‚Äôs going to be hard to do both, but not impossible. Many people have to support themselves and don‚Äôt have 100 years to finish their degree.

7424,"If profs don‚Äôt have more time, then why did some of them increase the workload compared to previous classes when I asked people who took the class before and compared dates on notes? Why do you think we also have time to do double the load if you also don‚Äôt have extra time? Some of us work.

7427,"I teach mostly online senior and grad level courses. 

Last summer, I was slanted to teach a f2f Am Lit survey course. 

A day before classes started, I broke my femur. 

When I let my dep head know that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to teach that course, she asked if I could do it online. We were really stretched thin, and no one to cover the course in any meaningful way.

So, I said, sure ‚Äî gimme a day to get used to all the pain meds and another day to migrate all course materials for online delivery. Lucky me, I have tons of experience with online, so no learning curve on my end.

However, while we were working out the details, the dean gets involved.

And HE, in his infinite wisdom, remarks that the class, as I had it set up, lacked ‚Äúinteractive and synchronized learning experiences‚Äù (direct quote).  I do my WTF face (on the inside), and ask, on the outside, what he meant by that‚Ä¶because I was and am sure he didn‚Äôt know what any of those words meant.

This was his answer: ‚ÄúIt needs to have more graded forums, and each module needs at least one formative evaluation.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm REALLY going WTF, because what he‚Äôs asking is akin to asking me to go faster than the speed of light.

Why?

This course, is a 4 week course, divided into six modules (along the major incision points of the periods). What he was asking for is to put in a graded something every other day. In addition to the summative research paper ‚Ä¶ I explained all that, and, as predicted and feared, the man didn‚Äôt budge. 

Lucky me, I have tenure and could have said, well then, YOU go teach that fucking course, but instead I make acquiescing sounds, and deliver the course as I had originally planned.

But you can see how interference from above or ignorance from below can result in completely unworkable course loads for students and not better learning in any way. 

So, before you go lynch the profs on the ground, find out what sort of influencers have the ear of the administration and to what degree those have a degree in instructional tech and system design‚Ä¶"

7434,"As an adult working a corporate job- I think this program is ‚Äúworth‚Äù offending people over. Experiences like this build leadership skills which are maybe the single most important thing you can have to succeed in your career. 

When all the graduates roll out for the year, the most attractive hires will be the people who had experiences like this- which will be (more than likely) a pool of upper-upper mid class white dudes. 

We need more minorities in leadership positions and this is an amazing way of getting them that experience before graduation. I honestly applaud your school for this and id really encourage you to explore the role. Soft skills are what get you promoted most of the time."
7435,"I worked for housing at another big public uni and unfortunately we find that BIPOC students (myself included) tend to not apply, typically because they believe they won‚Äôt be picked over white RAs, feel like they might not belong, or it flies under their radar. My job was to promote and hire fit candidates and I realized that BIPOC people tend to not put themselves out there because society has told them not to, so it was a big part of my recruitment vision.

This strikes me as them really wanting to recruit people like us because theres just so few applying - and we all know that it‚Äôs not just white people who live in dorms, right? Who will advocate and fight for those residents of color? 

Does that make sense? I believe this email is a net positive over negative."
7436,"They‚Äôre not going to let unqualified people in just because they‚Äôre people of color. That‚Äôs not how these programs work.

7438,"This is almost certainly the case. It‚Äôs probably not even legal for them to hire based on race/gender for this position, but they are allowed to actively recruit people to apply to increase the diversity of the applicant pool. In theory that will stochastically increase the diversity among of the hires while not breaking any laws or lowering any standards."
7439,And have at least addressed the student by name to make.it a little more personal.
7440,"I agree that they arent going to accept anyone just because of their ethnicity, my point in this post was to share how these programs are approaching minority students in a ‚Äúwe noticed you arent white! we want you!‚Äù way. the way they worded the email could have been so much better without pointing out that i am a minority"
7441,"OP, I think they have good intentions - but whoever wrote this email has 0 emotional intelligence."
7442,"I think that‚Äôs the problem. It bothers me, based off of how they worded the email, that they are ~specifically recruiting students because they are in an underrepresented group. Affirmative action can be fucked up because they are not treating us as ‚Äúnormal qualified students‚Äù but rather ‚Äúyou‚Äôre qualified AND a minority so we want you!‚Äù"

7444,"This isnt entirely the case, the required entrance criteria for doctors into JH is set based on race.     The Harvard AA case specifically outlined how Asian students were given reductions in scoring based on their race vs other cohorts."
7445,I don‚Äôt see anything crazy rude or demeaning on here. Isn‚Äôt the point of them wanting you because you technically fall within an underrepresented group on campus any way?
7446,Many underrepresented demographics never make it to the application process alone. This is what they are trying to fix.
7447,"So how do you expect them to make the programs ""more diverse""? Damned if I do, damned if I don't. They are saying you met their basic qualification and you are making their RA group more diverse. What do you want? A fair and open competition? Are you sure  you would have made it this far. Did you ask the same question when you got the admission letter to the college because being a ""woman of color"" certainly gives you an edge in getting admissions in almost every college in the US. Or are you expecting them to do it for the ""diversity"" reasons but don't like being told that was the reason? If that's the reason you are getting it, why don't you want to know about it? If I am given a preference for a particular reason, for sure I want to know about it."
7448,"But if they obscure why it is they‚Äôre reaching out, people might speculate why someone got an email and another did not. They‚Äôre being transparent about why they‚Äôre reaching out to you."
7449,"I understand where you're coming from here. However, in my mind I can't rationalize the ethics. Having a criteria for a requisition based on sex/race/ethnicity/orientation in any way just seems wrong to me. It feels the same as excluding candidates based on those things. Which in some ways i guess it kind of does if you decide you have to many of X kind of person so now you need to get more of Y. Inevitably someone who would qualify based on merit will now be turned away because some ""quota"" has been filled for that kind of person. And again, these traits are completely out of the control of any of this individuals. They were just born that way. Even if the intentions are good I just can't square this circle."
7450,"I‚Äôm sorry, but how? How would you have worded it?"
7451,Absolutely this.
7452,If those upper class white dudes meet the criteria though is it really all that bad if they get in? Maybe I'm in the minority here but I think that nobody should be chosen for these things based on things about themselves they can't change. Race at the very least should be removed from the application forms for these programs in my opinion. I was in the military though so meritocracy is sort of drilled in my brain.
7453,"The world isn‚Äôt black and white, good and evil. It‚Äôs all shades of grey and sometimes you‚Äôre picking the lesser of two evils.

One evil here is the potential for a good candidate to not get a role because of a defining attribute.

The other evil is generations of minorities not being given opportunities, not having mentors in their communities/workplaces, not holding positions of influence. It‚Äôs certainly the greater evil.

I will say that you assume that the candidate with the most merit gets the role which is almost never the case in reality. We pick new hires for a litany of reasons and competency in the hard skills is a small piece. We‚Äôre constantly discriminating, even the best of us."
7454,I fail to see your point. Anyone can discriminate against anyone
7455,"If you‚Äôre asking if it‚Äôs bad for future outcomes, it‚Äôs absolutely bad. Companies with diversity in leadership perform better over time, are more innovative, and have healthier workplace cultures. There are tons of data and studies to support this.

If you‚Äôre asking if it‚Äôs unethical to staff your company with only the people who look the best on paper, that‚Äôs nuanced. It really depends on your values as a company.

What this school is doing (and it‚Äôs really the stage of most DEI initiatives at this stage, it‚Äôs such a new concept) is to increase the diversity of the talent pool. A more diverse talent pool to choose from will have the effect of naturally creating diversity later. It‚Äôs human nature to like people like yourself so as long as there are female and male leaders, LGBTQ leaders, leader of color, leaders with disabilities, etc. they‚Äôll start to mentor others like them. We‚Äôre just all in the stage of trying to get those people into those positions which is slow going and potentially looks unethical if viewed out of context."
7456,I guess it depends on perspective. I think of it in a way that these organizations are trying to increase representation. They‚Äôre trying to reach out and give opportunities to eligible historically marginalized groups. They‚Äôre taking a small step to try to make a change to a systemic problem

I mean, we do work really hard and don't get paid much, but we chose this career. You're still trying to start yours. I thought we were helping students out, since you already did all the hard work during the semester to earn your grades.

For one class my students wrote a 5-page midterm paper, a 10-page final paper, had weekly quizzes, and had to do a presentation. I gave them a final with 10 easy questions worth 1 point each and told them to draw a picture for me to hang in my office for 5 points extra credit.

7476,"Adjunct professors, who make up most university instructors, receive little to no health benefits, make around 3,000 a class per semester and can only teach two at a time so they have to teach at multiple different colleges to make enough to live, usually making below poverty wages even if they teach 2 classes at 2 institutions because that‚Äôs only 3 times 4 per semester for spring and fall which is 24k a year. The job/pay situation for most adjunct professors has become so bad that TA‚Äôs often make MORE MONEY than they do, and adjuncts don‚Äôt often have access to TA‚Äôs like tenured professors do. If an adjunct cancels a class, it‚Äôs often because situations happen such as losing a place to live or losing their only form of transportation. Recently there was a post on r/professors where a full-time instructor said he had witnessed multiple adjunct instructors sleeping in the community office in his department‚Äôs building. They acted like they were grading late, stuck around until the building close up, slept there, washed off in the sink in the morning as a shower, and taught the next day.

You don‚Äôt know jack shit about what the average professor‚Äôs life is like anymore. We aren‚Äôt in the golden ages of education anymore. Nobody is funding it and it‚Äôs having to fund itself without raising prices so much that people will stop coming. States have all pulled out of funding their own higher education, causing tuition rates to skyrocket, and colleges had already cut as much of the cost as they could. And now the stagnant wages have started causing the poor majority of instructors to struggle beyond what most students probably think is possible. I teach full time (for about half of what you said, by the way, with no TAs, grading for 150 students across six classes a semester and with only one pay raise in the last 10 years, and I do NOT read PowerPoints‚Ä¶that‚Äôs fucked‚Ä¶and if I cancel a class, it is thoroughly documented and I‚Äôm asked why I missed class without making other arrangements when I threw up an hour before class started). I see most of us struggling and watching our students dwindle away. From last fall alone, freshmen enrollment numbers were down around 40% at my institution and most colleges are posting similar numbers. We are all freaked out that we may even lose the meager, sacrificial life we all have come to cherish, because there will be no more money left to help people make their lives better.

7602,I can't remember the last time I needed a book
7603,Then it sounds like the textbook company created the power point and probably also created the tests and quizzes so you probably don‚Äôt need both to prepare.
7604,"I eecommend trying to do the work as soon as its assigned. The material should be fresh in your head to get some of it done. Even if you dont understand it completely, it can help you solidify what you have down already."
7605,Yes but then the exam turns me sideways and fucks my ass. Then the following week I convince myself the PowerPoint was sufficient again. It‚Äôs a rough cycle
7606,Its a trap they hardly ever cover every detail in the PowerPoint dont do it.
7607,"Thats how i feel about my anatomy class, i work way better just reading and highlighting"
7608,"I like to use the book, even when I know it.
1) Reinforcement 
2) For essays and papers. I put page numbers next to my notes. I can go back through. Find relevant information, and find the page. Then read underlined/highlighted/sticky noted text to use as supporting evidence. I find making study guides is easier this was too.
Also sometimes the PP doesn‚Äôt cover everything, and you learn cool things from readings."
7609,"This is a good point, but only for classes that are actually related to you/your major. Not everyone wants to put 100% effort into their required general ed classes."
7610,"I mostly ignore power point presentations, I just like reading texts more. I think I can remember more from a text than a presentation."
7611,"That's fair, and it's a very valid way to live your life. I prefer spending my time/effort on social life and hobbies more than classes I don't care for, but I'm sure diversifying your understanding in many subjects can help you immensely down the road. If you can give 100% effort in your studies while still having a good personal and social life, then more power to you.

Don't worry, your reply comes across as ""tough love"" more than assholish."
7612,Even in grad school those thoughts don't stop
7613,"Not gonna lie, I didn't read a single textbook throughout my college career (unless it was something I actually needed to scan through to answer a question, or to get a question out of the book itself). 

&#x200B;

That said powerpoints might help you with the assignments itself, but the point of having chapters assigned is for you to gain more knowledge than necessary to complete the assignments. Its to give you a deeper knowledge of the subject even if you're not going to use all that information specified in the class. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, reading the books determines how much you actually want to gain for yourself than anything else. 

&#x200B;

Me personally I could barely concentrate enough to read and process the information on a single page, especially if it was a class/subject I had no interest in' the first place."
7614,The last time I ever read a book was in elementary school when they had the reading levels from A-Z.
7615,Just go with whatever format you like better
7616,"For me, lectures help me pass, but the reading covers lots of points not in the lecture and is very detailed. The reading makes sure I do really good. Basically you don‚Äôt need to do the reading but do the reading if you want a much higher grade."
7617,"Lol, i feel the same"
7618,"For the most part I was able to Google any factual information I may have needed that would come from a text book. 

&#x200B;

I'm also not the best person to cite for this method as my GPA was less than stellar in college, but again I also had very little interest / did not like school. YMMV."
7619,"Only experience this in courses that I have extensive background knowledge in, and even then it is only in the aspects where I have done extensive reading and research"
7620,"Reading the textbook for me helps fill in missing information from the lecture. General concepts from the lecture will be explained further in detail in the textbook. The textbook also may answer any questions I had during the lecture. I feel you though OP, It‚Äôs so tempting to not read because it isn‚Äôt technically required and feels extra. But it‚Äôs one of those things to where you‚Äôd notice if you DIDN‚ÄôT do it."
7621,Yea sometimes. Book has important background info to build a foundation and fill the gaps
7622,"I‚Äôm sure it varies by class, but I just spent 4 years of nursing school buying my books with a VA voucher and selling them back for cash the next day. For nursing, there is nothing in those books that isn‚Äôt available on the internet and, usually, in the PowerPoint."
7623,I do the ppt (my professor has a voice over on it) an then flip through the chapter and actually read the review at the end. I am working on my MBA Now and it worked for me all undergrad. (except for my bio class but that was a mandatory honors thing for a scholarship & I was a freshman then so it was prior to my burn out lol)
7624,chapter summary
7625,Doing that right now lol
7626,"When I took first year accounting it was on the syllabus that the average score would become a B (80%). I was in the section for honors engineering students (where I went there were a lot of engineering students minoring in business so we had our own section), and everyone in the class had at least 3 semester of calculus at this point so we lived and breathed math.

The instructor made the first exam a bit too easy, even in the business sections the average score was around 90% (when he'd target 75% average). Everyone in the engineering section got 100% and none of us were worried about it until grades actually showed up online and he'd given us 80/100...

We all threw a fit but he said ""it's on the syllabus!"" So we spread on the class discussion that we were going to boycott the second exam, because if we all got 0 points then we should, according to the syllabus, still get 80/100. He said we couldn't do this, a few students went to the dean who offered a compromise saying that if people went to the 2nd exam that we'd all get 100/100 on the 1st exam and the syllabus would be amended to not curve down if the average was >80%."
7627,"The average grade this sem for my intro chem class was a B+. Usually it‚Äôs a B- and the average on the exams have been up by 10-15% than what they usually are. Surprisingly, my professor didn‚Äôt do anything, nor did she make the exams harder or enforce tighter proctoring. She just let everyone get higher grades.

I feel lucky. I‚Äôm sorry this has happened to you."
7628,"Yeah, it's harder to focus and retain information with online class plus covid stress so scores tend to go down if the prof keeps their usual syllabus and people aren't cheating. We didn't have curves but a lot of my professors last semester just made the assignments way easier."
7629,"Yeah, grad student here... do this \^\^\^"
7630,"Holy shit, you managed to unionize an entire section of undergraduates?? And *accounting* undergraduates, no less. That's outstanding, well done."
7631,"WHAT. A. DICK. HOL UP. you‚Äôre gunna take away AN ENTIRE LETTER GRADE from me because you SUSPECT cheating? SUSPECT???? I SUSPECT that you‚Äôre a douche of a human and a terrible teacher. I‚Äôm in nursing school, so my classes are point based. IF THIS FUCKER dropped me 13% points I WOULD miss key points I need to NOT BE KICKED OUT. I‚Äôm so sorry you had this douche canoe of a prof."
7632,"Instructors are not professors. And if they are tenured fuck-all will come of this. Academia is super fucked up, where you hope you don't get some egomaniac who has tenure.

I would still raise hell as suggested.. Curved are bullshit. You should get the grade you earned for better or worse. Life's not fair but that works both ways. If he can't prove cheating, time to get fucked."
7633,This is bullshit. I would appeal my grade to the dean. These professors are out of control. See if you can get a group of students together to file a formal complaint.
7634,"Even tenured professors have to follow policy. You won't get them fired, but tenure doesn't mean they can do literally anything they want."
7635,Not allowed. Report him to his boss and the school. That‚Äôs not how the system works for cheating.
7636,"The averages in my chem class are about 20% lower than normal and all my professor is doing is saying how she can't understand why we're not learning anything lmao. No curve either, literally over half of the class is failing :)"
7637,Nope my chem classes grades have averaged a 60 for the last 3 exams and all 4 that we've had were open book so she didn't have to deal with cheating
7638,"How does this resolve anything? Assuming there was cheating, a big assumption, he cut grades across the board. The people who cheated still have the same advantage (percentage wise) and are at the same place compared to when there was no reverse curve. It did nothing to solve the problem at all."
7639,[deleted]
7640,"I see we‚Äôve got a lot of warriors here that think this is just as fair as curving upward. It‚Äôs all fun and games until it‚Äôs dropping you a letter grade and it‚Äôs your GPA that‚Äôs negatively affected. 

I don‚Äôt give a fuck if the class average was 130%, my grade is my grade and this is not how you deal with ‚Äúwelll maybeeee some people cheaateddddd‚Äù accusations. Grow up and bring some proof to the table instead of dropping everyone‚Äôs grade. If that means curving upward would also be unfair, whatever. 

I‚Äôd rather have a lower grade I actually earned than a high grade that someone decided needed to be lowered. Stop defending a system that wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to hurt you."
7641,"I'm sorry but the professor got serious of issues, how did he assume that everyone is cheating when he didn't have any proof, just because a couple of answers do not correspond with the information that is observed from the class, does not mean that the student does not know any information. I might study 24/7 after answering that question wrong then got it right on the test. It sucks, go straight to rmp bud"
7642,"Some professors have their heads so far up their you-know-whats that they think their class is the center of the universe. Not like there's a global pandemic where people are losing jobs and family members left and right, and most students are at home trying to concentrate when there's multiple other people in the house also at home 24/7, and some have to work because their parents lost their jobs and now they have to support their family, some might have Covid, or have family members with Covid, or even *lost* family members to Covid, and others might be having trouble with Internet access, device access, quiet space access, even *food* access in some cases...

(I'm in a parents group for my university, and one mother said back in March that if her child was home for more than a few weeks she wouldn't be able to afford enough food for both of them. I saw another post where a student at my university was sleeping in the kitchen every night because the apartment their family lived in was too small -- younger siblings took the bed and mom took the sofa)

It really pisses me off to no end that some professors have the nerve to think just because we're at home means we can suddenly dedicate all our time to their class & and that they're actually *surprised* that nobody's learning anything. Nothing about this semester is normal & a good number of professors are too blinded by their privilege and entitlement to realize that."
7643,"I think this is the case for STEM in the first place. Speaking anecdotally, all my STEM classes had much lower averages and according to national research on grade inflation, STEM students tend to have lower GPAs than other majors. 

I had more than a few classes where the high score would be the 100% threshold with an A at 90% the high score, B at 80%, etc. This usually worked out to 40-50% class average with high at 60-70%. Usually this worked but for computer architecture we had someone who already had a degree and had been working for 10 years in that field (his company required him to retake a handful of courses every 10 years for recertification). His exam scores were around like 95%...the next highest score \~65%...which was actually below 70% of 95...so no one in the class but him passed most of the exams. Did the professor omit him from the curve? Nope! But he did add a flat 15% to everyone else's score which still didn't make up the difference and there were a lot of F's that semester (I was lucky to manage a C)"
7644,but it is completely unfair to people who did not cheat. Bringing a grade down from an A- to a C + with no proof of that individual cheating is absurd. It could really hurt someone who works hard for their grades and is already stressed.
7645,"I have never had a professor that‚Äôs curved down wtf if he notices higher then avg grades, next semester the class is a little harder. If averages fall short, then a little easier the semester after that. But never has a professor punished a class for doing better then expected, that‚Äôs completely asinine."
7646,"Well it was mostly other students that organized it but almost the entire class jumped on to support it because the original grading policy was so ridiculous we figured we might as well be just as ridiculous. Secretly though we were all panicking that one or two people might take the test and throw off the average for everyone that skipped it, so when the dean proposed the compromise there was a massive wave of relief (even if we ended up having to take the exam)."
7647,"Feels like school, when teacher would take recess from us because some idiots just could not behave"
7648,This pisses me off so much
7649,"Same here. I am normally a solid B student, but this fall I was struggling to get a c-"
7650,"Our orgo exams had averages of around 55 or so, all open book.

I should add that the class is curved. It‚Äôs an 86 for an A just to give you an idea"
7651,That's evillll report him
7652,[deleted]
7653,"I understand the final was over average, however, it is unfair to punish us kids who didn't cheat. I wouldn't doubt that people cheated, but to make it where the highest attainable grade in the class becomes an 87% because 100%\*.87 is that, is plainly just insane. Most of the class got an abusive punishment for something we didn't do."
7654,"In this case though, there isn‚Äôt even any proof that people were misbehaving. Only suspicion"
7655,Teachers like this suck ass and shouldn't be teachers. This is something a child does.
7656,"Why does everyone else seem to have casual sex except me?


Oh wait im an engineering student."
7657,"Look, I don't mind that you don't like casual sex. But my dude, you're basically one step behind that. You're criticizing hookups while you yourself are having sex with a friend with benefits with no desire for a relationship. That is like as casual as you can get without doing hookups.

And your FWB is definitely fucking other people."
7658,"Sounds like you want the benefits of being in a closed relationship without any of the responsibility of being in a closed relationship. Sounds like a you problem, not a her problem."
7659,"Oh, sorry madam. We dont take walk-in bang appointments. If you‚Äôd like, i can fit you in for 2:30-2:45"
7660,"Your thoughts are normal and fine by me. Just because you're in college with people who are technically adults, doesn't mean they wont still act like children. I'm a junior and I absolutely do not care for hookup/party culture. sharing who you are fooling around with (or at least that you are fooling around with someone else) is a safe decision so that you can get an idea of who you could have gotten a disease from, and also why you should really use protection all the time."
7661,"Is it just me or has anyone else not really noticed hookup culture? Most women I meet are taken, and most of the ones who aren't are single by choice and don't appear to be interested in hooking up"
7662,"Considering the post, they aren't ready to hear any of that"
7663,"It‚Äôs up to the individual person. There‚Äôs no right or wrong. You‚Äôre not superior to anyone else with the way you think about sex, and of course you‚Äôre not ~the only one~. 

Nothing wrong with sleeping around, nothing wrong with not sleeping around. If you want this girl you‚Äôre with right now to share if she has been hooking up with others, tell her. She can‚Äôt read your mind. Neither of you wanted a relationship by your own admission so you really can‚Äôt expect her to treat you like you are exclusive when you are not."
7664,You guys are having sex?
7665,Wait let me get this straight. You are engaging with casual sex with someone and then get offended when they are having sex with other people? You‚Äôre engaging in the exact behavior you have a problem with.
7666,"Bro if this isn‚Äôt anything serious then she has no obligation to tell you who she‚Äôs fucking, if it makes you emotional then either stop having casual sex or try to start a relationship with someone"

7670,"DTR = Define The Relationship

Until that happens OP, she has no reason to change her behavior based on how you feel. You are into her, she might think it‚Äôs wayy more casual and therefore is free to do what ever she wants. Which she is entitled to do. 

DTR and then you can be upset if she‚Äôs hooking up with other guys."
7671,Where do we find that sir
7672,"Engineers can have great casual sex, too! Don‚Äôt let yourself down."
7673,"If you want to go exclusive with somebody, that means you‚Äôre in a relationship. You can‚Äôt just autonomously control a woman‚Äôs sex life at your own discretion because it makes you uncomfortable."
7674,"Thank you, I will admit I have had a pretty bias outlook. In my mind, I guess I meant like hooking up with one person at a time even if it‚Äôs casual. Thanks"
7675,I think being in a relationship entails a whole lot more than just not fucking other people though. I think it's a fair ask although it's completely okay for her to also not agree to the ask and prefer things to stay flexible.

7677,"In my experience, people getting laid a lot tend to meet people during the day by finding reasons to start conversations with potential partners, and then plan a time to go out and it goes from there. Most women go out to bars with friends who will prevent their friend from leaving with a random guy. Most guys I know who rely on drinking to get laid end up disappointed, there are exceptions though."

7679,I'm a CS guy but the only 2 ladies in my classes are both lesbians. It's honestly funny watching all these super smart socially challenged doods simp over them hoping to get a crumb.
7680,Your major checks out
7681,"The rule thumb w fwb is it‚Äôs frowned upon hook up w other ppl. However, until you make it ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù as they say, it‚Äôs rude but not ‚Äúagainst the rules‚Äù so to speak. Freshman tend to not figure the first part for a year or two when the norms are better established and they have more experience w modern relationships / fwb. 

It‚Äôs fine to be upset (in a semi-hypocritical way). I think most of us were navigating these waters for the first time. However, it‚Äôs not true that your fwb is **definitely** fucking other ppl. Many guys have that mentality and it doesn‚Äôt serve them well. I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs not I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not definite."
7682,"It's fair to ask but don't expect a yes. If someone said to only fuck them, but not put a label on it I'd be OUT"
7683,"Posts like this come up on this sub everyday. Why do people care so much about what other people are doing with their bodies? 

You‚Äôre having casual sex with someone while simultaneously shaming people for having casual sex. Seems like you‚Äôre shaming her for doing *exactly* what you‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶ with her.

7686,"Whatever your dorm's quiet hours are is what I'd go with (with maybe some leeway towards 9 or 10 am), but 1 p.m. is ridiculous."
7687,"The roommate also chooses to sleep until 1:30. I doubt they have classes past midnight and into the early morning. 

It would be like working from 2pm to 10 pm and deciding to stay awake all night."
7688,"i used to be like this guy but i realize it‚Äôs MY sleeping schedule that‚Äôs fucked, and i fixed the problem by getting a free pair of earplugs (unopened obvi) from a friend and no problem no more üëç"
7689,"I think making lunch around noon is a very reasonable expectation for a shared living space. Personally I'd make some effort to be quiet, but not compromise on the fact that you have to eat"
7690,"It‚Äôs possible that they may be depressed, but some people purposely schedule their classes around the afternoon/evening since they aren‚Äôt morning people and could afford to sleep later in the day. I don‚Äôt find this particularly unreasonable; however, complaining to a roommate about them making minimal noise around a sensible time (before 1:30pm, basically when most students are up) doesn‚Äôt really make sense and your roommate just needs to accept that disagreements like this one are inevitable when they have an abnormal schedule.

But I think it‚Äôs a great idea for you both to talk through this problem, especially because anything relating to sleep will affect school performance, mood, etc and be an important factor in your relationship."
7691,"I love to take afternoon naps but I realize that my neighbors aren't going to stop mowing their lawns, letting out their barking dogs, hammering, or drilling on their home improvement projects just because I like a nap. I invested in some earplugs that get rid of most of the noise. Your roommate needs to realize that he is not the main character and that the world doesn't revolve around him. It sounds like he needs to live alone and possibly seek help for depression."
7692,"I mean I get it. When I used to work the 2PM shift I'd get up at noon/1 because I liked having my freetime be AFTER my workday, not before. If I don't have to get up till 1pm, I can stay up till 5am and still get 8 hours of sleep.

A good compromise would be for the roommate to start waking up at exactly noon since that's when OP gets home."
7693,"This right here. 

I've always slept odd hours and right now I get up at 3:00 a.m. for work where my partner tends to not go to bed until close to or after midnight.    

A sleep mask and fairly cheap earbuds (sometimes playing binaural beats or other sleep music to block out additional noise until I'm sleep) have made a huge difference and make it so I can fall asleep most of the time even with the TV on and other destractions in the same room."
7694,"Your roommate is in the wrong. For the most part, generally go off your dorm quiet hours. I'm not saying at 8 am to start blasting music, but it is okay to make noise. Your roommate doesn't have the right to complain when it is the middle of the day.

I don't really know how to help besides talking to your roommate about them fixing their sleep schedule.

Edit: Do you think they may have depression? From what it sounds like, they aren't showering before class. Are they taking care of themselves? You may want to connect them to campus resources if you think they are struggling mentally."
7695,"hey man, sleep in all you want but just don‚Äôt expect people to be completely quiet in the middle of the day"
7696,"While that is a logical route to go down, it's not OP's job. They pay the same amount of money that the roommate does, and should be allowed to use whatever appliances come along with the room. Whether or not the roommate adjusts (ear plugs, or just starts to wake up earlier) is an easier change than telling someone they can't use their own kitchen"
7697,Don't shame my about my choices.....
7698,"Your roommate is entitled to sleep whenever he wants, but he‚Äôs not entitled to demand complete silence in the middle of the day. He‚Äôs the one on an atypical sleeping schedule. Try not to be obnoxiously loud with the pots and pans, just like you would with any roommate/neighbors, but don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre infringing on decency by cooking lunch at lunchtime."
7699,"That's not universal. My friend with ADHD is up at 5 am every day. Also, you don't know he has ADHD."
7700,"He might just be a night person, why straight up diagnosing him lol"
7701,"After noon, that's his problem.

I don't think the ""midnight-8am quite hours"" should be considered set in stone. If you're up at 8am making a LOT of noise thinking ""people should be up"", that's a dick move. Similarly, if you expect everyone to be perfectly quiet at midnight ... difficult to enforce. Those times are going to be fuzzy on both sides with some accommodations needed from both morning and evening people.

After about 10am, don't worry about it. Obviously don't walk in and crank the Spinal Tap to 11. Just behave normally."
7702,"I sleep really late too. However I‚Äôm aware that, in the afternoon, people are going to be awake and doing things, so if I want to still sleep it‚Äôs my responsibility to avoid noise, not my roommate‚Äôs or anyone else‚Äôs.

I personally put earplugs in and close my window so there‚Äôs less noise from trucks/lawn mowers/etc. He should look into wearing earplugs or headphones."
7703,"Is your roommate a night owl? Out partying all the time?

Seems like major health issues if they are sleeping 13 hours daily.

Sit down and discuss a time that's appropriate, if you can't reach am agreement ask a RA or request a move."
7704,Dogs should be aloud to bark lmao wtf is even that
7705,"I‚Äôve been the roommate that sleeps until noon, but I don‚Äôt ever expect roommates to tip toe around at regular waking hours. It would be one thing if you were making lots of noise at 6am, but 12pm is a different story."
7706,I don't lol
7707,How the fuck can ur roommate get mad at u when it‚Äôs 1 in the afternoon. To tell u to be quiet is ridiculous. I‚Äôd just keep doing what ur doing u both own the room and ur free to do what u want during the day
7708,"Yeah, you‚Äôre not in the wrong here. Is there an RA that can help mediate between the two of you?"
7709,"Yeah no. Your roommate is unreasonable. 

Maintaining odd hours is something that some people prefer but they cannot expect others to do so along with them. 

You pay extra for a pizza at 3 am rather than 5 pm because there is a penalty associated with having atypical needs. Your roommate is going against our species' sleep schedule, he is free to do so but cannot expect you to follow him.

Tell him you are following the quite hours guidelines and he needs to adjust to being an adult."
7710,If the dorms have an RA this is the way to go. Approach them with the issue and they can talk through issues with you or even mediate a solution. This will also let the RA know to look out for other issues between you and your roommate in the future.
7711,Do you know the roommate has adhd?
7712,"If you feel like ~*splurging*~ on a gift, loops makes reusable ear plugs he can wear night after night. They work great and have their own little case"
7713,"I have ADHD, prefer late night schedules, and have lived in similar situations.

I got over myself."
7714,"Yeah, I have adhd and my most productive days are when I get up at 5 or 6 and work until noon or so."
7715,If I don‚Äôt wake up and start my day by 10 it‚Äôs all over and the whole day is a loss.
7716,"You‚Äôll be alright bro. This semester was so bad!! So many students are failing and professors just assign more work with the belief that we have so much time. That‚Äôs so much bullshit. We have other things going on. But, regardless of your grades, just finish it up. Even if it‚Äôs bad or not what you hoped for, it‚Äôs not your fault. It‚Äôs not your fault you have no motivation. It‚Äôs not your fault you want to forget college exists. It literally sucks so much. Keep your head up Früêê"
7717,"Second this. An employer won‚Äôt see that a kid graduated in 2022,2023, or 2024 and think ‚Äúhuh this kid went through a lot especially during the 2020 pandemic‚Äù. It‚Äôs about what you did and how you overcame your troubles during your 4 years in school, I think."
7718,I feel ya. We had a ‚ÄúThanksgiving Break‚Äù too but two of my professors still had assignments due that week. It was a hard semester to pull though.
7719,"Between work and school and the fact that I took summer classes this year, I am having a breakdown with all of it. I literally have been piggybacking, chegging, and googling (do not do this is bad, never on anything closed notes) to get through the term because I've been so burnt out since week 4 I couldn't make myself go to class.

I've been thinking about it a lot. I find that the part that is missing for the is the *social reinforcement.* Many times last year I would be talking to people in my majors, bouncing ideas and subjects off them in casual conversation between classes to the point where everything makes sense. If I wasn't getting something, I could ask them to hang out and we'd go over their notes. It's much harder to do that with everything being online because instead of being in a learning environment where people gravitate to community learning, you have you actively break out and seek other people who want to zoom call on a particular subject. Learning online is black and white, you're either plugged into learning, or your focused on other life stuff. Go to class, fuck around at home for a bit, do homework, relax at home. There is no go to the library and hangout, it's only grinding alone and it fucking sucks.

(2nd year engineering)"
7720,"Also super frustrating that they assign all this work and it takes them foreverrrrrr to grade a lot of it, or they post content late. I even had a professor finalize grades yesterday. 10 days after the deadline for them to submit it. I get they have their own personal matters going on, but I feel like a lot of them expect sooooooo much from us."
7721,"I got myself switched into a robotics class which I had the recommended background for. I get in the class and they expect me to know how to code, which wasn‚Äôt in the course description. Fast forward to now, this is finals week and I have basically accepted failure in the class. I‚Äôve put hours upon hours in every day but I have more important classes to study for and I think they made a mistake calling it an intro class. I‚Äôm so tired I just want to sleep all day after finals. Idek or care if Ill fail anymore I just want out

Edit: I know it‚Äôs super late but if anyone‚Äôs reading this I passed the class! Almost failed calc 2 as a result though!!"
7722,rip class of 2021 i guess
7723,thats bullshit stop pretending this isnt the most difficult time to go to college in the last 20 years
7724,We have a winter break. Its called 'whenever your particular program feels like ending until whenever it feels like starting ' so some people have 2 months from december to feb practically while ive been in nonstop work mode since early august.
7725,Yeah my school did the same thing except we only got 3 days off for thanksgiving and it actually killed me I‚Äôm just glad I have my last final tomorrow so I can just relax üôÉ
7726,"I feel. We had a week for Thanksgiving break, and all my teachers assigned work over the break which was wonderful. We then reviewed for a week and we're taking finals as we speak. I'm actually procrastinating studying for my last final rn. The lack of motivation is real."
7727,I had a prof. who gave out a 24hr project on a Friday and then never graded it...smh
7728,"Yep, I wish they wouldn't do that. I needed that time to rest and recharge, not have a few assignments due 6 days in a row out of my 9 days off. :\"
7729,"I have a proff who doesn't grade most of the homework.

edit: spelling"
7730,"Lol my University had no breaks, finished early, and was super intense this semester. We even had a day wasted because of the final election debate where we couldn't be on campus for in-person classes. I had three four credit courses with one being a naturally intense class made way more intense thanks to COVID. I finished before Thanksgiving break luckily. On finals week, I crashed and failed my final practical exam with 10% on it for a course but luckily at leasted passed the course.  What matter to all of us is that we at least pass the courses we took this semester."
7731,My university got rid of spring break.
7732,Do you not have a winter break? That sounds ridiculous. Colleges really do be pushing us to our limits
7733,"The thing that sucks about American schooling is that it‚Äôs only about the money, and we see that now more than ever. When we get to high school college starts getting pushed on us because you need degrees for certain careers, and so you pick a college, and it‚Äôs super expensive. Normally it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, because in-person you‚Äôd get your money‚Äôs worth. But online it‚Äôs a whole different story. You‚Äôre still paying full tuition (mine was almost 20k) to sit on your computer while professors who weren‚Äôt trained for online courses try to teach. No office hours, your peers don‚Äôt feel like talking to you, you‚Äôre on your own. Then, for some reason, they took away our Fall and Spring break and tried to cram 16 weeks of material into maybe 12, without reducing the workload. You‚Äôve probably noticed that a lot of college age people in America have mental health issues, and usually colleges offer free therapy, but that was taken away when the campus therapists stopped answering their emails. So, you couple the pre-existing issues with the pressure to get all your work done in 12 weeks, AND make good grades, all while stuck in your house, and it wears on you. That‚Äôs why a lot of people have been dropping out. The material itself isn‚Äôt hard, it‚Äôs the way in which you‚Äôre being taught, and the way classes are set up and stuff like that. I ended up dropping out this semester to work on my mental health. I plan on going back when they fix how they operate, I don‚Äôt have 20k to spare every year. I hope that helps a little bit in understanding - and I hope school‚Äôs going well for you!"
7734,I agree. People are kidding themselves if they think a hiring manager will give a damn. Literally every college student across the nation went through the exact same thing. COVID doesn‚Äôt set you apart from anyone else
7735,"I‚Äôm literally one day away from my last final and I see all my friends doing fun things and I just think to myself, ‚Äúis it worth it?‚Äù 
And honestly I‚Äôm not sure anymore.."
7736,"Hang in there. It's almost over.

I'm an online student, but I got cocky and decided I was going to do a full course load in Spring, Summer, and Fall semesters.

There were technically holidays, but due dates were still a thing. I had a few days in between each session (2 sessions per semester).

Somehow I didn't start burning out until Fall Session A. I hated myself/school throughout this semester; I had to force myself to read/watch the lectures, do the homework, study for the tests, attend the Zoom meetings, write the discussion posts...I ended up doing all-nighters every week this semester, for essays/projects. 

The day after I finished my finals, I was so exhausted that I kinda zoned out the whole day. I had been going almost nonstop from mid-January to December 4th.

Next year I'm taking either Summer or Fall off, or reducing my course load in those two semesters by half."
7737,"Yeah remember showing off cool programs or making jokes about the teacher or flexing your 65 on someone elses 63. Remember walking around outside and watching the leaves fall instead of being a zombie sitting in a chair for four straight hours every day, and then having to sit some more to finish whatever inane assignment is going on?  Remember not having to email every fucking question?


also second year engineering"
7738,people handle stress very differently. Online learning does not work for lots of people but for most that is the only option. That combined with being completely isolated from your peers is incredibly stressful for so many students. I personally have had to drop a class due to the disconnect of online learning as well as I am failing a required class because I just cant learn the material online. Between that and students having to balance working (most of which are full time) it is just very difficult right now as compared to any other time in the past 20 years.
7739,That makes me die inside
7740,"If *everyone* in the US feels this way, I think it's probably not a mass overreaction.

>If your mental health is deteriorating just to get a degree, is it even worth it?

It's worth it unless you know of another way to find a job with health insurance. Or a living wage. What am I going to do, drop out with a semester to go? I might be able to find a retail job, but I'd never get a job in an office or anywhere that offered a good salary or health insurance."
7741,Group project too!! 5pm on Friday- 5pm on Saturday during finals week. I personally don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to get over it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
7742,Of course it is. Will employers care? Absolutely not. If you do bad your first year you have three years to improve and gather up. If you can‚Äôt recover you‚Äôre simply not trying hard enough. I‚Äôm going through that right now but they won‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs all about how hard you get hit and how fast you get back up.
7743,Mine too. But our break for Christmas is huge. Fall semester ended last week. Finals this week. Ans we don‚Äôt return until January 19th.
7744,"Kinda not true for premeds adcoms will be asking us what we did to help the pandemic, and our GPA will still = acceptance to med school or not regardless. Rip lmao"
7745,"AH that is horrible. My school started in late September, we got one or two random holidays off then two days for thanksgiving. Our winter break is normally three weeks but this year it was reduced to two :,("
7746,ngl you got us with that title
7747,"For real, I have to ask.  Why is the constant refrain to every problem with every professor to ""go over him/her"" to the dept head?

The reason I ask is that   I feel like this doesnt really reflect an understanding of the actual dynamics of an academic department.  The chair of a dept is not the boss of the dept in the same way that, say, the manager of a store is.  The chair cannot order faculty to do things.  The chair does not have hire/fire capacity.  The chair really can't do much at all without the consent of at least the majority of a dept except maybe set up an offending prof's schedule with a shitty time slot of a lab or something.  That's because  the chair is a colleague who is typically equal to everyone in rank and either volunteered or was voted in to the position. Their extra duties include creating course schedules, begging faculty to fill out committees,  mentoring new faculty, and pleading our budgetary case/agenda to the dean. In return s/he gets load release. But the point is, it's a rotating, consensus-based SERVICE position (almost invariably middle-rank profs as well).

Why does this matter?   Now I'm not saying if professor conduct is a legitimate problem you can't go to the chair, but for minor issues, at most the chair can maybe mention something to an offending prof in passing in an email.  This is especially the case if the prof is associate rank or higher.  (With pre-tenure or  NTT we have a bit more flexibility). Obviously illegal or unethical conduct is a little different, but encouraging students to immediately email the chair over something like this is just going to over-burden the chair.

Source: I am the chair of a dept.  Please stop emailing me about the resolution of Bob's online lectures (although Im always happy to hear from our students!).  We have university-provided web cams/laptops and im pretty sure theyre older than most students.  Getting them set up so that Bob, who is 1000 years old, can use them was in and of itself a miracle.  Please call IT and email Bob.  He just recently linked his email to his phone. He's very proud."
7748,"We get that, but we are paying literally thousands of dollars to schools that has all summer (and most of spring) to know and figure out how to transition to online and then to train and supply the professors with the necessary supplies.

Edit: Apparently people think I'm attacking the professors, I'm not!! I'm saying the universities should have figured online out. I understand many professors are just as confused as us."
7749,"Hey don‚Äôt disrespect the DSI camera my guy, it‚Äôs actually better than you would think. I have some pictures from years ago that are kinda decent honestly"
7750,Your title made me LOL!
7751,"At my school the department chairs handle grade disputes & general issues with professors, and on many cases do require faculty to handle issues a certain way. At my school, something like OP's description would definitely be a chair problem"
7752,"Just a reminder - many professors are adjuncts/lecturers, meaning they only have semester to semester contracts. They are paid next to nothing, and sometimes they don't even know they're teaching until a week or two before, and sometimes they do not get the necessary training or supplies because these are only given to the tenured or tenure track faculty (permenant faculty)."
7753,"I didn't blame the professors. The professors aren't the ones to blame, the schools are. Have a university issued device that has a 720p webcam, choose one virtual platform to use, and hold a mandatory training on said platform for professors. Realistically a chromebook *could* do the job, so it's not financially unreasonable. I get that it's difficult for professors, but it's harder on students and not figuring out what is going on is a lot more detrimental to students lives/careers than to the professors."
7754,[deleted]
7755,"Yeah my department head is in charge of making sure that the instructors actually listen to the students and grade fairly, among other things of course, but it's still part of the job description. OP did email the teacher, and he ignored it and the rest of the class who also spoke out about it, in class, via IM. This shit is unacceptable for a school op is probably paying thousands of dollars to attend. Sorry, but as department head, it's your job to keep you department in check, that's why you're the leader of it. If you let an instructor shittily teach his class after hearing that hes doing a bad job, that's on you as much as it is on him when students complain and drop the class. Also, IT isnt going to do anything unless the instructor asks them to, a student cant set an IT appointment up for an instructor. (Unless you're in some whack ass world) this whole issue is less about the camera being bad, and more about the instructor blatantly ignoring his students, and thus giving them a subpar classroom experience at best. That's a Chair issue."
7756,"For perspective, it took my adjunct colleague *a year* for our college to give him a work laptop that he was entitled to. I'm full-time (not tenure-track, but at least teaching staff) and got mine upon hire.

It's also not always possible for adjuncts to buy these things themselves. Two adjuncts I know are on Medicaid/food stamps. Many collect unemployment in the summer months and crowd fund for medical bills and car repairs. It is very possible they make $20k-$30k a year or less, even in a major city.

Also, one thousand-year-old Bob might not be able to go to campus right now because, you know, he could catch COVID and die.

I know this sucks for everyone all around. Just be aware that this is the failing of a hundred points in a huge turdy system, the biggest failure being the slow withdrawal of federal/state funding over the last 60 years. You can express your displeasure by getting involved in student government, making friends with the faculty/unions on campus, and being loud. 

I pray for all of us but particularly for Bob who probably saves all his documents to his desktop üôè"
7757,jealous because I only ever had a ds lite
7758,"If the professor is ignoring communication from the students, then going to the chair might be a way of getting his/her attention.  At the least, the chair will let them know there is an issue, and professors usually read e-mail from their chairs."
7759,"I'm emailing the dean. /s

Edit: Adding sarcasm, even though I shouldn't need to."
7760,Lol same was just playing on it a few hours ago
7761,"Yes I also do grade disputes (but this in an independent process over which i do not have individualized control), but if I received an email from a student complaining about the resolution of somebody's web cam, and they (1) have not emailed the prof and (2) have not contacted IT I'm going to tell them to (1) email the prof first and (2) contact IT and have them troubleshoot it."
7762,Some of my professors and TAs have large whiteboards in their homes. It's very much in character with the people I imagine being profs and math grad students
7763,All of my professors are teaching from home so it is entirely possible that his home internet just isn't very good.
7764,">I would expect him to be using a university supplied computer and webcam.

There's the answer probably."
7765,It‚Äôs giving me some ideas üòÇ
7766,"Tbh I got myself a brand new laptop this year and my camera quality is shit, so might just be that"
7767,How do you know it isn't his internet?
7768,"hey, ds lite is a respectable handheld"
7769,"Another professor here. I somewhat agree. You want to interact with the professor you are having issues with. Do not be a Karen and ask to speak to the manager. Talk to your professor.

On the other hand... if it is a real problem, and the professor is not responsive, department head/chair is the next step. If you \*really\* need to, contact them. Don't got over them and contact a dean or president or something else. Also, many of you may have teachers that are instructors, graduate instructors, or adjunct professors that yes, the department head/chair may actually be responsible for.

On the other, other hand... You school might actually have some administrative person or pathway to use for these sort of things. If they do, use that. The department head/chair will be pulled in if necessary. 

Always advocate for yourself, but don't be a Karen about it. Always follow the proper systems or chain of authority. Don't skip links."
7770,"At my uni, any kind of grievance you had with a prof would procedurally go through the chair first and then the dean then the dean of students. To me I felt like I would get my issue solved if I went to the dean first and he told me to submit my letter to the chair and it works it‚Äôs way up. Of course this all varies on school and even departments. To me this feels slow but whatever"
7771,"> that has all summer (and most of spring) to know and figure out how to transition to online and then to train and supply the professors with the necessary supplies.

That's....not at all as much time as you think it is. Firstly because you're assuming it was known for ""most of the spring"" that things would be virtual in the fall. You're also downplaying the amount of coordination and decisions needed to be made by larger groups and checking how those decisions interacted with each department."
7772,"A university professor buying their own tech- What do you think?

/s obviously yes USA"
7773,"Honestly I'd rather have a DS Lite than a DSi, since the DSi can't play GBA games"
7774,"I'm pretty sure the US isn't in fact a world superpower, but is instead a half dozen second world countries and forty-four third world hell holes in a trenchcoat."
7775,"Yeah I got started with photography with a Dsi cam. Not the best obviously, but for 200X it‚Äôs really decent and grabs details well. I have many photos with it that are way better than my Polaroid photos"
7776,"Nope! I spoke with my advisor recently and this has been in discussion for a while, program has a great enrollment and I have yet to find a logical reason for the suspension."
7777,"This is a very logical thought, great suggestion! I wonder if that's the reason the program is ""under review"" it worries me however because they mention they will not be offering classes for this major as far as 2024, my graduation year. It makes me wonder why they would suspend it for so long."
7778,"The wording sounds to me like they have been told they cannot continue offering the major by an accrediting body for certain reasons. They may have an issue that can be corrected, like not having enough instruction staff with graduate degrees teaching the subject, or they may not have been following the required curriculum standards by the state or accrediting body. Something, though, tells me that it‚Äôs some form of ‚Äúsomebody did something very wrong‚Äù, like was mentioned."
7779,Looks like it's time to transfer
7780,"That's already in the back of my mind, meeting with advising tomorrow to see what my next steps are."
7781,"As of right now, they are saying I can switch Majors, which will likely mean my previous classes have been a waste. Hopefully I will still graduate on time."
7782,"if you enrolled in the program you should still be able to complete the major under your catalog year.  i would walk to the Provost's office and ask for a meeting with the chief academic officer - dean of undergraduate studies, or provost.  

Demand, in that meeting, in the most cordial way possible, that your catalog be honored.  You should not be made to change your major, that is a violation of the catalog.  Is this a state university?"
7783,"Your courses will should apply at least as electives to another degree, no? Learning is never wasted. 

Also if they are having to flag it for review, I would ask to be refunded the price of any classes which will not count toward another degree--or to get vouchers to take an equal number of hours free. They owe you that--I would think."
7784,What options are they offering?
7785,Actively working on getting credit / refunded
7786,"Absolutely BRIALLIANT suggestion, I have a meeting tomorrow, I will be bringing this up and will keep all of you posted."
7787,Good luck homie
7788,They should have stop new students from enrolling if they have discussed this for a while and allow the students to finish the degree before phasing it out
7789,"You would think. I am going into my Jr year and they are stopping the program end of my Jr year. Meaning I will be a year short of finishing it. They have the date for the program ending set so those going into Sr year will finish , but not those with 2 years left."
7790,Appreciate it!
7791,"A long time since I looked at this sort of thing, and a lot here I don't know (the school, the major, your location, etc). But last time I checked (a long time ago in California), the school's catalog was treated as part of a contract in matters such as this. If your major was listed in the catalog in the year you began attending, and if you =declared= that as your major to the school, then the school was obligated (in California) to fulfill its obligation to the student with regard to that major.

So, were I you, I would look for a local attorney with a reputation for dealing with educational institutions (should be at least 3-4) and talk with them about this. And then as required, and as supported wherever you are, that attorney could talk to the school about this. Given so many things unknown to me, I can't be sure of the outcome. But it is reasonable to expect the school to continue offering the major until you finish, or, should they decide not to, that you would have grounds to pursue damages from them in the courts.

I've seen it happen in the past. Universities and deans, etc, do not react well when they mess with students and then lawyers visit them and make threats, file charges in court, etc.

Or, of course, just let it go and find a different school (which will cost you time and money). Up to you.

Good luck."
7792,"If you have any inklings of a Karen in you, raise hell."
7793,"Learning is sometimes wasted, like if this guy was getting a degree in a pseudoscience for example and that's why they're suspending the program, he'd have 'learned' a bunch of garbage that wasn't true and actively mislead him about how the world works."
7794,You could transfer?
7795,"My college did this when I was in grad school. They rug pulled me two semesters into my thesis and forced me to do a bibliographic review instead and a ton of one on one independent studies to graduate, thus damaging my marketability to doctoral programs while still taking my 100k‚Ä¶ Btw, the college lost accreditation for the major, now I have to tell people ‚Äúwell it was an accredited school when I went there.‚Äù

St. Rose, I hate you."
7796,This is absolutely correct OP while you are in college you operate under the catalog and degree requirements you entered with as a freshman. If they stop your major they‚Äôre still obligated to accommodate you. This happened to an ex in college and the school allowed her to take different classes to fulfill her requirements and basically just had to offer the course for the three or four remaining students. This comment is what you need to listen to fuck transferring
7797,"Under the circumstances, I wonder if the school could help transfer you to another institution to finish your last year? Maybe even a foreign exchange type thing?"
7798,Depending on my meeting tomorrow I may look into some online options that will accept transfer credits.
7799,Worst case scenario and you can‚Äôt do that major. Find a similar one that is offered and speak with the head of that major about substituting classes from your old major or talk with your individualized major program about creating one for you using the classes you have taken.
7800,Can you transfer? It's a bit extreme but honestly this is insane enough that I'd consider it if I were in your shoes.
7801,"CWU by any chance? Just transferred out of that school, thank god."
7802,"Tried posting this there, they claimed it had too many words and deleted it haha"
7803,Get a lawyer if they are not refunding you for lost credits because you are forced to change a major.
7804,"I think it is CWU, which is a state school"
7805,Are they getting rid of the major or only the specialization?
7806,"Loads of underclassmen don't spend 6-8 hours a day on school and upperclassmen usually have figured out how to balance things out. 

It also helps if you're hot and social, something which I have failed on both fronts."
7807,No one is bragging about how they went home and did classwork. You only hear about the exciting parts of college
7808,"I once got a handjob while taking notes for my online Ochem course. 

She just‚Ä¶ started. I was like ‚ÄúDo you want me to put my notebook down????‚Äù, and she said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be more fun if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

So I guess my advice is to multitask."
7809,Look at the moneybags overhere with redbull
7810,a lot of people go to college just to party and shit so when u think about it like that it‚Äôs not that surprising. You said it yourself it‚Äôs a common point in life for people to be free and wild
7811,[deleted]
7812,"i surprisingly had a more active sex life when college was online and i stayed at home. took easier classes, had time to go on a few dates, etc. 

since moving back to college i‚Äôve been so busy, i barely have time for my own friends let alone trying to get into someone‚Äôs pants."
7813,Stem major?
7814,Yep
7815,my first 2 years I probably spent 25-30 hours a week on school max. Certainly didn‚Äôt feel like it restricted my ability to socialize. Not that I was great at socializing anyway lol
7816,My girlfriend and I just take naps together after class lmao
7817,I remember one day needing to stay up to study so I had to buy a 99¬¢ can of Venom because that‚Äôs all I could afford
7818,Same dude same literally passed a exam today I was afraid of for a year and have no time to celebrate cause I have another coming up next week.
7819,exactly
7820,It is wild but definitely not free lol. My school costs about 3k for a semester so if i dont study all that money would be flushed down the drain.
7821,Buddy after college you're gonna work 8-10 hours a day until you retire. I suggest you learn to acclimate or life is going to just pass you by if you all do is watch TV and sleep after work.
7822,"print(""fuck me harder"")"
7823,Y'all have sex lives?
7824,Too funny this deserves an award
7825,3k a semester ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
7826,"Time to be that guy!  

and not get fuck buddies *because of* being that guy"
7827,"> a lot of people go to college just to party and shit

And even then, shitting at home is far better."
7828,You‚Äôd be surprised to know how often old people have sex. They copulate like rabbits.
7829,"This is how I see it. Some people just have really strong sex drives and their minds will go to great lengths to achieve that goal, including putting it on a pedestal as high as academic success. 

Now, don't get me wrong, sex is great but after a bit of effort met with failure, or perhaps success, I put that drive on the back burner while I focus on more important tasks. However, I've notice other people are significantly different in this regard. For some, the drive never ends and they spend a significant amount of energy looking for sex. How they manage this, I can only think is that they have lived this circumstance so long that they really have it down to a science, and know where to look, what to say, and when to say it, to achieve that goal. Just like anything, I think a big reason for the continued success is simply repetition, and time spent thinking about it."
7830,Better be wearing socks.
7831,Well I do have ADHD but I don‚Äôt take Adderall lol
7832,"Maybe that's just hollywood College. Depending on your degree, shit isn't really all that grandiose. This is more often true for STEM in my experience."
7833,"If you're too exhausted to even masturbate(if that's something that you want to do), then I think you might not have the best quality of life. Taking too many credit hours, perhaps? In the wrong major for you? Depressed? Idk."

7835,">Biochem right now with Anthropology as well and Religious Studies

Are you trying to figure out a way to disprove evolution? Lol."
7836,"Your reply makes my heart warm. Yes I do want to walk. I was just feeling like maybe it‚Äôs not such a big deal, but it is‚Ä¶it really is to me. Thank you"
7837,"First of all congrats, second of all its not like a high school diploma, three go walk! My university Is not even letting us walk due to supposed budget constraints lol so please walk for the both of us"
7838,"This is YOUR accomplishment and regardless of your age your should be proud of it! Don‚Äôt listen to your sister, you deserve the recognition"
7839,"I‚Äôd absolutely walk!!!

Edited to add: and by the way you‚Äôd be surprised at how many students drop out before even reaching their associates degree. Around only 50% of students who enter college get to obtain their AA. So it is absolutely an accomplishment! 
Enjoy and walk with some pride and head held high! Because you absolutely deserve it and EARNED it!!!!"
7840,Awww thank you!
7841,I am 46 and going to school too! I'm going to walk! This is about you - not her. And what you have accomplished!
7842,High school was easy! Community college? I struggle with each semester üò© I totally want to give up. Knowing that I can walk this May is making it all worth it. It's a degree and nothing like a high school degree!
7843,I will! I will walk for both of us!! Congratulations to you too!
7844,"If it's a big deal to you, then do it! You will most likely regret it if you don't. Also who gives a shit what anyone else thinks. I'm 38 and a second year university student and you know DAMN well I am walking across that stage!"
7845,"Literally I have no idea why people think associates degrees are the same as high school diplomas. A high school will hold your hand the entire way to make sure you graduate, even if you're near flunking out. A college will just say ""lol see ya üëã"" because it's not their job to make sure you graduate. The responsibility shifts way more onto the student and getting a degree above high school at any level is an accomplishment because of that. It requires level of dedication you just don't need to graduate high school."
7846,Thank you! I did not know those statistics
7847,"Walk, I got my AS and because of covid we just got a stupid slide show. Do it for me."
7848,Whole heartedly degree. You worked hard for this degree. Take that power walk. You deserved it
7849,Walk. Rock it. It's your achievement and you deserve to celebrate.
7850,"I‚Äôm so sorry about that. May 13, 2022 7:30pm I will walk for us both!"
7851,Thank you and congratulations to you too!
7852,If you want to walk then walk! It is a huge accomplishment! Congrats!
7853,"I am proud of you too! You got this! What are you taking for this last semester? I‚Äôm taking Biol 1408, Art Appreciation, Intro to Pholosophy, and Physical education. It‚Äôs been tough but I have all A‚Äôs so far."
7854,[deleted]
7855,"WALK! 

Own your moment and love it, you‚Äôve earned it and you deserve it. For what it‚Äôs worth, I have two Masters degrees and am very bothered by what sounds like snobbery from your sister. 

I walked for all of it and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I almost didn‚Äôt walk for my second Masters because of the ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve done this before‚Äù thinking combined with (at the time) not valuing that degree as much as I should have because it was a hybrid online program at a small school several hours from my home. It ended up being more powerful than any other graduation - including being a (in my opinion) very lucky Coloradan who got to collect my HS diploma on stage at the rather famous and impressive Red Rocks Amphitheater. 

Walk‚Ä¶proudly‚Ä¶and get that diploma for yourself. And please, do it to send a message to others to be proud of all hard earned accomplishments!

Congratulations!"
7856,Thank you and I‚Äôm proud of you!
7857,"‚ÄúYep I was here, and I did that!‚Äù  Love this! Thank you"
7858,"This is a great accomplishment, congratulations!! I graduated with an AA last year but I didn‚Äôt walk because of similar reasons and looking back, I wish I had. Don‚Äôt let anyone diminish your hard work üéâ"
7859,I'm proud of you üòò! It's always encouraging to hear about older non traditional students success. Best wishes!
7860,Thank you!
7861,I'm 35. I was not able to attend high school. I got my ged. I graduated with my associates last year. I was not able to walk because of Covid so walk for the both of us. My associates was a very big deal to me especially since it is math heavy and I learned no high school math.  I am a second semester junior now at university. I will be walking for my bachelor's.
7862,"Age is just a number. 

A degree is timeless!"
7863,"I agree with this, if it means something to you, do it.  I have attended so many at this point that if I never attended another I would be so happy. That being said, every single time a non traditional student of mine has asked me to be there for their graduation, I make every effort to don the old cap and gown to support them!  I do it for the young ones too if they ask but it‚Äôs the non traditional student that seems to take the accomplishment in a different way.  So, way to go, and walk that walk for you!"
7864,"I am SO proud of you! Your sister is definitely off-base, I‚Äôve seen many jobs that require at least an Associates (I live in Alabama, so it may be different, but I‚Äôve seen job postings that mention a minimum of an associates). 

Do you want to walk? If you want to walk, DO IT! You worked your butt off to get that degree. If you don‚Äôt want to, there‚Äôs no need."
7865,Thank you
7866,fair enough but it's allergy season too
7867,Allergy season rn. I don‚Äôt mind if they sneeze or cough just please don‚Äôt do it on me
7868,"Masks help my allergies so much! I was like ""why is everyone complaining about breathing in a mask, it's so much easier for me!"" And then I learned I just have allergies and breathing isn't this difficult for normal people."
7869,This is what I'm calling allergies from now on
7870,"Could be but I know in Texas flu is popping OFF right now. My brother had it, a kid in my environmental class had it, my professor was sick with something, my coworker was sick with something. 

If only allergies are high in your area that might be one thing, but some places definitely are having a weird late flu season. About 2 weeks ago the positive test rate for flu in Texas was 25%, the national average was only 7.7% :/"
7871,Still don‚Äôt need your snot everywhere
7872,"Heck yeah. I‚Äôm sick rn but we test for covid every week so I know it‚Äôs not covid. But like hell man, I feel like crap. I don‚Äôt want to spread it around. College is a breeding ground for this stuff. Strep, flu, random viruses, it all goes around like crazy if you don‚Äôt take precautions when you‚Äôre sick."
7873,The idea is more that people don't want to catch those other things either.  It's been a common thing in some cultures for years that if you are sick with anything you mask up.  More than a few people would like to see that become the standard in the US too.
7874,"Wearing a mask and staying home when you're sick are great, but sneezing, sniffling, and coughing don't mean they're sick, nor does it mean they have Covid. I've spent days/weeks of my life sneezing and sniffling without being sick with the flu, a cold, Covid, etc. Allergies are a hell of a thing. So is dust and animal hair."
7875,"They‚Äôre still spewing their droplets into the air. Idc if they have a virus or not, that‚Äôs gross."
7876,Fax that‚Äôs why I still wear a mask my throat is lowkey dry but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just allergies. I‚Äôm also trying not to get sick so prefer to wear a mask. Not really for covid anymore just to prevent getting sick
7877,"Sinus season, yo. The tree pollen be high af. If you‚Äôre got the vax and your boosties, you should be fine."
7878,I het heavy coughs every morning. Unless I drink lots of hot tea. No reason besides just my body being my body lol. I wish I could fix it.
7879,Don‚Äôt worry it goes in my shirt
7880,"I've got severe seasonal allergies, and masks are a fucking blessing if they're pollen related. Put on a mask if you've got allergies, you'll thank me."
7881,"Droplets are everywhere. We‚Äôre all gross.

If you have allergies and your nose is stuffed, wearing a mask for hours simply isn‚Äôt practical."
7882,"You can be sick with other things, just don‚Äôt put other people at risk of infection lmao."
7883,"If you're sick at all, you should try all you can not to infect other people. That's just common courtesy"
7884,agree with this but i also think the real issue is that many schools and workplaces in the US force people to come in when they are sick. i know people who had the flu and were fired from their job or failed their class just because they stayed home for a week.
7885,"Wouldn't wearing a mask also help with that tho? 

Isn't that why people wear a mask when they're dusting? So that they block out the dust"
7886,What about older professors? Family members of professors or college students that are in the affected age categories? College students who are chronically ill? It's not just you. Think about other people for a minute.
7887,"Getting sick can still be an annoyance without being a threat.  I don't want to get a cold if I can avoid it.  Not because I think it's dangerous, but just because it's annoying."
7888,It's pollen hell bro. It'll settle down end of may.
7889,Most people don‚Äôt openly sneeze into the air. They cover their nose with their arm or shirt lol.
7890,lucky that you‚Äôre around those kinds of people. most people around me don‚Äôt do that
7891,So people just can‚Äôt be sick with other things?
7892,"What's the logic here, do you think masks only work for COVID? It's like covering your sneeze with your arm, you do it so you don't get germs everywhere. It was gross before but now that we've been living through a pandemic for two years I feel like people have to know better by now."
7893,"It takes five minutes once a week, why you acting like it is a big hassle?"
7894,More the reason to do it since you MAY be sick and spreading fomites more often because of allergies
7895,so did you just not factor in allergies?
7896,"definitely feel that way. I graduated high school with a 4.0 and my current gpa is barely above a 2.0, I‚Äôve never been this bad with school."
7897,That‚Äôs part of the reason I‚Äôve stayed at community college longer then I initially intended. I‚Äôm not paying full university tuition for online classes and no social life.
7898,"Yes, I can‚Äôt do online again. I‚Äôd rather take a gap year than pay a ton to learn hardly anything"
7899,Not for me. I see college as a necessary evil and just want it to be over.
7900,"i graduated high school with a 4.0 and my grades haven‚Äôt been like high school ever since i entered university. online teaching has not been working for me at all and now i forgot how to actually study, so yeah."
7901,"I have become increasingly annoyed with people who say they can do their jobs from home and don't want to come in, don't actually do their jobs, and they just shrug and say ""pandemic"". Some people are being honest, and admit they can't do their best in a remote system they never trained for or worked with before. And if their best and your best combined just aren't working remotely, then it's best if colleges just admit it and let people take gap years with no scholarship penalty, etc. We keep muddling through, and it's not working for everybody. But so far they just keep kicking the can down the road without concrete plans"
7902,"I never got a college experience anyways since I‚Äôm a commuter, but Covid has definitely made things tough"
7903,"‚ÄúCollege experienced‚Äù is a vague term. It does not just mean partying and getting drunk all the time. College experience is a way for people to find passion, make connections with others, develops ones character, network, find hobbies, learn. A lot of these things whether you want to admit or not , are gone bc of covid. Yes there are people who gain nothing from it, but for every person who doesn‚Äôt gain something, there are 1000‚Äôs of people who gain something."
7904,"I have this thought every day. I‚Äôm learning fuck all on a laptop, albeit managing to get a higher grade point average (for obvious reasons). I see my friends across the country in states that didn‚Äôt lockdown having the time of their lives. I did my part, did everything I was told, just to probably get sent home again this fall. If it happens,  I already have a plan to drop out for the year and work full time."
7905,"Felt that, at this point I don't even care if we go back to online learning or whatnot, I've just accepted the fact that I'll never have a normal college experience again (I'm graduating in 2023 and at this rate with the pandemic I don't even know what to expect anymore)."
7906,"‚ÄúForgot how to study.‚Äù

The feels üòÖ"
7907,Not only the college experience is taken away but jesus I haven‚Äôt learned anything since covid put everything online. I feel as dumb as ever
7908,I went ‚Äú2023? That‚Äôs so far away!‚Äù and then realized it‚Äôs nearing 2022 and I‚Äôm also graduating in 2023 ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm doing.
7909,"Yeah, but for me I also worry that the longer I take off the more I'm not progressing I need my degree AND the harder it will be for me to get back into the swing of things. I took this whole summer off and just worked and I realized that was two months and one class I could have used to get closer to my bachelor's. I am a bit older so I guess that's why I think this way. Who knows when rona will end? Personally I can't wait forever to finish my degree despite how much online class sucks.

Either way good luck to you."
7910,"The College Experience^TM is a lie. It's a lie that schools sell to unsuspecting children with few other opportunities. I know The College Experience^TM seems like some big thing that everyone is supposed to have, but 4 years after you leave it won't have made a difference. Some people are really not going to like me saying this; just go talk to anyone that graduated if they had more fun in college or out of it."
7911,"This is the real answer, save money, imo learn more because they have less people to manage."
7912,Hate to break it to you chap but college is also servitude. Most of the time they are also corporations that only care about money and looking good.
7913,[deleted]
7914,"While I agree with you wholeheartedly, for some college is their first time ""on their own."" - It is a transitional period from youth to adulthood. There is always going to be some overlap and always going to be those that finally feel they can breathe for the first time in their life. It is an important experience for those people.

I'm going to school later in life so am grown up. I just see the importance for those that are not."
7915,I agree with having in person classes because you can network and get far more help than the college system being lazy and using Covid-19 as an excuse to not work
7916,"In person classes are drastically different in experience than online, and people have a right to be upset if they are paying regular tuition and getting online ones."
7917,">and now I forgot how to actually study

Yuuup, which is why I‚Äôm absolutely terrified to go back in-person for the fall"
7918,"Alright take this with a grain of salt. If you go to college for the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù honestly just drop out. You are not a kid, college is not for kids. College is for studying for a higher purpose down the road. The amount of people I have seen gone to college for the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù and come out with nothing but -80k debt is unbelievable. So please mature up because society depends on you. Again, college is for you not for the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù."
7919,"I am aware social events have been continuing this entire pandemic.

That is part of the reason we are still in this mess, people haven‚Äôt been social distancing‚Ä¶."
7920,"College is already less freedom. You go to college, sit there for several hours, go to the library or home, study for several hours, constantly worrying about grades, and worry if you get an A or not at end of the semester. While making no money at all with a low amount of money left in a bank account, and not able to buy much at all.

College is literally the same as corporate servitude, just that you are grade servitude, and learning servitude.

Thankfully my field"
7921,"OP probably isn‚Äôt in college just for the experience but it‚Äôs pretty discouraging and demotivating to study at home. First off, you make friends in college, meet people who are probably going to be your colleagues at work later on so we have been deprived of this. And second, at least where I go, the quality of the subjects that we study has dropped because we have been forced to study from home‚Ä¶ for example we can‚Äôt look at preparates in person and this is imo going to severely negatively impact our knowledge and further studying (and not by our fault)."
7922,"yep, wouldn‚Äôt have graduated with a double major if it wasn‚Äôt for covid. I took advantage of that shit and I know I‚Äôm not the only one"
7923,"I had really good grades all through high-school and my first semester of college. As soon as covid hit and we were all sent home my work ethic and performance nosedived. I was just starting to get back to normal last semester and I did pretty well, but I still am at a 2.8 when I had never dropped below a 3.5 in my life.

Edit: I can't type apparently"
7924,"I honestly just feel like waiting it out, and it looks like Covid isn‚Äôt gonna go away with all the new variants. But at the same time having uncertainty every few months and figuring out what to do is a big headache.
I just wish they can give people the option of online instead of forcing everyone to go back, it‚Äôs just too stressful. As an international that‚Äôs all I just want."
7925,"I also don't want to be too blunt, but I think a lot of students also don't realize that most people do better in high school than in college. They aren't factoring in that most colleges are full of people in the upper half of their high school classes, and thus it is more difficult, or that high school classes are weighted.

I'm sure COVID has had a big impact on grades, but I think a lot of these ""I had a 4.0 in high school"" are going to be a little shook when they are in person and are also not getting the same grades they did in high school.

\*I'm in my masters program online and can attest there are challenges, but I think undergrad freshmen are overestimating how much is COVID vs the differences between high school and college."
7926,See I say that and then I still do nothing
7927,"the only times I ""relax"" during the weekends are when I make a decision to not do any work over the weekend which then stresses me tf during the week, but I still get stressed during the weekend when I'm ""relaxing"" because I know that the week is going to be super busy .-."
7928,have fun
7929,My resting heart rate registers as a panic attack with all the work I have to do. Best of luck to you and everyone else!
7930,I have to write 40 pages worth of articles which is due in 2 weeks.
7931,"I've procrastinated for three months on mine, and it is due in 3 hours. I have about one paragraph done. I have never screwed up this bad before. Idk what to do."
7932,Thanks mom
7933,Relaxing in the summer? Interesting idea. In reality not much relaxing occurs
7934,"I've not had any legit guiltless down time this whole semester. There is always something I had to do. I can't wait until Friday evening when I am fully done with finals, but even then I will need to start packing everything up to move out the next morning. But at least the stress won't be there anymore."
7935,Good thing I‚Äôm taking summer classes üò≠üò≠
7936,I just submitted an assignment at 11:41 pm. I started it just two hours before that and fuck yea I met the deadline
7937,I feel yah... I have a research paper due tomorrow and I haven‚Äôt even started on it. It‚Äôs due tomorrow so I‚Äôll do it tomorrow üòÇ
7938,That‚Äôs so true. One weekend for relaxation = complete annihilation
7939,"No problem, son. Make sure you're eating well and getting exercise, too."
7940,Lol same. I pretty much begin to contemplate the universe and start cussing lmao
7941,"No idea. I managed to write a 15 page paper in 10 hours. I have already done the research, but I just don‚Äôt want to write 10 pages lol. I‚Äôve been writing way too much this semester"
7942,One thing you could do is get off Reddit and work on it
7943,you guys are ballsy but so am I :(
7944,"Just do as much work as you possibly can. Turn in what you have and then ask for a possible retention. 

Some credit is always better than no credit."
7945,Oh damn. I don‚Äôt envy you. Good luck.
7946,Mood
7947,That's going to bite you in the ass and ruin a lot of things for you
7948,"Yeah I‚Äôve got an 8 page essay due in 7 hours that I haven‚Äôt started, did I have two weeks to do it? Yes, do I put it off until the day it‚Äôs due to give me a reason to actually do it? Yes"
7949,I've worked through practically every weekend this semester and I am happily taking this one off
7950,I hate that we're simply conditioned to be chronically stressed. The quality of work produced by students and teachers would be astronomically higher if we were actually allowed to have and enjoy free time.
7951,I dont think i could ever handle that much. How long do u think that is going to take?
7952,"I'm sure people talk about it and I haven't seen it, but it makes me feel a little better seeing someone talk about it directly. 

""Guiltless downtime"" is something that everyone probably cares about that never gets named :/"
7953,10 pages lol along with a 3000 word annotated bibliography
7954,Felt
7955,"Unfortunately, the further you go into your studies (especially upper division), the less time you‚Äôll have for any sort of relaxation. That has been the case for STEM, at least. I would not expect weekends to be ‚Äúnot do any studying/homework days‚Äù."
7956,"I second this. I did this myself for mental health reasons and it was the best decision I could have made. Take the time you need to recover and go back when you‚Äôre ready. School will always be there. Luckily most schools are just now starting or have not started yet. If it‚Äôs too late, speak with the counseling department about starting a medical withdraw. They will understand and it will expunge all grades from this semester. It will be like you were never there. Best of luck to you OP."
7957,I'm using the GI Bill so idk how that will work. I already submitted for benefits for this semester so idk if it's too late to stop them.
7958,"The worst thing you can do is go to school in a bad mental state, get shit grades while paying money and dig yourself a GPA hole.

If going to school works for you and will help, do it. If, like you said, you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre in a position to focus on classes, take the semester off. For real, it‚Äôs not a big deal to take time off. Get the estate in order, take time to grieve; maybe go on an extended trip if you can (would highly encourage) or try new hobbies. 

I‚Äôm sorry for your loss and I hope the best for you.

Edit: also, therapy."
7959,It's not. The VA won't even pay your tuition out until a few weeks into the semester. At least that's how it works at both schools I'm attending. I suggest talking to your VA office to be completely sure but all you likely have to do is drop your classes and maybe pay back your book stipend if they paid it out already.
7960,[deleted]
7961,"I highly encourage you to seek out counseling. If you do go back to school, they have free confidential counseling services. You can start the semester, get free counseling, and if you can‚Äôt complete you can get a medical withdrawal that shouldn‚Äôt affect your GPA. 

You can also call a suicide hotline for support right now. Many such hotlines (including the one linked below) explicitly say they‚Äôre there to help support survivors who‚Äôve lost a loved one to suicide. 

1-800-273-8255

https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/help-yourself/loss-survivors/"
7962,Best advice here ‚ô•Ô∏è
7963,"Department chair here. I recommend going to the dean of students, rather than the academic advisor. The dean of students has the pull to execute a no-fault withdrawal for OP to handle the academic end, and can probably help with short-term mental health support as well. Academic advisors are generally lower in the hierarchy and less able to intervene effectively in situations like this one. In any case, I strongly agree with the advise to take a leave of absence -- take care of yourself, OP."
7964,"Grieving isn't for the dead, it's for the living. If you don't let yourself heal and deal with the aftermath, you will surely find yourself struggling even more and it may have an impact on your performance (personally, professionally, and academically) that has further consequences. 

Edited to add: To clarify, I mean that the time after you lose someone and the grieving process is about *you* finding a new normal, not just honoring the person you've lost. Find your footing on your terms, not based on what your family is telling you or he would tell you."
7965,I was scheduled for 18 credits but I dropped down to 13. I can't drop anymore due to utilizing the GI Bill unfortunately.
7966,"My whole family is saying things like ""your father wouldn't want you to stop school because of this"" and it makes me feel bad in a way because I know it's absolutely true. He was a great guy and I always pushed myself to impress him."
7967,"I am also using the GI Bill and I don't think it would be too late to stop the benefits. Especially since you wouldn't get paid for this month until, at the soonest, the beginning of next month. 

Plus, you have the ability to change your schedule at literally any moment and that paperwork has to be submitted to the VA office to be processed. 

Either way, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Please talk to a professional if you can, and please surround yourself with loved ones during this time. If you decide to go to school, talk to your advisor and the mental health people at your school, and also tell your professors about what is going on. Take care of yourself. There is no shame in needing to take this semester off."
7968,[deleted]
7969,"I think you should strongly consider taking the year off. You could try a reduced course load, and definitely look into that, but if you take a year to work while maybe visiting a therapist, you could potentially be a lot more motivated by the time next spring rolls around. You have to keep busy, though. Take some time right now to grieve, and don't rush into work or school if you can avoid it. Then when you're ready make sure you fill your schedule with some positive things to do. I'm very sorry for your loss. :("
7970,"I would contact your school as well, if this is affecting you the professor might be able to do something to help ease the load on you, worth a shot."
7971,Would this constitute a full time load? I need to manage full time in order to satisfy my GI Bill. I can't pay my bills wihout the housing allowance it provides
7972,Please do not go to class in any sort of unmotivated or sad mental state. You will destroy your GPA and future. Speaking from experience.
7973,[deleted]
7974,"Self Care.
Surround yourself with support systems. 
You are entitled to how you feel including adjusting timetables. It is all part of grieving.
Self Care. Self Care. Self Care.
As the point person in your life, it is difficult to grieve, concentrate, and reconcile events. If you choose to not wait until spring , be gentle with yourself about your resulting grades. 
Request a study support system as well. Campus Grief counselling services. 
Be gentle and kind to yourself.
Rest, eat well, request support."
7975,"If you're capable of studying everything from books and internet, one thing you can do is try talking to your professors. I believe most of them will let you off the regular classes and you can just attend important dates. Good luck!"
7976,"But I am also sure your father would want you do take care of yourself and take care of your own health. He loved you and he wouldn't want you to suffer and put yourself through hell trying to do something that you couldn't handle at the moment. 


Taking a break from school is not quitting/stopping school. I have friends who had to take time off due to poor physical health, but they got back up on their feet and started going back to school, and they were even more successful than they would have been if they tried pushing themselves to go to school when their health simply wouldn't allow it. 

There is no shame in taking time off if that's what your health and grades require. You just need to do what is best for you and your health. Please don't let others make you feel guilty for taking care of yourself and mourning in your own way."
7977,"If you need time, take the time, even if the classes aren't offered until next Spring. It's better to take the time to grieve and heal than to try to jump right into it when you aren't ready and just let your grades drop down the hole. 

If you feel better by next term or summer term, try taking other classes that are required for your program at this time. Also look into other colleges nearby that might offer the classes you need a bit earlier. Some schools will allow you take individual classes from other schools and transfer the credits. 

I'm sorry for your loss."
7978,I would say take a semester off
7979,"So my father passed away 2 years ago, I am very sorry for your lose. I'm not exactly sure how you are feeling or how your father was but I used it as an opportunity to think of what my dad would want to see his son do (or daughter) kept my head up and pushed forward. It doesn't get any easier to think of your father as time goes on maybe talk about but never think of him. It's been 2 years now but still feels like yesterday it happened. Take your time, everything might be moving at a hundred miles an hour but press the brakes a bit and don't be too quick on decisions. Good luck I wish you the best."
7980,"Grief is real, and there is no real, concrete way to handle it. If you take the year off it may be enough time for you to move through the stages. My father was terminally ill, but it still felt sudden when he passed away the day after my junior year. I feel like although I went back to school a week later, the rest of that year was a blurr of not caring. I cant imagine even what you're going through. I hope you have a good support system, and that you take care of yourself."
7981,"This is in no way similar to what you are going through- but a month before I started college my mom passed away from cancer. I committed to the school year but I really shouldnt have. I should have taken a year off to process, grieve, and pull myself together. 

My biggest advice is to take a semester or two off and figure things out. You are going through an extremely difficult situation and I admire your courage and strength. But please take the time to think about your own wellbeing and what is best for you! I am so sorry for your loss, if you need any help I'm here!"
7982,"Wow. This is a hard one. First off, I'm sorry to hear this happened and to happen on Christmas. Your feelings right now are 100% valid. 

Your situation is really the reason deferment exists. One year is 12 months. 12 months to grieve, handle the estate, and heal.... a lot of stuff. You deserve to heal. So 12 months is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. It's okay to do this. Your not letting anyone down and it's not going anywhere as long as you follow school policy. 

Imagine not deferring, not doing well, being over worked and stressed, depression sets in.. things get worse... and now your GPA is permanently damaged. Its not worth it. 

I say allow yourself to grieve and heal, school can wait. Just tell them and communicate with them and follow their deferment policy.

Edit: I just saw your on GI bill. Thank you for your service."
7983,I'm so sorry for your loss
7984,"People grieve differently. My next door neighbors father commit suicide in a similar time frame to yours, sadly. One kid is in California working as a game tester and his daughters in college for something. 

She‚Äôs posting pics at parties wearing nice dressing and stuff. But I know she ain‚Äôt happy about it, cos I hear her crying at night. Thin apartment walls, man."
7985,"> My whole family is saying things like ""your father wouldn't want you to stop school because of this""

He wouldn't want you to drop out. I obviously didn't know him, but I'd like to think he could respect you taking a set amount of time off to handle his estate and your own grieving, before going back to do your best work"
7986,Actually getting a Ph.D
7987,"I had an in-class programming test for my C++ class. The class runs for an hour, but the test closed after the first 30 min of class. My laptop died after the first 2 mins I opened it up. I told my teacher, and asked if i could run home.  (and by run I mean literally sprint. I didn't have a car.) I lived about 5 min away, so luckily I was close.  I grabed my charger, and ran back to campus. I finished the coding assignment no problem and got an A on the assignment."
7988,"My physics I class was horrible. I struggled the entire semester and could not wrap my head around how to improve. Had regular visits with my prof most of the semester, and towards the end of the semester we were talking about my grade. He said I had improved after tanking the first couple tests, and I could probably swing a B if I did decent on the last exam and homework assignments and the final, but an A wasn't in the cards.

Fast-forward a couple weeks and he's giving us a review for the final. Working through old tests, answering questions, typical final review stuff. After finishing up we all got to talking and he said that if anyone got a 100% on the final he'd give them an A in the class. We all just kinda laughed it off, because the class was really hard and none of us really considered it realistic to ace the final.

Turns out, I got an A in the class."
7989,"the golden rule : write high/drunk, edit sober

7991,I wrote my Master's thesis in one semester at the height of the covid outbreak while working three teaching jobs all at the same time. It was the busiest I've ever been in my life and I barely slept or left my house the whole time.
7992,"I have 24 hours to write a 3600 word assignment worth 60% of my grade. Fml.

Edit: done, dusted and caught up on missed sleep."
7993,"I wrote my capstone paper in 40 hours AFTER the deadline (I procrastinated so hard I waited until after the deadline to request/receive a 48 hour extension to ""make some further revisions"" but really I hadn't written a single word yet). I mass meal prepped in like 2 hours and then went to the library (my laptop had died that week) and sat at a desktop to write the entire thing in 40 hours. I got an A lmao. 

&#x200B;

I also turned a semester of all Bs into all As by asking the profs if I could get bumped up and they all said yes. All 4. I was so scared by my luck I was sure something bad would happen soon."
7994,"I got D's on the first two exams of my dev bio class (100 points each). there was no homework so the entire class was just 3 exams at 100 points each. Managed to get a few points of extra credit through the semester. Realized I was on the verge of failing, studied the entire covered material cover to cover. Scored the bare minimum (88%) I needed on the final exam (100 points) to end the class with an 80.33%, or B-."
7995,Thumbs up my friend‚Ä¶ i wouldve tripped somewhere along the way and lied down in defeat‚Ä¶

7998,A strategic report on how a company of choice can make a successful shift to renewable energy. Thats the gist of it.
7999,"Got a 40 on a project which put me on the verge of failing the class since I'd failed the project before it too. When I talked to the grader, he said that because I was one of the few people who approached him for feedback, he would let me redo the whole project before the end of the semester (giving me ~2 months of time) and get all the points back with no penalty. That talk gave me the confidence to not only redo the assignment and boost that grade from a 40 to an 80, but I was also able to pick myself up from rock bottom in that class and get As for the rest of the semester. So basically I went from a failing average to a B+ in 2 months."
8000,How are you alive?!? I would‚Äôve just died on the lack of sleep alone.
8001,I had only been getting Cs on essays in this one literature class and had a B- (2.7gpa points) in the class. For my final I wrote an essay about Kanye got a high A at it brought me up to an B+(3.3gpa points). I was mostly shocked because I didn't think the prof would like my essay at all. I think I got one of the best final essay grades lol

Finished and printed it about 5 minutes before it was due walked into class looking like shit and someone asked if I was okay. I think I made a joke about having just finished my paper.. next week we get the back and they guy sitting next to me asks how I do. I made a 94 only because I was short a source.  I was proud. That teacher loved me because she thought I put a lot of effort into her class.. nope I just took AP lit in highschool.

8045,üëéüèª That is all I got left
8046,"I agree, and I would suggest not sounding overly mean. Your professors may read it too someday, so keep their feelings in mind"
8047,"I read mine from time to time. I‚Äôm generally very well reviewed, but I do get annoyed when I don‚Äôt get any new reviews in a semester. 
People tend to be more honest on ratemyprof than they are on teacher evals so it‚Äôs a useful source for me too! 

Also *leave positive and mediocre reviews too!* it‚Äôs very easy to leave a negative review, even if your professor is just okay, leave that review. It will still help someone avoid that one dick of a professor!"
8048,"This is a thing in statistics, you're 100% correct"
8049,"Certainly I will :). I planned to do it ever since I first heard of it (and that was many years ago!)

this is my first semester by the way :)"
8050,yeah that‚Äôs true. even the shitty professors have feelings
8051,"I do this every semester :D helping my fellow uni students! I always add details like if quizzes/exams are timed, page/word count on essays, and most importantly does the professor actually  teach anything or do they just read from the powerpoint word for word and have it posted online lmao."
8052,My prof put a negative review on his website as a joke
8053,"While I do see RMP as a helpful guideline for picking profs, I do find it a bit skeptical when I do. It has probably happened at least once or a few times, but a dissatisfied student might leave a bad review for the prof for either getting a bad grade (which is not the prof's fault) or simply wanting to feel better that their ""rep"" has now been ""ruined"".

When I do use it, I take it all reviews with a grain of salt."
8054,"I've said it more than once, I'll say it again.

The best prof I had, where I actually learned A LOT from, had a 1.5 rating"
8055,"I read mine as well but am quite poorly reviewed (avg. RMP score = 2 lol). It is a bit sad that such a public-facing evaluation is so negative, but it's also nice in that it disincentivizes less-motivated students from taking classes I teach. For negative reviews, I'd say to be constructive and specific in your critique -- don't just say 'class is boring and teacher sux', but list the things you didn't like in greater depth, which'll also help students to calibrate how much weight they'll give your review in their own decision-making."
8056,I feel like a lot of people put ‚Äúbe prepared to write!‚Äù or ‚Äúlots of papers!‚Äù for professors who assign the department-mandated minimum number of pages for the quarter or semester. Too many students just have really unrealistic expectations for how much work college should be.
8057,hope it went well!
8058,"Exactly! Always take into account the difficulty of the class too, some students expect an easy ride and will complain if not given one"
8059,"Take a breather first, get some distance from the bad professors."
8060,"I always do. Wish their character limit was a little longer though, hard to fit all my thoughts in."
8061,thanks for reminding me.
8062,"Review truthfully. Don't water or down to avoid sounding mean, but at the same time don't exaggerate. The fact that they might read it someday makes this even more important because it gives them an opportunity to see their shortcomings and learn from them"
8063,The English teacher I had this semester had a low rating on ratemyprofessor. People are saying she is too hard and whatever. She was one of the best English teacher I had so far. No one talks about how good she teaches. Everyone was like too much writing. No shit bruh it's an English class.
8064,"I do this after every single semester. I like to wait until final grades come out cause you can't edit after you post and I think putting the grade you got helps the reader take it with as many grains of salt as necessary. I try really hard to be descriptive, so even if I have a lot of personal feelings about a professor, I try to only say one sentence on that, and devote the rest to ""exams every other week (6 total)"" ""2-page paper but grading incredibly strict; only 3 10s given in our entire 150 person class"" etc"
8065,I was looking at a future professor‚Äôs reviews and all were positive except one. The one negative one just said ‚Äúyou have to show up and do work.‚Äù Wound up loving the professor
8066,"I can‚Äôt stress how important positive reviews are. I picked one teacher over another because she had amazing positive reviews and she ended up being the best professor I‚Äôve had so far. Her lectures were incredibly engaging, the workload of the class was not difficult at all, and I‚Äôm ending the semester with a 99% in a gen ed class I had never taken before."
8067,"They still need to hear the truth though. I've always believed that there is so such thing as a bad teacher, just not the right teacher for you. My Eng Comp II prof changed that this semester, so you can bet your ass that he's going to get an honest review on just how shitty a teacher and how shitty a person he is."
8068,I took a class with an exceptionally awful professor this semester who would give us surprise exams. Had to drop the class unfortunately and left a scathing review on rate my professor as that is really the worst thing I could do to get back at her. Hopefully others see what I wrote and save themselves the hassle that I had to experience.
8069,"Right a person rated a professor low bc there was no formula sheet in calculus. There has never been a formula sheet. It‚Äôs the rule of the department, that‚Äôs not a reason to leave a bad review."
8070,"Tbf, In college it's a huge gamble whether 'doing poorly in a class' = Crappy student or Crappy professor.  I found the latter to be true so I stay away from professors with low ratings."
8071,"The second bullet on my syllabus is now: ""There will be a lot of writing. This is a writing class."""
8072,"They really need to do away with that, or make them much longer. Hard to write a useful review in those few characters."
8073,"To be fair some people are liars though, one of the best professors have right now. FIY, my school makes us to evaluations on the professors and courses. My professor mentions one of the criticism she got which was the dumbest thing was ""she talks too much about her horses"". She doesn't own a horse. She made a comment it was probably someone who only show up for one day and written her off as a bad educator because of it. I think you should trust people you deem trustable for their opinions because they won't lie because of their dislike of the professor. EDIT: Also don't write anything that you are afraid to say face to face. So don't be a dick about your reviews if you don't have the balls to own up to what you wrote online."
8074,They limit the # of characters per post which sucks because sometimes you do want to get into nitty gritty but run out of characters
8075,"Please give a rating no matter the quality of your professor! 

I have found that nearly all of the reviews on RateMyProfessor are incredibly negative, regardless of the actual quality of their teaching. If you have a average, good, great, or exceptional professor, plEASE write a review. It helps to make the site more indicative of the actual quality of teaching."
8076,Reminds me of all the arguments I heard between my family during online classes in the first year of college. Always had to have my zoom on mute cause closing the door wouldn't stop the noise! üôâ
8077,"Didn‚Äôt know children that young can get married, let alone divorced"
8078,I‚Äôm so sorry
8079,"Oof. I live with a 5, 6, 8, and 9 year old so I definitely feel this."
8080,Doge
8081,Wow such loving environment
8082,"Been there, albeit not about divorce, but similar.

If you ever need help or wanna vent, DM's open. I know it's not easy at all."
8083,My parents are divorcing too and today I just saw our home on the facebook marketplace üòç
8084,One of my profs makes us have our microphones on during midterms so we can all hear weird sounds coming from everyone‚Äôs homes. Pretty funny but annoying
8085,My little brother was blowing a train whistle during one of my tests :)
8086,Maybe they just wanted to make sure you were wide awake for the exam lol ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
8087,"Im sorry OP. Thats a really bad situation and Im sure really frustrating. 

This isnt nearly the same, but maybe itll get a laugh. My dad woke up while I was doing my geography exam, I hadnt gotten the chance to tell him I was in an exam but I had a sign on my door. He walked through the halls singing somebody that I used to know at such a volume that Im sure the lockdown recording picked it up. Couldnt decide whether to bust out laughing or be a little upset at the volume lol."
8088,"I hope my parents split up when my mom caught my father cheating.

That man still lives here spreading toxicity and bad vibes :)))"
8089,After doing as suggested.. mildly irked I quoted a meme without realizing.
8090,Damn I wish I had parents
8091,Virtual exams stressful enough but adding to the fact you had to do it in your living room or something I wish you good luck man
8092,"I had a recorded chem exam a while back, and they were fighting, and I'm pretty sure you could hear it in the recording. I feel your pain."
8093,I have no idea what that means.. I merely have legit lived the life the OP described so I dipped into Ultimate Sarcasm and that comment came out. ü§£
8094,i had a built in mute button on my mic
8095,"I feel you man I'm tired of emailing professors that I had to turn off my camera and mic in exams because of live-action domestic violence. 

Hope our toxic fathers get kicked outta here real soon :)))"
8096,Just search your complete comment on Google.
8097,I'm sorry. I'm going through something similar. You can DM if you want
8098,Definitely made me miss boarding school where I can just skip out on stuff like this.
8099,"I feel you, except that was me in high school pre online classes. I moved states away for college so I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with that. They‚Äôre divorced now. 

I hope you still did good on your midterm! It gets better, really it does."
8100,i‚Äôm sure you aced it in that perfect testing environment! we love a loving family.
8101,"hey brotha man, shoot me a chat if you need to vent or whatever Im always glad to listen. Or if its anything history, english or philosophy related Id be willing to help with whatever you‚Äôre working on. Take it easy"
8102,"My roommate had a job interview the other day. Right when he was wrapping up, roommate 2 nearly cuts his finger off and starts screaming call 911 at the top of his lungs RIGHT outside of his door. Needless to say he did not get a follow up interview."
8103,"An award for you, this made me laugh üòÇ"
8104,Sorry to hear that
8105,"luckily noüòç but once I was in an important meeting and my mom barged in and started yelling at me, the ppl in the zoom have treated me wayyy to nicely ever since üò≠"
8106,"I felt like this all the way through undergrad. Now I'm in postgrad and I still feel like this. Despite all the cramming, I'm actually shocked how much I've retained. I've found that even if I don't remember specific details, I know the general concepts well enough that I can just do a brief review and it comes back easily if I need to revisit a subject. YMMV but I've found that it apparently works for me, so I've stopped stressing about the fact that I'm behind and just do my thing."
8107,"I definitely feel this. My gpa is great and my grades aren‚Äôt too bad either but I feel like, especially during online learning, I‚Äôm not learning anything. For example, I‚Äôve been busy all week so today I crammed in all of my assignments. I made pretty good grades on all of them and my avg for the classes won‚Äôt go down much but I didn‚Äôt learn anything at all."
8108,Also same. Haven't learned a thing and work is always finished last minute but still sitting on good grades.
8109,"This is super normal and it‚Äôs actually a well-known phenomenon in education literature. It‚Äôs basically impossible to judge how much you‚Äôre learning while you‚Äôre in the midst of a class, it‚Äôs not till years later that you can reflect on how much you learned and grew.

You‚Äôre doing great, and that‚Äôs why your GPA is high. Keep up the good work!!"
8110,Same holy shit
8111,"Bro reverse for me, was at a 92 now a 70, exam kicked my ass."
8112,"C's get degrees my friend. Unless you're in medschool, then good luck"
8113,"Yes, especially this year, my school completely changed how our classes work so now instead of taking multiple classes at a time over the whole semester we take one at a time for ~3.5 weeks, the level of content is crazy so I find myself cherry picking readings for the answers I need and prioritizing only what‚Äôs graded, I got an A in my first class but definitely missed out on a lot of the real takeaways by just doing what‚Äôs needed"
8114,"Amen to that. I wish I simply cared about just passing, maybe I'd be more sane today. I think I aimed for good grades because I wanted to make up for not caring in my youth... and to make a point that I can do well despite what all the haters in my life have said (long story)."
8115,"I‚Äôm exactly like this. I‚Äôm a senior and have a 3.9 gpa but ask me what I‚Äôve learned in college so far...???? 

I just do the work. I don‚Äôt necessarily retain all the information I should. And like you, when a professor says ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt write this paper last minute,‚Äù I write it the night before and get an A. And that‚Äôs more stressful than If I had worked on it for several days. 

As far as emailing the professor, I never do. If I need extra help, I read the textbook or watch YouTube videos. On some occasions I‚Äôve hired a private tutor. I just don‚Äôt want the prof to know I‚Äôm winging it or they might subconsciously grade my work harsher. Like ‚Äúoh, I know sloth wrote this paper last night because that‚Äôs how she did the last one. It‚Äôs probably bad‚Äù and then find errors they wouldn‚Äôt notice otherwise"
8116,This is me haha. My gpa is near perfect but it always feels like I'm faking it or I'm not learning enough bc I can't recall nitty gritty details. But honestly part of it is imposter syndrome. I always fall behind towards the end of the term and go crazy studying wise. However I realize I actually retain most of the big concept ideas pretty clearly so you could be in the same boat. I feel like all we can do is alter our studying habits and not be so hard on ourselves
8117,"This makes me feel 100 times better about my life, cuz this is how I feel very often! Thank you! Your words have helped me."
8118,Thank you all for voicing this today lol. I needed this.
8119,"Yeah I swear everytime a professor says ""you can't do this assignment last minute my brain instantly says ""challenge accepted"".  Last winter I coded an entire game for my software development class in 2 days when he gave us the assignment a month prior..."
8120,"Yup, same here + the not wanting to blame it on mental illness. I've been thinking of reaching out to my professors despite me having great grades, but most of the time I feel like an attention seeker if I do, so I don't lol. Glad to know I'm not the only one."
8121,"It sucks. My school has a winter term where you can cram in up to 2 classes in 3.5 weeks. You don‚Äôt learn anything, you just do the work. I took an intro to marketing class during the winter term and I now have absolutely no idea what marketing is. You don‚Äôt retain any information because you don‚Äôt have time to really digest it or even practice it. You move from one concept to the next very quickly."
8122,What was the structure for your 3.5 weeks class like? Summer classes are typically 5 weeks here and you usually take one or two so they‚Äôre more like nuisances in the summer than actual classes and  you rarely retain anything you learned. I‚Äôve taken 4 classes a semester since high school so college is similar. It‚Äôd be interesting to just focus on one class at the time.
8123,"This reminds me of one really incredible high school teacher I had. I always got out of class like ""well I learned absolutely nothing"" but then I'd look at the study guides before the tests like ""Wait how do I know all this stuff?? Pretty sure I didn't know any of this before????""

To this day I have no idea how I learned the complexities of aerobic respiration by sitting through 10 minutes of entertaining lecture followed by 40 minutes of coloring stuff, doing weird puzzles/activities, and watching goofy videos. She set up a murder scene with some fellow teachers and had us solve it, learning all kinds of stuff along the way about the human body without us realizing we were actually learning any course content. She's a genius"
8124,I feel you on that. I got a job that has absolutely nothing to do with my degree. I plan on staying at that job because I love the work and company but I'm still going for high grades because it's something I take pride in.
8125,"I feel this so hard, but especially in my Spanish classes. I have a Spanish language minor and I think language learning is so so awesome, but I skipped a year of it in high school and that totally fucked up my skill levels. My grades hold up because reading and writing comes naturally to me, but I am with to my prof every chance I get just having normal conversations but in Spanish to work on listening and speaking. 

So yes, I would say going to them does help. They usually understand what you mean by this because they were students too"
8126,"Yeah I've always said to take summer/winter classes in stuff you don't care about retaining, so no major specific stuff and no classes that will be built upon later. They're great for gen-eds, but I wouldn't recommend it for important classes. Its too much information to remember in such a short period of time, because it's supposed to take a whole semester to learn it. I recommend it for gen-eds that are gonna bore the shit out of you, so you can get it over with in a month instead of a spreading it out. 

I also used to say a lot of that about online classes..."
8127,"Yes! I did this my first year through a bunch of algorithms classes at my university. Managed to pull a 3.8 as an average, but I still regret doing so, and I spent the summer studying up on everything else because algorithms are an important concept to grasp. IMO, if the coursework seems like it will seem helpful to know or understand, I would just count your blessings that you got an A, and then run through some of the most important parts. It helps me feel less shitty about myself and also, I learned some valuable stuff too."
8128,lol I wish I had this problem da fuqqqq take that good grade and keep it pushin
8129,"I wouldn't worry too much. To be honest, I stopped doing assigned readings by sophomore year and I still graduated with a high GPA. I just meticulously took notes during class, did my assignments, and read when I had to ( for papers). Especially with everything being online I would  take notes before class, if the professor posts slides before hand, and then add notations to it during class with info that wasn't in the slides.
You just have to figure out what studying style works best for you. I found that reading material wasn't very useful so I didn't want to waste a lot of time on it."
8130,Yes. I have a 3.9 GPA and never know what‚Äôs going on in any of my courses ( especially now that everything‚Äôs online)
8131,"Exactly. I had like 5 weeks to write a 12-15 page paper on The Hunger Games, but watched the first 2 movies again the day prior, and wrote that paper and a 5-8 page paper all in the same day the night it‚Äôs due lol. I also once had ‚Äúwork at your own pace‚Äù college classes, and had to get 3 of them done by the end of the 2 Month period. I got them all done in the last 9 days lol. The academic advisor was impressed but also annoyed that I didn‚Äôt show that effort earlier lol. The firefighter arson scenario at its finest."
8132,"I honestly feel that at this point, professors assign more readings than what is reasonably understandable to keep up with. I‚Äôm a senior, and for me it seems each year professors have progressively gotten worse with relying on textbook material as a foundation for the course. Just read what is absolutely necessary, skim what you can and pay attention in class and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôve actually learned a lot more than you think you have."
8133,"are you actually me?!?! i‚Äôve felt this literally since high school and i cannot BELIEVE i‚Äôve finally seen the feeling put into words!! when your gpa is great and teachers love you but you‚Äôve retained zilch, the imposter syndrome is so so brutal.

zoom university only makes this exponentially worse. i feel so scattered with deadlines and readings only being given to me through a screen...combined with * gestures at everything * it‚Äôs just absolute hell.

sending you all my best vibes, pal. you‚Äôre so not alone and you can totally do this !!!!"
8134,Omg same. I have a good GPA but I always feel like it could be so much better if I didn't fall behind so much and actually did things on time. Ugh!
8135,That‚Äôs pretty much life. On the job you‚Äôll be winging stuff on a day to day basis.
8136,I really second that last point. I feel like the experience I got out of some classes was more about how to do well and be successful than learning the content. Some classes are just set up in a way where conventional studying habits and knowing all of the content is not actually how to be successful in that course. Being able to adapt to this kind of thing is the key to being successful in such a course. 
8137,"It‚Äôll bite the in the ass very soon. Stay in your lane in this case, TRUST ME, the rewards are greater for you. I was like you, and once I got my ish together, everything fell into place nicely. I‚Äôm much more successful now, and you will too. Keep grinding!!:)"
8138,"Tbh, if it‚Äôs for classes you don‚Äôt necessarily need for your major, idc. My friend aced their history course by cheating, but never cheated for classes on their major. 
I‚Äôm in Accounting and if I saw someone cheating in there, then yeah I‚Äôd get pissed. "
8139,This is true. Grades arent even an accurate representation of how much someone knows or how capable they are.
8140,"You still need to maintain a certain GPA for a lot of things. For example, in the state of MA where I am, it‚Äôs required for teachers to go back to school for a masters degree. You need to graduate with a GPA of 2.7 and no less, no exceptions, in order to be considered for a graduate studies program. Let‚Äôs not forget being eligible for certain programs while still pursuing an undergraduate degree, depending on the university. 

You‚Äôre right, grades aren‚Äôt accurate in demonstrating academic drive/rigor, but they sure are important in most instances. "
8141,"Yea, the gen eds. Just do whatever you want to get the A. Most of those classes are just money grabs, they say its to be ""well-rounded"" but I didnt learn anything more in those classes than already learned in high school.

Cheating in major classes though? Your just setting yourself up for a bad time."
8142,"Unfortunately, employers *are* interested in your grades even if you‚Äôre not."
8143,[deleted]
8144,"At my university, the entire group of final-year law students (we have undergrad law) conspired to share the exam answers before their final exam.

Someone who got the message turned them in, so they were caught.

They didn't just receive a failed grade for that one class. Because the cheating ring was so widespread, it meant that their concurrent and previous grades were called into doubt as well, so they retroactively failed every single course they'd ever taken. All four years of (probably) hard work was wiped away and *then* the university gave their transcript the ""cheaters' mark"". That means that any other university they ever apply to will know they were failed across the board for cheating, and probably won't accept them. It's not likely they would ever be accepted to a law program ever again, plus their GPAs are 0 now.

Our degrees have to mean something, and so any time someone is caught cheating, the automatic punishment is failing every single class that semester with the cheaters' mark. More serious cheating gets a more serious punishment."
8145,"When I was in college that would have driven me nuts too.  And you have every right to be furious.  A lot of the other comments here are playing the ""it'll bite them in the ass"" or ""you're in college to learn and grades don't matter"".  And in some respects that's true.  A person putting in the work will get more out of the experience.    But college isn't just a learning experience in today's society.  A college degree is the cost of entry into almost any full time job, whether you learned anything or not.  And when you get out of college, your prospective employers will absolutely look at your GPA and request your transcripts.  They will then judge your resume against the very people whom you're so frustrated with.  And before they even call you and talk to you to find out if you know anything, they will put your resume on the bottom of the pile.

They aren't doing that because they believe that GPA is the be all end all, but because when you're filtering thousands of applicants, you have to filter down somewhere.  And companies rightly-or-wrongly assume that an accredited University will have an honor code and enforce it to filter out cheats.   And so they may hire someone who doesn't know as much as you, but got the same degree, and had a better GPA, which companies are more or less forced to use as a surrogate for capability.   If you're lucky, they'll look at your course by course grades in your transcripts and realize you performed well in those classes, but if your classmates are cheating in general classes, they're probably cheating in major classes too, so they'll still look better on paper.   If you're unlucky, they'll hire them before even interviewing you.  They'll then get the on-the-job training that they need to do the job, and by the time the employer realizes the person is incompetent, they're either trained enough that they find something they can do anyways, or fire them and learn that your University graduates people that don't know anything.

The academic honor code is what ensures that your degree has value.  If cheating is rampant and obvious, you need to report it.  To your professors.  To your department chair.  To the ethics office.  Anonymously if possible, but with persistence if not.  If you allow the grades that you're judged against to be knowingly diluted with cheating and allow them to unlevel the playing field, you're hurting yourself as surely as they're hurting the integrity of your institution.  It may be hard to report people, particularly if they're friends, but academia is the ultimate situation in which you are judged against your peers, and like it or not, that judgement is predominantly based on grades.  So you really have to decide if their friendship is worth letting them get away with cheating that system."
8146,"Then it's your responsibility to find a way around that. It will very likely mean doing things differently to how you are ""supposed"" to.

Learning styles aren't really a thing, but your mix of learning preferences certainly is. 

 - If you know you have difficulty focusing then you'll have to start work earlier than others. 

 - If it's bad enough to impact your grades, then you should have disability accommodations. 

 - Have a set place that you use for work and work alone. Don't try to study in bed or at the desk you play video games at. Have a series of actions you go through before every study/work session to prime your brain. Try to make these things that you can also do for an exam, i.e. headphones and music may not be a good idea.

 - Have everything organized before you start so you're not constantly getting up or changing track. You'll forget what you're doing and then it'll be 3 hours later and you're vacuuming the kitchen. 

 - Live your life by a to-do list and rough schedule. Organizing your time to specific hours or minutes probably won't work, but at least have a rough plan for the day and be realistic about it. Lower your expectations to ensure you will meet them. Don't set goals too lofty. 

Your study hours will seem inflated if you're actually spending very little of it studying. If you have ADHD, you probably can't plan out blocks of study time but will instead need to intersperse it with other things. Try to sit down for 5 hours and you're still only going to do a total of 30-60 minutes of actual study. "
8147,"I‚Äôm a professor and I research student success. I‚Äôll tell you for a certainty that these people don‚Äôt win in the long run. It may seem that way, and they may get away with dishonesty or laziness sometimes, but life and decisions catch up with you. My specific area of expertise is health-allied majors. There tends to be a comeuppance at some point in a lazy student‚Äôs journey. Sometimes it‚Äôs after college when they‚Äôre coworkers and supervisors know them for what they are.  

It‚Äôs also important to remember that cheaters very often lie about their grades- I‚Äôve heard knuckleheads bragging about how well they did on an exam before or after class and I know full well they did horribly. 

I‚Äôll also point out that I don‚Äôt broadcast what I think of a student or when I know they‚Äôre cheating/phoning it in. So to other students it may seem I don‚Äôt care. Quite the opposite- behind closed doors and in the gradebook I can make sure things remain fair. But professionalism has to be maintained.

Edit: I‚Äôm seeing in other replies that people want to know how these thing bite the cheaters in the ass. The first example that comes to mind is licensure exams. Imagine spending years in college and your gpa looking great but you can‚Äôt pass licensure because you didn‚Äôt actually learn. That‚Äôs years of wasted time and money with nothing to show for it."
8148,"Not saying OP has a learning disability, but people with learning disabilities can have more trouble with studying; I have ADHD and it makes everything so much harder. There are days where I am just hyperfocused and everything clicks and is super simple, and then there are days when the exact same content can make absolutely no sense and I can't seem to put the pieces together or make sense of it. "
8149,[deleted]
8150,"If every single cheater who is caught is a ""dumb cheater"" and doesn't count as an example of cheating biting them in the ass, then it's literally impossible to prove what you're asking for. You're setting the definition of a ""cheater"" to be someone who is never caught and never sees any ramifications. 

All cheaters are pretty dumb. Cheating in any way that isn't dumb requires a lot of effort, and if they're putting in that much effort then they must be truly terrible at learning because it'd be easier to dedicate that effort to study. "
8151,"It's pretty discouraging. I took the final for this intro level class last semester that was pretty easy, all you had to do was study the powerpoints from the lectures before the exam and you'd get at least a B-. Yet all throughout the exam, everyone in the room (lecture hall with \~300 students) was talking out loud to each other (not even whispering) as they did the problems. As in, you literally had kids turning around in their seats asking the people around them for the answers. Two professors were there, but I guess they didn't give enough of a shit to tell them to stop.

 This is at a pretty expensive private college. I just sat there the whole time thinking ""What the fuck is this? What am I doing here?"""

8153,"Yeah, exactly. I was so upset when I found out I‚Äôd have to take art and history, it‚Äôs just excessive loans lol"
8154,"I know people who haven't read anything all semester, and when test time comes I just give them some summaries I made of every chapter in the textbook. It doesn't hurt me and I don't care if they are just starting to do their work when test time comes. It's whatever. It's not like I'm a saint and above being lazy sometimes plus I'll usually get help for other classes in return.

Some people see college as place to be challenged and to learn, others see it as something to get done by any means necessary. I don't condone cheating as I don't do it, but I don't get bothered if someone else does it. 

Just focus on yourself and not on what others do. Is it fair? Nah. But neither is life."
8155,"Or consider if this is even something you should be doing. It sucks but people are all not equal and you may not be able to do the work asked if you for that field.

I had a friend in undergrad who was dead set on becoming a surgeon. Poor kid couldn‚Äôt even pass basic biology or chemistry even after dedicating 20+ hours per week solely to this classes. He would never go out, never do anything fun and was in the library consistently from breakfast to 10pm. Weekends too. He just didn‚Äôt have what it takes to do well in that field."
8156,"i have not found this it be the case in CS 

you might have a 3.5 but your still taking the coding challenge and if the guy with a 2.5 beats you, that looks better than your gpa"
8157,Looks like you need to start getting nervous about your grades a little earlier in the semester...
8158,Exactly why I‚Äôd get pissed if people cheated on their major classes üíÄ

8161,"I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs okay in them too. I see it like this. They may be useless but we‚Äôre all paying a boatload of money for them and we all have to follow the same requirements. In some of them they take more work than core classes. Obviously that‚Äôs a bigger problem but it‚Äôs an insult to cheat when there are people taking all their classes seriously because they know they need it to get that degree. I mean some people have to literally pay for a petition to graduate. Sure you can cry about having to do that, but again that‚Äôs how colleges make your money and it‚Äôs the game you have to play to be able to put a diploma on the wall. "
8162,"In my botany class a few weeks ago, one girls phone went off during the test and it was a computerized voice that started reading definitions and answers to her. 

She was looking up all the answers and the accidently pressed the speaker button.

It went on for a good 30 seconds cause she dropped it.

She said sorry and then finished her test.
Prof. Never even looked up."
8163,">You're literally admitting that cheaters do not get punished in life just for being cheaters.

... life isn't some cosmic force of morality. Karma doesn't *actually* exist and the only ramifications for cheating are going to be imposed by other people when they get caught, either caught in the act or caught out by their lack of knowledge and utter mediocrity. 

>There are cheaters that never get caught and therefore thrive.

That's like saying that there are murderers or thieves who never get caught and therefore murderers and thieves who do not get caught do not get punished in life. Yeah, the mafia boss who doesn't go to jail is gonna thrive. But that doesn't change the fact that you risk getting caught if you engage in that behaviour, that it's socially unacceptable, and that it can have far-reaching negative impacts on the community as a whole. "
8164,"Jesus, this isn't difficult.  The entire premise of ""snitches get stitches"" is horse shit.

I would record them talking about their cheating and their methods and then go and report them.

Why?

Example:  I remember working for a forensics firm early in my career.  I am a military veteran and I have a high work ethic and know from my training that if I did not operate to the best of my abilities that people could die.  I bring that with me to every job.

I had to work with a guy, we'll call him 'Ruben' who would kiss ass and brown nose his way through the work day.  He was substandard in his work, but boy did he love going to the gym.  He was really great at time management:

When to take his supplements, when to eat, when to hit the gym, and what to do at the gym for that day's training.

'Ruben' was promoted to my level. Partly because the upper management loved his pillow talk (they had no boots on the ground) but mostly because he was ineffective at assisting clients, maintaining chain of custody on evidence, not causing spoliation of said evidence, and was just a shit head socially.

At first, since he was made my problem I would monitor him and then try to mentor him.  As I said, he had great time management skills - only great when they benefited him directly.  I tried to harness those skills to turn him into a bad ass forensic analyst.

3 months in and I was able to prove through reporting and his time sheet that he was doing next to no work. I kept the coaching going and tried to encourage him, however I now babysat him.  Hourly.  He had racked up some hefty charges for the company for mishandling data and not doing the basic things like notifying customers of data was received.  (Note: at this point I think he was stuffing one of the upper management ladies.  I was undeterred as she had made a move on me while working with the RCMP a year prior [she was in my hotel room while I was out to dinner. I took a picture of her when my buddy and I got back. She said she wanted a cigarette, I told her to get out of my room.])

After 6 months he was doing only what I assigned him and he was deeply hating me.  He reported up the chain and to HR that I was making work a hostile environment for him.  We had a meeting with myself, HR, and Ruben which also included my manager and the lady from upper mgmt that he was screwing.  I was told to back off.  I was also told that there would be an investigation and that the meeting would reconvene after that was complete.

As soon as we were back to our area, 'Ruben' turned to me and said ""Yeah, that's right. You don't get to tell me shit anymore. Have fun doing all the work, bitch.""

I set my phone to record (it was already in my lap) and spun my chair and said ""What did you just say?""  and the dumbass repeated himself adding ""I have better things to do than the daily bullshit anyway. I can do what I want, just ask (upper mgmt he was screwing). So MERRR!""

He always made that stupid sound effect to try and sound funny.  I just said ""Okay, Ruben.""  Spun around, saved the recording and sent it to my work email and personal email and then saved that off to a hard drive.

Two weeks later the head of HR came all the way from NY to weigh in. I had brought all of my reporting (my work vs his work - the amount he had already cost the business, the audio, as well as the time entry records for both of us).

I was interviewed alone a final time, and nothing felt better than ratting that sonofabitch out to the head of HR.  I showed her everything, wrote the timeline on the whiteboard for her, and explained in great detail how he was nothing but a slow burn on the business and was having a work affair to boot.

Playing the audio was icing on the cake.  HR's eyes were so wide I almost laughed out loud.  Almost.

Since this was HR I don't know what else she had, however she did say that there was a specific complain about me (by guess who) of which I shared the RCMP pictures and story and my friend (who no longer worked there) was very willing to talk to her about it.  I was thanked and that was all I heard about it formally.

In a week, both of them were let go. The faces on them when they were escorted off the property by security were amazing.  And they totally blamed me. 

Especially because of the nasty-grams they both sent me.  Awesome to read.

So please, if you know someone who is cheating - please rat them out.  You are not here to do someone else's work for them and earn them a grade, or a paycheck, or anything. You are here for you.  If they are cheating the system they are indeed cheating you as well.

Think about it this way - these are the people who are going to be helping to run the country or taking care of their elders when the time comes. Do you want some lazy assholes around forcing YOU to have all the responsibility? 

Or do you want people that are going to do their fair share?

Rat out cheaters folks.  Don't give someone a free ride you worked hard for."

8166,"Is it possible for you to take the class through a different university and transfer the credit over by the end of the semester? I‚Äôve had to do this before, but it was a 100 level class, which I assume is not the level class you are taking."
8167,This feels like a very incomplete story or a fictional story.
8168,"This.

the last class i needed to get my undergrad degree only had 3 students enrolled in it.. they only offered it because i needed it to graduate.

it‚Äôs surprising to me they won‚Äôt allow you to enroll/didn‚Äôt give you priority considering you needed it"
8169,Does not make sense.
8170,"OP: If you go this route you‚Äôll almost certainly need a waiver from your dean. If this is for summer or fall, the time to ask is now. This does mean you‚Äôll have to apply to, and be accepted at, another school. If this is an elective style course you‚Äôre likely to find anywhere, take it at a community college. It‚Äôs cheaper and they have an almost universal acceptance rate."
8171,"nope, this might be UCF. Big universities are literally trash. My major had 4 different advisors in my 3 years there."
8172,"Many universities require that your last handful of credits (it‚Äôs 30 at my university) are taken on site and cannot be transferred. So if you go this route, OP, make sure you look into the rules."
8173,"That's odd... typically schools will give registration priority to students who are closer to graduation over students who still have more classes to complete.

If you just have a single class to complete, you ought to have been allowed to register for classes super-early before the class and wait-lists filled up.  Unless all 120 students ahead of you are also 1 class away from graduation?  Did you get priority registration?  Did you try to sign up for the class as soon as your registration window opened, or did you wait to register?

I'd suggest talking to the registrar and seeing if they can enroll you in the course early for next semester, etc.  Before general registration even opens.

What is the class?  Is it like a ""senior thesis"" course, or is it a lower division general ed?"
8174,"Join the wait list if they have one and check the class every day to see if someone drops it. Contact the professor of that class as well. A week into the class sometimes people drop the class, see if you can join then by talking with the professor."
8175,"Not all. This sounds like a UCLA thing, etc.

I go to a big school, UVA, and they are very very good about opening spots if folks need to graduate."
8176,"Something doesn't add up here... did you miss registration by a few hours? Seniors get priority when registering for classes to try to avoid these exact issues. I can't believe that your advisor would tell you to change majors over 1 class, mine would try his hardest to squeeze me into the class if I was in this situation. 

If the dean is ignoring your emails, try emailing your schools retention coordinator, they are great people to know and can help you because it's literally their job to keep students on track for graduation."
8177,My friend walked without realizing she had 2 classes left. She was able to take those two classes during summr and recieved her diploma in summer.
8178,"The waitlist is also full. The class has 50 spots (full). Waitlist has (70 spots) but also full.....

The professor has no problem taking me into the class but she isn‚Äôt allowed to. It‚Äôs a big university and professor has 0 power. Everything is hierarchical and centralized"
8179,"My school gave priority to seniors about to graduate. Sorry about this situation, sheesh"
8180,I think the mods need to consider banning or heavily moderating these ‚Äústory‚Äù posts. Half of them are BS and the other half are from people that are too chicken shit to just go to the department head or the dean. They are adding nothing to the subreddit.
8181,How the hell do people not know what classes they need? I check like 4 times a semester lol
8182,You're still not answering some of the key questions. Are you not given priority during class registration? Things aren't adding up here. In our school (also a big public school) you also apply for graduation a semester before. Have you done that?
8183,"Ah ha, there is it. Your advisor isn't telling you to change your major, they suggested a different track within your major. There is a huge difference there!

While I'm not in CS, I do have a PhD in a STEM field. In my experience, no one really cares what your official degree is called. When applying for jobs/positions, just call your degree a Computational Math degree with a strong focus in CS on your cover letters. It honestly doesn't change anything about you as a person."
8184,"Sure, I could believe the bad rules... in isolation. But not the bad rules, the advisor that just says ""change majors"", the dean that doesn't reply, the poor family with no financial aid, AND the school being a top-ranked US school.  


The student is not a stats major because they are spinning a yarn with nearly a dozen unlikely events all in a row. Without a lot more information, I don't believe this story."
8185,"probably ""I was just going by what my advisor told me""

Can you tell I've been screwed over by the college advisors in the past?"
8186,[deleted]
8187,"You can't go straight to the dean if you haven't worked your way up yet. Contact the program director and department head. If they ignore you, then you'll have a strong argument for the dean."
8188,Really? Because I know people directly who weren‚Äôt able to get classes there they needed to graduate and the school didn‚Äôt give a damn.
8189,"you're leaving something out here, because if its really the last class you need to graduate you should have had priority registration to sign up much in advance. Also doesn't make sense for any advisor to say that, along with emailing the dean (of the college? the university?)"
8190,"Yeah, graduate rates/degree completion are pretty important to schools. I don‚Äôt buy that an advisor would tell a fifth-year student to change majors over one class."
8191,"I was a poor student at the University of Michigan for my undergrad. I'm pretty sure Michigan accepts FAFSA.  


Every school allows students to change majors. You're honestly trying to tell me a school has a class required for graduation that is hard-capped at 50 per semester, it is taught in both the fall and the spring semester, and yet the department has well over 100 students trying to graduate a year? I honestly don't believe that for a hot second. There are layers of curriculum committees and admin that would flag and correct that problem.  


What else is there to this story?"
8192,"I‚Äôm not sure how all schools are, but I go to one of the largest schools in my state and there‚Äôs probably 6 or 7 advisors for the business school alone. I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs assigned to one advisor, you just book an appointment for the one you prefer or whoever is available first."
8193,[deleted]
8194,Exactly. 75% of people need to be told to take a deep breath and go write an email. The other 25% are just whining and can‚Äôt be helped. r/CollegeRant exists for a reason...
8195,I faced a similar situation (the clas I needed wasn‚Äôt offered in my last two semesters). I was able to do an independent study with a professor to cover the course requirements.
8196,"Amazing! Well done on your hard work in college and in your personal life. You should be very proud. 

And that GPA too? Incredible. Keep it up! :)"
8197,You‚Äôll be an amazing accountant! Good luck!
8198,I‚Äôm doing a BA (bachelor of arts) in accounting :D Fun to find other accounting majors out there!
8199,Thank you for your kind words!
8200,"Nice!!! I just finished principles of financial accounting, still have 3 accounting classes I need before transferring and taking the dreaded intermediate courses lol. 

How far are you in your degree??"

8208,"Amazing!,"
8209,I left community college with a 2.2 GPA and one of my last classes was physics which I failed. Do you think an Engineering degree would be possible if I gave it my all?
8210,"Hey my friend, honestly just go in with an open mind, participate in class, and just do all your homework and actually read the chapters/watch videos integrated with your course and you'll be fine.

Like seriously, I was one move away from prison and a criminal record, (not a bad person, never hurt anyone, I just had drugs in my pocket) 

I promise you, you can do this. I'm not a genius by any means, but I will say I'm a hard worker.

What really makes a difference IMO is if on say friday or saturday night, you have homework or important studying to do, stay home and do what you need to do.

Bars and parties will always be there, don't worry about that stuff right now and make school your #1 priority and you will be fine.

Wish you the best of luck."
8211,"I left with a 1.71 in 2013.

This semester brought my cumulative up to 2.70 as one course was replaced.

It's definitely possible if you give it your all.

A year ago I was pouring concrete for money. Literally went from a construction worker who was out of school for 8 years to a great semester.

If you honestly give it your all, and seek help if you need it, you can do it."
8212,Congrats I'm happy for you. I as well have been through some rough times and decided to bet on myself. I'll be returning to college in the fall. It really helps to know there's others out there who struggled but now are doing just fine back in school. ‚ù§Ô∏è
8213,"Wow. I dropped out of college when I was 17-18 after turning alcoholic. I am 21 now and still haven't achieved anything in life. I keep starting to think maybe a job or education isn't for me, even after people told me how incredibly clever I am all my life.

You inspire me to give it a shot though. Thank you, and congratulations"
8214,That's fucking awesome. Good job.
8215,"I had a bad habit of getting baked and not going to my classes too. I still did the work, but I think I would‚Äôve put more effort in if I had participated more. I‚Äôm hoping I can get aid this year so I can go back. I‚Äôm prepared to take it seriously now. Covid has made me realize how much I took collective campus resources for granted"
8216,I‚Äôm finished with managerial accounting (the class after financial accounting) and taking the first intermediate class next term. I‚Äôve also taken management information systems (might be called something similar at other schools)
8217,"Really?? My cpa uncle told me intermediate was the most challenging and that advanced accounting tied everything together for him. 

Appreciate that though, I'm either doing managerial or federal taxes 1 in the fall. (Depending on what my advisors suggest)"
8218,"Yeah for me that's the class after managerial but before federal taxes 1

After federal taxes 1 I transfer to a local 4 year uni and I'd assume start intermediate."
8219,Congrats! I hope to succeed as well :)
8220,Congratulations for doing so well despite what happened! You've totally earned it!
8221,I dropped out of college cause of a girl who broke up with me less than 6 months after I made that decision. I really wanna go back this fall and I‚Äôm about to do my FAFSA
8222,I‚Äôm going back for the first time this September. Thanks for posting this.
8223,I had a 0.76 üòåüòâü§´
8224,"gang shit, good job"
8225,Congratulations üéâ that‚Äôs really impressive
8226,I *just* got back a project that I turned in March 3rd. The grader graded us on concepts that we learned later after turning that project in. This class is a fucking mess.
8227,"My problem professor doesn‚Äôt even post lectures...
They also use the same slideshows for each lesson that are outdated with the current versions of software
They also carpet grade assignments with 100%‚Äôs regardless if it is right or wrong"
8228,It is really easy to miss a deadline update on Canvas when you're changing like 50 of them (the auto-adjustment never worked that well for me). But the whole syllabus is something else. It is not that hard to answer emails within a couple days. 14 days is nuts to me but seems fairly common.
8229,"It's not hard. Those people should be dismissed if possible, or pressured to improve. But tenured academics are, all too often not challenged or forced to do better."
8230,I have two classes with no grades and four weeks left. I literally have no idea how I‚Äôm standing.
8231,"See, I almost always take pity on professors. Part of me wants to go into that profession and I can only imagine how difficult it may be to juggle teaching multiple classes, having hundreds of students, and doing research or working more than one gig. But the professors I love the most have a lot on their plate and thus are extremely lenient with us cause they get it. 

I will never understand professors who take forever to do the bare minimum and then have the audacity to be disappointed when we don't do their work exactly how and when they want."
8232,Having due dates on every assignment really helped me get through my biology 101 class. I would just go to the gradebook on canvas and click on the link thats due soon and complete it and move on with my day. And all the powerpoints were there and the lecture videos were proper
8233,I'm still waiting on grades for assignments submitted in January. It's infuriating.
8234,"Faculty here.  I can confirm the idea that ""ripping them a new one"" will without doubt lead to the evaluation being discarded without a second glance.  Nobody cares about evaluations that are so bad they sound like they were written by a crazy person.  By the same token, overly fawning evaluations such as ""omg best professor ever I loooooooooove Dr. So and So"" also get discarded as useless.

What we're looking for in a useful evaluation is *succinct* explanation of *concrete* things that were both good and bad about the class.

So if grading was too slow to be useful, then by all means put that on the evaluation.  But if you write a three paragraph diatribe about how horrible Professor So-and-So is, it's easy to dismiss the comments as coming from somebody with a grudge over a bad grade or whatever.

Guide for submitting an evaluation that will be read and taken seriously:

1. Keep your comments short and to the point.
2. Give concrete examples of what was good and/or bad.  Writing in generalities isn't useful.
3. Do not allow yourself to lapse into hysterics or unnecessary exaggerations.  If the professor was bad, it's absolutely fine to say it.  But if you phrase it in a hyperbolic way, it makes you seem untrustworthy or overly biased and increases the chance that you'll be ignored.
4. I strongly encourage you to avoid any mention of the professor's demographic characteristics (age, sex, etc.).  For instance, anyone who writes ""professor XYZ is too old and should retire"" will be ignored, because your average college student isn't competent to judge the suitability of someone with vastly more knowledge and experience.  Instead, specify the exact nature of the problem, e.g., ""Professor XYZ was not familiar with the online class management system and never managed to learn how to use it over the course of the semester.  That made it very hard for Professor XYZ to keep the class organized.""

So, as tempting as it is to use your evaluation to just vent a bunch of negative feelings, I urge you not to do so if you're interested in actually influencing things for the better."
8235,I‚Äôve not really had a problem with the emails they tend to reply pretty quickly. But yeah the the course syllabus has never changed. ‚ÄúPlease use the sign up sheet on the door to choose your project topic‚Äù oh ok I‚Äôll get right on that.
8236,"I see that all the time. 2020 dates on syllabus and schedules. It creates confusion and I missed one assignment because of that --- the due date was never clear. 

Had the accurate due date been shown, I'd never have missed it.

Later when I was just ready to start that assignment, I realized it was already past due."
8237,"Not if you don‚Äôt know how to spell grammar. Especially with the technology we have available, like Grammarly that you can literally install as an extension & fixes your grammar and spelling for you."
8238,We definitely are not!
8239,But you should be careful. Rip them too much and you‚Äôll look like an outlier. Some people just give terrible evaluations no matter what. Try to sound intelligent and keep it short.
8240,"Well, I've got news for you! Tenure is dead. Now, everyone, prepare to be taught by grad students and depressed, job-insecure adjuncts barely making minimum wage."
8241,"I also think required classes should be reduced, so professors have to teach classes students actually wanna take"
8242,Lol are we in the same class? ü§£ my professor is the exact same
8243,"I literally have a professor at the moment who removed recorded lectures with information from on our first two tests from canvas. These lectures were removed because apparently Canvas has a ‚Äúfile limit‚Äù and they had to remove some to add more in (This was right before our third test). I emailed and asked the professor if he would somehow put them back on canvas or by some other means so us the students could have them to prepare for a final (now is a week away). He didn‚Äôt respond for 4 days until I made a follow up email saying nicely that I really needed these lectures for the final. 
His response was ‚ÄúYour request is actually causing me a lot of work that I cannot complete until sometime next week. Thanks.‚Äù"
8244,[deleted]
8245,Yes! It‚Äôs 50/50 for me this semester. I have 3 amazing teachers and the other 2 make me teach myself.
8246,[deleted]
8247,Same. I have a teacher who hasn‚Äôt graded anything all semester.
8248,"I wish I got carpet grades like that. My professor has two GA (Graduate Assistants) who grade all the papers for him. I get knocked down to a 60% on most things for spelling, grammar, etc, even when I turn my shit in like a week or 2 in advance.

Academia is a joke."
8249,"This has been driving me crazy since even before COVID turned everything upside down. 

I get syllabuses with wrong dates/years, wrong class names, and totally inaccurate requirements. I had to email a professor this semester because he had 2 textbooks listed as required that weren't for our class, lab dates (there's no lab for this class so I was really freaked out when I read that one), and incorrect dates/assignments. 

They so clearly copy and paste or just reuse the same syllabus for every course. I get that they're busy, but so are we and **we are paying for a service**."
8250,"In my econ class this semester, the prof didn't grade a single homework until last weekend- it took more than half the semester to find out I've been getting Bs on all of them, so I'll only be able to improve on the last few assignments."
8251,My teacher last semester didn't upload half of the course and then just gave us all 100s for the stuff we never even saw. I emailed him 100s of times with no answer. I even emailed my advisor to ask what I should do. I'm going to college to learn and I feel like my time was wasted and especially feel like my money was wasted on his class.
8252,"Or when you write a final for a class that still hasn't returned a 30% research proposal report.... Ended up getting it 4 days after the exam .. Like gee thanks, what if someone wanted to drop the course if their proposal wasn't up to par? What would they do now once the deadline is far gone? But nah none of that matters, only students have to adhere to deadlines"
8253,We took a test the first week of March and have not received the grades yet. When asked the professor said ‚Äúthere were complications and they had to be regraded.‚Äù üßêüò§üôÑ
8254,"Didnt have to be quite so rude about it, but grammarly is dope."
8255,"I pay 3k per semester for my profs to barely do fucking anything. They don‚Äôt lecture for online, they don‚Äôt respond to emails, they don‚Äôt provide any instruction, just like wtaf"
8256,"There's no rush, you're in school. If you weren't in school or working and just being lazy then maybe but you're not. And it's not like you guys are 30 or anything. You're still young. (I'm 21) Honestly I would just enjoy while you can, once you graduate and move out and start your career it's gonna be stressful and you're gonna miss being able to just chill with friends."
8257,Lol right! üòÇ That's the part that the OP will miss the most when they're out on their own
8258,"I‚Äôm about to turn 24. It‚Äôs insane how different the lives of all my high school friends are right now. Some of them are married with kids. Some of them are still living with their parents, no job and no college plans. Some of them are halfway through a doctoral program and some didn‚Äôt make it this far at all. I think it‚Äôs just the nature of being in your 20s. I found it weird when some of my friends started getting pregnant and engaged, and distanced myself from them. Now I can barely stand to be around the friends who party and have no real plans in life. I gravitate towards the ones who are settled down, even if I miss the fun I used to have. It‚Äôs just a weird fucking age to be."
8259,"The breakfast part might just be a mom thing, her way of showing she loves having you all around and doing something nice. It‚Äôs not a sign of immaturity at all- in fact, I would be that if she did think it was bad, she wouldn‚Äôt have gone out of her way and done that for you. 

COVID has certainly made life‚Äôs milestones crazy as hell. Just try to relax, read the room, and if you feel like you/your friends are beginning to feel unwelcome, adjust."
8260,Not to mention the crippling student loan debt you have to start paying once you graduate üôÉ
8261,"Rent was dirt cheap when I was getting my first place - I moved out when I was still in high school and was pretty comfortable: $300/mo, utilities included; no lease, no deposit. Now I can barely afford the rent in my area as a grown-ass adult: $2000/mo, utilities not included, lease requirement, fat deposit, AND you're competing with a ton of other applicants so you're also dropping application fees left and right. 

I mean, in the 90's you could get a 3-bedroom in the Bay Area for $1500/mo - and *that* seemed expensive."
8262,"Oh, I feel that. I‚Äôm already $31,000 deep."
8263,"26 here. Still in school. Look, the economy isn't getting better for a while. Neither is the planet. In many less-wealthy nations, multi-generation housing is the norm. I don't think you're that far behind necesarrily, but if  you're getting bored Of getting high and playing video games, it can't hurt to try a new hobby!"
8264,"Right out of high school, one of my HS friends (we're both 24) had cancer, got married, and now has a one year old kid (I know she works but I don't know what she does). Another friend has a 5/6 year old and a job in the medical field. Another friend is still dating their HS boyfriend and living in our hometown and working.

I'm about to graduate college after bouncing to three different colleges and having no idea what to do. I still don't know where I'm going after this but at least I'll have a degree, I guess."
8265,Fr I don‚Äôt think my friends moms have made us breakfast since we were 14
8266,"I mean that is incredibly wholesome in and of itself. If my mom made breakfast for me and my friends, I'd be thrilled. Though you could do her a favor and maybe you guys could cook breakfast for her?   


Reminds me of the time this guy won a drinking contest after a hard night of partying, then got up early the next morning to cook breakfast for everyone at the party. Apparently what happens when the party person of the group is also the responsible person of the group."
8267,Enjoy it while you can. You don't always know when it's your last time

8269,"I knew a girl in college that was only 18, but she was already engaged and purchasing a house with her fiancee. It blew my mind and made me a little envious at the time. But now I realize that it's okay to be at different stages in your life. I love my mom and I enjoy living with her, just as she loves the fact that I am still around. There is no shame in feeling some amount of adoration for your parents. It's hard to break out of the nest these days. Just enjoy the present and don't worry too much about what people think, ya know?"
8270,I feel like the opposite. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm growing up too fast. I‚Äôm 20 and graduating with a bachelors this semester. I‚Äôve worked since I was 15 so I now own my own car and just got my first apartment. I‚Äôm going to have my first salary position in January where I‚Äôll technically be in charge of a lot of people. It all feels so fast and sudden. And none of my friends are where I‚Äôm at so it feels awkward. My friends can‚Äôt even visit my apartment because their parents don‚Äôt allow them to go out. And here I am on my own already and freaking out.
8271,"It‚Äôs weird because a year ago I would have agreed with you, but now I don‚Äôt and I think you should try and enjoy this while you can.

When I was 18 my priority was getting the hell out of my hometown and ditching my friends as I felt we were on different trajectories in life. I moved out, went to college in a different city for 4 years (6 hours from home), lived in the dorms for 2 years and in a different shitty living situation for years 3 & 4, and now I‚Äôm on my own at 22 with a full-time job (well, full-time
paid intern, but making decent money). 

I‚Äôm proud of myself and everything I‚Äôve accomplished, but it‚Äôs been a struggle. It was a slap in the face when I realized that hard work is rarely rewarded anymore. If you work hard than they just give you more work to do. I‚Äôve been an intern for a year and a half, and they keep extending instead of hiring me as an employee because of COVID which is understandable, but at this point I do the same work as everyone else does for a fraction of the salary. I lived in shitty situations because that was the best I could afford, and even that was $1000-$1300 a month. I‚Äôm extremely jealous of people who still live in a nice house with their parents. I went months without eating much due to a lack of money. 

I wish I appreciated the time I had at home more. I wish I accepted my friends for who they were and not what I wanted them to be. I wish my mom still had the house so I could move back in. But I don‚Äôt. I decided it was best to be independent at 18. It wasn‚Äôt a bad choice, but don‚Äôt let any boomer talk scare you. Moving out at 18 nowadays is stupid and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Don‚Äôt be a lazy bum, but enjoy what you have and try to do the best you can in this fucked up crazy world."
8272,When I'm a mom you bet ur ass imma be making my kid and their friends breakfast whenever I can. I'll even embarrass them and make an egg and bacon smiley face LOL
8273,Oh my god you just solved the student debt/cost of living crisis

8275,"This is a weird age. I'm 22. My friends are all 21 or 22. I'm graduated with a part-time job and have a house with a friend and her brother. One of my friends is a full-time teacher but still lives with her parents. One of my friends is getting married next week. One of my friends hasn't finished school yet and doesn't know what she wants to do for a career. Some people my age are having their second child. Some have never been on a date. There is no ""should be"" in life. You take your own path."
8276,[deleted]
8277,"I moved out of my parents house and to a super expensive city (NYC) when I turned 18. I'm working to pay for my college and rent and living expenses without any support from my parents. I wouldn't recommend this lifestyle for anyone. I had my reasons for having to do it, but if there was another option I would have taken it. Never feel bad for staying home late and focusing on school or your career, it makes life a million times easier than the alternative. There's no ""right"" way to do it, and if your parents are happy to have you then ride that as long as you're comfortable with."
8278,Can verify. I live in east bay and it is crazy. Here. I have a good job and thank god landlady has not raised rent in 11 years because I fix her house. Otherwise I would be screwed
8279,You moved out at 18 in California while going to college? Wtf?
8280,"I am currently 60,000 in debt, 30,000 in parent loans. I went to community college for 2 years, took all my gen eds then transferred to a State University. Problem was that not all my credits transferred and classes I needed for my degree were not offered. Wound up still doing 4 years after cc. Although, technically I could graduate now with a degree, I applied and was admitted to a program that went further into my field. It of course required more schooling but included an internship. With that said, credit hours are up to 700 bucks a pop. They made it so regardless of how many classes you take, the minimum you pay is for 15 credit hours. Doesn't matter if more or less but it's just asinine."
8281,Nothing wrong with living with your parents and staying at people's homes but you are definitely old enough to make your own breakfast.
8282,And that's if you graduate. There is a lot of people who don't graduate and then still have enormous amounts of debt that still need to be paid back on a low salary.
8283,"Some of us... Can't live with parents and have to live in student housing. Some of us arent even in the same state or country as our parents. Some of us can't work because of disability, covid, or literally any other reason. Some of us are taking 6-8 courses. Some of our parents kick us out of the house at 18 and we are forced to accrue debt. Some parents die right before college. Some parents waste away college funds on cars and stuff. Some people are told they will get their college paid for and then get told nevermind the day before they move. Some people never had parents. Some students have been homeless all their life. 

Please don't assume your situation is universal."
8284,"Finding a really flexible job at my university was super helpful since I can make my own schedule and have weekends off to study. I also moved pretty far from my university so I could find cheaper housing, and I chose my school because it gave me almost full scholarships, so I pay next to nothing at my overpriced shitty private school. The rest is just careful budgeting, which I mastered growing up in poverty."
8285,"What is your rent? I couldn‚Äôt imagine moving out while living in California, especially with being in college."
8286,"Take the class and use it as an opportunity to improve the speed of your writing. When I started last year it would take me a couple hours to write a discussion post. Now I can bullshit out an A essay in 2 hours since I was forced to write so much. Very grateful for the skill lol.
Not to mention discussion based classes are an easy A if you do the work, just don't slack."
8287,"yep, and thatll be $60,000 please"
8288,"I would stay. I've noticed that with my online classes, there are no tests, just essays, because now it's so easy to cheat. This way there's proof that you engaged with the material or w/e"
8289,[deleted]
8290,"I'm an older student with a writing background, so it's not the writing itself that bothers me. When classes went online last semester, I found it difficult to find posts with enough thoughtful intent to respond to. The requirements OP mentions  (a 2 page response to a student) would make me nuts if I had to read similar content to what was posted last semester."
8291,^^ this 100%.  When the pandemic hit I was in an honors philosophy class and we went to online discussions. We each had to have an initial post (you can't see the other posts before posting so it's original) and then 3 replies to separate people. It took my HOURS to think of what to write at the beginning. But now I'm skilled in bullshitting.
8292,"I'd just be as confrontational as possible.

Someone says marshmallows are good? I'd say he's supporting climate change and animal torture.

Fuck discussion posts man"
8293,"I'm going to second this. I had a class that was exactly this model, but add in one midterm essay and one final essay. 

It was one of the easiest classes I've had so far."
8294,"I've never set up a discussion board in my classes, but I was wondering why anyone would dread posting on it?  Especially people here who post about everything all the time.  Is it the lack of anonymity?"
8295,My differential equations class doesn‚Äôt even have lectures. No videos or zoom. Once a week you can go in person for help and that‚Äôs it. Oh and the notes they post are like 2 pages. The one class I wanted to have a lecture for :(
8296,"These don‚Äôt sound like discussion posts. It sounds like mini papers.

So instead of looking at this like a ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù look at it as writing a short paper every week.

It seems like the teacher is pretty much just having you read the material, then forcing you to actually do it by requiring you to write about it. I know it seems overwhelming, but this is actually pretty easy if you can get into a rhythm.

My suggestion is to pick two days a week for this class and do all of the work for it then. So on Sunday afternoon, sit down around 3:00 and get the material together. Read through the discussion prompts and decide what you want to write about. Then go through the material and familiarize yourself with it. Craft an outline that is an Introduction that includes the discussion prompt and your overall response to it, then a paragraph for each point you are trying to make and then a conclusion. Submit the work. 

Then check back in on Wednesday to respond to another post and use a similar method. 

No reason for anxiety, no one is actually going to read your long post. They will skim it and then respond. Just like you will be doing"
8297,[deleted]
8298,And that's just for parking and books
8299,Yet here you are discussing things on a post.
8300,Sometimes I don't really care enough about the subject to be addressing and responding to another student who also doesn't really care. It's usually the general Ed classes that do this.
8301,This professor isn‚Äôt doing lectures either! We just read from the textbook and do the discussion posts :/
8302,Cries in financial aid...
8303,"Don't drop it. You're going to run into courses where 70%+ of the total grade is based upon discussion and participation... especially in grad school. You might as well start getting the experience now that you'll need.

Once you become ""at ease"" with discussion and participation... grad school will be like a piece of cake."
8304,To add to that - always comment EARLY! Nothing worse than going to a discussion and seeing everything you thought of already mentioned
8305,"It's different when you know you're being graded based on what you write. It's no longer just casual dialog, especially when you have a word count and outside source requirements. 

Some of my favorite uses of discussion boards in classes were when there was a clear dividing line between formal and casual discussion, where either some posts were just sharing thoughts, or comments weren't encouraged to include citing."
8306,"I loved those courses.  The page requirements you have are total bullshit though I mean, I don't recall too many post that couldn't be answered in 2 paragraphs without repeating everything everyone else said.  This is a boring, yet easy course.  I'd just do it for that reason."
8307,Social anxiety and fear or embarrassment
8308,"Classes like that are a godsend to me. If there aren't weekly quizzes or assignments, I will 100% not keep up"
8309,"Easy, you just do what humans are good at. Make it all about you. Take the 1 useful insight the last poster had and blow that up like a Wikipedia rabbit hole. Talk about all the tangents, the historical significance of what they may have mentioned, and how one school of thought on the subject is objectively right in x y z instances, but wrong in a b c instances."
8310,"Well, that, and the fact that I could be graded the same way from an essay seen exclusively by the professor. For me personally, I am still getting used to college and having a bunch of other people seeing my work makes me nervous that they will judge me."
8311,And it's with a scholarship
8312,Are you replying with 2 page comments in every thread?
8313,The skill of bullshitting is an art that college students learn to excel at.
8314,[deleted]
8315,"I never minded doing the initial post. Like others have said, it's when there is a requirement to respond to classmates that is sometimes difficult to accomplish.  This largely depends on the nature of the question, but it can be difficult to offer anything insightful. 

There's only so many ways to say, 'Wow, great point.  I agree with you.'"
8316,"I will admit, being 36, working 40plus hours and taking 17credits each semester took its toll. It's do able but remember Bs and Cs get degrees too. Never compare yourself to ANYONE! Thats what society wants."
8317,"I‚Äôm not sure if there was a miscommunication but I wasn‚Äôt praising that behavior directly but rather the sacrifice they made because they needed to. It‚Äôs *definitely* not advised but you‚Äôd be surprised that many people don‚Äôt get an adequate amount of sleep because they have other tasks during the day. Many need to work full time on top of school, so they spend time studying long nights or catching up on assignments. *that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm praising* 
Their hard work to do what they need to & giving them recognition they deserve for it."
8318,"Well, if no one has told you yet, great job discovering what works effectively for you & for your achievements. But you realize that not everyone has the same motivations, drive, time, etc... right? For instance, some people work slower than others & need more time, which is why they spend ‚Äúsleepless‚Äù nights studying. I‚Äôm emphasizing the fact that they‚Äôre pushing themselves to *their* limits, not yours, their school‚Äôs, or their peers‚Äô limits. 

I suppose a more specific example would be a teenage boy not getting an honor roll award in school because he sacrificed his time working 2 part-time jobs after school to help his family pay their rent & groceries, but still tried his best to keep all his grades at at least a passing level. He didn‚Äôt get recognition at school despite how hard he realistically worked & tried to make it work. 

Plus, sometimes the time management requires people to stay up late because they can‚Äôt fit it anywhere else. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this clears up what I‚Äôm talking about."
8319,Thank you‚ò∫Ô∏è
8320,"It‚Äôs definitely hard, but deserve to be recognized & proud of yourself for the amount of work you‚Äôre putting in. It can definitely feel demeaning to when it seems like all your hard work isn‚Äôt good enough, but it is! Keep grinding & good luck on your future endeavors :D"
8321,Thanks my guy
8322,Thanks for this words of encouragement. It helps
8323,"after suffering through high school with hardly any decent grades to show for it, i went back to school almost 8 years after graduation and worked hard to get all A‚Äôs. I should be on the president‚Äôs list but because I‚Äôm not a full time student, I‚Äôm not eligible. It sucks not getting that recognition but I‚Äôm glad there are people out there who make me feel proud of it anyway (:"
8324,"So you‚Äôre saying college was easy for you?



If so then I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre lucky, and I‚Äôm envious."
8325,Exactly! Myself & so many others are proud of you for all of your hard work! Keep doing the best *you* can! <3
8326,"There‚Äôs so many other factors that go into this, from extracurriculars and work schedules to general emotional stability to majors/minors. If I get back to my room at 1am from a job and have class at 9am and a few hours of homework, I will not be getting 7-8 hours of sleep regardless how smart I‚Äôm working or how effective my time management is. Kudos to you for balancing everything but stop trying to apply your experiences universally. We‚Äôre all different."
8327,"Usually people working that hard are doing so out of necessity. I agree that you shouldn‚Äôt take pride in not getting enough sleep, but the students that don‚Äôt get as much sleep as they‚Äôd like usually have no other choice."
8328,"Thank you<3 I really needed this after flunking out of CS despite working so hard for it. Most likely inn part due to undiagnosed ADHD, it's made all of school hard lol"
8329,"Well when you work full-time, and go to school full-time, and have other responsibilities, you have to find a balance between study and sleep. That‚Äôs especially true for classes that are very challenging.




Some students don‚Äôt have to work, or do anything really except go to class. If you‚Äôre one of those students, and you‚Äôre also incredibly intelligent, then yeah you can just breeze through.




Good time management is a very valuable skill, but it can‚Äôt give you more actual hours in a day."
8330,Thank you very much.
8331,"A major‚Äôs difficulty has nothing to do with it. When you‚Äôre working full time and/or taking care of a family, *all* majors are difficult. College is incredibly demanding regardless what the major is.

Physics may be hard, but so is writing a 25 page research paper for a psych class."
8332,Easy to do when you dont have a life

8338,Not in college just yet but you‚Äôre very kind
8339,"Thank you. I started off college pretty crap and I pretty much wasted a year and earned grades that have always kept my GPA lower. 3.3 isn't bad, but it implies that I've been getting by on mostly B's and a few A's, when actually I've been trying my hardest to maintain A's to combat the D's and C's of my first few semesters."

8344,"Wow, you‚Äôre incredible! Congratulations on such a wonderful & inspiring achievement! I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt given the recognition you rightly deserve. You definitely deserve such a high, honorary title for all your hard work and diligence. Great job, friend!!"
8345,"I‚Äôm glad it could be of some encouragement for you! Keep growing, discovering yourself, and come back even better to give it another try! Or, if you‚Äôve found a new passion, go kick butt! Regardless, be proud of yourself for giving it what you could despite that challenging circumstance. I certainly am <3"

8365,"Yes. My first years as a prof i realized in the freshmen level courses you can teach the content but you won't succeed unless you teach them clearly how to interact with the content as a learner. I found that part patronizing and I hate patronizing but they come out of high-school without knowing how to behave in society as an adult. So every assignment was couched with an explanation of ""start ahead in case there are tech issues"", ""x,y,z does not count as an excused absence"", ""study like this"", etc etc"
8366,"I disagree. As an older person you have the benefit of a fully developed prefrontal cortex. All of the things you referenced (abstaining from excessive social media use, establishing a good study routine, etc) are most likely second nature to you but as a former impulsive 18 year old with the attention span of a goldfish I can promise you it is not as intuitive to your average 18 year old. I get what you're saying about it being patronizing and I am sure it can seem that way to you as someone with a little more life experience but as you noted most of the people in the class are not really in that stage of life and those are the people that the content is directed at."
8367,"I don't know if I agree. Those English paper topics seem pretty much in line with the topics I had to cover in my own English classes from middle school up into community college, except then animal testing was the big topic. I also don't think pointing out that mental health can be affected by social media is the same as patronizing them about phones. Some of the students in your class might really learn something from those assignments and start to analyze their own social media usage. 

What seems like common sense to older students can be eye-opening for the younger ones. I mean I absolutely dreaded having to sit through a 1-2 hour online course about drugs/alcohol usage/sexual harassment as a 30-year-old transfer student to my university, but I realize that it's necessary because a lot of those topics are brand new for some students coming right out of high school."
8368,You're right about mental health.  The 2nd leading cause of death for college students today is suicide.
8369,[deleted]
8370,"It's so difficult to spell everything out in just the right way so it doesn't sound condescending and is also helpful and not obvious. 

After a few years, the submissions for my online assignments have gotten so much better because I've realized what students need to know and how to get their attention. 

There are still those students who just do not care. Makes me wonder why they are enrolled if they are just going to give me no respect and the curriculum 0 effort."
8371,[deleted]
8372,"I don't know about other universities since my experience is limited to just one, but we're constantly being told to make our material relatable to young adults. The safest way to do that, especially for lecturers that are unimaginative, is by constantly referring to social media. 

I do tend to disagree about the patronising parts you listed. In gen-ed classes we get students with wide ranges of experiences and mentalities. Some students have never had to take charge of their own learning and blame their lecturers when they inevitably fail their 1st year classes. By teaching them proper academic habits, we're doing a bit of early intervention and self-protection. 

Also, you'd be surprised how few students in undergrad classes ever learnt basic things such as note taking, on/off study schedules, effective cramming, etc."
8373,"Huh? I actually wrote a 10 page essay on social media use causing extremism. I think it's actually very important for us as young college students to think about this stuff. I don't think you can have input on what we feel, most of my peers my age have never had an issue with anything you brought up in terms of media usage. Plus we always can include our opinions on it which is the whole point of college.

Edit: I also forgot to include that we have discussed plenty of other topics besides media usage lmao"
8374,"But are there more mental health problems because of phones or have we just become better at diagosing? In the 50s they'd sent women to the looney bin because she was a lesbian and would give her elctro shock therapy, a lobotomy, or hysterectomy. Shit people are still confused about autism"
8375,">You'd be surprised at how little academic ""freedom"" you can really have, especially if you're taking Gen Eds.

For my first ever stats course, we had to analyse data from a fish market...

Freedom is for students who've proven they can manage the complexities of it. And that's none of the students in the lowest level course on offer. 

Also, I can't even imagine how super difficult it would be for someone to mark 100+ reports based on unknown datasets written by beginners. They need a standardised dataset so they know what the correct answers are."
8376,"As someone not quite your age who is also not quite 18 anymore, I wouldn't find topics about social media usage uninteresting at all. Social media usage is rampant in our day and age and is a topic worth studying. I think students of Gen Z often take it for granted as well and some probably couldn't imagine living without it. It's also sort of just a contemporary issue that most people can relate to on some level.

Examining something like this in particular doesn't fit the definiton of propaganda.

However, I will say, I have gone through several condescending and ridiculous videos as part of last year's admissions cycle, including during the orientation.

But I have also in my work life encountered far more condescending speech from managers, as well as in work culture propaganda videos through corporate HR before this. 

General ed can be hit or miss. I took an Interpersonal Relations course which I found fairly unrionically HR and PC for students. Like anything else, at times CC will be a slog."
8377,I think it‚Äôs probably a lot more complicated than that.

8379,"Maybe both. I was having a beer with a friend who just retired as Dean of Students at a large midwestern university. I asked him what changes he had seen over his career. (He started right out of college as an RD.) He said that when he started there were 2-3 credible suicide threats or attempts in the residence halls each semester. When he retired, there were about 1 per week."
8380,Consider that current college students  have grown up with an awareness that at any time a random active shooter situation can break out in a classroom and the only response from adults will be for thoughts and prayers. My oldest started kindergarten in 2006 and came home from school one day ‚Äî at age five ‚Äî and filled me in in the difference between a hard lockdown and a soft lockdown. I didn‚Äôt even get a note home to alert me that the school would cover security threats  with the kidsthat day so that I would be prepared for his questions. This is their normal. It‚Äôs not the phones alone.
8381,Probably car accidents
8382,Media literacy is crucial
8383,"Reading your message, I find myself wondering what you are trying to achieve in college.  

Its been my experience that students who are bitter regarding their general education courses are often better suited for vocational school than college.  That is because such students are generally wanting to learn only applied job skills, rather than the full range of knowledge expected of college graduates.  That's not to say one is better than the other, but rather that one who hates gen eds may be wasting a good deal of time.

As far as the social media goes, clearly much of your coursework involves that subject.  Still, one has to write properly and effectively for English class.  It really doesn't matter if the subject is social media, world events, or whatever.  Its the same in statistics.  Your test involved social media.  Many of my stats tests involved the tensile strength of various strings of yarn.  One has to apply the same statistical concepts for both."
8384,"I agree with you OP. I think a lot of factors play into this. College aged students are more vocal about their mental health because of it becoming less taboo to talk about. I also think that society as a whole has a social media issue. Let's talk about Q-Anon's main viewer/userbase: Boomers. If you can, maybe make some counterpoints in your English class. Could make for interesting discussion."
8385,"Many college students are not well prepared for college academics, not prepared for structuring their own work processes, and yes, many need a level of help that I would have found borderline insulting as an undergraduate. Even when I teach at the graduate level, on the first day of most classes, we cover ‚Äúhow to read academic writing‚Äù. Reliably, afterwards a few students will thank me and tell me that no one has ever taught them how to read a large volume of material quickly, or how to read scientific papers, etc..."
8386,">I understand that the topic of social media usage is important, but do we have to make every assignment about it in every class?

But **it's not the topic of every assignment in every class**.

That's definitely just a ""your community college"" thing. It **is not** something that happens in universities.

Also, you can't even say it's a thing at your community college because you've only taken a small number of gen eds. That doesn't mean it's also the topic of choice across all of the subjects you've never taken. A single low-level statistics course and a single low-level English course is hardly representative of all subjects at all levels.

Plus you have no idea what interests young people. It's fine for you to find it all boring, but don't speak for other generations. Don't tell young people that they find discussion around social media to be infantilising. University is a place to interrogate the real risks and benefits of something we use all day, every day. That's valuable. 

Personally, having grown up with early social media (MySpace and IM), I would find those discussions to be incredibly relevant. **Especially** in a statistics class because there you are dealing with data, not merely opinions. But it's very surprising that you somehow went through an entire statistics course with data about social media usage and you *still* think it's ""Boomer propaganda"". You're probably older than most lecturers at your college."
8387,"As I said in another comment, my reports in an early stats class had to be based on data from a **fish market**. Another person here said their first reports were on the tensile strength of yarn.

It's not *supposed* to be complex. It has to be as simple as possible, and that rules out most interesting datasets. They also can't let you choose your own because it'd be a nightmare to mark when they don't know your dataset.

So (intro) stats classes use simple data sets. You should be grateful that yours tried to find something relevant to the majority of students. Be grateful you weren't studying sales of fish in an imaginary market or the strength of yarn."
8388,"A good professor will try to make assignments relevant to learners.  Like it or not social media impacts every aspect of our lives, whether you use it or not.  In my experience it's been the older generations that have a hard time navigating social media because they seem to forget how to think critically about what they see online. 

Incorporating stuff like growth mindset and academic habits is because students need this. The research backs it. What you don't see are all the people behind the scenes at your college studying the progress of students and working on research and initiatives to improve it. They're not just slapping stuff into the LMS for the hell of it.  If you don't need this, good for you. Easy A. 

I don't see how mental health is social media propoganda... I can't even count the number of students who have reached out to me about mental health issues, even before Covid. 

The writing you are doing in English class is applicable to any field you will be working in. 

I 100% treat my students as adults, even the dual enrollment students who are still in high school.

I suggest you open your mind a bit about what college is actually for and you might enjoy it a bit more."

8390,"I couldn't agree more with this statement. A large part of it is the continuous reduction in education funding, but I primarily blame No Child Left Behind. Shifting from actual concept based education with a focus on mastery of those concepts to a ""teach to the test"" method has negatively affected students' ability to think critically and analyze information presented to them. I listen to students at my cc complain regularly about having to take ""stupid gen eds,"" but truthfully, those courses are foundational to honing critical thinking."
8391,"Most students dislike gen-eds. They're rehashing of courses taken in high school, thus likely students view them as a waste of time and put as little effort as possible into them. Whereas students are more likely to invest more effort into courses required of the major.

In my view it would be better to offer degrees that exclude GE courses, similar to an associates degree but only includes the courses required for the major. It cheaper and quicker than doing a 4 year degree requiring GEs."
8392,"Not disagreeing, but there have been a lot of other changes over the 3 decades I‚Äôve been teaching as well."
8393,"> I don't think you can have input on what we feel

I don't think you can have an input on what an entire generation made up of millions of people feels either. ""We"" aren't carbon copies of each other and don't feel the same about everything. Also I think it's funny that you claim sharing opinions is the whole point of college while simultaneously telling OP they aren't qualified to share their opinion."
8394,"Yes, but social media undoubtley has a huge amount of impact, it completely changed the way we socialize, be it in or out of social media. Many people spend at least two hours daily on social media, that obviously will have a massive impact on mental health, brain development and whatnot. There are many studies that directly correlate mental health decline with social media use, especially among teens, more specifically teenage girls."

Jesus Christ... Tell your classmates they can create a filter to automatically mark the professor's emails as read or even delete them in their inbox as those messages arrive.

The one time professors try to be personal and welcoming in an online class, this happens.

But for your problem, politely send an email to the department's office and ask if the professor is OK. They can't tell you much, but should give you a general idea on what's going on."

8435,Your classmates are rude assholes.
8436,"Bro, I ama about to beat up some people. Like come on, maybe the proff was a bit sad or something and tried to lighten his own mood up by sending people stuff and thinking he may lightened someone else's day up"
8437,"Prof here! It's sweet of you to be concerned. After spring term, I also question whether I'm alive.

No communication after a week is unusual, so contacting the chair with your polite concern is warranted. They should have your professor's phone number or be able to coordinate more robust outreach.

Something short like, ""Dear Dr. X, I'm a student in Professor Y's COURSE101 Sec 3 course. He disclosed that he had COVID and I'm worried about his safety. The last time we heard from him was X date/when he posted X grades. I/my classmates have tried contacting him on XYZ dates via email/phone/D2L with no response.""

It's also possible that your prof is swamped with work and is just hunkered down recovering and catching up. Professors are a bit like cats; we disappear for 4 months and then return looking bedraggled but alive. I'm in grad school myself for a second MA and one of my professors didn't reply to emails for a week and posted our course grade about 5 days after the official deadline... so shit happens.

I hope everyone is safe. Thank you for looking out! If we had more people like you in the world, much suffering and tragedy would be prevented. I was dismayed to [read today that the person who committed the mass shooting in Texas messaged his friend ‚ÄúI just shot my grandma in her head"" and then ‚ÄúIma go shoot up a elementary school rn,‚Äù](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/us/texas-gunman-text.html)\--and yet she did nothing, thinking that he wasn't being serious. While it certainly isn't all this friend's fault, I imagine her calling the guy, calling the police, doing *anything* would've made a difference. 

We need to and *can* take care of each other. One person can make a difference."
8438,"As a college graduate, I can't believe a bunch of kids requested their professor to stop sending morning chat messages to them. If that is what is disrupting their daily lives then they have it real good (aka spoiled). If it was bothering them that much to take 10 seconds to entertain then maybe they should figure out how to mute the chat and pray the professor doesn't slide some important information somewhere in there."
8439,"Some of my classmates are like this, we have an online portal and if the lecturer updates the announcements section it generates an email. They go apeshit on every lecturer for this, despite the fact we can limit it on our side AND they also never read their emails. They are the same group that have officially complained about things they missed due to not reading their emails /online portal... *facepalm*.

8440,"Another student and I have sent a message around 3 hours ago, no reply as of now. There is only an email listed in the syllabus."
8441,3 hours?! He's dead for sure. No professor in the world would let an email sit in their inbox for 3 hours. /s
8442,"Wow do a nice thing for students and get shit on by those same students, I just don‚Äôt understand. Your class mates are rude as fuck.

8449,">	they can create a filter to automatically mark the professor‚Äôs emails as read or even delete them in their inbox as those messages arrive.

From the sounds of it, it seems even simpler, as it is probably some LMS that automatically send emails when certain events take place... based on your notification settings. 

Even if not though, there must be a way to create a filter that doesn't affect any other mails of his.

Them being overwhelmed with such a simple task doesn't surprise me the least though, considering that every email we get from faculty, one or two students, without fail, will hit that ""reply all"" button. So now all 500 Students in the programme know that Jennifer is failing her courses."

So if there's no in-person component to the class and the guy doesn't have any close relatives...it's entirely possible it'll take a few days for him to be found."

I made jokes about it in the beginning bc I‚Äôve always been an introvert and struggled in social situations so quarantine was perfect to recharge without having FOMO but now everyone is back at college having fun and I‚Äôve never felt so isolated.

I‚Äôve talking to people online for quite some time now, and while it kind of helps, most of the friendships are never genuine connections so they‚Äôre short lived.

Additionally, I had Covid and my mum too so we were in isolation for three weeks!! Normally, I was able to escape to the city in order to be around people but I am not interacting with anyone, but with covid and staying in isolation with depression I had ZERO contact with others. My boyfriend also broke up with me during the pandemic and since then I am even more depressed.

I think for many people it is a problem, so really, just know, you are not on your own with these thoughts. We will manage somehow. Things might take a while to get back to normal, I guess it will stay like this until July next year.

Also, from experience, it is better to be on your own than to catch this virus. I am 25, young, healthy and caught it and it was NO fun at all. Protect yourself. I try to stay positive, I think it could be worse, but it also could be better...

For me, it‚Äôs fine if classes end around 4, but starting 4 pm and later is not fun. 

My ideal schedule is classes starting around 10, 11, or 12, and ending around 2 or maybe 3. It‚Äôs not always perfect, but those hours are when I‚Äôm most aware in class."

i have so many horror stories about that dude. he has a well earned 1.3 on ratemyprofessor lol"
8544,That would call for someone to knock incessantly until the door is reopened. Professors shouldn't expect students to stay outside while their belongings are in the classroom. 
8545,"> The section should really read ""students are assumed to be children incapable of making their own decisions"".

Exactly. The prof probably used to assume students to be adults, then after whatever happened over the years, the prof start assuming everyone to be children.

A lot of older adults seem to be like this. What's up with that...is this a part of the aging process?"
8546,"Prof here: this person is a jerk. There's simply no reason to treat college students like children and contrary to his/her assertion that's exactly what they are doing. Nobody would hold a three-hour meeting in the workplace and demand nobody leave the room for any reason. I'd complain to the department chair-- as a chair I would be appalled if one of my colleagues put something like this in a syllabus. Luckily, in 25+ years teaching college students I have never had the misfortune to encounter anyone this ridiculously self-centered. As others have suggested, it's also a clear violation of basic anti-discrimination policies on most campuses; if someone with a medical condition is in the class they should not have to decide between their education and their physical needs, and the instructor should not require them to ""out"" themselves to the class in order to do either.

My students are welcome to come and go as they please, to bring water/food to class, and hell, even bring their infants if they are feeding them or have an unplanned childcare situation."
8547,"This rule seems wierd, because in my experience, every class I have had that is 3+ hours is required to have at least a ten minute break..."

8550,"We had a similar incident at my unversity. As it was an Intro to Philosophy class, so there were easily 250+ kids in this huge lecture hall. Midway through lecture some kid gets up to go to the bathroom, professor stops mid-sentence to berate him about ""being a distraction to the entire class"" (which was ironic as no one would have noticed him leave). After the kid left, professor put a chair behind the door so he couldn't get back in. He had to come back after lecture was done to grab his stuff after a verbal lashing from asshole professor, kid dropped the class shortly afterwards."
8551,The fire marshal might have some harsh words for a professor blocking the exit like that.
8552,"I had a realization today while sitting in McDonalds. A nearby high school had just gotten out, and a bunch of freshmen/sophmores/whatevers started coming in. Now, 3 years ago, they would have just looked like normal people to me. Now, after a few years being an adult, they look like babies. Magnify that affect by several decades, and think about how college students must look to a person in their 40s, 50s, or 60s. Imagine how a 40 year old must look to an 80 year old. "
8553,...so what happens if a student gets their period in the middle of class? does the professor think they can hold it inside their uterus or something?

8559,"Damn you piss 24 times a day, that sucks"
8560,"I actually see this phenomenon more with younger professors than older ones. Older professors tend to develop the ability to control the classroom while younger professors are more uncertain of themselves.

In any case, the reason that professors treat students like children is because, well, they *are*. People don't stop maturing until their mid-20s and tend to act irresponsibly before then. Almost any middle-aged person can tell you numerous stories of how they were at 20 - and today's 18 - 21 year olds tend to be just as irresponsible.

While there a cultural divides - consider cellphones, where many young people can't imagine being without it while many older people frequently leave their cellphones behind in their office - I think the only major distinction I see is that young people today tend to be far less willing to accept responsibility for their actions.

It wasn't all that long ago that I would say ""you skipped the test, you get a zero"" and it was treated as a tautology. For modern students, it's treated more like the start of a debate - many of them simply can't understand that their actions have consequences and that when those consequences descend on them, it's their own fault rather than someone else's.

However, this could be viewed as simply a retarding of the growth process. Today's 18-year-olds act more like yesterday's 13-year-olds and it will all be resolved by the time they're 27."
8561,"When I was in the actual military, we were required to take several courses. We were treated like adults. If you were being disruptive, you would be reprimanded. If you needed to leave for whatever reason, nobody asked questions as long as you came back in a reasonable time. Hell, I used to take a piss, smoke, and grab something to drink as long as it took \~5-7 minutes and I was falling asleep."
8562,">This is one of the garbage things I hate about college, and is the main factor in why I'm taking as many courses online as possible.

This is hardly normal-- it would never happen at my school. I welcome students to come and go as needed, to bring food, etc. as do all of my departmental colleagues."

8565,"This is one of the garbage things I hate about college, and is the main factor in why I'm taking as many courses online as possible. Adults should be able to make responsible decisions, which includes leaving during class.

I've sat through too many classes in my time where people sit around asking stupid questions or circle-jerking about some philosophical nonsense that is only tangentially relevant to the course.

If I'm paying to attend, I should be able to make decisions about my personal time. If I only want to show up to turn in assignments and take exams, that should be my prerogative. If I feel as though I'm going to piss myself halfway through class, I should be able to take care of that."

8574,"I have been going through waves of massive depression and lack of motivation. Starting when I should have had spring break, I just zoned out. I was trying to ""care for myself"" while also dealing with life issues, but it was like trying to save a sinking boat. Things just weren't working. Studying did not create good grades. Doing stuff I love was not making me happy. I was just angry that nothing was working.

A second wind has kind of hit me with only a couple week left because I am so ready to be done with this crap. Guys, we are almost there. We can't give up now. They aren't going to help us, so we have to help ourselves.

I think of a soldier when I get bent out of shape. I imagine someone my age in a trench half way around the world. He gets shot in the shoulder, but he can't just fall down. He needs to crawl out of that muddy trench and either get help or shoot back. That is how life can be sometimes."

I need this website to have 10 projects to graduate, but I believed that I could get most of it done without actually designing any more projects. The funny thing is, I only have 4 more projects left to go and I completely ran out of material. I have a feeling that I am going to have to pull some all nighters this done and yet here I am watching Netflix every night for 3 to 4 hours. It's not just you, I don't know what's happening!

8602,"It depends on where you are and what your school is like I guess. I go to UCLA and the call to cancel classes gets louder every day. The reason is that waiting for something to happen is reactive and not proactive, which can be really dangerous. For us, they won‚Äôt cancel classes until one case is identified among students; but they also refuse to test students. In LA we now have community spread, and classes are 300ish people. Basically, waiting for someone to get tested and get confirmed means that there are almost absolutely other people who have already gotten it through community spread. By then, it‚Äôs too late and cancelling classes means a mass exodus back to hometowns, and the unfortunate few who are sick may transmit the disease further. This is an extreme situation but it‚Äôs not an unlikely one."
8603,"Serious question, why would students ask their administrators to cancel classes? I understand if a student is immunocompromised and doesn‚Äôt want to take chances, but for the rest of us wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to just wait and see what happens?

That would be a pain..."
8618,"With spring break coming up for many students, there will undoubtedly be a lot of travel around both the US and abroad, which significantly increases the odds of someone who is infected bringing the virus back to campus. Although the majority of college students do not have to worry about serious permanent consequences from the virus, they could easily carry it to someone who does, such as an elderly person, someone who is immunocompromised, or someone who has some other condition. By moving class online, this risk is greatly reduced, which can save lives."
8619,"Most schools aren't canceling classes, just switching to online lectures"
8620,yea that was really similar to UW where many students petitioned to shut down the school but obviously the admin wouldn‚Äôt do anything until a faculty member got sick

8652,No? Some students still have in person lab and clinical etc. and will potentially get everyone else sick. Not to mention being young doesn‚Äôt mean COVID-19 can‚Äôt be fatal for you. Lots of young teens with asthma (which is incredibly common) have passed from it.
8653,That's why you wait until the checks are cashed. Let families sue and it can stay tied up in court for years. By then the Dean might be gone.

8656,"It‚Äôs not that the classes are online that is the issue, but the ridiculous price tag that is still attached. My university requires freshman to live on campus. Wanna know what‚Äôs going to happen if we shut down again? Nothing. They still have that dorm lease with no refund. Not to mention the other dozens of fees for on campus activities. 

I love higher education, but the pandemic has shown what they are, which is a business first, students last. In person courses switched to an online format should be priced as such."
8657,"also as a freshman in college, i understand that this is an atypical situation (to say the least) and for the sake of my family, my peers, and the world, i will follow proper guidelines in order to minimize the spread of covid-19. i will not be partying. that 20k you‚Äôre paying is for an education, not just the social scene (this is not to understate the importance of the social side of college, but the main priority of school is to learn!).

i have had people in my life who got covid and that shit is serious. would you be able to live with yourself knowing that you partying could result in someone getting sick?

That said since they said they got the number by hacking the school I'd probably go to IT/the registrar just in case they did hack the school's system.

They probably just got the number from a friend of the guy. It‚Äôs evident because the sender felt the need to mention the source of information without the receiver asking for it.
8672,"sounds like he‚Äôs got a crush on you. dude is seriously concerned with you literally just going to school üíÄjust know this guy is hardcore insecure and obviously very jealous, especially of your car LOL"
8673,"This. They're in college, time to grow the fuck up."
8674,"Or just add it as a contact, open snapchat, and go to the ""add by contact"" section to see who it is"
8675,"Depends on the person. When you grow up with the same people for 13 years of your life, going to an out of state college is different. You forget HOW to make friends because you haven‚Äôt had to since you were little. And a lot of us just don‚Äôt have the time to join clubs or do activities that put ourselves out there. 

In my experience, I have plenty of acquaintances in college. But no one who I‚Äôm actually close to. No one who I truly hang out with and do stuff with. Just people I talk to in classes and text every now and then. It‚Äôs tough to get close to people you‚Äôve only known for a few months"
8676,^ yeah they hella jealous of your car bro thats all it is take this as a compliment hold your head high dont let this lower your self esteem and dont reply. Also keep your car locked at all times and keep up with your keys. Don‚Äôt let this scare u of going back to school as hard as it may be this person is really mad over your car I‚Äôve had ppl do similar things for the car i drive (back when i got it it was 2018 and the yr of my car is 2018 so it was very new etc) you‚Äôll be shocked how many ppl will hate you for the material things u have its a shallow world we live in.  But stay strong 10 times out of 10 this person will never EVER APPROACH U IN REAL LIFE FACE TO FACE hints to why they used a fake number and didn‚Äôt say who they were its all about being Anonymous. There a hater and if u don‚Äôt have any you‚Äôre not doing something right lol!
8677,"It sucks. I relate. Back in Feb 2019 I had people prank calling me (from a blocked number) and leaving annoying voicemails. I just kept deleting them and never responded. They eventually stopped. Back in February someone on my Snapchat list texted me from a fake number saying shit like ‚Äúno one cares about your life, stop posting all your shit, try taking harder classes and then come back and talk‚Äù blah blah blah. I got super irritated and responded, even though I should have ignored the message and moved on. 

Easier said than done, but you should just delete the message. These people are not worth their time. They need to grow up. They just want a reaction from you. Keep your head up."
8678,How‚Äôs it hard to make friends in college? Most people are in the same position: out/far from home and alone in a new environment so everyone is open to new people (for the most part)

8685,"I thought the same thing, he‚Äôs worried about what op drives etc that‚Äôs just weird and gives off cringey jealous vibes. I‚Äôd ignore these people texting you and report it. If they keep sending weird messages that‚Äôs harassment and the police on campus might be able to do something about it. Reading the messages they sent made me uncomfortable lol, you can tell they‚Äôre lame asf in real life and obviously unhappy with their own circumstances/shitty life that they felt the need to try and bring you down with them."
8686,"That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ hard. In the first place I would suggest taking that freshman under someone‚Äôs or your wing, that itself can do wonders.

After I closed it I immediately emailed the prof who allowed me to take it during the summer course (after our semester ended), so I did and it froze...AGAIN. He ended up just emailing me back telling me he predicted I'd get 100% given the responses to my answers before it froze and gave me an A."

8731,"Dumb things I've done: spring semester of 2022 edition

* Replaced a 101-level distribution requirement class with English 255... as a freshman. Classes numbered 250 and up are junior- and senior-only at my school; sophomores need written permission from the department. I only got away with this because I was in the middle of a change in academic advisors at registration time
* Did two months' worth of past-due French homework in about three days to turn in for half-credit because I assumed the homework would be linked on the syllabus (it was not. Extra credit, here I come)
* Same story with my Astronomy homework. Also I absolutely fudged the 'give the dimensions and distances from the sun of every planet in the solar system in Earth masses and AUs' question on my last exam. Wrote down wild guesses and hoped for the best
* Made a habit of skimming the assigned reading an hour before the corresponding quiz in Sociology class. Do I now know how to read an entire book in an hour? Yes. Do I know anything about Sociology? I think the fuck not

Spent a couple months messing with my Adderall dosage. Life's been a trip"

I thought I had another week but I ended up giving the most half assed research presentation out of all the students. It ruined me for a while but hey, one year later and I have an offer for grad school at Columbia University so it didn‚Äôt ruin me as much as I thought it would‚Ä¶"

Got like a B- from it after the 10% late deduction. Still got the piece of paper and am in a much better place mentally now: less than a year later. 

You'll look back at today and laugh and be grateful for how far you've come in the future. Don't worry ‚ù§Ô∏è"

If that were the case, chances are you're one of many who also thought it was the next day"
8752,Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôll do my best
8753,"My heart goes out to you. You may be taking too many classes at once. Putting together a routine that gives you time to complete homework and study as well as time for self care is important. Also, make sure you get enough sleep and incorporate healthy foods into your meals and snacks.  Next semester I would advise to tone down the workload and limit the amount of credits to give you time for rest and relaxation too. Getting burned out will effect your grades and mood quicker than anything.
 Good luck!"
8754,"My sister, who graduated with honors, gave me some advice that I thought was bologna at the time, but have recently learned she was right. You cannot read everything that's required. You just can't. You won't sleep and you'll have mental breakdowns. Choose to read the required text for classes you know you'll struggle in, and be content with just taking notes for the others.

I know that sounds like a fool's way out, but since taking her advice, I've been on the president's list twice now. I fought against the idea for a while because I'm a major perfectionist, but she was right.

The first semester of college is ALWAYS the hardest. You will learn how *you* learn, as well as how to manage time, what the professors will want you to learn, etc.

My mother is a Professor. If you're struggling, reach out to yours. Most will be happy to accommodate you, especially during this pandemic."
8755,"I second this consensus. I had to make some adjustments to my life. I try to leave my apartment at least once a day, even if its to run to the store. I also take 10-30 minute breaks where i just go outside (luckily i have a nice balcony) and i spend time just being outside and trying to consciously relax.

&#x200B;

As far as all nighters go with the work load most people are trapped under this semester, it seems necessary every now and then. Try not to do more than one a week. 

&#x200B;

Also i think if you follow this sub, you'll find that things this semester have been particularly grueling in terms of work load. When we get back to in-person courses, things will definitely change and hopefully for the better.

&#x200B;

I was very skeptical, but I bought a pair of blue light glasses (i dont even wear regular glasses) and it really helped my sleep and mood. I'm sleeping better and feel less depressed. It might not make a difference for everyone but it's worth trying."
8756,"talk therapy has helped me. College still makes me depressed but therapy has helped

edit: many college offer some free talk therapy so you could look into that"
8757,"I have group chats w/ my classes. It‚Äôs not much communication, but it helps us get to know one another and it also allows us to be easily available for Zoom/Skype group study sessions, etc.

Don‚Äôt burn out. Make a schedule & stick to it, but schedule yourself some free time each day as well. Just remember: you‚Äôre working hard and you deserve to relax, even if it‚Äôs only for 15 minutes."
8758,"Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôm studying by going through the textbook and doing the practice problems the teacher gives.

The textbook really doesn‚Äôt help though idk :/"
8759,"Hey! I know exactly how you feel, my freshman year was very similar, and Im also a STEM major. 

For Classes:
- Do more practice problems than pure reading. 

- Set a specific time each day for studying, eating, taking a walk/going to gym, sleeping, and fun. 

- When readings textbooks, make sure to look at the chapter summaries both before and after you read the chapter itself. Even write them down and try to look for it as you go so your mind puts extra attention to it. 

- Quizlet and Chegg are your friends. 

- Dont forget that ACE offers free tutoring, and I believe they also offer online tutoring now. 

- I was a person who would start Group Chats in my classes so we could ask eachother for help, do study sessions, etc. I doubt your professors would be upset if you did the same 

- Make sure you have a planner so you can keep track of what assignments are due when and how far out tests are. If you need a super in-depth one get a passion planar, or download one sheet of it to test it out. 

For your health/mind:
- You need to set up a 6 hour minimum sleep schedule. If youre so stressed that you cant sleep, try Melatonin. All nighters, while tempting, just really mess up your mind and energy for several days after. 

- Pick a physical activity to do each day, even if only for an hour. Blood clots are rising exponentially in students who are not moving around enough with everything being online these days. Plus this will give you a little breathing time. Go to Landis and play with a dog, go on an early morning walk, have a dance party in your room. You get the idea. 

- I strongly suggest you add a hobby to your routine. It could be playing video games, it could be embroidery, reading a physical book, it could be songwriting. Something that either you already love or are curious about learning. I recommend doing these after your daily study session, treating it as a reward. It will encourage you mind to study again the next day, and itll give you a cooling off period before sleep. 

- I know you mentioned not having any new friends due to online classes. Two suggestions for you. 

1. Call up some of your high school buddies! I still talk to about 10 of my high school friends and Im about to graduate! Make an effort to keep them in your lives. 

2. You can try to find clubs to join. A lot of clubs are hosting activities online since so many students are still at home. Or you could try to search for non school related things like a sports club or whatevers in your area. 

Secret 3rd Option: You dont have to do this one all the time, but if theyre alive call your grandparents. Its a scary time for them, and since they prob cant get out much odds are theyre bored to tears and a simple call could mean a lot to them. Just a suggestion. 

- If the screens are hurting that bad, consider adjusting your screen to red light, getting blue-light glasses or making sure youre letting in enough natural light to fight it. 

- You can get a free therapist through the school. Each therapist is different, but my experience was really positive and they helped me find the courage to leave an abusive situation. I dont know everything thats going on in your life, but its always nice to have someone to talk to. 

I hope some of these help you! Good luck!"
8760,"What classes in STEM particularly? 
For biology: concept mapping is awesome, as well as doing practice problems. Sometimes asking yourself questions (ie: what process(es) is(are)the Golgi apparatus involved in? What is the significance of these processes?) it helps you think about what questions could look like as well as how to answer them. Also, go to office hours! Your profs and/or TAs want to help you! That‚Äôs what they are there for. Even if you need help figuring out how to study, that‚Äôs a good thing to ask for help with. 

For chemistry: same as above, but do all the practice problems possible. Go over them till you get them right and can explain what you are doing wrong. Watch YouTube videos (I‚Äôm partial to the organic chemistry tutor- he has gen chem and physics videos as well. 

Try not to to focus too much on how overwhelmed you are and make sure you are blocking out some time during the day for a breather. Self-care is just as important, if not more than studying. 

College is a whole other beast then high school, but you‚Äôll get the hang of it."
8761,Thanks :)
8762,"I would add that you could probably drop a class now. So you get a W on your transcript during Covid. No one is going to care.
I think they would prefer a higher grade honestly"
8763,"Electrical Engineering Major here: 

Set up a schedule and delegate study and relaxation time, all separate from each other. 

Make sure you‚Äôre getting physical activity (gym, running, etc) because you need to get rid of the stress hormones. 

Also, if you‚Äôre having breakdowns, I‚Äôd recommend seeing a therapist. I‚Äôm seeing one right now and it helps a ton! 

Good luck!"
8764,"If you are feeling like your mental health is being affected by your classes, you should treat it as any other illness. If it becomes too severe you can send your professor an honest email explaining your situation briefly and if you are seeing a therapist of some sort they should also be able to write a letter on your behalf. Mental illness is exactly that- an illness, and it should be treated as such."
8765,"I‚Äôm taking mechanics, chemistry and calculus this semester. And thanks for the advice"
8766,"Are you taking notes for the step by step process during lecture (if you have it) or from the text for the practice problems? Breaking the problems down with notes could be helpful. 

Also, if your professor or TA have office hours, maybe ask if they can help walk you through a problem or two and point out areas where you‚Äôre getting tripped up.

What do you find frustrating or confusing in the text?"
8767,Also get checked for ADHD. It's really commonly diagnosed in college for kids who were smart enough to get by in high school without needing to develop good study habits. I got a diagnosis during my junior year of college and suddenly I went from C's to A's after going on medication. Life changer.
8768,Can you drop one class? It might make things more manageable.
8769,"I always recommend taking some gap time if things aren't working well. You can usually take at least 6 months off without repercussions. Get out, get a job, and live life for a little bit and find your motivation!"
8770,"Great advice--in humanities classes, a friend and I would split the reading and then tell each other what it was about and what to write the essay on."
8771,"Spend some time outside, it helps."
8772,My college had like an $8 fee with your tuition every year that pays for the counseling center lol. It‚Äôs pretty common to experience depression after a big change like going to college. Use that resource if it‚Äôs available.
8773,"I‚Äôm in the same hole, except I live on campus which is now a ghost town. Please no more all nighters. I give myself at least 6 hours of sleep if I need extra time to study.
I also go out for a walk, take time to play games, etc to unwind. 
For the socialization aspect I have joined online study groups. I also socialize with gaming and voice chats on discord. Sometimes we just need someone to talk to. 
You also might need to learn effective studying techniques.
I literally only read half of what I am given more poly science and government classes because half of it is just explanatory matter.  That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs just fluff, apparently all the thesis and theories have fluff in their introductory matter, lol. 
Also, the only thing you probably need to do in some classes is brute force study definitions. I have gotten A‚Äôs in some classes just studying definitions, reading only the intro chapters to understand the basic concepts and extrapolating data from there. Please also look into online tutoring. Many colleges offer free tutoring to their students."
8774,Thanks for the advice
8775,I missed the deadline dropping out this semester for this one because I thought I would be fine. I‚Äôm definitely going to register for less classes next semester though. Thanks for the advice
8776,"*rubs hands together* alright here come the suggestions!

So listening and note taking at the same time is hard, don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs not a skill you‚Äôre born with! It takes time and practice. I learned by being a waitress first, so here‚Äôs what helped me/ended up crossing over to college.

‚Ä¢Use short hand or abbreviations to start

Ex. Abt, w/, w/o, arrows, half words, misspellings (while still knowing what you were getting at). They don‚Äôt have to be cute, they have to be on the paper. If you understand what you were getting at, you can fix it later.

‚Ä¢If you‚Äôre able, maybe try recording the audio from a lecture with your phone or an audio capture software on your computer. That way you can rewind and relisten or adjust the speed if you need to or if an area is confusing. I did this for my classics lecture when I‚Äôd be too tired to take more detailed notes and it saved my buttttt.

‚Ä¢Some professors record their lectures as well, maybe reach out and see if you can get permissions to record or get a copy of a recording. It depends what software they‚Äôre using, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask.

‚Ä¢Also request slides from lecture if at all possible if they‚Äôre not provided. Some professors are a pain about it, so start with the TA. They‚Äôre the in between for you and the professor and I‚Äôd bet they‚Äôd be more likely to get them for you.

‚Ä¢Look for key concepts or ideas when reading the textbook. This is more difficult in the hard sciences I think, but ideally start with the broad strokes. Definitions and word examples are my first go to. Then summaries at the beginning and end of the chapter. Then the diagrams to see how those ideas are represented. That way you‚Äôre absorbing the initial information, without going line by line.

‚Ä¢Depending on if your book is physical or digital, check if there‚Äôs a read aloud option. My texts are digital and offer a read along feature, which would help if your an auditory learner.

‚Ä¢YouTube videos! There were a few suggested channels in the main thread, go through those! Likely they‚Äôll have some of the subjects you‚Äôre working on. In those cases too, you can adjust the playback speed and/or turn on subtitles to help the information stick better. 

‚Ä¢TA office hours! Use ‚Äòem and abuse ‚Äòem. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for and they can give you tips and tricks for the professor that others can‚Äôt. Same with your professors office hours, though those may be more limited.

‚Ä¢When in doubt, see if your college offers extra tutoring for your subjects. If not, I know there were other tutoring options on the main thread, so check those out!

Whew that was a lot, but hopefully these help a bit! The learning curve between high school and college is rough so try not to beat yourself up. You‚Äôre learning harder material and how to really study for the first time so it feels like so much more than you‚Äôve ever done, but I know you can do it!

Also if you need to, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to counseling services on campus. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for and keeping your mind healthy is far more important than grades!"
8777,"You need to talk to someone. College can be a huge adjustment, and it's especially difficult right now since social activities are limited. All-nighters are never a good idea. You really shouldn't pull more than one or two all-nighters in a semester, and definitely not multiple in a row. It'll stress you out and make it much harder to function.

Email your school's counseling service and see if you can schedule a session. You're paying tons of money (if in the US) and might as well take full advantage of that.

You're right that you need to find a way to have some balance. Studying 24/7 really won't help. You need to find different ways to study. I also think you should join some clubs. Lots of clubs are meeting online, and it's never too late to join! Join clubs that interest you and join some related to the classes you're taking, as they might be able to help. Personally, studying for 12 hours straight isn't as good as studying for 4 hours, then taking a break, then another 4 hours. You can only retain so much information at a time.

And cut yourself some slack :)"
8778,"When I started university it was hard for me too.

I was a dual enrollment and AP student. (12 of them exams most of which I passed) I was in a lot of classes in my senior year and was attending my high school and my DE college full time. (Go to school, come home, eat, go to college, etc.) I was working with three clients so anytime I had free time I was working or volunteering or doing religious work. (i'm a Christian)

I didn't get a break from high school. I literally graduated and started class at the DE college to make up two classes I failed as a DE student the next day. I was also still working three jobs to help pay for college. 

Then halfway through that, I started university classes and orientation in a special study abroad program. I finished out my CC classes, did the study abroad portion of the program and then the next day started a new program where I did research and science programs (kind of like a STEM orientation week) and then I started fall classes. 

When I started U classes I lost the ability to go to sleep and lost consciousness twice over the summer as a result. Apparently, I was experiencing a mental breakdown but I didn't realize it because I had been told all my life that people who asked for extra time on papers or for help were lazy or ""typical gen zer's.""

&#x200B;

I didn't have any friends as they all went to another state school and everyone who had ever bullied me came to mine. So I would just be walking through the science hall and then I'd see the woman who shoved my head into a toilet just sitting there chilling on her phone or"
8779,"Dude, I feel the exact same way. Only I‚Äôm actually at my college and I still don‚Äôt have friends :(. I‚Äôm also a freshman and feel so overwhelmed like I‚Äôll never get the work done. 

Maybe buy some blue light glasses for your eyes? That‚Äôs what I did. Something that also helps me get my work done is literally writing out a schedule for my day hour by hour. At first I didn‚Äôt want to do it because I‚Äôm not someone who plans, but it‚Äôs really helped on the days I have multiple assignments due. 

Other than that, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you other than you‚Äôre not alone, which sucks because people tell me that and I‚Äôm like how is that supposed to help me feel better? Sending you a virtual hug though. I hope you‚Äôre able to find the motivation to become organized and things get easier for you!"
8780,Get printed books and drop one or two courses.
8781,"For starters, I would strongly recommend getting blue light glasses since it is affecting your eyes so much. For the rest of it, I would recommend learning to pick your battles. The textbook can be helpful, but depending on the class, you don't need to use it as much as you might think. I've had science classes where the textbook is followed, but the most important things are the lectures and the work that the professor assigns. That will show you what you need to know and how to do the work. Just do what you reasonably can, and work from there.

Another thing is to make sure you take some time to yourself. Get your assignments done, sure, but you will only continue to do worse if your health, including mental, falls apart. Play some video games, read some books, spend some time outdoors, socialize. Whatever you need and want to do. Life isn't meant to only be about work and school. If you need to or are able to, maybe take less credit hours next semester. Good luck, you'll do great!"

8784,"Great!

P.S. - What is ""Canvas"" like? My college is about to switch to it from the current Blackboard system. "
8785,"Ehh, it's the right context for it. More of an r/humblebrag."
8786,In what class is the final not required??
8787,Let‚Äôs hack the shit out of him! And steal his A. üòà
8788,For real though
8789,Blackboard suucccksssss
8790,">Plus on the grades tab you can see the low/high and average on assignments for the class (if the professor has it enabled)

Legit my favorite thing about canvas.  

Canvas is pretty professor dependent. Mostly I‚Äôve had great experiences with it but I‚Äôve had one or two profs who didn‚Äôt know how to use it properly and buried assignments under random pages, etc that made it horrible. But mostly it‚Äôs at least as good as blackboard or better. "
8791,fuuu I've not got lower than an A minus as of yet and I never got that lucky lol still had to take all my finals.  congrats!
8792,[deleted]
8793,Don't mention moodle. Brings back high school nightmares 
8794,"Not op but Canvas is awesome. It connects directly to Google drive, it's straightforward, it's well designed, AND it has a usable app. A+"
8795,Quite a few in my experience. In one class I‚Äôm currently finishing up the professor offers to just duplicate your midterm grade if you‚Äôre satisfied with it.
8796,Damn good job dude. I'm hoping this happens in my cell bio class. I got one more exam to go which determines if I get an A or not.
8797,I'd love to see the final average drop from a 75% to a 60% because none of the A students are taking it.
8798,"My professors look over the final, help the assistant to write it down, and are there when you review it, but the vast majority doesn‚Äôt go through any exam. Maybe for fun they look through a handful. They just have more important stuff to do, like research or forming a strong opinion on something irrelevant."
8799,I like it better than Moodle though 
8800,"One English professor of mine spent a good half of a class explaining to us why punctuation was the equivalent of training wheels for reading, and that old books (PhD in Medieval English) didn‚Äôt use them and everyone was just fine and we‚Äôve gotten lazy with our reading.  "
8801,Most importantly we know that his battery is at 29%
8802,My math teacher doesn‚Äôt use Canvas at all- not even as a gradebook. She uses mymathlab for everything. Which moots one of my favorite things: the ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù grades where you can change the grade of anything in the gradebook and see what your grade would be 
8803,"This is my wildest fantasy, and you are living it"
8804,Canvas squad rollout.
8805,But he charging it so...
8806,How do you like BME? What year are you? 
8807,"I've heard of it in a lot of classes where its a lower division large (>100 people) class. Also, I had heard of professors making it optional if you have a certain grade if the final is like the last final on the last day of finals to make it easier for all students."
8808,"I switched from BME to Mechanical Engineering after my 1st year, am currently a 2nd year. ME's classes are more math/problem-solving centered while BME classes are more like med school classes as you get deeper into the major. I definitely wanted to focus on engineering. So glad I did it, because all of my friends in BME are having trouble finding co-ops (internships). Meanwhile, as a ME, I had 2 offers from my first 2 interviews and had to cancel 4 other interviews.

Word on the street is that it's very hard to find a job/co-op in BME. It's more of a Masters program than a Bachelors program (and you can always get your Bachelors in ME and then a masters in BME)."
8809,"My school uses Google for their mail host, so my school drive is linked to my student account which is linked to Canvas "
8810,He has bluetooth on.  It is a bit counterproductive.
8811,Coming from the professor perspective... Canvas is much better designed. Much more responsive. Easier to use. And has a more useful feature set without the bloat.
8812,"Get used to just liquor on the rocks, no mixer (unless it's seltzer/soda water). It's cheaper and lower calorie than beer or wine.

Other than that, I got nothin'

Edit for anyone wondering: /u/decisive-beaver is mostly correct. I went to a very good (top 5 actually) law school, did securities work for a year, got Lathamed (what we called junior associates getting sacked in the recession), and fast forward a decade later, I'm an adjunct, picking up odd jobs tutoring, editing, etc.

It sucked pretty hard then, and I have no good advice. Except the booze thing, but that's more a good vice."
8813,So employers will intentionally fault you for the economy being bad? That seems rather short sighted and misguided.
8814,"[Fundamental attribution error](https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html). It sucks, but you have to work very hard to convince future employers that a stagnant period on your resume isn't a reflection of your character. In a broader sense, this is why you should always provide a situational explanation for any employment gaps or other weirdness in your resume because many people will make the most uncharitable attribution possible."
8815,Go to grad school lol.  It's safer there.
8816,This the genuinely the advice given to me by a really well known business alum from my school. They said the best way to beat the recession (they specifically talked about ‚Äò08) is to work on being even more skilled (likely grad school for college students) and to use that time with a bad economy to develop yourself and then as the economy strengthens make your debut into the labor market. The logic surrounded this was since your first job matters then try to delay getting your first job by staying in school until it‚Äôs a job you‚Äôd be comfortable receiving regardless of the economy.
8817,"My wife graduated around then with a bach in Interior Design. Nobody was hiring, so she worked as a waitress for a while, then kind of fell into IT recruiting through a family member. She currently still works in recruiting does well, and has a wall of design books she will never touch again."
8818,"Going to grad school to ride out the poor job market for a few years is a bad idea, you'll have massive student loans and the job market isn't guaranteed to improve, even if the stock market does."
8819,"Stalked through your profile. 
Man, you had it exceptionally rough.

I'm really sorry."
8820,"> Most companies have announced that they will be honoring job offers given to the class of 2020

lmao"
8821,"This is very true. A family member was out of work for over a decade because they were a stay at home parent and although they are qualified, it took them a while to find a job."
8822,Does anyone know if it will be the class of 2020 or 2021 that will be impacted more from this economic hardship? Most companies have announced that they will be honoring job offers given to the class of 2020. My fear is that companies will have to cut back their job offers substantially for 2021 graduates because these companies will still be recovering from the economic difficulties that COVID-19 will/has cause(d).

8827,I hated college as is. I don‚Äôt think Grad school is going to be for me lol
8828,"I can't really say for certain. I was a law school grad and we got hit really hard.

I knew some people who were nurses though, specifically obstetrics, and at first they were saying the recession doesn't matter because people are still having babies. ...True for folks already pregnant, but the recession did hit them later on as fewer people were starting families.

The basic rule is that if a company is selling to customers that are hit by a recession, then that company is also hit by the recession. People kept saying criminal defense lawyers, for example, would be fine because people still commit crimes -- but if your clients have less money, you can earn as much.

Or are you asking about their ability to mix better budget drinks?"

8838,"It really depends on your degree field.  I was in the sciences, so I got paid to be in grad school (PhD).  Not a lot, but it was a steady paycheck during a recession.  Even with unpaid grad programs, you can get paid as a TA or adjunct, which is what my sister did.

However, PhDs are challenging mentally and emotionally, so if you're not excited to do research and learn more, it would be a shit show."

8882,"I‚Äôm a senior in college. I had this mindset freshman year and it started fading away my second semester of sophomore year. College can feel like an intense competition. You want to excel so badly that it seems wrong to devote your time to anything else. The problem with this mentality is that dedicating all your time to studying is unhealthy and probably isn‚Äôt the best way to get ahead. As I‚Äôve progressed through university I‚Äôve come to realize that the relationships you develop from socializing, whether it be in a recreational or professional setting are more valuable than anything. Additionally, maintaining good mental health by balancing your time often leads to higher productivity in the long run. You may be able to keep this up for another another or even two or three, but your career lasts a lifetime. Do you want to spend your lifetime feeling guilty for not working? I think adopting a long term mindset can justify breaks from the books and make achieving balance easier."
8883,"what i‚Äôve learned from this thread is that school is ruining everyone‚Äôs mental health. not that this is new info really, but it‚Äôs odd that school is still structured in such an unhealthy and stressful way."

But in most circumstances you‚Äôre absolutely right, there‚Äôs a clearer divide between work time and home time."
8886,"I‚Äôm an engineer and the stress is still there, it‚Äôs just different. I don‚Äôt worry about hitting due dates a week out, but the work I do actually has weight and I can‚Äôt get it wrong.

I'm slowly working on stuff but I'm anxious about going to class tomorrow, so very anxious because those two professors I have tomorrow tend to call on people or make us talk, and I'm ashamed to say I don't know or haven't done it. It's crippling, but I might end up working all day (with breaks) the next two days to play the catch up game.

8932,"I used to feel guilty about it, but my dad kept telling me ""it's like I'm your employer and I'm paying you in the form of college tuition."" He would explain that it was an investment he was making; he spends a large sum of money on me now so he's not paying for my living expenses for the rest of my life. The sooner I get my degree, the sooner I move out and am no longer financially dependent and leeching off my parents. I don't come back to them with my problems seeking help; they can live worry free and spend 100% of their money on them in the future."
8933,"Not an immigrant parent but we are paying for our student‚Äôs college education as well.  We‚Äôre making sacrifices so we can pay but wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.  We don‚Äôt want to saddle our student with a huge amount of debt, plus parent love, plus our own experiences with debt led us to this decision.  My advice, take the gift and give back love and whatever else your parents value.  Our student has said and written us some pretty awesome things during their college experience.  Parenting is a really weird, emotional and unexplainable journey.  Sometimes we make choices that don‚Äôt make sense from a logical standpoint but make sense from the heart."
8934,No that is what is expected of parents if they can afford it. You pay them back by doing the same for your children
8935,As a student that has parents that aren‚Äôt helping pay for college don‚Äôt feel guilty. If your parents can/ are willingly to help you appreciate it!
8936,"yep, this. you work hard now and take advantage of what they did for you. then you provide a good future for your children and set them up well. take care of your parents when they're old too!"
8937,"Yes. I feel guilty that my parents have sunk so much money into my education, health and well-being that it‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm *very* stubborn about being independent and paying for what I can. I asked my mom how I should pay them back and she just says that when I get my degree and have a decent enough job where I can afford to travel like I want to someday, I should take her along on my trips. My dad says that I should just remember to visit and call every other day to update them on my life.

Parents just want to see their kids happy and successful. Just helping out wherever you can and showing a little gratitude for all they do for you is enough. When you get your degree and find a job, talk it up to your parents and tell them all about it, and thank them for helping you get this far. They‚Äôll be happy that you‚Äôre happy"
8938,"Great answer. I‚Äôm a parent too who desperately wants to fund both my kids college. Debt is a dirty word to me and I don‚Äôt want them to have any. It has taken years of sacrifice, watching other families go on huge yearly vacations while we stay close to home, and the sacrifices will continue. My husband kind of disagrees to the point that I might have to ask them to find like $3000 a year to keep him feeling good about it. 

To the op, THANK YOU for your attitude and your sense of gratefulness! Please always tell them of and show them with your appreciation. When you have a great family, visit them often with their grandchildren!!"
8939,Exactly! Not all of us have that privilege and we should be grateful
8940,This^
8941,"Yup, my grandparents paid for part of my college and I felt like I had to go well to make good of their money, it would be insulting if I failed and wasted their investment."
8942,"I was in the same boat 21 years ago. And it weighed heavy on me especially when I was struggling with some of my engineering classes, I remember getting bad grades on an exam made me think I was such a waste of resources and the money could have been helping my family with other things.

I suffered alone at the time because I didn't want to be more of a burden. Years later after I graduated and my mother was sharing pictures of my graduation with a friend of hers and she had a beaming smile while talking about them sending me to get my education.

After the friend left, I told my mother how I was struggling at the time and of the guilt I felt about them spending all the money on me. I was speaking fast and was avoiding eye contact since mental feelings and such isn't really a thing you talk about because of the negative connotation that comes with. When I finally looked up to see her reaction, I just saw tears running down her cheeks which kind of freaked me out a little (my mother is very strong woman). She just hugged me and said she didn't know I struggled in that way with it, and she said that me getting an education and doing better in life than they did is the dream of all parents.

I then told her that it was so much money at the time, she said yes but it was one of the best investments they made in providing us kids with an education. She then told me I would understand when I have kids of my own. Then she hit me in the feels when she said that the fact that I cared that much about them and their time and money, means the combination of parenting and education had created a good thoughtful person. Then being my mother and realizing I was tearing up, she started teasing about when I will give her grandchildren.

I teared about a little now thinking about all of that. My baby daughter is in her crib a few feet away from me, and now I understand what my mother is talking about. I make good money and would be totally okay living in a van by the river if it meant giving all my money and resources to help my daughter do better in life.

So, the best thing you can do is keep doing well in school and improving your life, because the joy you give them from that is immense even if you don't realize it."
8943,"Be thankful that your parents love you and were able to save up money for you to go to college. There are many students that are not as fortunate. 

You should only feel guilty if you aren't taking college seriously and start failing classes when your parents are paying for it."
8944,I'm paying for my own college. But I still feel that way sometimes.
8945,Ha no don't feel bad. Enjoy the joys of higher education without worrying about crippling debt and working in college like the most of us. You're parents are doing this for you because they love you and have the chance to afford to this.
8946,"I feel the same way with my dad as well. He pays for my education (I live at home though) and it‚Äôs not cheap... He just wants me to be happy and not have to worry about debt like he did, so I know the best way I can repay him is doing well in school and striving for what I want. 

Also, my personal goal is being successful enough in life that if he needs me to help take care of him (nursing home, place to live, etc.) I can afford to do that for him. He‚Äôs done a lot for me and I think it‚Äôs only the minimum amount that I could pay him back ü•∞"
8947,Yep im one semester in and im pretty sure im wasting their money and gonna turn into a disappointment
8948,"I‚Äôm the daughter of an immigrant family as well my dad always told me his goal in this country to know that everything was worth it was me and my brothers getting into college and graduating , I‚Äôm the youngest and I got in and my dad is paying and one day I‚Äôll be able to repay him for all he‚Äôs done. Be grateful not too many parents can do that or are willing too and one day you can pay your family back that kindness"
8949,"I‚Äôm in pretty much the same boat here. Even after getting married and starting graduate school, my parents are still covering my education and related expenses and I still feel a lot of guilt about it. Despite the fact that my parents are pretty well-off and they started saving for my education when I was born, I still have a deep feeling that I should take some responsibility for myself. I‚Äôve talked a lot about it with my mom and honestly just telling her how I feel has really helped me deal with it. It kind of allowed her to tell me why it was important to her to do this for me. I know they wouldn‚Äôt want me to pay back the money they‚Äôve spent directly but my hope is that one day I can make enough money to give some nice things back to them, maybe I‚Äôll buy them a vacation one day or help them out with something they need. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really a way to be totally free of the guilt but it helps me feel better to be committed to doing something good that benefits my parents someday."
8950,Same
8951,"Hey I was in the same position as you. I tried my best to graduate within 3 years double majoring (and i did just last quarter!). I wanted to save my parents' money. I looked for a part time job so I can cover my own living and food expenses while they only covered solely my tuition, or I would feel even worse. Now that I am graduated, I still do feel bad because I do not have a job currently and am living under their roof. I cook for them and clean for them because I felt bad for being out of the house for so long and having nothing to repay them. I know they worry about my job and future so if I were to go back, I wished I tried even harder in school than worrying about financial issues. I kept worrying that my parents are stressing over my tuition and I felt horrible so i would work many hours of my part time job along with school and barely eat because I needed the money to pay rent. 
You can repay them back in the future. Our parents #1 thing that breaks them is seeing their own children struggle. Your worries are normal and maybe one day you guys can sit down and talk about them. For now, I would invest your time in school and that internship lined up! Make your parents proud with your achievements."
8952,"Everyone comes from a different path in life; some have been given money and others have been given other stuff like great family, extraordinary skills, other stuff etc. What only matters is how you can use what you have been given and put it to good. I think you're doing good so far :)"
8953,They chose to have you why should you feel guilty
8954,"Your parents love you enough and are able to support you. My parents foot about 50% of living expenses (bills, food, etc) but I‚Äôm paying for the college part, getting a degree that‚Äôs useless and will be in debt for. Your smart SnD your parents are kind to use the resources they have."
8955,Capitalism got you feeling guilty on parents providing for an ever expanding list of basic needs needed to survive the real world.
8956,"I'm in the same boat you are except that I still work because I made financial choices that I don't expect nor want them to take care of. They said the deal was that they'll keep paying so long as I actually stick to my degree and don't drop out again (which I did the first time due to a massive mental breakdown and the second time to help out the family when my older sister was unfortunately diagnosed with cancer). 

One of the things mom told me recently is that it'll all be worth it when they see me finally walking to get my degree and they can show off to their friends that both their kids are college educated (something both of them value very much because they grew up in communist Cuba and my dad had to drop out at 14 to help feed his family). It'll all be worth it in the long run, dear, and I think the best way to say thank you is not only by keeping up your grades and doing the best you can, is by taking care of yourself and make sure you're doing okay and if you'd like, do little things here and there around the house for them. They only want the best for you and anything you can do/contribute will be much appreciated."
8957,Yep i feel bad even though my parents are just essentially giving me a 0 intrest loan and financial aid has pretty much cut my costs in half
8958,"> I hope to pay them back one day but they said they wont take any of my money

Spend a lot of time with them. Maybe treat them to a nice breakfast/dinner every once in a while once you are financially  stabilized. At the end of the day a good parent wants to sacrifice for their child. Why else would they have one? It makes me sad that there are some bad parents that throw their kids away. 

I am paying for all of my university solo, but my family still sacrifices for me in other helpful ways. 

The way I dont feel guilt is by vowing to somehow return the favor to someone else one day. Even if I dont have kids, Ill for sure know a kid and Ill help them out. Hell I can help out my siblings. Make sure we are all alright. I know my parents would not want it any other way."
8959,No because they aren‚Äôt paying
8960,Same here and it's that appreciation that I think keeps me moving forward when things get tough and hectic.
8961,I feel worse that I'm paying it myself.

8963,"Trump has been going about downplaying the severity of the pandemic. So he tried to push the nation to re-open despite having no protocols to safely do it. Then when shit went downhill, instead of doing his job to repair things, he goes and spread lies and misinformation.

This whole thing with ICE is because he has no say in how/when the schools re-open, so he pull this bullshit in an attempt to force schools to re-open physically. To have students go back in person despite all the risks. That way he can say everything is ""normal"". Secondly it plays to garner more support from his xenophobic followers.

I guess he is so use to people just ignoring or submitting that he didn't anticipate this much retaliation. However, I don't think this will be the end of it. I'm sure the psycho will try again. Maybe not the same thing, but with something equally horrible.

Edit: Typos."
8964,The fact that this had to happen in the first place is beyond ridiculous
8965,Fuck yes
8966,What a pathetic attempt from Trump to throw red meat at his base
8967,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what he was going for. I think it was an attempt to force universities to hold classes in person
8968,"Well I think the reason was for him to get support of parents of these kids and students who lean right who want to go back to school. Speaking from myself his move of forcing to reopen schools at least gave me some hope for my life to return even if it would never happen. 

Oh and you also got to consider most republicans value individualism rather than communalism  so they would want schools to reopen regardless of the potential of spreading the disease. 

I'm just saying some shit Trump says actually resonates with people."
8969,He was trying to force school's hands into opening
8970,"I wish the field would make pushes like this for other issues, but damn this is an incredible victory! I have so many international students who were wildly stressed this last week, and to be able to welcome them back to school (from afar of course lol) warms my heart! 

Power in people > People in power"
8971,But with only one month remaining before the semester starts? I mean for the fall semester it would be a logistical nightmare if not impossible to fill all those spots
8972,I think it was probably both
8973,">This whole thing with ICE is because he has no say in how/when the schools re-open

This is true for a whole range of issues, foreign and domestic. But the federal government does have many 'levers' to pull to get what it wants."
8974,It was both. Much of Trump's base thinks university is for liberal indoctrination; to simultaneously keep thousands of immigrants (highly skilled or otherwise) out of the country while also harming these institutions of indoctrination is a win-win for them.
8975,He‚Äôs so fucking insane I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs playing some sort of 4d chess or if he is just stupid.
8976,He's just plain stupid. The people around them are imagining they are  playing 4d chess while in reality the ultra rich and brainwashed Christians are telling them how to win while donating checkers.
8977,"I don‚Äôt blame them if international students would prefer to go to the UK, Western Europe, Australia and etc. You can still get a great education, and frankly it‚Äôll probably be a lot cheaper too"
8978,"Out of curiosity, does this mean international students in ""hybrid"" colleges have the option to opt for a fully online course schedule? Or, is this only for colleges which have gone completely online."
8979,Any body can take fully online classes
8980,"/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump 

He, uh, tends to contradict himself sometimes."
8981,"Yep, and this backtracking doesn't really make students feel better. Sure, there's the relief that they won't be kicked out but now they know just how close the US's finger is to the trigger. 

The last order came out of nowhere on some boring Tuesday. What's to stop them from ordering something even worse tomorrow? Or next week? Next month? Any time in the next 3 years? Trump could announce today that he's cancelling all visas and that all non-citizens must leave, and I'd be horrified and outraged, but I wouldn't be *that* surprised anymore. I wouldn't doubt the news was true because it'd be entirely ""on brand"" for the US.

It's a lot of stress for people to go through. Even if they decide to stay, it's going to colour their view of the country. Plus this whole ordeal played out on the nightly news in other countries, everyone knows about it and it might dissuade them. Whether or not a university is good is utterly irrelevant to the world (and to academia) at large if the immigration system is unstable. A lot of the people who make your universities good and who will make them good in the future are on non-immigrant visas today."
8982,bold of you to assume Europe‚Äôs policies are as bogus as this administration‚Äôs
8983,[deleted]
8984,"Forcing schools to reopen prematurely would delay everyone's life trajectories, Rugged individualism should not be the principle of publicly funded institutions focused on delivering public goods. Schools will definitely reopen, but it will be up to parents, students, states and local school districts despite what the administration's claim of absolute powers."
8985,"https://www.businessinsider.com/foreign-students-pay-up-to-three-times-as-much-for-tuition-at-us-public-colleges-2016-9

Not sure if this holds up today but the xenophobia on display here isn't a solution and will only cause more problems funding higher education."
8986,"Basically universities remaining online doesn't go well with the ""we‚Äò‚Äôre doing great"" narrative he is trying to make you believe."
8987,"Alot of horrible things have went under the radar due to covid, it is the perfect distraction for this administration and their beneficiaries. Environmental laws were relaxed; dumping harmful pollutants into the air and waters, the EPA is being evicerated, native american rights are trampled and many others. 

And one of the big reasons why this can be done is because the US has some of the most insular news coverage ever, misinformation, framing, straight-up lies are rampant. Misleading the public sometimes against their own good. This is not an environment for a stable democracy to function, this is a cesspool of nepotism, corruption, oligarchy and greed. 

I hope this tumultuous time will be the catalyst for a new system of checks and balances that insures the stabillity of the US."
8988,Thanks!
8989,"It's... interesting to see them actually speaking their mind now. Before, they all said that it was only the ""illegal aliens"" they didn't like and that they supported legal immigrants who work hard, assimilate, and follow the law. A lot of international students would be the poster-child of the ""good immigrant"".

But it's not a problem with legality. They just hate foreigners."
8990,"I just saw a trump ad last night in tv claiming how he had made the greatest economy we have ever seen (lmao) and that he made unemployment at record time lows (big lmfao) and that we need to vote for him because he‚Äôs a tough and smart leader.

I can‚Äôt believe anyone could genuinely believe the bs in the ad. He destroyed our economy and sky rocketed unemployment, and is the reason why over 100K Americans died."
8991,"> Seriously, what was the fucking point???

Precisely to scare off international students and immigrants."
8992,"I've purchased ""used"" access codes from places like amazon. They turned out to work fine and were much cheaper than the $70 the website offers it for. 

Once I purchased a code that turned out to not be for the right version of the book, but the book publisher's customer service hooked me up with a new code at no additional cost. I might have just been lucky though. But purchasing through amazon (good return policy) meant that I could buy that code for $30 or so and if it didn't work, I could just return it."
8993,"Also, as a professor, please please talk to someone if you're particularly hard up and can't afford texts/access codes.  Most universities have a fund to help students in need.

(I use free online textbooks for my classes, but I know there are still plenty of students in need)"
8994,Same here.
8995,[deleted]
8996,[deleted]
8997,Where do you go? Time to transfer
8998,I can vouch for this. my professors were the ones who suggested to buy from the website itself (instead of the pricey bookstore code)! They don‚Äôt want us paying more money than we have to either.
8999,"Yes, same here, for all of my classes that requires hw done through pearson, Cengage, Wiley, and one more that started with an M. Sometimes I could save $10 if I didn't want the hard copy of the text book. But that's it. 

I'd hardly call it a scam, just need to shop around."
9000,"yup. i buy from Chegg, Amazon, or VitalSource. For access codes, i usually go straight to the source like OP says. 

My school bookstore is useless and way too expensive. I just pay out of pocket ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
9001,"I see a lot of comments saying that access codes at their college's bookstore is the same as the one at the publisher's website. This is probably true for a lot of colleges, but not all of them. 

Some colleges/courses (like mine and OP) only list one or two options for purchasing course material. For example, there are two main ways to getting the access code: buying the access code separately and buying a textbook with the access codes. It's possible that OP's college only provided the textbook option. Getting the ebook version or buying a used textbook is usually a much cheaper option than buying a new physical textbook, so it's usually better to buy the access code separately.

Furthermore, some college bookstores only list access codes/subscription prices for maybe one semester. Sometimes for classes with multi-semester sequences like Calc and Chem, it can be advantageous to purchase multi-term access codes/subscriptions since that's usually cheaper. 

Again, colleges can have the opposite problem as above: they only offer multi-term access codes when you might only need a one-semester access code.

Finally, sometimes.colleges have prices that are actually cheaper than the normal publisher price. For example, my prof was able to talk to the college's publisher rep and get discounted prices for multi-term access codes so that the difference between 1 semester's worth and 4 semesters was like $14.

tldr: College bookstores often don't give you the full range of options that publishers offer, so it might be better for students to go see what option best suites their needs. Sometimes colleges have better options and sometimes publishers have better options."
9002,"10/10 recommend checking eBay for your books before buying them from anywhere else. Before you laugh, I got one of my books brand new from eBay (access code and all) for $120, when the bookstore and everywhere else wanted $250+. Other books I got for $20 when the bookstore wanted $50, and similar large discounts. Can‚Äôt hurt to check!"
9003,You can't pirate access codes for webassign/mastering access or the custom software publishers have to autograde homework problem.
9004,"I sell used books (and access codes) on Amazon. The access codes are unused, so still valid, but we have to list them under used since we‚Äôre reselling them. So they should be good no matter what, at least from my experience.

Tl;dr: buy used codes"
9005,I‚Äôve had teachers provide the textbook for free to me and I even told them I wasn‚Äôt hard for cash. I‚Äôve also had teachers recommend 235 dollar textbooks from the SPE.org website. Oftentimes the prof can contact the publisher and ask for a discount. The book store at PSU allows for so many pages free to scan and send to students.
9006,"Prof here - I use McGraw-Hill connect and in my pre-semester syllabus video I give a pretty clear walkthrough of how to buy direct through the website (very easy as I just post the first assignment link in Blackboard).

However - important thing here - some students are on scholarships where they MUST buy through the bookstore to get the full refund. If they bought online like we‚Äôre all suggesting, they get no refund.

I try to be as clear as possible about this, but do check your textbook refund rules of your scholarship!"
9007,"Personally never had my college charge me more for an access code. I will say this, the codes you buy with books come with books and I enjoy collecting (not reading) books."
9008,"Yeah definitely!

Some publishers also offer an ""unlimited"" option which means yiu can access all your material for every class if they use the same publisher. For example, Cengage unlimited allows you to access all your textbooks and webassign (hw) for all your classes using Cengage. This can be a lot cheaper if your Calc, Physics, and Bio classes all use Cengage and Webassign."
9009,See my school has $600 a semester we can charge to our student account for books so we dont have to pay. It comes from our tuition and since i alway wait until the professor says you need the book for the class i usually only ever use $200 of that $600.
9010,The concept of paying a small fortune to textbook publishers in order to turn in homework needs to die in a fire.
9011,"And I don't use the online access codes, but the publishers have actually offered my students a discount.  It's definitely worth comparing carefully."
9012,"This is also good because if you have any issues with your subscription, buying directly will mean better support. 

A month ago I bought from my school bookstore not knowing any better. Since I bought the code through my school, the publisher wouldn't help me. And every time I'd get the bookstore, they would turn me to the publisher. Out of frustration, I talked to the professor who got everything resolved in 24 hours. My professor had to intervene, get the sales rep for the school for the book/publisher, and force them to make it right. 

The error? The bookstore sent me the wrong code for the wrong program. Thankfully, it was the same publisher so they could fix it."
9013,"For a stem student if they do the research early and find out what books there teacher uses the multi semester ascces can SAVE tons of money. 


I bought the 2 year plan since I knew I would use it for atleast 4 semester's. I ended up getting 5 classes out if it and that brought down the price I would have paid per semester down by like $30 or more each semester"
9014,"This. I‚Äôve saved a couple hundred bucks this semester already by just going straight to the site itself and not going through the book store. Also, if you‚Äôre like me and would like a hard copy book instead of the ebook for some subjects Amazon rental is has been a blessing as well."
9015,"Yeah, that's what I did, a 2-year sub through Cengage. I also like that I can technically add any ebook for free, so if I need lab help I can try to look up lab manuals and see if they have an answer that I'm looking for. Plus some people like to read textbooks, so they have a lot you can just find and read."
9016,This is the way
9017,"The scam is the book price and code in the first place, hope teachers do more with Open Education Resources, there are tons of free and peer-reviewed books out there for all subjects. Students advocate for these, most teachers are open but have no idea they exist. One source of many, OpenStax."
9018,"Yea same, my college bookstore actually price matches too"
9019,"My school charges *less* than the website. I'm not sure how, but I'm not complaining"
9020,I love AbeBooks.
9021,"I second this, I was able to buy two of my textbooks for dirt cheap on eBay by using the make an offer option. Because you‚Äôre usually buying them from another student who just wants more than the $20 the bookstore will give them you can usually get a good deal."
9022,Thank you! I feel really proud of myself :)
9023,It‚Äôs huge!!! Congratulations
9024,"You have every right to feel proud. Fantastic job! I love to see students improve their GPA instead of going the other way. Celebrate your victories, that‚Äôs not a minor accomplishment."
9025,"2.74 going into my soph year, COVID hit and i buckled down and brought it from a 2.74 to a 3.32 in 4 semesters. Damn proud of that"
9026,Wonderful! I'm so proud of you!!
9027,"Keep going. I know exactly what you are going through. I had a 1.8 GPA after like 2-3 semesters, it opened my eyes and I have been grinding ever since. Should end with a 3.0 after this next semester."
9028,Congrats!! :)
9029,Good job! That's an amazing accomplishment!
9030,"good job! failed two years of school, got kicked out of my uni with a 1.7 gpa

now i‚Äôm at community college and passed all my classes! now at a 3.0 i‚Äôm so happy 

let the celebration ensue for the both of us"
9031,Great job as starting my first semester and ending it on such a good note. You should be happy and this proves that through hard work I can definitely get my GPA up from a 2.75.
9032,"Good job man! even small victories like these are the ones we must appreciate the most. Keep going, and i wish you the best of luck on getting your gpa higher! :)"
9033,Congratulations!
9034,That‚Äôs a big positive change! Major congratulations!!
9035,each time you redid a semester how much did it go up?
9036,"Seriously, proud of you!"
9037,it's truly unbelievable
9038,Congratulations üéäüéâüéà
9039,Nice! Keep up the great work!
9040,not all schools offer it but mine has course recovery where you can retain a d/f course online to replace the grade
9041,congrats
9042,CONGRATS!!!
9043,YAAAAYYY
9044,"That's great! Any improvement shows sincerity, maturity, and should be celebrated!!! CONGRATS FOR REALS AND KEEP GOING!"
9045,"You should be proud, well done!"
9046,"That's a whole 4/5, that's impressive. GPA gets harder to move in either direction as you continue, but you will likely only go up from here."
9047,"Woooo! You go, that‚Äôs awesome!"
9048,Great work!
9049,"LFG OP! Onwards and upwards, this kinda post gives me hope cuz this semester was rough to say the least!"
9050,Congratulations! That‚Äôs actually a huge accomplishment!!!
9051,Congratulations!
9052,"Thanks for the feedback.  The like ""two week out"" reminders are what I'm thinking of primarily.  Our LMS doesn't do anything automated or show ""upcoming"" until too close to the deadline a lot of times.  Of course, I'd also send out reminders like two hours prior to deadlines ""Hey, much sure you hit submit!"""
9053,As long as there's a way to turn it off and you're also using whatever the defacto communication method is for your uni. I like getting all my notifications by email because that is what most teachers use. I would get confused if I had to check texts for one class and emails for another.
9054,Two weeks out is probably too far away to be useful. Try two days out.
9055,"Yeah, that's a tough one.  I always tell people to make you Upload AND Submit, and then download your submission to make sure it's right.  I try to flexible where I can, but unfortunately there are always students who try to scam the system.  

ie,

Student: I forgot to submit, it didn't work.

Me: Okay, email it to me right now.

Student: Okay, I'll email it to you tomorrow.

Me: If it's done, you shouldn't need 8 hours.

Student: Well, I actually need to finish it. I can't send it since it's not finished.

..."
9056,YES PLS
9057,Great point.  This would be in addition to the LMS and nothing would be ONLY available via text.  It would be totally opt in and students could unsubscribe or block it at any time.
9058,For one of my classes us students have setup a groupme chat where we send out reminders for all of our up coming assignments. We find it extremely helpful so that we dont forget an assignment.
9059,"I had this in high school and the amount it saved my was a lot. I wish college professors would do that but on another hand it prepares you for the real world. But during something like this with no face to face, I think it's a great idea!"
9060,[deleted]
9061,Yes!
9062,this would be so helpful
9063,"Absent-minded procrastinator here. If a student genuinely forgot about the assignment, then two hours might not be long enough to put together a semi-decent paper. Maybe send out the text around noon, so they have a 12 hour heads up?"
9064,One of the main problems that I feel like I have right now is the constant changing and updating of deadlines. I like to plan and schedule myself to ensure adequate time for each assignment or exam and I feel like deadlines and expectations change nearly daily. The format of these changes comes in many delivery methods such as email or blackboard but rarely both. I don‚Äôt think it would be helpful to have text reminders unless they were used consistently for all assignments for that course.
9065,"That‚Äôs a really nice thing to do and I‚Äôm sure your students would appreciate it considering the chaos and lack of structure in these crazy times. 

Just to play devil‚Äôs advocate though, we‚Äôre all adults and we should be expected to remember when our work is due. Sending out an email reminder is already being kind, as most of my professors say that if something is in the syllabus, we‚Äôre responsible for it, end of story. I‚Äôm still a student so I can‚Äôt speak from personal experience what the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù is like, but I can‚Äôt imagine the same kindness being awarded to us in the workforce. I don‚Äôt want to come off as unsympathetic for those who find themselves back home with dysfunctional families, lack access to technology, or have recently lost loved ones, but I just wanted to give a dissenting opinion since no one else has.

I‚Äôm extremely opposed to professors who try and make their courses difficult for the sake of difficulty, but I see this as the polar opposite. Regardless, I really appreciate professors like yourself who care about the success of their students and are willing to do more work so that we can have less. We all have a duty to be kind to one another in these difficult times and help each other in any way we can (Just don‚Äôt let your kindness get taken advantage of!)."
9066,You can also use the Remind app! It's an app that let's you have and join classrooms that you can message without giving away your private number.
9067,"I think this would be a great idea, as long as it's an opt-in. Personally, I stay on top of my work, usually getting things done a day or two in advance, and getting reminders about my work would a) stress me out and/or b) just be annoying. However, I know that a lot of students would probably greatly benefit from something like this!"
9068,"No, you're just increasing your attack surface area for lazy students, or diligent students that stick to original deadlines.  Imagine if you change a due date by either advancing or retarding it, but the update doesn't get sent out over text; are you prepared to not take off points for late work in the event of such a discrepancy?  


Technology will fail you at the most inopportune time."
9069,"Do people really not know how to set up a planner/calendar on their own? I get that things are different but it‚Äôs really not hard to set a reminder in your own phone or get a paper planner and write it down. 

Your future boss isn‚Äôt going to be texting you to remind you to do your job."
9070,"YES. I have a professor who creates the assignment the middle of the day that it‚Äôs due. I create my weekly calendar on Sunday, and if I don‚Äôt see an assignment that day it doesn‚Äôt get written down. Well, I‚Äôm now failing the class because I missed an important quiz and I was already struggling to make good grades on other assignments."
9071,"As a student, I personally hate getting emails. I need text messages. I totally support this idea!"
9072,"I get the point about the real world, but many things in the real world DO have text reminders now.  I get text reminders for my power bill, gas bill, etc.  College is hard enough, no need to make it artificially harder (IMO)."
9073,That would be amazing! I'm usually great at planning but I forgot to watch a doc that was going to be discussed in class. I was stressing the whole time waiting to be asked a question about it. I would have totally watched it if I remembered to.
9074,"Yes, yes, 100% yes."
9075,Yes!!!!
9076,"One of my professors has a whatsapp group with the class where he is always available for questions and always reminds us for classes, quizes and anything else we might be doing. It‚Äôs the only class I am consistently following in this semester."
9077,"This is a really good idea! In high school my teachers used remind which was nice as i wasn‚Äôt checking my email at all in hs. We would get a text on the app or our phone numbers directly that assignments were due or extended etc. 

I think it‚Äôs great that you want to take this extra step and although some may say it‚Äôs the students fault for not paying attention etc. life happens. Sometimes things take precedent and things get in the way, i know out of all the assignments i had to do for my online classes the only ones i ever was late on or missed was discussion board comments as i lost track of the days they were due or where i had finished an assignment but hadn‚Äôt submitted it yet as i wanted to take one last look at it to review after i took a break from looking at it and would come close to forgetting to submit it that night. 

Obviously it would help a lot with the current situation but even in normal situations students have jobs and families and most are involved in some type of club or athletic event where sometimes those are up in the air. I know my practice schedule was constantly changing so that would sometimes throw me off. 

But i think it would also benefit professors from getting many emails about students who forgot a deadline but did the work etc. 

Depending on the class/assignment I think the idea of sending out one reminder 24 hours before the due date is helpful."
9078,My professors all do a weekly email of exactly what is do for the week and I reference it often.
9079,Especially now with all this zoom stuff. I get tons of emails daily but I don‚Äôt really like email and would like some sort of reminder through texts

I saw the same guy around our common area and in the dining hall all the time during first semester and then he was in my lab group in one of my classes second semester so I actually got to be friends with him. Funny how things work out like that.
9114,"Not if, you know, you approach the situation and say it like a normal human being."
9115,All the time! Just casually mention that you see them around a lot and ask about their major. I met some of my friends that way.

9120,"Walking on campus once I mistakenly thought I recognized a dude approaching me from a distance, so I gave him an up-nod instead of the standard stranger down-nod. He up-nodded back.

I'd see him every week or two for a few years. We gradually progressed to up-nods & short hand-waves, but never further. Not a single word was ever exchanged between us."
9121,"Sure, it is curious. Not everyone is brave enough to make the climb, jump that gap. Go and talk to them, who knows what might come of it.

Storytime: I remember there was a girl I had seen in some of my classes. Then I started noticing her whenever I was returning from my workouts. I've lost about 40kgs and was exercising pretty hard those days but she was sort of overweight but still a cute girl. I remember her looking at me whenever I came out of the running ground, pretty much every other day.

 Well, one day she started showing up to exercise. She started running, I would run a few laps and go rest for some time and she would rest after a single lap in the beginning. My resting spot was a few feet ahead of her, slightly diagonally. I used to feel her eyes digging holes in the back of my head all the time. I could tell that she wanted to talk to me but was being shy and having a hard time coming out of her bubble to do so. But so was I. Also, I had just lost my grandmother that month and was just sad in general. 

Well, one day I ran - hard - and when I was pumping from all the adrenaline, I walked over and introduced myself. We made small talk, I didn't get her number - I did that the next day. We started running together soon. Well, today she may not like me or admire me or anything but she is my crush. She's also the most beautiful girl on my campus. My story doesn't have an ending as of now, but my point is that just a small, tiny moment of courage can give you a story, and maybe the other person is afraid to make that leap, but you always can."
9122,Then they are weirdos and nothing of significance is lost
9123,"I started a conversation with my guy one day. We  push off all our studies for hours talking every day. He's really sweet and helps me with my projects. He's also the first guy I've clicked with on our small campus. Our age difference and my mom status makes this an unrealistic match.  It's kind of a bummer because we do have amazing chemistry. My point is, reach out. Maybe this person is your next adventure."
9124,You should hit her up in one of the non-English languages she speaks
9125,One of us. One of us.
9126,"I am not sure, but that could be me"
9127,"Facebook friends are such weird things honestly. Back in second year I had a ton of people added who I never spoke to again, meanwhile I had actual real life friends in my major who I sat next to everyday but weren't official facebook friends with, we were still connected on messenger to talk about stuff though. I only took the plunge and added them during the summer break after I had already known them for a year and done tons of shit together."

9142,"There are two angles to approach this. 

First, I'm not a therapist but I am a person with depression and I remember feeling like this, particularly about college. Getting professional help for my depression has really helped me to improve my outlook and the amount of energy that I have to put into the whole process.

Second, I think it might be helpful to explore why you want to be a doctor. Figure out where your motivation is and use that as the source of your action. Look at Masters and PhD program requirements and figure out how much you need to do to get yourself there. 

I'm in the last semester of my senior year and my major requires we attend weekly seminars with staff from other universities. There's been a good deal of discussion about what schools are looking for in masters and PhD students, particularly with the difficulties of COVID keeping us off campus, and what I am hearing programs say is that they are looking for students with with drive and excitement as much as grades and experience.

Find what drives you."
9143,Felt this through my bones
9144,"This is a mood. I felt like this since high school because i was struggling with my horrible mental health. On one hand, some of my classmates with loving parents who raised them to be successful and who had a great group of friends got into Brown, UC Berkley, ect. Meanwhile, I was too busy trying not to kill myself bc of bullying, lack of friends, having to hide my identity from my parents, my shit grades, my shit SAT, shit AP scores, and not being useful like my peers who were fortunate in their situation.

I swear, shit's rigged against those who dont have it perfect."
9145,"My hypochondria / severe health anxiety is like 24/7 torture  ive tried to think my way out of it. it doesnt work. therapy failed, genuinely dont know what to do. and i believe the covid lockdown is exacerbating it, if i was out there living my life, i dont think i would have such anxious thought loops. but in person school is still 6 months away. ahhh dont knoe what to do fuck

&#x200B;

 have 24/7 hypochondria / health anxiety. i just rot in my room doing homework all day and stressful exams, just rotting, stress, and anxiety. and depression. i want to live my life but still have 5 more months in jail"
9146,Thanks for this comment. I think some of the dommsday stuff is my depression speaking I think the rest of it is just capitalism. We‚Äôre worked like mules for our whole lives and never get a damn break to just LIVE and be humans. It‚Äôs high school then college then grad school then work til you finally retire. And thats for those of us privileged enough to be able to do well enough in one of the aforementioned to even get to the next. The system‚Äôs fucking over everyone. But ig I can‚Äôt really do much about that alone so I will take your advice and figure out whats really pushing me to be a doctor in the first place. I know its what I want to do I just need to keep pushing myself to get there.
9147,"I feel that as a pre-med too. I literally never feel like I'm doing enough, instead, there's so much more that I should be doing. As a pre-med comparing yourself to others is inevitable, in fact, it's practically built in the curriculum: you have to be the best of the best. It's so frustrating and I feel like a robot. And imposter syndrome is so realllll ugh."
9148,"you don't have to be the president of a club

you don't have to be a straight a student

9153,"Do all of us a favor and don't become a therapist. 

maybe see one though."
9154,"I agree with you that I really don't learn anything in the majority of my classes, except for two. 

However, I disagree with you on the ""you also have to be the president of a club and do research and volunteer etc etc."" You really don't have to do all of those things. Just pick a few things to focus on and become great at them. For example, you can prioritize your grades and be president of a club that has to do something with premed. Or you can prioritize your grade and focus your time on research."
9155,....wow lmao yikes
9156,"Damn I really empathize with u. I have major focus issues and depression (which school exacerbates to almost unmanageable levels) so I kind of feel what you‚Äôre goin thru. On the bright side, summer‚Äôs in less than 2 months so hopefully you won‚Äôt have to worry about classes and have that shit add to your stress then."

9160,major in accounting and mediocrity is rewarded with countless job offers from local governments and companies
9161,Fr man I feel you. Ive struggled w a shit ton of mental issues since HS too and they got worse in college. People w privilege just keep getting exactly what they want and are given the opportunity to get to exactly where they want to be while the rest of us pick at their scraps. It‚Äôs why the rich stay rich and the rest of us keep getting poorer.
9162,Yup. I was just about to comment that Op‚Äôs discovered his purpose as a worker peon in an r/latestagecapitalism society. Glory to our billionaire overlords!
9163,"There is at least a little bit of a reason this is happening, though it's not good. 

\~2008, a lot of high level employees were laid off. They were then forced to apply to work in a lot of entry level jobs, and a lot of companies would require this to weed out newgrads and prioritize people with experience. It just never really fully went back because as it turns out, industry liked paying more qualified people less money. 

Also, everything is getting too saturated. We have almost *too many* students/graduates with good qualifications, which raises the expectations for those who get selected. It doesn't exactly help that a lot of the people pursuing these programs/jobs/etc are going after the best ones (reasonably so) which have very high requirements to make it in. 

Honestly, you're right for feeling this way. This shit sucks. The pandemic doesn't help because it's very hard to build resume skills and such when mentally this pandemic is taking a toll on all of us, and distance learning is just not for most people. If I weren't as far in my program as I am, I would have dropped out until the pandemic is over tbh."
9164,OP wants to be a doctor I think they'd find out real quick about that one.
9165,"Hey I know this is every pre meds biggest trigger but I was pre med until 3 weeks ago, have yo thought of PA school? Ever since I sat down and prioritized my mental health and what I want for life I decided to go pre-pa. It might be something to look into OP. 

I would also advise you to start thinking about ehat you want for yourself in life even if you don't meet these goals and what would still make you happy. Don't forget to take care of yourself first and remember even if you aren't a doctor you still kicked ass. Its okay not to become a doctor and your mental health and happiness are first priority. Just remember at the end of the day life is about LIVING don't slave away and miss everything because your so focused on the future. If you need to take a break take a break it will be okay I promise you it will be."
9166,"The reason for this is because there aren‚Äôt as many jobs as people think. And choosing to be a doctor is a tough decision if it‚Äôs based on pay and your parents weren‚Äôt doctors. 

Now we have a major amount of computer science students who suck at engineering and are about to go through hell to land what‚Äôs been promoted to them as a golden ticket to a decent salary when that‚Äôs not even the case. CS is a field with ageism, sexism, and you actually have to be good. They fire a lot of people and have a lot of job hoppers for salary increase because it‚Äôs a money game. 

College is essentially a waste of time if you don‚Äôt have a plan and if you choose a major for money you‚Äôll always be looking for something to do with your life to get out."
9167,"Ikr, sucks that those ppl also pay hella lip service to things like ""mental health awareness"" while crapping on us and saying that we ""just work hard and get over it.:"
9168,"Doctor here, if something seems off in my writing i wanna ask for your pardon upfront since not my native language. 
Pre med and even all the way thru med school it is inevitable to feel like this, its just a recipe for chaos/depression/anxiety, what i can tell you is, be happy with what you are and where you are. 
It can get really hard to find light in this long tunnel called medicine but i can tell you that it will be found eventually, you are not doing an ordinary thing, you are preparing to work on whats most valuable which is someone‚Äôs health/well being, you cant think expectations wont be high.
Theres gonna be perfect scores, presidents for whatever club/society, just keep rowing buddy. You sooner than later realize the books dont apply for even half the stuff you will see out there, concentrate in grasping clinical data, any doctor can ask for a wide spectrum of image/laboratory tests but the one who studied for life and not for the test is the one who will ask a single study and know even before they come in what the patients disease could be."
9169,"Fuck man. That‚Äôs the issue w this goddamn system. Work never stops and if you stop doing the work, you‚Äôre at the bottom. Its fucked up."

9172,"I was .03% away from an A in my capstone class. Despite the clear ""I don't round up"" policy stated in the syllabus, she still gave me that .03. I think most professors are pretty reasonable, they just get super annoyed with people who beg or get rude about grades. That same professor has told me some horror stories of students who thought they could demand or threaten in order to get a better grade."
9173,"My dad always told me ""You don't shoot, you don't score"". I would 100% e-mail the professor, if it's a 1% difference. Explain that it would improve your GPA and ask if you could do some extra work for them to round it up."
9174,good idea thanks
9175,N don't go if he asks you to come over
9176,But if you want that A you best go
9177,"The only time I got slightly rude was with an instructor who didn't post grades the entire semester then just submitted the grades to the university. No way to verify if it's correct at all. I had her email me a breakdown of both of my grades (two classes). I don't understand what's so difficult about putting grades in the online gradebook, as all of my other professors do. I like being able to check my grades throughout the semester and calculate what i need for a certain grade. There was one time where I could have used less than a point to go from A to A+ but it was my fault for missing the extra credit meeting. The only people demanding and threatening are people who didn't try and don't deserve the grade."
9178,Worst he can say is no. You loose nothing by trying.
9179,"Professor here. Go ahead and email them. Phrase it delicately has has been mentioned in previous comments. You can ask to see your test, what you missed, why you got an 81 and not an 82.

Just keep in mind that your professor will probably not give you any extra work not available to other students and you will still probably come across as ""that person"". 

I do want to build on a point another commenter said in that you pay to access the school's resources. You sure do! But don't mistake those resources as an easy way to increase your grade."
9180,I‚Äôd email but word it politely and professionally. I‚Äôm much more willing to find an extra point somewhere for a student who puts in effort to send a nice email instead of ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm 1 point away from an A. Can you bump it?‚Äù
9181,"""""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take""  Wayne Gretzky"" Michael Scott"" This guy's dad"
9182,That makes it sounds like the beginning of a porno
9183,"Also a professor here -- don't email them. I just finished getting almost 20 e-mails identical to what you are suggesting. 

If students are really close to a cut-off point for the next letter grade, and they worked hard in the class and completed all the assignments, I will bump them up. However, if students didn't make an effort to submit every assignment or had profoundly late work, I won't bump them. Asking me by e-mail doesn't change my mind. 

And for everyone saying something to the effect of 'you have nothing to lose,' I might remind you that these kinds of conversations often go badly and are perceived as grade-grubbing or entitlement. It is an easy way to burn a bridge. If you suspect you might ever need a letter of recommendation from this person in the future, I would strongly advise against sending this e-mail."
9184,[deleted]
9185,"As a professor, I am fairly certain this is not an allowed practice. At least at my university, if I pull this trick, I'd get a very stern email from the provost."
9186,And make sure to add the Brazzers logo at the bottom of the email
9187,Don‚Äôt forget to add a ;)
9188,Or do
9189,"Yeah, that's a completely different situation and I can't fault you for that. I had a professor who was the same this semester and it was awful. Her horror stories are more along the lines of students who didn't show up to class for an entire semester and never turned anything in and then think they can demand a passing grade, or worse their parents get involved and think they can intimidate the professor."
9190,Not sure of A he'll get that D for sure
9191,They can put whatever they want in the syllabus but if it clashes with the institutions policy it's invalid
9192,nobody said that was out of the question
9193,Lol parents... Do they not realize that their child is a grown adult? My parents get a printout of my grades at the end of the semester to get a good grades discount on the insurance. That's the extent of them knowing what's going on with my degree.
9194,This is correct. University policy > syllabus. This kind of deduction is likely to lead to grade appeals.
9195,"Man my parents didn‚Äôt even go to orientation with me. I didn‚Äôt realize that was a thing that parents go to, then I felt super awkward being there alone haha. They supported me through college but also stayed out of it because I‚Äôm an adult, ffs."
9196,"OP, this is mostly a minority of professors. But do read the syllabus.

Your professor seems like a bitch btw."

9199,"if you aren't willing to go, then don't ask the question BRUH"
9200,"Sure, bump up the students who didn‚Äôt care enough about their grade to email you, while ignoring the student who cared enough to build up the courage and ask for a bump."
9201,"As someone who has been on the other side of this, the latter has never been more likely to get me to actually change a grade.

Either the professor will round up on their own because you are so close, or won't because they don't round up."
9202,"It‚Äôs sick
I was biology teacher in Taiwan.

My weekends that entire quarter were literally wake up, work on OS all day except for a couple quick food breaks (for a total of about 14 hours of work), go to bed, repeat the next day. Weekdays were more like 6-8 hours of OS each day, not counting class, plus my other classes. By some miracle that was my lowest grade that quarter at a B+. I still don't know how I managed to get high grades in my other classes when I felt like I never did anything for them, because OS took up all my damn time.

Fun fact, that quarter is the one that led to me breaking up with my college girlfriend because I had zero time for her with OS, lul."
9206,">This was a general education class and NOT my major. üòí

Is it just me, or is it almost always the general ed classes that make things needlessly time consuming? They also seemed to be the ones most likely to take personal offense that their class was not your number 1 priority in life.

I know that was true for my classes at least, save for one or two CS classes that were notorious time sinks. But those were more time sinks due to the complexity of the content and assignments, not the professor being super anal and thinking they're the center of your universe."
9207,"I have a discrete math class where the professor takes points off if your lines arent COMPLETELY straight. There are also like 50 other rules we need to remember and follow or else we get points off. I go to a community college so im not even surprised, every professor related to my major has been terrible."
9208,I swear there is no in between for ENG teachers/profs. In my experience they are super chill or hardasses.
9209,"Yes! It made me hate it. I had no interest in learning. My only saving grace was when I was complaining out loud to my husband at a store. We ran into a woman who was a biology teacher. We talked for a moment, and she mentioned all these great resources I was able to use. I told her it wasn't the material it was the teacher. I loved biology before. She was a really nice woman and I'm glad I met her."
9210,Upvote this 100x. I‚Äôve had a few classes where within the first day or two I knew it wasn‚Äôt worth the effort. Drop that shit so quick.
9211,"Surprisingly one of my minor classes, forensic techniques is my hardest class this semester. Its online so strictly textbook notes and a 10 minute overview video each week. The textbook feels like 2+2=4, but the quizzes and exams feel like advanced calculus. Its so bizarre."
9212,I‚Äôm so sorry you have to be in English. It‚Äôs true hell for everyone
9213,"I mean it sounds like you passed it because you put I the ungodly amount of work that was required, good on you but also Holy shit thats too much for a college student."
9214,"The whole credit hours thing is a lie. Whoever came up with this rule that credits = time spent is a fucking idiot.


All the lower-div courses here are 4 credits because they come with a lab. All the upper-div courses are 3 credits. My random gen ed lower-div that I spend 3 hours a week on because it's asynchronous is 4 credits. My systems course that I spend 10-20 hours a week on, and my software design course that I spend 10-20 hours a week on, are both 3 credits each. I'm taking 13 credits this semester and it by far has been more busy than my freshman year 17-20 credit semesters."
9215,...do you at least get a ruler for the lines? If not that might be an ADA violation if he's taking points off for free handed lines. Hand tremors are a very real thing.
9216,Yeah freshman year I took a 5-credit physics class that also had a lab. Physics is insane.
9217,"this is just power tripping.  she should then spend all day .. literally all day, no sleep no bathroom breaks, no showers, no food- on this then. since she was the one getting paid."
9218,"This is me with Physics! Still can't get over the fact 4/5 ""free attendances"" went to their off campus, non university supported, attendance app. It wouldn't let me log in. It'd crash, etc. Literally took pictures of myself in class with timestamps to prove that I was there. They said ""That's why you get 5 free :)"" each time I emailed. They assign homework on weekends, 2 sets of homework pelec/bridge sets a week. 2 discussions. Mandatory lab you don't even get full points for attending b/c the TAs are picky. Oh yeah, and their first exam? Nothing like the ~mandatory~ book you have to read, so I spent 10ish days studying wrong and failed b/c I focused more on the math. Oh, and they don't grade work on exams for partial, in a literal math based course. They said they don't have the resources but the class has 3 professors and 6 TAs. It's a teach yourself class, literally, they call it a ""flipped course"". Yet attendances is rigorous and work is extensive.

Never had a class make me want to drop an entire semester because of the stress. I can't even focus on my Physiology class because of it and my Human/Animal relationships class is lost on me. Being at campus is stressful. I've started having actual nightmares about the class.

This is an introductory Physics class, algebra based. It's harder and more work intensive than any 400, 500, or 600 class I've done. You'd think for people who study the laws and physical constraints of our world, they'd have more of a realistic grasp of an appropriate workload for their students."
9219,Now that I think about it this is spot on. All the English instructors I've had were either really lousy or amazing. No in betweens.
9220,That's what we were saying! She was tripping out how we kept telling her to calm her ass down. Each time she was like you NEED to know this stuff to pass. You need to recite this back to your family to make sure you've learned this and not just memorize it. Each class we kept telling her this isn't our fucking major. She was clinically insane and we didn't understand why.
9221,"I had a math professor who wouldn‚Äôt accept alternate forms. Lets say you have ‚Äò5x-3‚Äô

They would mark ‚Äò-3+5x‚Äô as incorrect"
9222,"Unfortunately that class just requires a lot of attention by nature. It's a very difficult course with a ton of moving parts. Most people struggle or will fail it. I barely made it with an A at the end of that course and I spent about as much time as the previous poster, but it wasn't worth the effort imo."
9223,"It was the last class I needed before transferring. Bio is really hard to get into, so I thought I could yolo it. I went into the class fully prepared to put in work no matter how long it took. It was the first time I heard that. You live and learn lol."
9224,"Hell Yeah.

I take 6 classes right now, one class Statistical Thermodynamics, is twice as hard as all the others COMBINED.

But I remember how annoyingly hard my freshman English class was. Like I was a taking intro physics, intro bio, calc, and theology philosophy but my hardest class was one where we had to write essays on stupid prompts‚Ä¶"
9225,"I'm an engineering major and somehow my writing workshop is the most demanding, requires attendance, and has the most stuck-up professor ever."
9226,"> My bio teacher straight up told us the class was going to be a full time job.

Good thing there are no college students with jobs or multiple classes."
9227,I have dysgraphia I'm very curious how such a teacher would accommodate me with a rule like that
9228,"Lol because a lot  of them only have worked in university and have no skills outside of their respective classrooms. That or they haven't been a part of the real world in a while. They forget about work-life balance because *they* find their subject important and expect the same out of you as a student. 

But that's not how life works."
9229,This semester I‚Äôm lucky enough where each class is the same amount of work or less. But I have had that class before and I usually zone out mid semester and stop putting so much effort.
9230, Biochem
9231,"I'm not sure. I've been going to community College for years because I didn't know what I wanted to do. This was the ONLY class I have where the teacher was super anal about everything. It was my first proctored class too. I took it during the pandemic lock down. The rest of my science, math & English weren't like this. I actually learned in those classes and the teacher actually wanted you to pass. I spent time on the assignments to actually learn. I don't understand why my bio teach was such a butthole."
9232,"Well, now I kind of want to read it."
9233,"Idk the results, but my caffeine is staying"
9234,I mean I drink a lot of caffeine just to stay up late just to meet assignment deadlines
9235,"Seems like an impossible study to conduct because there are so many factors at play when it comes to academic performance based on genetics, social status, number of working hours, number of credits being taken, your major, amount of sleep, mental and physical health, work ethic, etc etc. I‚Äôm just not sure how you can separate all that to get sound results."
9236,Where my link at? Trying to see which one I need more of.
9237,Think the frame of mind that would follow from tests verifying caffeine impedes academic ability would be that developing consistent sleep schedule > improved performance > no longer need to stay up late because body is functioning optimally
9238,"Yeah I agree.  Far too many independent variables to make a conclusion.  I‚Äôd like to see the assumptions and methodologies.  (Not saying OP is wrong, I just want to see how they cleaned up their data if they made a valid conclusion)"
9239,"It's doable, but you would definitely have to consider a lot of control variables.   
  
Additionally, with the above comment's abstract for the project, I feel like there's definitely extraneous variables that are impacting the ""more caffeine leads to poorer grades"" relationship.  
  
While most students drink caffeine at some point, those drinking excessive amounts are probably those with other factors that impact school work (i.e., poor time management, busy schedules, other commitments, etc.). To compensate for these factors, they may drink excessive amounts of caffeine to ""power through"". Each of these factors are more likely to be what's causing the poor grades. So rather than it being the caffeine causing the quality of work to go down, it may just be that caffeine is related to factors that do impact grades (e.g., a person with a busy schedule has to stay up late to finish an assignment. To help with this, they drink caffeine. It's more likely that staying up late/having less sleep is what is impacting the work, rather than the caffeine).   
  
This is an undergraduate research project, so where the current study is at is appropriate and I'm sure they're getting advice from their PI. A great direction would be to either control for these factors, or to see if caffeine serves as a mediating effect between these factors and poor grades. Of course, I'm a graduate student in a completely different field, so there can be several other factors at play."
9240,That‚Äôs why you have to do a tolerance reset once every two months where you go through hell for four days straight. It sucks but it‚Äôs worth it to get the sweet caffeine buzz forever.
9241,"The more you use it, the more ineffective it becomes."
9242,good job!
9243,Congratulations! (But be cautious about doxing yourself!)
9244,Congrats!!
9245,As a fellow psych major (incoming freshman) congratulations!! You are my hero
9246,I‚Äôm not sure what this has to do with my comment. How else would they gauge academic performance without using a grading system??
9247,Oooo I want to read!!!
9248,"Kent alumni here, nice job!"
9249,"Engineering student here, I need to know where I can read this article‚Ä¶..for research purposes of course‚Ä¶.definitely not for personal use‚Ä¶‚Ä¶definitely‚Ä¶"
9250,or chasing that first buzz every two months forever anyway until you discover an illicit alternative lol
9251,Congratulations! Also- what are the results/tldr?
9252,"OP posts about their research, refuses to elaborate"
9253,How the hell are you going to show us this and not give a link
9254,That makes a lot of sense and to me seems like it should be the center focus of their study (time management or work load) as it relates to caffeine consumption and academic performance. Just seems like trying to control for all these variables would make it that much more difficult in getting a decent sample size for the study.
9255,"Correct. I should've said ""the more FREQUENTLY you use it."""
9256,That's a major accomplishment! Congratulations üëè
9257,"Congrats, good job!!"
9258,"That‚Äôs an amazing accomplishment! Congrats, do you have a link? I‚Äôd love to check it out - it sounds interesting!"
9259,congrats!
9260,Congratulations!
9261,You are so cool! Congrats!
9262,You should have fought for those points back.
9263,Here‚Äôs a secret from someone who now grades things  using a plagiarism checker: it‚Äôs very easy to tell when something just happens to somewhat match someone else‚Äôs work and when it is plagiarized. Plagiarized work has distinct ‚Äútells‚Äù that are pretty impossible to occur from just a coincidence.
9264,I ended up dropping out of college because the one I went to was kind of bad and the campus is actually closing down after this year. In hindsight I should of but still got a B in the class so I didn't care much. Over half the students dropped the class as well.
9265,"I‚Äôm nervous about my lab reports every time I submit one. I never plagiarized or plan too, but I get a little nervous. I was talking to a professor one time and even he said it‚Äôs neeve racking cause you‚Äôd have to explain your work even though you just wrote about it.  Also, there is only so many ways you can write things on a lab report"
9266,"Same thing happened to me, except for me it was the definition of grassroots development. Some teachers are wack"
9267,"I completely agree. We may be leaning on the toupee fallacy a bit, but true positives versus false positives are pretty distinct."
9268,"It's great that you're that way, but unfortunately, as you even see from the comments, that isn't always the case. Not all teachers seem to be aware that these ""plagiarism-checkers"" can be wrong."
9269,"Professors in CS departments are definitely aware of the potential for submissions to look suspiciously similar, but detecting plagiarism, especially in introductory classes, is more concerned with making sure that code didn't come from the internet. If your code utilizes a method that has never been discussed in class, for example, then you might find yourself in the hotseat."
9270,"Yes. In English classes I got super afraid. How did I resolve it? Honestly ensuring I cited my sources. The main thing I got frilled into my head was cite your sources. I'd make comments, I'd put stars, I'd basically ensure that I checked it over and did the citations right. I also bookmarked all my sites as well. I've had some stuff pop up, but it's dumb stuff like 'so Anthony, the author, said'. Technically I 'could' have copied that info but it's such a nothing statement. Some professors and teachers are shitty abiut it though and if you get accused and yiu didn't, don't take it lying down. Fight for it."
9271,"I know someone who had their backpack stolen and the only thing missing was their paper when she got it back.  She reprinted the paper and the teacher was going to fail her for copying someone else‚Äôs paper until she showed her the file save date and police report for the stolen bag.  Then the other person who turned in the paper first was reported to the University police and she matched the image from the security cameras.  The was arrested for the theft, AND got a zero on the paper.  She was sent before a tribunal and expelled for both the plagiarism and the theft."
9272,"In my college orgo, lab reports would usually come back as like 40% plagiarized every single time even though you wrote them entirely yourself, because there aren‚Äôt a lot of ways to phrase descriptions of lab maneuvers or spectrum analysis. With hundreds of students doing the same exact lab that week and then every subsequent semester, it‚Äôs basically impossible for lab reports to not come back ‚Äúplagiarized.‚Äù 

No one that I knew ever had any sort of issue with it because everyone‚Äôs results were similar in terms of percentage of ‚Äúplagiarized‚Äù phrases. I think the professors, especially in the sciences, know to look at how it comes back and not just the ‚Äúyes or no‚Äù from the program."
9273,"I remember a professor during my final year in college wanted to check for plagiarism during the midterm and final exam. 

The plagiarism checker he used which was through Blackboard reported plagiarism on the questions but not the actual answers."
9274,How do you prove you didn‚Äôt in a situation like this?
9275,"This...doesn't make sense.  Without the references, you literally are plagiarizing.  My papers routinely get flagged because I quote and reference heavily (in my subject, it's not uncommon to have one to two references per sentence).  I've never had issues‚Äîonce the professor actually looks at the comparisons, he realizes that TurnItIn is just mistaking quotes for copying‚Äîbut if I were taking out my cites as you've suggested, I'd be kicked out of school, and rightfully so.  It is precisely because of my references that I'm not committing plagiarism.

People, always cite ideas, quotes, and sources which are not your own.  Without a proper cite, you *are* stealing and committing academic dishonesty.  And that's a big no no in university and, frankly, any professional setting.  This is honestly dangerous advice."
9276,Okay how does that even happen? That is like statistically impossible to get 95% if the writing is your own.
9277,"There's plenty of advanced kids that are able to program but don't have the paper that proves it. As long as you can explain your logic, you should be fine. If your answer is just, ""I don't know, I found it on Stack,"" then yeah you're fucked."
9278,Turnitin.....what a pain.
9279,"My mother told me that when she was in high school, she noticed the teacher only read the first couple of pages and the last page.  She inserted random speeches of presidents in the middle of her papers to pad them out and got A‚Äôs. Of course she also graduated in 1953."
9280,"My friend's high school teacher deducted points for plagiarism for including the term ""Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"" in his essay"
9281,I mean did you cite your quote correctly?
9282,Hahaha that happened to me. I typed out the questions and answered the questions right below and it came back as being plagiarized because of said typed questions.
9283,"Your notes, drafts, research copies etc.  suggest you make a file with all that in it until the class is over."
9284,"You don‚Äôt take your references away you just need to properly source them, then they should not be makes as stolen."
9285,"Plagiarism checkers are extremely stupid, keep that in mind, I spent 3 months writing an 8 page paper on the church of the flying spaghetti monster (I genuinely hate that man so much now because of it) about 3 of those weeks were spent making the plagiarism checker happy because part of one of my sentences was similar to some guy at community college in Illinois, 12 years ago. Don't stress over it, talk with your professor about it and figure where the number should be, it'll all be good. You're going to be fine."
9286,What? How dumb do they have to be?
9287,"There's no reason at all to ever remove the references.  The professor can see in the application what is flagged, and then cross-check it with the original material (which it does for him).  When he realizes that what's being flagged are just quotes, he will then check to see if you sourced those quotes, i.e., referenced them, properly."
9288,"yeah, due to how safe assign is setup it took the original file with just the questions into the database to check against. So when people submitted said test with the questions answered it marked every question as plagiarism (including the header of the document) but not one single answer was marked for plagiarism, which defeated the point of the checker as every submitted test was guaranteed to have 40% - 75% plagiarism that they couldn't control."
9289,The most unoriginal and restrictive of writing prompts can force people into arriving at very similar projects.
9290,"I just graduated as a CS major, and I also was a TA for a few classes. Unless your college is more up to date than mine is, I can tell you right now that even if you copy/pasted most programs from somewhere (but wrote your own documentation), they‚Äôre not going to catch it. My school used a plagiarism checker intended for English papers. You need a different checker for programming languages, but a lot of universities don‚Äôt invest in one.

I found this out when I started to TA. I tried to make sure my students didn‚Äôt plagiarize code by using Google to look, but that‚Äôs not a guarantee. I‚Äôm sure some plagiarized, I just could never prove it (e.g. poor class performance and grades, except for work from home programs).

But I see it this way: if you plagiarize, you‚Äôre just cheating yourself. What will you do at a job when you graduate? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, boss, I can‚Äôt do the task you gave me because I cheated on that stuff in college.‚Äù So I never got worked up about cheaters in school. It‚Äôs their money wasted, not mine.

So don‚Äôt worry about your code, especially don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre actually doing your own assignments. You‚Äôll be fine."
9291,"As someone who used to help other students bugcheck programming assignments (I spent years programming in C/C++ before I went to school for it), it's blatantly obvious when someone copy-pasted code they found on the internet if you have a good handle on the language.  Formatting, variable naming conventions, how they convert between the chunks of code and other signs make any copied work stand out.  It's like looking at a lego house where random parts are all different colors.  If you reference code but then write the work yourself, any competent teacher will see the flow is all the same and not question it even if the plagiarism check flags it.  And that's an expected process anyway when you're learning CS, looking at code and understanding it enough to be able to write it yourself.  


One assignment stands out in my mind, where we were tasked with multithreading data processing.  It was a very straightforward assignment, where any good student would have done it with a fairly simple and direct process.  Five people in that class got flagged because we all had very similar solutions.  However, the signs of plagarism that usually come up were absent, and the teacher knew we were the students who worked through the problem till we found the ideal solution.  He had no issue with the similarities and we all aced it.  


Also, stupid little things that might get flagged (ex. Copying code to clear an input buffer)  teachers really don't care about.  They are concerned about whether you understand the material, vs just being able to complete the assignment using outside code.  Especially where some schools will even check against your own code, if little things like that get flagged the teacher won't care.  I was flagged several times for plagiarizing my own code because I reused stuff constantly, and it was never brought up.  Which is often good programming practice anyway- if you find an ideal process for a particular problem the best thing to do is reuse it rather than write it from scratch each time.  In the real world, employers care about you doing it right every time.  Not that you wrote it from scratch every time.


Even so (because I too worried about it quite a bit,) as a precautionary measure I always wrote my code in steps, and once one part worked I'd start a new project to continue the work.  That way, I had a series of progressive steps to show how I ended up with the final solution.  If anyone ever questioned if the code was mine, they could look through the direct progression of how I came to the solution.  Over the entirety of my education I never needed to show it."

Per FERPA:

Is a recorded lecture (audio or video) a protected student record?

If a recording includes only the instructor, it is not a student record and FERPA does not limit its use. If the recording includes students asking questions, making presentations or leading a class (other than TAs), and it is possible to identify the student, then the portions containing recordings of the student do constitute protected educational records. Educational records can only be used as permitted by FERPA or in a manner allowed by a written consent from the student.

9353,Having privacy. I grew up ina large family and with a mother who enjoyed looking through my stuff a lot. For the first few months of living in the dorms I wasn't used to privacy so my door was always open. Thankfully that changed quickly so my door got shut when I wasn't around
9354,Classes ending at 5:30 PM are all fun and games until daylight savings times end and it's dark as hell by the time you are done.
9355,"Being able to just do something if I wanted.

If I wanted to order Chipotle and watch TV with my friends? I did it

If I wanted to go out and spend all night hanging out with friends? I did it

When I was in high school I used to have to ask my parents to do anything and I had to be home by 12. College is so freeing lmao"
9356,"Might seem weird but seeing kids on a college campus! I was expecting to see only college students/faculty/staff, but the area is open to the public and there‚Äôs families and children that can walk on the streets or buy food from the dining hall. Wild imo"
9357,It‚Äôs always okay to address them as ‚ÄúProfessor.‚Äù
9358,"Just the whole tango of asking profs ‚Äúwhat do you want to be called? Dr. ______? Mrs. ______? Your first name?‚Äù 

Having profs cancel class an hour or less beforehand.

Being able to determine your own ‚Äúsick days‚Äù."
9359,"Hahah, it's the complete opposite for me. We have roommates at the dorms and we don't even have shower curtains. As an only child in a divorced family, i spent a lot of time alone, and suddenly people were around me all the time."
9360,"Class hours and sleep. Went from a solid 12-6am sleep schedule (on a GOOD day) to being able to get 8+ hours plus naps every day.

And also grades. Back in my HS everyone got 90s on exams so getting a 91 or 92 was either not special, or just below average. Meanwhile in my majors hardest weed out class I got a 91 on the first exam, felt incredibly stupid that I didn‚Äôt get a 97+, then was surprised to know that only 4 people got above a 90 in the class of 170 students.


I‚Äôm still constantly surprised at class averages and medians being in the 50s and 60s. That used to be failing but now I can be proud know that a 75 or 80 is top 10%-20% of the class."
9361,"I haven't started yet, but what I'll have to get used to is that there isn't one single campus. My classes will be spread out across 4 buildings in different parts of my city."
9362,yeah my class is from 5-7 üíÄ
9363,I feel this. Sometimes dormies would have their younger siblings over (and I‚Äôm talking <10yo) and it freaks me out every time. A tiny human?? I forgot that was possible üóø
9364,"Weird class schedules. It‚Äôs not the same as high school. 5 classes on mondays, 1 on Tuesday‚Äôs and thursdays, 4 Wednesday, 2 Friday. And I have 3 hours gaps in between some of my classes."
9365,Except when they're an instructor and not a professor.
9366,what?üò≠ that‚Äôs literally every college
9367,"this but probably in a different sense than you    
my parents were super open to me doing whatever i (reasonably) want but literally any friends or anything was at minimum a 10 minute drive and i lived in miami where it's often 80+ degrees and humidity   
at my college it's so freeing to walk to any of my friends' dorms within 2 minutes"
9368,Ew what no way?? No shower curtains? So do you just have to take a shower around people butt naked and everything?
9369,"Seriously, there will be a combination of TAs, lab instructors and Associate Professors that all prefer different things. 

We had professors who hated being called Professor and preferred their first name, and others who preferred Professor."
9370,"Not having a formal schedule, and not having anyone care about my grades.

Like in high school if I got a bad grade on a test, my teacher would probably want to talk to me to see what happened. If I skipped a class, I would get caught. The only classes I had the experience for was for my Russian language class, but that was likely because we had the same 15 students in there semester after semester, and the class was conversational in nature, and one of my English courses, which was likely due to the professor's attitude towards teaching and being a super caring person more than anything else.

I also had undiagnosed ADHD and it turns out what was keeping my focused in high school was a high level of anxiety related to the fear of letting the people checking up on me down. College was a rough transition for me.

On a happy note, I realized I function very well with 6 hours of sleep + 1 hour of nap. I did some research and apparently that is a valid and healthy sleep schedule. I'm also not an early morning person AT ALL, which I struggled a lot with in high school."
9371,"How to cook, shop for groceries, which was really hard since I had no money"
9372,I‚Äôm right there with you in a 5-9pm. Good luck!
9373,"Hahaha, ye. I got used to it eventually. It helped that i knew probably none of the girls wanted to peep on me and they had all the same fears as me about the situation. I also got to learn when to go showering when no one's around. 

But funny stories did end up happening. For example that one girl who repeatedly went to shower with his bf to khm... 

Anyways, timing and respecting each other is important."
9374,"i got life360 still, I can't wait for this luxury"
9375,This college sounds like it's from a sit-com
9376,Yess especially elementary school students having field trips to the college
9377,Same. Just yesterday I saw a mom and her kid eating together in the dining hall.
9378,"Idk my school had a ton of squirrels on the Quad, and they were very unafraid of people because they're so used to students feeding them. They'd come right up and take your food."
9379,Shouldn‚Äôt they say their title on the first day of class? Or in the syllabus? I never had a problem with this in my four years.
9380,"My favorite part about scheduling is trying to block it together as much as possible, it's super satisfying haha"
9381,To work independently and be able to evaluate the quality of my own work
9382,Rate My Professor is an absolute necessity. I honestly don‚Äôt understand why anyone would sign up for a course without checking the professor rating first.
9383,"I didn‚Äôt need a replacement class, I‚Äôm going to take an extra class next semester instead"
9384,"I posted something similar and hard professors team up on me and say ‚Äúwho hurt you‚Äù while they post on r/professors all day gatekeeping your college experience. 

Their generations neglect shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to be perpetuated."
9385,Did that on my first day of freshman year. Didn't like the classes or professors so changed my entire schedule and went undecided. Best decision I have ever made and I loved last semester and am liking this one so far.
9386,I like watching the profs there get into petty fights.
9387,"That sub is pure salt, I wouldn‚Äôt take any of their posts too seriously"
9388,Oh that's even better I would think. I'm at just enough classes to be counted for full time so I would have to find a new class quickly if I dropped.
9389,"There is no filter, so you have to take everything with a grain of salt, but if you look at the more detailed reviews on a professor's page, you can typically get a good feel for what you're getting into. I've actually found RMP to be exceptionally accurate as long as you ignore the angry reviews from butthurt slackers."
9390,"There is no filter for RMP. If you really want to know how a prof will be, try contacting them and actually talking to students. People will say anything online behind a veil of anonymity without offering any opportunity for dialogue. I wouldn‚Äôt make any other purchase for several hundred dollars based on reviews of anonymous strangers who may or may not even own the product you‚Äôre looking at let alone be approaching it with the same intended use that you are."
9391,"Agreed, it was my fault for not checking. I also had a list of pre selected classes I already checked, but I had to change one up since it was filled. So this class was a last resort. 

Hence how I got to here."
9392,"Professor here, I 100% agree with you. There are some real jerks on campus. If you don‚Äôt have to, don‚Äôt deal with them. If by the time they are tenured they are a jerk then it‚Äôs a lost cause unless they do something so incredibly egregious that admin has to fire them for cause. You made the right choice. Sorry part of your educational experience was tainted by a turd."
9393,Lol I went to the dean of science once over a professor at my college and she said that she does not interfere with how professors professors grade or run their class. You‚Äôre better off just avoiding shitty ones like the plague
9394,"Now I‚Äôm at just enough, but I had room to drop a class."
9395,"I usually stick with classes unless I know the professor‚Äôs style will be so bad I can‚Äôt get a good grade. But this semester I literally put classes on my schedule, got in and checked out the syllabi, and if I didn‚Äôt like it just dropped them."
9396,"Sometimes you can learn from a professor that you don‚Äôt like - I had one whose teaching style I HATED, but stuck with it, and ended up learning a lot. Had another professor whose class I hated but had to take, and what I learned was that I could dislike something and get through it. Then I had one that I dropped the class, moved on, and never looked back. That was also the right choice."
9397,"RMP isn't always accurate. Ignore the ones that say ""they're tough"" and instead focus on the ones that describe the Professor in detail as to why they're good/bad."
9398,Unless your major involves math I don't see why anyone would want this. My major has nothing to do with math so I just want an easy ride while I spend the majority of my time and effort on classes will actually help me in my future.
9399,Isn't that a part of her job lmfao
9400,"I agree with this. Its your money, why would you waste your money? If its a required class, that's a different story and you might be SOL. At my uni, we had 2 weeks to drop the class without effecting # of withdraws we had (Texas has a limit of 6 drops (counts if after the census date) for your entire college career, even at different uni's). So if after a few classes if you don't like the prof, see about switching or taking the class the next semester. 

Though, I would recommend taking RatemyProfessor with a grain of salt. I found that they are a bit like reviews on amazon, you're only going to get a response from people who are sufficiently motivated to do so, good or bad. So you'll end up with skewed information. 

My university has professor evaluations available through academic affairs. that would provide feedback from students and any comments they had on that professor. Check to see if your institution has this as well, its a pretty good resource and at least at my uni the evaluation was ""required"" to see the end of the year grade. So you'll get a lot more responses and a realistic expectation of how the professor is, along with course load."
9401,"The one and only class I've ever dropped due to bad environment was a Calculus 1 class. On the very first day the professor went over the syllabus with us and I asked a question on something that didn't seem clear when we got to the end. Her response was a condescending ""We went over this already, learn to read or learn to listen."" 

Dropped the class that night. Math is my worst subject, and I can get upset when I don't understand something even with effort, I need to be able to trust people to go to them for help, not be condescended to and treated like an idiot. Was able to take that class the next semester with a much more patient professor, thank God for community college. There were two other professors at that college that I wouldn't wish on my absolute worst enemy, but their classes were easier and time-sensitive, so I stuck around. 

(One had a thing against white people and people calling him on some of his absolutely ludicrous claims, and the other had a thing against ""the youth"" and liked to publicly name and shame students in front of the class or dock points for asking clarifying questions, despite never actually teaching us the material.)"
9402,"My major requires us to take professional communications (literally a speech class). I signed up for it this semester and the professor was really rude. She wanted us to buy her $100 textbook. And there was a ridiculous amount of homework, quizzes, and exams. For a speech class that has nothing to do with my major? Hell no. I dropped the class and I‚Äôll just take it with a better professor in the summer"
9403,"I always check RMP and I always leave reviews at the end of the semester. I have noticed A LOT of students complain about professors because the student is extremely lazy. I had to sign up for two courses with a professor who had really poor ratings. Everyone said she was one of the hardest at the college. Honestly, my experience was alright! It was not nearly as bad as everyone made it sound. It was a class where you had to put in work, but the expectations were pretty clear as well as the grading. I have her again for statistics this semester and I don't feel too worried."
9404,"Check to see if you're uni has professor evaluations available! If you've ever had to fill out an evaluation at the end of the semester, you'll know what I'm talking about.

 My uni had all previous evals for every professor available to students through academic affairs, and included stats on total students, average grade, student rankings on delivery/assignments/expected grade. Along with comments from students. Everything from i think this professor is great/bad/whatever, to in depth 

I think it was a great resource, as you got a larger sample size, and could get a more ""middle of the road"" as it avoids students that were sufficiently motivated to rate on rate my professor (good or bad)."
9405,Great idea! Caveat I‚Äôd offer is whether evals are mandatory or not. If they are I am all in for this suggestion.  If not you‚Äôll get some of the same issues as RMP although at least you‚Äôll have assurance these people actually took the course.  If you‚Äôre in a program with an active student society or message board of some sort post there... especially for core courses I think these are a great resource
9406,"This. Unfortunately, I didn't discover RMP until sophomore year. Most of my professors were ass freshman year so I learned that lesson."
9407,"I'm curious to know specifically what about their teaching style you hated? And it sounds like for the second one you just hated the material, not the professor specifically?"
9408,"Dam that sucks. I don't fully know what the dean does. I know for some assignment it can be regarded by another professor. Sadly when your get Into the senior lvl class where the university only has 1 professor that teaches that class I dont know what they can do.
I'm guessing most regrades are for sophomore lvl classes and below with maybe a few senior and junior classes that are able to do this.


I went to my dean on Monday because my teacher said only students who show up on campus can get extra credit. My professor said she'll zoom the class live but won't answer any questions since it's to difficult to look at the comments. 


My husband got covid so my school banned me from coming on campus for 20 days unless I also get a positive result. With my own positive they could shorten my quarantine to just 10 days. 


Well I told the dean it's not fare to force student on campus and to exclude me when I didn't choose to stay home.  The dean got in contact with the science department and fixed this problem within a few hours."
9409,"You'd do have to take it with a grain of salt and know that the reviews are mostly going to come from angry people. That said, any prof I've taken below a 2 (with >10 reviews for all these) has earned that rating by being literally awful to learn from. 2-3 is where it's really a judgment call, and you definitely need to read the reviews to tell if it's worth it. 4 is very rare on any inherently difficult class, but common for gen-eds. 5 is almost exclusively gen-eds at my university, and almost always reserved for easy gen-ed profs. 

I won't take any gen ed professor below a 3, but a 3 on one of my upper level courses? Probably great."
9410,"The first one went on many long tangents and told numerous anecdotes, and never stuck to the schedule. I‚Äôm someone who likes a lot of structure, so I found that both annoying and anxiety-producing. But once I accepted that this was just the way he taught, I relaxed and just enjoyed myself. He was extremely knowledgeable on his topic - he just was never going to present it in a pan organized way.

The second one - honestly, I don‚Äôt know. I think it was a bit of both - not loving the material, and not liking his personality. Came across as informal and easy-going, and was actually unreasonably rigid (imo). So didn‚Äôt feel like I knew how to read him or his expectations.

The third one I thought was a total, disorganized flake from day one, and didn‚Äôt think it was worth my time."
9411,"ALWAYS use ""rate my professor"" to cherry pick your professors for each of your classes. I never realized how much of a difference good professors made until now. I spent way too much time studying per week last semester in Chemistry due to a mediocre professor, and now this semester I barely study because the  new professor knows how to actually teach the material in a way that sticks without much studying. Same goes for the rest of my classes. A good, non-stressful semester depends heavily on your professors"
9412,"This!! The one about the notes is a big factor for me! I cannot take notes and pay attention at the same time. I don‚Äôt know how other people do it but is very difficult/frustrating for me to try and get notes(which are gonna be important for exams/etc) and keep up with what the teacher is saying at the same time. Online classes give me access to take notes and watch the lectures again if I need to, or pay attention to the lecture and come back to take notes later."
9413,I agree. I love the flexibility it gives me. Also the lectures are almost always shorter than if there was scheduled class meetings.
9414,The flexibility is amazing but idiots like me can't handle all the freedom without burning time away on dumb shit.
9415,"I miss it as well.

My school is a commuter school, so if you go to school anytime after 11am you're guaranteed to find 0 parking, with no traffic its 25 min to and from school, but with traffic it takes an hour+.

Paired up with my classes sometimes being hours apart + having to chill at school + it can be a little hard to find a good spot to plop down and concentrate finding the motivation to do classwork is rough (I also problems with concentration)

I'm a comp sci major as well so when I'm at school for the majority of the day I'm just drained and my concentration plummets. I have to be hiked up on caffeine to be able to actually process what's being taught to me in class. Also being able to rewatch recordings was a godsend to be able to ""fully get it"" on the material.

I did miss the social aspects of going to club meetings in person and being surrounded by my classmates, but the actual ""education part"" outweighs the social aspects for me. 

I miss being able to have a full morning routine before my zoom class vs skipping breakfeast sometimes and rushing to get to school on time."
9416,"Asynchronous online classes are a godsend if you don‚Äôt work, too."
9417,"I like classes that completely give you the option. Like for one of my classes there are asynchronous short videos for each chapter, in person lectures that are zoomed live and recorded . Attendance is not ever required. You can do as much or as little as you want. go in person or don't. Mind you this is an upper level class not some gen Ed bs."
9418,"A mix of both has been a blessing for me. I have ADHD, a part time job, and the stamina of a wet dishrag. I get myself to the couple of in person classes a week I have, and then the rest (asynchronous online) are matched to my pace. When I have a surge of energy I‚Äôll bust through my A&P modules. If I‚Äôm tired, I won‚Äôt. In the past, being tired meant missing an 8 am lecture for the same subject, and retaining nothing bc I was half asleep anyways.

But having some in person classes keeps me on a semblance of a schedule and I don‚Äôt feel isolated."
9419,A lot of people prefer online but most extroverts don‚Äôt and they are usually the loudest voices üòÇ
9420,"same. i just completed my degree in december and it was entirely online. loved being able to work at my own pace and whenever i wanted to. i mostly did my courses online because of severe anxiety (hard to focus around a lot of people i don't know), but i also really struggle with focusing on what is being said and taking notes at the same time. 

it's a great alternative as long as you're responsible enough to get everything done on time. i've had people tell me it's either not a real degree, or it's less respectable than getting your degree in-person. but my diploma looks the same as everyone elses so :)"
9421,I completely agree. I miss online classes and not having to commute. I feel so exhausted having to commute and having no time for myself. Every single spare second dedicated to school.
9422,"For me application courses like math, English, accounting need to be in person while I like memorization courses like History, government, or biology online."
9423,"yeah, it really tests your self discipline"
9424,"I genuinely am not capable of learning during in person lectures, it feels like such a waste of time and throws off my entire day. It also makes me feel like an idiot even though I can learn fine on my own. I take highly detailed notes but it's a long and slow process digging through textbooks, YouTube lectures, and other resources I find online."
9425,"finally, I've been looking for someone to say it! Online was a miracle and I loved every minute of it. I no longer had to deal with commuting, I was able to study more and study to the very last second of an exam - now I have to stop an hour or two earlier to commute - to get to the campus earlier cause traffic is a nightmare near me. kills necessary time I need -.-"
9426,"‚ÄòThe class know it alls‚Äô 

Oh boy if you were in my chem class... 

I HATE THOSE KIDS 


AAAAAHHH 

Literally just them makes online classes better like can they shut up for five seconds and stop acting like they teach the class

My calc class is fine tho cause nobody knows wtf is going on"
9427,Hated in person classes. Hated being in there at a specific time and I hated having to deal with people. I just graduated and 95% of my classes were online. For my bachelors I will be doing it completely online.
9428,"It's one thing to participate. It's another to have a ""question"" multiple times per class that is just you restating what the professor just said as if you brilliantly put that together or making yet another statement about how this ties to something you just read in a journal. Participation that is mainly focused on demonstrating your own knowledge and that ends up leaving less and less time for other students to participate is disruptive."
9429,"I love online classes personally. I still have 2 of 3 of mine online, by choice."
9430,"I 100% agree. Also well said. Online classes are so much more efficient for me. I feel like it takes so much longer to commute, go to class, leave, go home, unpack, etc. So much wasted energy"
9431,I love online classes too for these exact reasons. I‚Äôd love to hear more!
9432,I agree with this completely. I tried one online math course and had to drop it because I just couldn't do it. It had to be in person because I needed the extra help.
9433,"I'm a math and physics professor.  I agree with everything in this post.  However, many students just lack the self-discipline to succeed in an online class.  That's a skill that can be learned of course, but I can tell you from experience that a high percentage have not learned it yet."
9434,"Same here! My attention does not split easy, taking notes while listening is a real pain"
9435,It's not the people who participate that are the problem. It's the ones who suck the air out of the room because they want to sound smart or clever and take up valuable class time by doing so. I have no issue with people who participate.
9436,"Well, I've got nada, dude."
9437,[deleted]
9438,Okay but also I can keep my in state tuition and move out of state and they never know.
9439,"Some online classes are good but I couldn‚Äôt do online classes for all my classes. I graduated a while ago so I may be biased but nothing beats actually being in the class except if the teacher sucks at teaching. When I struggled with my classes my school offered tutoring for the subject which helped me a lot and I honestly would struggle/ lack motivation if I wasn‚Äôt doing in person classes. Also I was in different school organizations, made friends there that I still talk to this day and many good memories. Online classes wouldn‚Äôt have given me that. A mix of both is fine but completely online classes would suck for me."
9440,"I completely prefer online classes, it‚Äôs close to an hour drive to get to school which is an hour wasted on which I could‚Äôve done work"
9441,I agree. I prefer online classes.
9442,"Same. When you can get a 2.1 with a 83 in the class, something's not right.

I hate weedout classes with a passion."
9443,"Not exactly what I mean. I'm all for weedout classes, and I have no problem with normalizing grades (upwards or downwards). I wish numerical grades would be given because there's a big difference between an 80 and an 89, or a 90 and a 100, yet at my university, they come out to the same letter grade (and hence the same grade points)."
9444,i've no idea how to read this
9445,"Its kind of hard for me to look at this and see that people can struggle so much and still pull A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs. I just had the worst semester of my life, had to drop below full time and still ended up failing a class. It makes me wonder if I‚Äôm actually cut out for college since I apparently can‚Äôt face hardships and still come away with good grades"
9446,"Best of luck fam

I had the same thing going into this semester and it sucked ass. My sophomore year started with me researching the highest parking garages on campus. Don't know how but I got my shit together and got all As that semester. [then I got fucked in the ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/9cabwv/alcohol_laws_in_the_us_are_such_bullshit/) and got a few bad grades that semester. 

Got super depressed/anxious/withdrawn. Junior year didn't really even happen; I took a few classes and did okay but I felt fucking terrible. Most of all, I felt isolated and lonely - which is terrible at college cause it seems like everyone else isn't

I had the shittiest summer of my life. I stupidly thought of trying therapy and pills, which fucked me up and made me into a suicidal zombie. Seeing as I was genuinely, literally planning on shooting myself before this semester, I got really behind in classes [couldn't bring myself to do it....or get out of bed for something I hated]. 

I sort of just gave up academically and focused on the one thing I never did all throughout school: actually making friends and joining stuff. I actually feel at home here now and actually feel confident enough to talk to people. I have tinder matches and am in a band and for the first time in 2 years I actually feel glad I'm alive

GPA got a bit fucked but hey...now I actually want to be alive. I don't give a fuck about a number. [and actually lol it's not even that bad considering my major. some people have worse GPAs just through stupidity/lack of work ethic/etc]"
9447,Think it‚Äôs incredibly shitty that students can‚Äôt get the counselling they need cause they can‚Äôt afford it. That shit should be totally free. It‚Äôs 100% free here in the UK! 
9448,"With all that said, how do you have a B average?..."
9449,"But then how would colleges in the US make money? 

/s"
9450,I wish my grades were in High Definition 
9451,"People present their struggles in different ways, and that doesn‚Äôt invalidate anyone else. It takes a lot of time and patience to discover how to cope with hardships, and I‚Äôm sure if you truly want to graduate from university, you‚Äôll find your way. Plus, there‚Äôs no shame in taking some time off to recover! "
9452,"It‚Äôs not you, that‚Äôs just what majoring in physics does to you. But congrats :) you did it!!! üçæüéàüéâ "
9453,"That's true. 

You can only hope your professor will be accommodating in rounding up if you're on the borderline, otherwise you'll drop something like 0.3 grade points for virtually no reason that missing maybe 1 or 2 points in the class.

"
9454,Finished a class once with an 89.4. Was given a 3.0.
9455,Haha yeah me too all this A Pluses I get. What to do with them all am I right? Haha. 
9456,Is this serious? You can CERTAINLY fail an exam and get a B. You can do the math yourself. 
9457,I wish a B- wasn‚Äôt a 2.6.
9458,"I feel the same way. I related to a lot of what OP said, but my grades are far from as nice looking as theirs. Or when friends complain about struggling so much, but you know they will still pull off good grades. It's something to think about, but personally I am done thinking about it and I will go into next sem seeking help this time."
9459,"We only just got counseling at my university a few years ago because an alumni class raised funding for mental health. It's a limited service though - after about 10 visits, they kind of kick you out and strongly recommend you try finding a permanent therapist."
9460,But u have good grades my guy
9461,"Yep, I finished 3 classes this semester in the range of 87-89.99. That qualifies as a B+ (3.33) on just about any grading scale, but all three of my profs in those classes just happened to have harsh grading scales. So much for a good semester lol"
9462,Congrats bro! I‚Äôm a measly freshman in college but posts like these give me hope. I wish you the best in the future.

9464,A degree in Physics is an accomplishment not everyone is capable of even with the best work ethic. Well done!
9465,"As a french person, I always found your grading system a little bit weird with GPA and the way you scale the grades on 100 where 70/100 is meh. 

Like in France, a 70/100 grade (which would be 14/20) is pretty damn good in college. You almost never go above 80, it's rare. 10/20 is enough to pass, 12-14 is decent, 14-16 is good, anything above 16 is awesome and unusual. Some teachers never grade above 15 for example. "
9466,"That, but also I hate getting A+s and not getting any recognition GPA-wise."
9467,What is IC? 
9468,"Yeah, everything between 80-100 is the same here, so I guess it's important to have the actual number. 

I know a few people who had high-90's for most things but a 79 somewhere, so they end up with a lower GPA even though their numerical average is way higher than mine."
9469,I don't know the college but as a physics major myself I think I can safely say that they are physics/physics and astronomy.
9470,Oh a physicist! Cheers to you bro/sis! First year here. Lazying through so far. 
9471,"""Weighting"" is how much the course contributes to 1 year's worth of classes. So you have to have 4 classes at 12.5 each semester to reach a full degree in 3 years. Then the last 4 have 25 weighting because that was Honours. 

""Mark"" is the final numerical grade

""Grade"" is the letter grade that goes into your GPA. I'm in Australia, so everything above 80 is High Distinction = HD. IC is Interim Complete because Honours courses don't get individual grades, you just get one grade at the end of the year. UP is Ungraded Pass because Research Experience isn't graded, you just passes it or you didn't. "
9472,"No lol, he made it before class but he waited until the end of class to give it to me"
9473,Well I give the girl I like carrots I grow myself lmao maybe he likes you maybe I confused the shit out of her as well
9474,Making him a sandwitch in return is the cutest thing I've ever heard please do it
9475,[deleted]
9476,"Professor: No eating in class

Students in the back:"
9477,"Oh jeez haha, so what should I do now? Should I make him a sandwich too for our next class? Or should I wait for him to ask me out?"
9478,Everybody offers a beer but nobody dreams of offering somebody a sandwich.
9479,"idk it's kinda hard to tell. he's super nice and friendly to everyone, so maybe he was just doing a kind gesture or something"
9480,I‚Äôm super paranoid and would be like ‚Äúwhy‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs in this.‚Äù That‚Äôs super sweet though.
9481,Girl he was thinking specifically about you while making it. He likes you!
9482,Bring an air fryer to class and make him some wings. He'll definitely ask you out if you do that.
9483,ADORABLE omgg stahhhpü•∫‚ô•Ô∏è
9484,"if it was turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes it means he likes you, if it also has mayo and olives he's gonna kill your mother tomorrow morning"
9485,I will soon running out of carrots
9486,I don't think thats paranoid. I think thats how a normal person would react.
9487,Right? That‚Äôs so adorable.
9488,It actually tasted really good! It's the very first time that I ever had a guy make me a sandwich so I savored every bite haha
9489,"My next class with him isn't until Monday (our lecture is mondays/wednesdays), but I'll definitely post an update! I still haven't decided on whether I should make him a sandwich back. I'm way too shy when it comes to this stuff üò≠"
9490,Mans just pulls up the desk attached to the seat whips out mayo jar starts spreading it on the bread cuts up tomatoes and lettuce he pulled out from his bag cuts it into triangles and hands it to OP LMFAO I‚Äôm dying bruh that‚Äôs what I had imagined when I read this üòÇü§£
9491,It‚Äôs always make me a sandwich never can I have a sandwich üòîüòî
9492,Aww that‚Äôs cute üòÇ it would of been funny if he did it during class though
9493,How did the sandwich taste?
9494,"He said: ""Hey Hannah, I was bored at home earlier today so I decided to make you a sandwich""

Then I said: ""Aww thanks, that's really sweet of you""

Then he smiled and said ""No prob"" and walked away"
9495,Please post an update OP I‚Äôm officially invested
9496,Make two sandwiches that way you can eat the sandwiches together after class
9497,Agreed!!
9498,Especially if he had a toaster or something with him. üòÇ
9499,Make sure he didnt put anything sus in it tho
9500,"High School Teacher: college won't be lenient, you won't be able to do anything fun

Actual College: go ahead and make a sandwich bro"
9501,"He never flirted with me ever. However, during class I would frequently catch him looking at me... And there are also times where he'd catch me looking at him too lmao. Idk if frequent awkward eye contact counts as flirting"
9502,Tbh if this organization wasn‚Äôt a non-profit doing charity work I‚Äôd think it was an MLM.I don‚Äôt think this internship is going to help me gain a job-it‚Äôs just a time suck and emotional drain.
9503,"I agree it is unfair to require students to work an unpaid internship for graduation. I personally did not get an internship because it‚Äôs not required, I couldn‚Äôt afford to work for free or sub minimum wage, and not getting an internship in my field is not the end of the world."
9504,The only silver lining is that this internship is highly competitive with less than 5% of applicants accepted.So at least I have that going for me.(I think that they really just lacked applicants from my area so they took me in-I interview well but otherwise I‚Äôm pretty average in all other regards lol)
9505,I‚Äôve never heard of this being a requirement for undergrad degrees.
9506,"While you may be right that it‚Äôs shitty, it‚Äôs not really your college‚Äôs fault.

99.99% percent of post-bacc full-time jobs require some kind of experience/internship. ‚ÄúEntry level‚Äù becomes further out of reach with every year, but that‚Äôs just the job market we live in. Your university is trying to help you get a job after graduation, so let them help you. 

Since you can‚Äôt avoid working an internship anyway, you might as well make the most of it. It‚Äôs an opportunity to gain experience and make valuable connections who may connect you with later internships/opportunities or even full-time offers. 

That being said, fuck unpaid internships. They should be illegal. Try to get a paid internship if you can."
9507,Exactly it feels almost elitist in a way.I have been paying for my last couple of semesters tuition and after being laid off because of COVID for several months I‚Äôm broke.I have a hold on my account so I can‚Äôt sign up for a summer class I need until I pay off the remaining amount which should be possible after I get my tax return.And meanwhile I‚Äôm working an unpaid internship...FoR EXpeRIenCE lol
9508,Yeah it definitely favors rich kids who don‚Äôt have to worry about paying for tuition or housing lol
9509,"You said it's through your school, you could ask about a federal work study. I did my entire internship without realizing I was eligible for a work study because no one told me. My internship is also a nonprofit based out of my school, and my director told me about the work study and I got paid minimum wage to intern. But this wasn't until I accumulated all my hours for my internship class that I found out, then decided to quit my job and just stick to the internship. 

Realistically students are expected to either do it over the summer or as one of their 5 classes during a normal full course semester, so its not exactly THAT much more work, especially if you make sure you take easier classes alongside it if you can. My class for the internship was just to submit a paragraph or two each week about what I did, and a 3-4 page paper at the very end of the internship. And I worked 6-10 hours a week or 3-5 hours twice a week in between classes. It sucks and is grunt work but honestly thsts the type of shit you're more likely to see in the workplace than any of your classes anyway lmao. And like others said about being competitive, I will guarantee you you're not going to get a competitive or better job over others. Most people have 2-3 internships and more. Internships are way too important in 2021. Worth more than the degree truthfully. If schools didn't force students to take it then students like yourself would undervalue yourselves and think the school failed you or that your education wasn't good enough. 

A degree used to be enough, now it's internships. After your first one you're sure to get an even better one. My first one was similar to what you described but I also ran their social media accounts and some other random things. That internship got me another internship with a fortune 300 company twice. And with that internship I hope to get an internship with a major company like Spotify, Google, etc. For sure wouldn't have been possible without he first grunt internship at the nonprofit my school had. Of course this all leads to a job in the end too"
9510,Not all colleges require it but more and more are beginning to unfortunately.I think it‚Äôs a great idea if someone has the time and energy not to mention the financial means to spare but for students who don‚Äôt (I imagine this is the vast majority) it becomes a burden.
9511,"IMO, if schools don‚Äôt help you find paid internships, then it shouldn‚Äôt be a graduation requirement. I was required to co-op in order to graduate, and my school helped me get one at Campbell snacks and Ben and Jerry‚Äôs. Unpaid internships are are honestly scams if you are doing valuable work."
9512,"required and *unpaid*  is the part i haven't heard. 

The places i know where they are required the pays usually is pretty good."
9513,"The whole system, top to bottom, favors the wealthy."
9514,"Now consider how much easier this is for students from well-off families to do an unpaid internship and classwork because they don't have to work during college, and you'll understand yet another way this system punishes the poor."
9515,"My professor gave us all a list of recommended internships,but they are not directly affiliated with my school.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd qualify.The internship I‚Äôm in requires 12-15 hours a week and I need a minimum of 120 hours to complete my class.I still don‚Äôt see how this internship could possibly help me more than the extensive job experience I already have.I kind of get what you mean about undervaluing-but an unpaid internship is the epitome of being undervalued.They‚Äôre gaining my labor and time for free because my college is forcing me to do this.I hope this ends up being worth it.

Edit: a word"
9516,I think it really depends on the degree but it seems to be the norm around here and in a few other places.
9517,"What you should hate is that jobs kind of require this to get a job after school, if your school didn't require this of you your job sure would.

I'm sorry your school makes the internship thing so mcuh harder than it has to be though."
9518,"Unpaid internships are just a way for the school, government, or some businesses to get free labor. That's it. Unfortunately if you graduate without any job experience it looks really bad, so a lot of colleges require them, but I think a job related to your field should count for that requirement.

I know at my university you can't earn units for a job/internship you're being *paid* for. It's against the rules, which is ridiculous to me, but luckily my university doesn't have an internship requirement for graduating."
9519,ive never heard of a college requiring an internship
9520,"Oh yeah that is rough :/ I remember my internship technically allowed me to work through a bit of the summer as I needed 120 hours too but managed 6-10 a week and finished the extra hours during the summer and did more hours since I had no classes. 

Unpaid internships are stupid af though some states or counties are requiring all internships to be paid experiences but obviously not all are... hopefully something comes out of it and it helps to get your first job at least!! If it makes you feel any better we all have to go through this same bs"
9521,Lol I have to do an internship even tho my field here is light years behind the world. However I can pay my way out of that mandatory work ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚úã
9522,*all education majors collectively scream*
9523,"I know it will not apply to anyone, but I literally just talked to my buddy who owns a business and asked him if I could ‚Äúintern‚Äù. All the teacher asked was an email and a presentation of what I ‚Äúdid‚Äù in the company. In my case, they did not require any heavy paperwork or anything like that. Maybe people could find something like that too"
9524,The vast majority of what nonprofits do is fundraising.
9525,Yeah I know but I feel it‚Äôs very cunning to require all your interns to fundraise over 300$ (which my internship does).I feel uncomfortable asking family and friends since we‚Äôre all in tough financial spots-I even over-drafted my own account for the first time in 5 yrs.I‚Äôm paying the ‚ÄúDonation‚Äù myself because I hate the idea of begging my family.
9526,I graduated in 2011 and had to have one.
9527,That‚Äôs not normal. I thought you were doing things like fundraising emails and calls to donors. I don‚Äôt think they can make you ask your friends and family for money or require you to come up with some set amount of money. You certainly should not be giving them YOUR money. Tell your university.
9528,"It seems like every other major in SUNY requires an internship. All majors at least count an internship as three credits towards your degree. Typically in internship-required majors, you'll walk the stage but will only get the degree after you come back and give a presentation on how your internship went. 

 So, in these majors, the economy never really fully bounced back after '08, (as in amount of professional jobs) and now with COVID-19, I know maybe five guys off the top of my head who aren't able to graduate as they never got an internship or the internship got cancelled. Some programs/departments are allowing independent research projects to take the place of an internship."
9529,Yeah it feels pretty elitist.I have a friend who got hired on as an intern at his fathers company (his dad is VP of something or other) and got paid beaucoup bucks.If I was in the same state as him he might‚Äôve been able to hook me up with something low level like data entry.
9530,"I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm a professor and this sounds really dodgy to me. I wouldn‚Äôt want students to be put in the position of thinking they need to give money or get their family to give money to this nonprofit. The internship is supposed to be a learning experience, not a way for them to get money from you. They should have a development office that is in charge of figuring out funding and doing fundraising."
9531,My program requires internships for clinical hours (medical field) which is pretty standard
9532,Congrats! You worked hard and that‚Äôs all that matters. Good luck on getting your psych degree. You‚Äôll get there!
9533,Thank you!
9534,"Begone, ad"
9535,I know a lot of colleges use a +/- system and I‚Äôm happy that mine doesn‚Äôt. Have you found that you like having +/- or does it just add stress?
9536,yes what could it possibly be
9537,Congratulations!! Those grades are amazing!
9538,"It sounds like you did an excellent job! Let‚Äôs not bring this other person down though, making As and Bs takes a lot of hard work!"
9539,"I worked my ass off for a C- once, I learned quickly that it isn't all that matters lol"
9540,Thanks!
9541,Thank you! Only a few more semesters left.
9542,Congrats!
9543,"Good for you!

I teach abnormal psych at the grad level. Not always an easy class

Very well done"
9544,Congrats!!!!
9545,"As a psychology major in sophomore year those classes sounds so interesting , congratulations !!"
9546,Thank you!
9547,Nice!!! What‚Äôs your major?
9548,Abnormal psychology sounds interesting and gratz
9549,hell yea! congrats :]
9550,"Doing awesome! I remember my interpersonal relationships course. Our professor would start the lecture 20 mins ""late"" every day because he wanted us to take time to meditate and chill haha. It did work though, we all were very relaxed and ready to work after."
9551,How was abnormal psych? I‚Äôm planning to take it in the Fall
9552,Not OP. I like the +/- system except for one thing. Saying I got straight As *is* a lie but saying I got straight A+s *sounds like* a lie or unnecessary bragging. I just say my percent average to avoid the issue.
9553,Same! Thank goodness for summer
9554,What did you watch for ethnicity & emotions in film?
9555,"Congratulations!! üéâüéâ
Don't worry, things will definitely get better. Just stay positive and you will hear great news soon.‚ú®"
9556,That's fantastic. Proud of you!
9557,I would cry with joy if I got such good grades. Congrats!
9558,My uni has some classes +/- depending on the professor. It depends because some of the harder classes you can only get a B+ no matter how hard you try due to your background and it's nice that it's worth more than a flat out 80%. At the same time though sometimes you get to the end of the semester and it's nice to know that you can slack off in the class that you have an 89 in knowing that you'd have to score a 20 on the final to get all the way down to a C
9559,Thanks!
9560,Psychology haha
9561,Lmao every single one of those classes is a psychology class my dude
9562,"I have experienced something similar to what the author of the post related. In my situation, I can prove that my teammate did it by accessing Google Docs history. I can see who (which gmail account) wrote each paragraph. Maybe this info will help someone."
9563,I talked to her and she is saying that she doesn‚Äôt care. The killer part? My uncle was hospitalized on the day that the assignment was due and i just submitted what i had because my colleague didn‚Äôt bother submitting it himself.
9564,"Under the bus your classmate goes. 

Seriously -- If everything here is true run them over with the bus. Back up over them. And then drive away over them again one more time for safe measure. 

Copy / pasting wiki this day in age is the DUMBEST thing to do in a college setting and if you do it you absolutely deserve to get fucked."
9565,"Imagine coming back from the hospital after a whole night there and realizing that your dumbass partner sent you the project at 4AM instead of submitting it himself. It is partly my fault for not it checking it carefully but can you say that you wouldn‚Äôt have opened the file, checked that there is readable text and submitted it and went to sleep?"
9566,"Escalate it to an advisor and ask them what to do. Gather documentation from your uncle about the hospital visit as it will help your case. Keep escalating it one position up until you find someone that will help you. Request an oral exam on the essay content that you wrote to show that you did it. Offer to take a 25% penalty instead of a 0. If that fails, start a change.org position at the college to give them bad PR for not handling the case fairly using philosophical principles of utilitarianism."
9567,"My colleague did this entire part, i did other stuff. He copied from Wikipedia. He didnt submit the project and waited for me to submit it the next day ( i was with my unlce) . He only gave me the project a few hours before the due date, so the next day meant that it was late"
9568,"I‚Äôm pretty sure any software can do that now too. It‚Äôs a little harder with Microsoft Word but you can track changes. 


This doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that OP could‚Äôve known their partner cheated before submitting and chose not to do anything about it. Just because they can throw someone under the bus doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt without fault"
9569,"Hmmm but how would the OP know if the partner's plagiarized or not? even if OP could get the partner's work, OP can't go through all the websites and just compare them one by one right?"
9570,"This is literally what i did. Screenshots, chats, everything. I never thought someone could be this dumb"
9571,"Take the situation with the department head. Aka if the employee wont listen to your complaints, demand her boss. I figured this out much after college, but if something doesnt feel right, you need to speak with the person up top.

Dont think of yourself as just a student, YOU ARE A CLIENT. You pay the school to assess your knowledge, the school is not above you. They work side by side with you. You aren't even just a customer, you are basically their partner. Sometimes its easy to forget. Explain the unfair situation with the department head, send them an email or call them. 

Ive complained about a professor's credibility due to their sloppy and factually incorrect lectures, which resulted in the department head coming in to assess them in class. Ive gotten wrong information from school office clerks and had to speak to the department heads personally to get right answers about programs. Ive gotten denied from my program application, and also spoke to a department head about how I only needed one class in it to complete, which resulted in them letting me in after a short appointment. 

I have even stupidly FORGOTTEN to drop classes for a masters degree program and didnt find out I was enrolled until the semester ended, resulting in me owing tuition, but I came in and spoke to the necessary party, explained my unfortunate situation and did the necessary paperwork to get an application approved for tuition costs being removed.

Unless you are speaking to someone at the very top of the chain, you need to speak up more. If the professor wont listen, go to their boss, their department head, make yourself heard. Im telling you right now, reading through the list of comments here and I see alot of BS. Forget the professor, talk to their department head. 

As I said before, its easy to forget, especially if you are out of highschool where you have no voice or power. But in college, there are alot higher expectations for schools to adhere to. Professors are unwise to think they decide whats fair. So ask the department head to mediate. Best of luck, be brave and speak up.

Edit: seeing some of the replys so let me say this. If you think you deserve to take the L and not do anything, then thats fine, learn a lesson by dropping 2 letter grades. If you already learned the lesson, its time to pursue action and start remedying the situation instead of letting your education fall apart."
9572,"No I would do exactly what you did. I‚Äôm not saying you weren‚Äôt put in a crappy situation or that you weren‚Äôt given the short end of the stick and your partner did you dirty. But assuming you had more than 24 hours to submit the assignment, these are the concerns you‚Äôre up against. Which is why your professor isn‚Äôt budging."
9573,"I have messages of me telling him to start the project from 2 weeks before the due date. A couple of days before the due date, he told me that he was going to start doing it. What more could i have done? ( I genuinely want to know, so i have good arguments when i talk to the prof/dean)"
9574,You gave me an idea. I went to message him as if im surprised that the got a 0 and asked ‚Äú why did she give us a 0!!!‚Äù Lol i want to kill him
9575,"My apologies if I‚Äôm not understanding you correctly, but it seems to me from this comment that you are the one who used Wikipedia? If that is the case, then you will not be able to change your grade. Also, the professor won‚Äôt care about your uncle because he was hospitalized on the due date of the project - you could have easily completed the project before that day."
9576,This is some really dumb logic. If you assume everyone is cheating then  everyone shouldn't be in groups.
9577,Assignments usually get run through software that highlights phrases that plagiarized or found in other places and shows the articles they're found in.
9578,"I‚Äôm going to be downvoted to oblivion, but this is nonsense. You are looking at your education as  business model, and I don‚Äôt blame you because this is what higher education is advertised as today (using the language of business).

Unfortunately, when you ‚Äúbuy in‚Äù to this model, you are treating education as a product. *The learning transactions and the knowledge being produced by the student is the product*. 

In fact, *the student is the product* of the school.

In traditional conceptions of organizations, the teachers are the inputs, the students are the outputs, and the learning that happens is the transformative properties.

It seems that in the OP‚Äôs situation, the learning that needed to happen was to budget time to look over everyone‚Äôs contribution to the project and not just the material being taught.

To go over the professor‚Äôs head simply to demand a grade is to say *you know better than the professor.* I suppose you know what‚Äôs best for your career trajectory than the professor does, sure‚Äîwe all want to get by on our own ideal vision of the world‚Äîbut life doesn‚Äôt work that way. And when you treat school as some sort of model you can force yourself into and shoe-horn your ideal situation as manifest... well, you are doing yourself a disservice.

Sometimes it takes a failing grade to realize where the learning actually needs to take place.

Downvote me to oblivion. I don‚Äôt care. I had to speak to this, because this is the problem with higher education today."
9579,ooof thats rough. I hate group projects
9580,Idk about yours but my university has a clear rule about that. If one of the members cheat you all get zero. Apparently we are supposed to check each other‚Äôs work. Tough luck.
9581,You would hope that you could trust your own partner not to plagiarize. I don't think it's on the student to have to check for cheating by their partner and I'd suggest OP still try to advocate further for themselves in this situation.
9582,"This is just another reason why group projects, especially during the pandemic, are a fucking waste of time.

Your professor obviously just doesn‚Äôt want to do anymore work and you‚Äôre basically asking her to work overtime without pay. I bet the whole reason she assigned a group project was to only have to grade 1 item for multiple people - just like every tenured professor who assigns group projects."
9583,"Honestly hospital aside, there‚Äôs always the argument that you guys were supposed to be working on the assignment together so you should‚Äôve been able to check and see your partner cheated or you guys were working together to cheat and you‚Äôre just throwing your partner under the bus. If you can prove those claims false, you have a leg to stand on"
9584,"One thing you‚Äôre forgetting here is that this project was clearly plagiarized from Wikipedia - the head of the department won‚Äôt have much sympathy if the students didn‚Äôt do their own work.

Now, if the student can prove that only their partner cheated, and that their part of the project was done correctly, then the professor might have sympathy. But you are better off talking straight to the professor in this situation."
9585,"Yeah. I would‚Äôve rather did the whole project myself, got an A and forgot about it."
9586,If that‚Äôs the case and your partner truly doesn‚Äôt know what plagiarizing is then you can maybe use that to your advantage. But your partner would still need to be the one to come clean and confess they don‚Äôt know what plagerisim is and if there‚Äôs anyway this can just be a teachable moment that doesn‚Äôt affect your grade. I doubt it will work to be honest but that‚Äôs all I got
9587,"The issue seems to be that you're both responsible for the entirety of the work. If your partner agreed to do a section of it, you're still responsible for the final product.

Practically, what you should do is bust ass for the remainder of the semester.

And then consider the lower grade a relatively cheap price to pay for a very important lesson: Everything that can negatively impact you is your responsibility. It's like when you're walking and go to cross the street at a crosswalk. You still look both ways. Doesn't matter if drivers are supposed to yield to you; what matters is not getting hit by an inattentive driver."
9588,It‚Äôs not a negotiation. You don‚Äôt have anything they want or any leverage to negotiate with. Why would they give you 25% instead of a 0? How is that an ‚Äúoffer‚Äù? Also why would the professor take time out of their day to make up an alternate assignment for you?
9589,100% agree
9590,"I get what you are saying and i agree with you. The problem is that I wasn‚Äôt home chilling watch Netflix, i was at the hospital because of an emergency."
9591,"So on the day that you turned it in, you had access to both your partner's work and your own after he gave you his part, and then you turned in all of the work for both of you? If that is the case then I think the professor can still see you as being at fault. If you had access to his work before you turned it in then you should have checked it to make sure everything fit together and was up to snuff. A simple check would have shown that he used Wikipedia. Your professor also saw this as a group project where you both were supposed to actually work together, and not just divide up the work to do individually."
9592,"Definitely agreed. Transferring from a CC saved me a ton of money, and if you stay focused on what courses you need for your major and whatever else, they‚Äôll transfer over to your university and you‚Äôll save a great amount of money."
9593,"I go to Penn State with out of state tuition. I really regret not going to community college and transferring credits, it will save you so much money and time. Even if they are online these classes will save you LOTS of money."
9594,"I know exactly how you feel. My parents make approximately $5000/year too much for me to qualify for financial aid/fafsa. They did not save any money for me or my sister to go to college. They genuinely couldn‚Äôt afford to send me to college. I knew this growing up. I was always told I had to make good grades so I could go to college. I had to give up going to the school of my dreams and ended up having to go to a local university. I got a decent academic scholarship, but I have to live at home to avoid paying any money and I have to work to pay for my car and gas and food. It‚Äôs all working out fine. I just worry about my sister who is in high school. She doesn‚Äôt care much about her grades and doesn‚Äôt think they‚Äôre serious when they say they can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt pay for her to go to college. I hope you are able to figure something out! Good luck!"
9595,"This honestly breaks my heart. My parents make much, much less than yours and they still help me out any chance they get. I can‚Äôt imagine being so fortunate that you could afford to give your children an education, yet refusing. 

Please consider community college. Will every single credit transfer? Maybe not. But you stay proactive, look into 4-year institutions and their transfer credit policies, and *call them* if you have questions. If you stay proactive in tracking your degree audit from the start, CC can be a wonderful stepping stone. 

Keep your grades high. Do some EC‚Äôs if you have the time, but if not, don‚Äôt worry too much about them. They‚Äôre not as important for transfers. Retake the ACT or SAT if your score isn‚Äôt great. Connect with your professors so that when the time comes to transfer, you‚Äôll have solid letters of rec. When you‚Äôre about to finish your A.A., look into state colleges that offer merit scholarships & colleges that meet full financial need‚Äîthis is going to include a lot of private LAC‚Äôs and schools with lower acceptance rates, so really focus on keeping your GPA high. 

It‚Äôs not a seamless plan but it‚Äôs still a plan. And if you have reservations about CC, believe me when I say that you get what you put in. I‚Äôve attended a CC for the past year and a half, and I‚Äôve gotten a more personalized, in depth education than several of my friends who‚Äôve spent their freshman & sophomore years at universities pissing away their time so that they can party. Don‚Äôt be like them. Have fun, but keep your eye on the prize. 

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this, but know that you do have options and you can still get a wonderful education and a degree from a great school."
9596,"dude wat.

cc here is 5k.

although it's Cali so xD

edit: i have fafsa and i'm downright paying nothing. but for out of state and for those who don't qualify for the financial aid and has to have a studio apartment and other expenses, it'll be roughly 5k if you're good with budgeting."
9597,"Agreed. I got two years of free college at CC by being in an honor‚Äôs program. They paid for everything. I still had trouble affording college when I transferred to uni, but it made it a whole lot less expensive."
9598,"bruhh, where in Cali is it 5k? My friends CC offers ~1000 (he gets no financial aid) a semester, and the Cal State I‚Äôm attending is 3.4k a semester"
9599,"Honestly, being in your early 20s is hot garbage. I waited until my late 20s to start college because of this crap. Also, fuck parents like this. However, you should be able to talk to financial aid, and get some sort of paper work, to state that your parents aren't providing."
9600,"Another CCer here, it literally saved my life. I was able to transfer to the college of my dreams, and because it‚Äôs private I got a bunch of scholarship directly from the school. CC is real college, no matter what anyone says, and is always an option."
9601,"Prove mom wrong.

Go to a local community college.

Your parents sound toxic--I would get away from there if you can."
9602,"This might get buried but here goes. I know exactly how you feel. My parents had a lot of money and I always somewhat expected that they would help out financially. Then I found out they wouldn‚Äôt and I‚Äôve always resented them for it. My mom ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt believe in helping kids financially‚Äù because apparently they come to rely on it too much lol. 

My revenge is that I‚Äôm saving actually quite a bit for my own kids when they are older and I can‚Äôt wait to rub my moms nose in it because I will be sure to mention how much help they are getting and how important that is!!!"
9603,"If you are not under 24 then you can file as independent on the Fasfa and your financial aid would be determined based on your income. Not your parents

Also tbh, your parents are dicks not that I probably have to tell you but I mean what do they expect you do to"
9604,"Just to add something about Community Colleges: A lot of the ones in my area do a transfer program to a state university, and by being in this program you have access to scholarships to PAY for university. Please talk to your local CC to see if they do this type of program or if they have any scholarships available! They will definitely work with you."
9605,"- Community college. You can transfer to a solid school, especially if you're in a good state with a good state school. Some states also have Guaranteed Transfer programs for community college students transferring into state schools. 

- Hold off on college until your 24. At 24, you're classified as an Independent student, which allows you to negate your parents' tax info. You'd only have to provide your own tax info for FAFSA, which would likely qualify you for some good aid.

- Get married or pop out a kid. Doing either of these two things will also classify you as an Independent. Gotta love the higher education system."
9606,"OP, contact financial aid departments, have a meeting (call or zoom whatever you can do rn) and explain the situation, there maybe be away to request more aid or appeal their financial decision

Edit- sorry didnt know i was wrong, ive known people who werent claimed as dependent and used that to get more financial aid but i guess that was just something the college worked with them for and nothing to do with fafsa."
9607,"Ask her to research trade jobs that might be a good fit. 

They're not as expensive as unis and you learn a skill in a short amount of time."
9608,"This is my situation too. My parents won't give me their tax information, so I can't apply for financial aid. Pre quarantine, I worked five part time jobs and went to school full time. Now, I really don't know what's going to happen."
9609,"That‚Äôs not true, being claimed as a dependent or not on taxes does not affect dependency for FAFSA"
9610,I'm in cali. My cc is like $100 per semester (tho I qualify for a bunch of financial aid)
9611,Your parents are a blessing. Tell them I love them for being a good role model. <3
9612,"You might look at declaring yourself financially independent. This only works if your parents are not providing anything for you - so you would need to move out and pay for all your own stuff. 

One kicker is that your parents cannot claim you on their taxes and they may still try to in order to get the deduction. So then you would need to look at getting lote assistance from an accountant and/or lawyer. It would be a long process, but it could be worth it."
9613,"Heavily agreed. I admit, my CC education wasn‚Äôt as complex as my current university education, but I did have a great number of teachers that cared and had a nice method to teach students overall. There‚Äôs also a chance that the CC you attend may be linked to a local university that you may be interested in, and they‚Äôll help you with transferring and other inquiries."
9614,"California has some of the cheapest community college fees in the nation. 


It‚Äôs also not going to be 5k. You MIGHT be able to hit 2k if you take a lot of expensive labs and go out and buy all the books instead of pirating them. But you‚Äôre never going to hit 3-5k on normal courses..."
9615,"It's sounds rude af but I kinda agree on the toxic part.

I will not allow myself to have kids if I can't be sure of their basic needs and education."
9616,Yes @OP if you decide on going to a CC make sure the courses you take will transfer over to the university you're interested in
9617,It's rare to go out of state for community college when you can stay in your own state and pay $1000ish each semester
9618,"I worked in higher ed for 15 years and I now work at a high school.  I saw and still see many students in similar situations to yours. Parents like yours mostly infuriate me. They have enough money to assist their children but just refuse to do so. Why have kids if you aren't going to support the kids right through college or trade school?

There are numerous ways to pay for college - paying for it yourself with cash on hand, financial grants or aid from colleges, federal and state grants, federal student loans, private student loans, scholarships, tuition reimbursement, participation in ROTC and the GI Bill. Let's go through these so you completely understand your options.

**Paying for it yourself** - This is probably the most difficult option in today's climate. If this is the route you take, then start at community college. Community colleges are less expensive. You can take ""the basics"" there along with learning a trade or skill. I encourage you to visit your local community college to see what your options are there. 

After you have taken 60 credits, you can transfer to a state school. 60 credits is usually the maximum a university or college will accept so don't take more than will be accepted in transfer. Also many community colleges now have academic advisors to help students plan their schedules to prepare for transfer to university. Shoot for the best state school in your state. If you can't leave your city, then go the state school closest to your home. 

Also, if this is the route you take, plan to take 2 - 3 classes a semester and go year round. You will need to work close to full-time to cover all of your expenses. It will be difficult to attend school full-time and work full-time. 3 classes a semester is better than 2 classes a semester for making progress to your goal but doesn't overwhelm you so that you feel you need to drop out. Going year round also gets you closer to your goal. In addition to traditional semesters, many community colleges have ""mini-mesters"" during the gaps between semesters. 

Once you've finished at community college, do the same at the college or university you attend, go year round, take 3 classes a semester, take advantage of any unusual scheduling options available. Just keep plugging on and you will get your degree.

**Financial Aid or grants from colleges** - This is usually known as institutional aid. It is almost always reserved for students with financial need based on the FAFSA. At this time, it does not sound like you would qualify for this based on your parents income. Once you turn 24, you can apply for aid based on your own income and this category may open up for you. 

There are other ways to qualify as an independent student. You can google them. Those that are feasible for you all require huge life changes that I would not recommend for a college student such as getting married and having a child.

**Financial Aid or grants from federal or state sources** - Federal grants are all based on financial need and would not be available to you in your current circumstances. However, some states do have grants for students that are based on merit and not need. Without knowing your state, I can't tell you about any specifics for you. You will need to do some research to see if there are any in your state.

**Federal Student Loans** - Federal student loans are available to ALL students in the United States regardless of financial need. Even if your parents will not pay for any of your college education, you can still qualify for federal student loans. I know student loans are not popular but if you only take out federal loans to the maximum allowed, it is still less than $30,000 over four years. This is a monthly payment of somewhat less than $300 a month. Where students get into trouble is when they agree to pay back their parents' ParentPlus Loans or when students take out private loans as well as their federal loans. Then the loan burden gets too high. 

If you do take out federal loans, don't do it for community college, if you can help it. Save your federal loans for university. This will keep down your loan burden and, I believe, you still qualify for four years of loans even if you have some credits already. You would need to speak with a financial aid officer at your school to better understand this. 

**Private Student Loans** - Don't, just don't. There may be some truly unusual circumstances where someone needs a private student loan but they are few and far between. Avoid these at all costs. Most loan horror stories involve private student loans.

**Scholarships** - They are out there but can be hard to find and harder to get. Start looking for smaller local scholarships. Many community organizations give scholarship. Try local Chambers of Commerce, service organizations like the Elks Club or Kiwanas or American Legion. Churches, synagogues, and other religious organizations sometimes have scholarships. This is where asking your high school counselor can be helpful. Community colleges also should have a good sense of local scholarships. You just have to keep looking.

**Tuition Reimbursement** - There are companies out there that reimburse their employees for college classes. I know UPS is such a company. There is at least one major grocery store chain in my state that also offers tuition reimbursement.

But the employer most likely to offer tuition reimbursement is, no surprise, a college. Colleges have many different kinds of jobs, many of which require no more than a high school diploma. Start now to apply to all of the colleges, both community colleges and four-year colleges, in your area for administrative positions, clerk positions, janitorial positions, grounds crew, whatever you think you might be able to do. Colleges don't always pay as well as other employers but they do provide decent benefits. At the college where I worked, there were numerous people who got their bachelor's degree from our school and then went on to get master's degrees paid for by the school. 

**ROTC participation** - this route does not necessarily pay for all of your tuition. If you went this route, you would need to investigate exactly what the program would provide you. However, ROTC programs have advisors devoted specifically to their students to help them navigate both the academic and financial aspects of college. Obviously, only go this route if you have an interest in military service after college.

**Military Service and the GI Bill** - and that leaves us with going into the Armed Forces then using the GI Bill to pay for college when you leave the service. When I worked at the college level, many of my former students were former military. Their tuition was paid along with receiving a monthly stipend to pay for living expenses and other costs related to school. Military students were also considered as independent students so they could also apply for financial aid on their own income, if needed.

Many of my current high school students are considering this option since even with the extensive financial aid many of them could receive (I work primarily low-income students), they just feel it is a better option so they can begin to make money to help their families while also getting the benefit of the GI Bill after they leave service.

Some of the services also offer extensive educational options. The Air Force has their own community college system. The Navy will provide extensive training for some of their jobs with some of the credits for that training transferring after  leaving the service. I don't know about the other services. You would have to do the research. Again, only pursue the military option if that is something you can truly see yourself doing for at least four years.

I hope you find this helpful. I believe strongly in the power of education to transform lives. Unfortunately, our current system can make that difficult for many people. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to send me a message. I'm happy to help."
9619,"Conversely, I go to Penn State with in state tuition and a decent scholarship, and I think its an alright deal, although still expensive. Paying for it on my own like OP, although my parents don't make 200k+ haha"
9620,You are correct. Under 24 = dependent unless very unique circumstances apply.
9621,"That's why I think don't have kids if you're not financially independent. If their future is not insured, don't even go for it. YOu're just making another person suffer."
9622,You got me there.
9623,Not social skills as much as I feel like I‚Äôve lost my ability to be funny.
9624,Same. But I find comfort in the fact that everyone is dealing with the pandemic so most people will be a little awkward.
9625,i wish this weren‚Äôt true but sadly it is
9626,sameeee. I live far from friends since I moved recently and other than talking to coworkers/family I don‚Äôt interact much. The only reason I am going back to my school‚Äôs campus is for the social aspects of college life just so I don‚Äôt become even more of a hermit.
9627,"Likewise, this recent semester I really put myself out there and met some new acquaintances. Then came Corona. I think the world is telling me something."
9628,"I finally got myself to talk to a girl in my lab and we hit it off very well. Week later, shutdown. 

I‚Äôm blaming my lost love on Covid."
9629,"Yes!! I feel like whenever I FaceTime or Zoom with my friends I forget how to be human! I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have a job right now so 90% of my interactions are with coworkers, so talking with a more informal manner has become  so lacking!"
9630,YESS me! I had my online orientation a few days ago.. and I just could not talk right
9631,Fuck you‚Äôre not wrong but you didn‚Äôt have to say it üò≠
9632,"Literally since Highschool I‚Äôve taken online classes anyways. I have absolutely no social skills. I left all my friends for my ex. Then when he dumped me after I found out he was cheating, I kinda just holed up on my own. And have been floating around doing work and school and hoping to god one day I get the nerve to go out and make friends again"
9633,I feel this on another level.
9634,"I find that there's a lot to talk about if I just stick with the following formula:

""Hi, how are you doing?"" \[good and you?\] ""Well I'm getting by okay. Isn't Trump just the worst?""

There's always conversation afterwards, either way!"
9635,"Agreed, my parents pushed hard to have me and my brother go back to campus for a sense of normalcy."
9636,"Every time I try to talk to my family, I always end up sounding like a fool. It's funny because I write ALL day for summer school, so you would think that I would be fine talking verbally... NOPE!"
9637,"Sorry my dude. The only thing I can say is good for you for staying in college. That will get you very far in life :-) 
Also, you‚Äôre my internet friend. hi-5!"
9638,"Tell me about the things he advocates for that you like. I personally agree with his positions on China. They need to be reigned in.

BOOM, CONVERSATION!"
9639,What social skills?? üòÇüò≠
9640,"My social skills have flourished since quarantine. This is thanks to me gaining self confidence in myself by reading personal development books, meditating, and getting my health and fitness in check. You don‚Äôt not need to be the funniest, smartest, or most attractive person, only the most confident in ones self, that is truly a force to be reckoned with. Fall in love with yourself, and talking to others will follow suit."
9641,"Idk if this is serious or not.. but please don‚Äôt bring up politics in a conversation with friends.. most people don‚Äôt like talking politics in person, especially with something as bold as that, correct as it may be"
9642,I couldn't have said this better myself ü§£
9643,And already awkward people will now be awkward+
9644,"What? I would never bring up politics with strangers, but with friends? Who else do you talk politics with if not your friends? Family? No. Co-workers? No. Acquaintances? No. But my friends? Absolutely yes. What are they there for if not to roast president cheeto dust with me? Or to vent about that one racist uncle everyone has?"
9645,"Whether you like his policies or not, it's pretty hard to deny that he's a ridiculously out of touch person who bullshits 99% of the time."
9646,"Right but he wings it by telling outright lies and saying wild inflammatory shit that doesn't even make sense half the time. He spreads hateful messages on a regular basis. 

I'm not a ""All Trump supporters are evil"" guy either. I would never vote for him but I understand why certain people like him. He's pretty funny and the whole ""tells it like he sees it"" thing resonates with some people (although it's kinda funny because the way he sees it is usually just so warped it's sad) 

In my opinion it says a lot about you and why you like him when you won't even admit that he's a bullshitter. However, it's a free country and I'm not into silencing people who have different views than me like so many on the far left are trying to do. To each their own but tbh I think you're a little misguided."
9647,Yes awkward will be the new normal
9648,You‚Äôre not alone! I know my writing work in school is great. I think quarantine just made me more antisocial to the point where I don‚Äôt even want to interact with anyone anymore. I don‚Äôt even text people back unless it‚Äôs a family member or somebody important ü§°
9649,Yes but not sure if it is because of the pandemic or not
9650,"Yes 100%. But mostly with my eye contact. I found that after quarantining for so long, making normal eye contact during a conversation felt so awkward and I was avoiding it (even with my good friends). But it‚Äôs slowly but surely getting back to normal."
9651,"Speaking of corruption, what do you think about Trump commuting Roger Stone's sentence? That's like the most blatantly corrupt thing a president has done for decades."
9652,"""sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as much as you can""."
9653,That line really hit home
9654,"Same here. Never pulled one. Never will. It‚Äôs not worth it. I mean, are people so bad at doing homework during the day?"
9655,I‚Äôm so sorry this happened!! I can‚Äôt believe your roommate didn‚Äôt wake you up if they heard those alarms going off for so long. Maybe you‚Äôll hear back from your professor or maybe you‚Äôll have to drop the class I don‚Äôt really know. Hopefully it‚Äôs a class you could just retake another semester and move some stuff around? Maybe take a summer course or winter course to make room for it? Good luck!!
9656,this is shitty i‚Äôm sorry you had this experience! little piece of advice going forward - sleep is the ultimate university life hack. i started planning my schedule around getting a minimum of 6 or 7 hours a night and it has done WONDERS for my grades & mental health
9657,"I have 4 projects every week assigned on Monday and due at 11:59 on Thursday. Each project takes between 12-20 hours depending on the class. So on average I have 60 hours of work to do in 96 hours. Now add time spent in classs on top of that. If I go to the gym 2 of those days and hang out with friends for a few hours then I'm fucked and need an all nighter.

Needless to say, I've given up on my 4.0 this semester"
9658,"I‚Äôm so sorry:( I actually had a similar thing happen... a depression nap turned into a full blown sleep and I missed my midterm. After a lot of crying and freaking out I emailed the professor and I actually was able to make it up the next week, so there‚Äôs definitely a chance that you‚Äôll be able to make it up. I hope everything works out okay!"
9659,[deleted]
9660,What are the projects? What weekly project takes 20 hours?
9661,"How did your advisor ""make"" you do that and why did you go with it knowing the workload of your major? I'm just curious on that part, because everything in college is really up to your discretion and advisors are there to advise unless you're on like probation."
9662,So damn relatable
9663,"4 CS projects

We‚Äôre only recommended to take 2 at a time but my advisor fucked up and made me take 4. The way it usually works is you take 2 for about 30-40 hours of work and then 2 gen Eds for 5-10 hours. So normally a manageable load

She fucked up and made me only take general Eds first year with just 1 CS class so now I have literally nothing else to take"
9664,\- God
9665,I miss this dudes Dog too
9666,"As a freshman, I would have assumed my advisor knew what they were doing and gone along with their suggested schedule, to be fair."
9667,"The unfortunate fact of life is that you can't have everything. Students who need to work to support themselves or their families must accept that they can't act just like a student who has no similar responsibilities, and that the hours they work will cut into time they'd otherwise spend on clubs, homework, and socialising. It doesn't matter how organised you are or how dedicated you are, at the end of the day you are always limited to 24 hours. 

It's up to the individual if they want to sacrifice sleep, socialising, their grades, and/or their health, but those are *choices*. There is always the option to go part-time in your studies or to drop certain clubs, but those decisions come with their own downsides as well. It is always the students' choice, though, and they must take ultimate responsibility for the consequences."
9668,I overslept and missed my bio midterm today so I feel this deeply.
9669,"I‚Äôm guilty of pulling them every now and then and I do decently on tests. But when I get a test back and see what I missed, so much of it is obviously missed because I was sleep deprived and didn‚Äôt read the question right"
9670,"Exactly. If your course load feels too heavy, drop some classes or a class."
9671,">I thought I had the willpower to do so

Eventually biology takes over willpower. That's just what the body does to protect itself, willpower becomes less of a factor as the hours without sleep increase and it becomes more about your physiology.

> I was pulling all nighters left and right for all of my projects  

You do know that this type of work is generally not productive, right? Work quality typically deteriorates with tiredness so that hour you spent working at 6pm is much more valuable than the 4am hour you did. Additionally, for tests, all nighters typically *hurt* your grade when compared to just getting sleep (ironic)."
9672,"Never pull an all nighter before the test, only to finish assignments. If even.."
9673,You didn't think to get out of the classes? Holy fuck man I'm in CS and couldn't imagine doing that
9674,[deleted]
9675,"Turn off the lights and close the laptop every night at 10 pm. No phones either. The light tricks your brain into thinking it's daytime.

Paper only after 10 pm. Try to set a bedtime. Maybe 11 pm. Taking a melatonin at 10pm would help also but you might get reliant on it. That said if I need it to sleep, I take it."
9676,"I saw a dog on campus that was a spitting image of my childhood dog and I literally sat on a sidewalk in the quad for an hour holding the pup and talking to the owner. 

Apparently I wasn‚Äôt the only one missing a beagle on campus, I was the third one that day to cuddle him. His owner says he loves taking walks on campus because people pet him. üòÇ"
9677,What do I do with the rest of the 18 hours?
9678,My roommate got mad when I woke her up after her alarm rang and she didnt wake up so
9679,"Yeah, all nighters are a choice, not a necessity for your normal college student."
9680,"If only I could fall asleep. I have no roommate, so it's just me in my room on my laptop with the lights on (which I'm doing now at 3:30 am) -- but I have a 9 am MWF, so usually however much I stay up just means I sleep less. I don't even have enough work to merit this, I've been doing totally fine and am not struggling with anything, but I'm just bored and end up not sleeping because I have a hard start time."
9681,Email your professor and ask him/her if you can take the midterm during office hours.
9682,Yea most researchers will give you it for free. The money the schools pay for databases the most researchers don‚Äôt see a dime of that. 
9683,"Problem is, every time I need a source, it‚Äôs for a paper that‚Äôs due in like 2 hours so I don‚Äôt have time to email and ask and wait"
9684,OP has a future in the government 
9685,Also  if you are at a  university they should have a program through the library to do this as well. 
9686,"Looks like this author only took an hour to respond! It‚Äôs worth a shot. But you should also try to do your papers earlier, haha. "
9687,"You can also check [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se/#about) for general science and both the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (pronounced ""archive"") and the [NASA Abstract Service](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/) for physics/astrophysics/mathematics. It's quite standard in those fields to upload a free-to-access preprint after a paper is accepted for publication."

9703,"This!

I found an article I wanted to use, but it was behind a paywall. So I just have up on google scholar and used my school‚Äôs library database and I found the article for free.

The local town library also has tons of resources of databases. You just need a library card. "
9704,"Of all things, I had a research project for my AP Calc BC class my senior year of high school post AP exam. Chose to do it on alternative fuel sources since automotive is one of my hobbies

Emailed a professor at the University of Michigan who was not only pleasant enough to send me his prior research but some current research and emailed back and forth a couple times answering some questions that came up on the project

I think the moral of the story in both cases is that a lot of Professors/research authors take pride in their work and appreciate when the outside world reaches out to them about it. I think validation or something in that regard but either way, they are usually pretty receptive to emails like this "
9705,"Yah, at least three hours ahead instead of two!"
9706,There is actually a website that may or may not rhyme with tiepub.tw that may or may not strip the drm from articles
9707,"You can always ask a librarian. They‚Äôre paid to help you find articles. If your library doesn‚Äôt have it, they‚Äôll get it scanned by a library that does. "
9708,This is bad ass
9709,"My go to for research PDFs is usually [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), I also use the web extension [Kopernio](https://www.kopernio.com/)"
9710,"Wow this is awesome, also cool username haha I used to play as wel"
9711,"Already got the article from this email, but thanks!

How though? Do you have access to all of them?"
9712,"Awesome update! A very heart warming story. 

It can be difficult to step out of our comfort zones and your actions had a positive impact in more than just his life."
9713,This is wholesome. Thanks for sharing! üòä
9714,Good for you! just shows how much fun and happiness you can experience when you express your love!
9715,"Not dumb at all, this is precious. Thank you for posting a follow-up."
9716,This is pure wholesome material. I love seeing these small acts of kindness and the effects they have on people.
9717,"I'm glad you went through with giving him a gift! Not only did you probably make his day, but it sounds like it had a positive impact on yourself as well. I hope you have a wonderful holiday!"
9718,This is so precious and wholesome
9719,I love love love this.
9720,"This is so wholesome, brings tears to my eyes"
9721,This is awesome! I am so glad you were able to do that. I remember your first post and this is just so lovely to read. Happy Holidays!!!
9722,Great story!
9723,That‚Äôs an awesome gesture! Have a great holiday break!
9724,"This is what the season is all about, friend. Thanks for sharing."
9725,"Yeah! We have a bookstore lady who is super awesome, she knew the names of everyone in our program after only meeting us once. We got her a card, all signed it, and gave it to her yesterday. She was SO happy. 

For any other socially awkward people out there, 10/10 would definitely recommend acknowledging the people that brighten your day."
9726,That's very kind of you! Happy holidays : )
9727,"So happy you followed through with this! Insane your first post and was hoping you would. Something I‚Äôve learned recently in life is that I‚Äôve never regretted sharing my gratitude with others, no matter how big or small the situation. It delights people to know that they‚Äôve made an impact on others. 

Always tell people when they‚Äôve made your lives better."
9728,Very wholesome and sweet OP.
9729,"Aww. That‚Äôs such a lovely, kind gesture!!"
9730,Dont worry i spend an ungodly amount of time looking at pens
9731,THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING LOLLL. this woman is too clingy
9732,No. You don‚Äôt owe her your presence. This is weird.
9733,My guess is she probably isn't great at making friends on her own and enjoys your company is all. I'm on the other side though. I would've loved that haha
9734,Sounds like the roommate is insecure and/or spoiled.  There is nothing wrong with visiting home as often as your studies allow.
9735,Man I‚Äôd be over the moon if my roommate went home every weekend
9736,One semester my roommate never showed up so I got the whole room to myself for the entire semester. That was bliss.
9737,"Y‚Äôall sharing a dorm, you don‚Äôt even have to be friends much less present, as long as you can live in peace and cooperation"
9738,I loved my roommate but I was always excited when she went home even for a day
9739,Best comment in this post
9740,Get her a bf that can come over when your gone
9741,"I had strict parents and I had to go home every weekend when I was in college. Depending on the semester, I would either leave on Thursday or Friday evening and I wouldn't be back until Monday morning. Even then, all I would do was drop my stuff in my dorm room, then I'd be gone for most of the day because of classes and my on-campus job. I had a feeling that my roommates loved it, especially my first semester, because she didn't like to wear clothes and would blast the heat."
9742,My roommate randomly moved out a few weeks ago. Pretty nice ngl
9743,others have said but yeah that‚Äôs weird it‚Äôs none of her business
9744,"Yeah, I rented a condo with two other students, and one of them started getting SUPER upset about me going home to see my parents/boyfriend most weekends. She hated when I had homework to do and couldn't hang out with her, and treated it like a crime when I had time for others and not her. Like, when I mentioned I wanted to get a small caged pet she got super defensive like I couldn't possibly have time for it, because I often couldn't hang out with her due to homework. Unsurprisingly in hindsight, things turned ugly quickly, and when I didn't do what she wanted, she got her boyfriend to randomly show up at the condo and help her ambush me. That kind of possessiveness is something I always recommend being cautious of."
9745,"For real. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cause drama with people you room with, ask them about it. Here is my opinion of the perspective they could have and the reasons behind it, use it in your conversation and be very tactful and respectful. But if it‚Äôs a shit reason don‚Äôt think twice life is long.‚Äù *Chefs kiss*"
9746,"She probably likes you being around, kinda weird she's upset about it tho cuz you're leaving to be with your bf lol"
9747,"Right? When I lived in the dorm still, none of my roommates ever went home. It was awful because 3/4 never even left the room at all for the most part. It was so annoying to never have privacy or my own space."
9748,[deleted]
9749,"Also this is from a text someone sent to someone else. The op isn‚Äôt being rude for living her own life, but neither is the Roomate for just saying things to another person. It could be simple lonliness ‚Äî it could be jealousy cuase she has to be on campus all the time, it could be she feels guilty about not having that much energy to see family members etc. The little text the roommate sent might be judgemental but it‚Äôs not inherently a bad judgement. One thing I‚Äôve learned from growing up isolated to having 5 roommates in a small dorm is that people don‚Äôt live up too 100% one thing or the other. Someone might think a person is an oversharer and occasionally remark about it to another party, but still value the friendship very much and not be bothered enough that they need to tell there friend they don‚Äôt like that about them. You‚Äôre unlikely to find 100% compatability with a random person(s) you get paired with and people need an outlet to express their feelings."
9750,That‚Äôs a good way to get your bed fucked on.
9751,You have weird friends man
9752,My guess is she was hoping to be friends with you and you going home every weekend sends the message that you don‚Äôt care about your friendship. She probably would like to do activities and hangout over some weekends.
9753,"Not unless you guys are like best friends, sounds like she just needs to make friends"
9754,Damn 2 random people showed up in my room a few weeks back‚Ä¶ come get y‚Äôall‚Äôs damn roommates I don‚Äôt have enough room for them and they eat all my food.
9755,[deleted]
9756,"My roommate Freshman year would straight up vanish for a week and text me ‚Äúbe back Monday‚Äù on a fucking Monday lol 

Every time, what a delightful message.

Honestly have no idea how that dude graduated, come to think of it."
9757,"I don't get along with my roommate and she NEVER leaves. God, I wish she left for one day. Why does this person want her to stay lol."
9758,"Yeah I was thinking the same thing. It sounds like she‚Äôs feeling lonely or abandoned, because she probably doesn‚Äôt really have friends and therefore is just having to spend weekends alone. Not saying that it should be OP‚Äôs problem, but that‚Äôs the only explanation I can think of for someone not wanting to have the room to themself on the weekends."
9759,"THIS. Last year, both of my roommates left me all the time over weekends to be with their boyfriends. It was super lonely and depressing."
9760,Bruh MINE TOO
9761,"Does this professor drop the lowest assignment grades at all? Most of the time when I see strict policies like this, it's paired with a ""lowest assignment grade gets dropped"" policy to account for the fact that shit happens to people sometimes. 

Otherwise, I'd personally try to stay away, because shit happens (*especially* in the context of a pandemic paired with the accelerating effects of global warming)."
9762,"""That's how real work is"" always infuriated me because I worked several jobs during college and apparently having to work isn't an excuse ""because in the real work world, you can't have that problem""."
9763,"‚ÄúPlan your time‚Äù

‚ÄúFamily emergency‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt plan the death of my grandma you asshole (not including killing her)"
9764,"What kills me is the (just like the real world of work) part. It comes off as so demeaning to insinuate that their students don‚Äôt have a clue what the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù is like. Especially so if this professor is an academia lifer who has never worked in industry. 

That said, I partly agree with their decision to not allow late work as it just puts more work on the instructor and gives procrastinators an unfair advantage, but illness and emergencies likely fall under some sort of ‚Äúreasonable accommodation‚Äù policy somewhere.  You may not get credit for an assignment because your grandma or dog died, but if you got cancer while taking this class I bet you‚Äôd get some accommodations. 

It is really frustrating when you have a situation like I did last summer: professor doesn‚Äôt accept late work, then turns around and doesn‚Äôt reply to any emails or grade assignments for weeks. Didn‚Äôt know my grades on the first few assignments until 2 weeks before class was over. Pure hypocrisy!"
9765,"The ‚Äúfamily emergencies don‚Äôt qualify‚Äù is what gets me the most

That‚Äôs like saying the essay about Shakespeare is far more important than helping a severely ill family member"
9766,"This is also somewhat more reasonable given that students can do the work early.

It's functionally not different than setting the due date 3 days earlier, and saying there's no penalty for being late by 3 days, but nothing is accepted later than that, no excuses."
9767,"I hate when people belittle students by assuming the world they live in isn‚Äôt real and they have no idea how the ‚Äòactual‚Äô world works. 

Stupid power trips."
9768,Came here to say this. The prof is obviously FAR removed from reality. I would be contacting anyone within my reach at the university to have these bullshit late policies changed.
9769,"I had a professor like this before nothing was accepted as late or  excusable under any circumstance even illness/sickness. At least they drop two of the lowest grades for any paper/exam we chose no questions asked.

While it seems unfair, I really don't have an opinion either way. They are right that you need to plan ahead for assignments and it's best to start early, but sometimes something random can completely throw your life out of balance."
9770,"I worked out of academia for many years and this is it here. The real world thing is almost always said by people who have no clue what non academic jobs are like. Very, very, very few deadlines are truly immovable. Federal grants are one of the few I can think of and even then, I have submitted reports a day or two late. 

No one actually cares about this stuff, especially in circumstances like those listed."
9771,"Kinda normal? You‚Äôll have professors who are chill af and those who are strict af. Either one can be an amazing profesor or asshole. One of my favorites, docked me an entire grade for turning in a paper at 12:03 instead on by 11:59. I still enjoyed my conversations with him and he was super helpful in providing feedback and support."
9772,"I was working a full time job while commuting to college and had a professor that wouldn't let me make up work for when I was in the hospital... BeCauSE THatS nOt HoW tHe ReaL WorLD WoRKs...  Like, fuck off. I am 23 and know how the real world works, and my job let me make up the hours because that's part of being freaking responsible."
9773,"The real world of work is too often like this. It‚Äôs called abuse, and trying to give it further credence as if you‚Äôre doing students a service is a disservice to us all.

Just because it‚Äôs normal and expected, doesn‚Äôt mean that it should be. America in particular is one a cesspool of corporate exploitation."
9774,"I feel like majority of the time, if you can do the assignments on the first day, the class actually isn‚Äôt planning on teaching you anything( you already have the tools to succeed)"
9775,Why am I paying money to take a class if I can do the assignments on the first day? What of value am I supposedly gaining in the class then?
9776,"Yeah I think this is why I'm not particularly floored by reading it. 

If he was handing out assignments periodically then something happened within that timeframe, I would say this is pretty strict. But if it's true that ""you have the assignments on the first day"", as in you know from the minute you get the syllabus what all is expected and when it is due... then yeah it's kind of on you for putting something off long enough to be considered late. 

Idk just my thoughts."
9777,Lol wtf where is this?
9778,"People who are like thats how the real world work are professors and academics operate vastly different from a lot of jobs lol. they do the same spiel in highschool, and dont really know how the real world operates."
9779,Is it really hard to have one ounce of sympathy
9780,LPT: Kill grandma to get assignment extensions! (Only works ~~once~~ twice)
9781,"Different people will take it different ways. To me, it invalidates any previous experience I had before attending college. HW assignments are basic deadlines, anyone who has paid a bill/tuition/anything with a deadline knows how they work. 

I could just be projecting. I started college in my mid 20s after working in my first career for 6 years. If I read this on a syllabus my first day I would seriously consider trying to switch for a different instructor if at all possible. For no other reason than to avoid spending a whole semester with someone who gave me such a bad first impression. 

I wouldn‚Äôt drop out of college or anything over it, but I would have a very bad impression of that prof from there on out. Good for you for not letting stuff like this bother you! It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm still working on."
9782,"Double standards and lack of empathy this semester I swear! I mean I really am upset because even great (well before COVID were) professors I‚Äôve taken in the past are getting insanely strict and then get mad when you ask about why they didn‚Äôt reply to your email, give feedback on xyz, show up to Zoom meeting etc."
9783,"I mean. Having that as a policy is kinda normal. That way if there's a real honest emergency it's the exception instead of the rule. I've had actual emergencies happen with profs who had this rule and they usually were fine, but they had this rule to prevent people from turning things in late. They have grading deadlines too, so your late work affects their life as well. And it's not just your paper, it's you plus whoever else in however many other classes they teach. So, whatever they can do to try and scare people away from ""I was sick (I had a hangover) and I couldn't come to class, can I still turn it in pls?"" as they can, I think is the real purpose. But, as others have said, you can always drop and go with another prof/class, etc. Or just plan to do this class's assignments as early as you can if you're expecting a hectic quarter."
9784,Because communicating with your professors when you reach a roadblock is a productive method?
9785,"Similarly, all I could think of was ""My boss is a fellow adult who understands that life brings challenges that outweigh that weekly progress report."" And if this hard line was his stance I'd work elsewhere."
9786,"It‚Äôs probably that they‚Äôve always had terrible internet due to a lack of existing infrastructure, it just didn‚Äôt affect them academically until the pandemic forced all classes online."
9787,"My suggestion? Drop the class if you can and take it in a future semester with a different prof. I just graduated and in ‚Äúthe working world‚Äù you can receive extensions for extenuating circumstances. 

I had a professor that had a similar policy. I figured that I am good with meeting deadlines so it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Tragedy struck when my roommate/ friend passed away unexpectedly about 2 months into the semester. I tried to appeal a deadline with my university but they held that they couldn‚Äôt interfere with preexisting class policies. Even though my friend was a student of the university and I was immediately put on the school‚Äôs radar as a close friend, it wasn‚Äôt enough. It made an already awful situation even more distressing. Protect your GPA/ sanity first because you never know what could happen."
9788,I feel like being able to do the work early makes it seems more reasonable but that isn‚Äôt always possible for everyone. I know when I was in college I was taking a full course load and working 3 different jobs. I worked ahead when I could but it wasn‚Äôt always an option for me and I feel like policies like this are extremely stressful and harsh on students that don‚Äôt have a traditional schedule or work load.
9789,"Sorry, this is a load of bullshit. I always tell my students I'm flexible with small extensions of a day or two because shit happens. However I also tell them that if I start getting a ton of requests for such extensions (my personal benchmark is 20% of a class), my flexibility vanishes. However, it's *never* come to that. 

Now if some massive power outage happened affecting a huge amount of my students, well obviously that's an issue. But this kind of stuff is just...unnecessary."
9790,Your second paragraph is probably the most insane thing I've read today.
9791,"If they were really your friends you would see them after the celebration

The celebration itself isn‚Äôt as important as you finishing the degree. That is what you should be proud of the most."
9792,"Sorry, but congrats on the hard work üí™"
9793,"I am so sorry you missed your graduation, but I am very proud of you. You worked super hard to earn your diploma!"
9794,"I had to miss my high school graduation due to a positive COVID test too. I‚Äôd say arrange to meet up with your friends after your COVID quarantine ends. Also FaceTime/contact them. 

Congrats on graduating!"
9795,Ask the college if you can attend the next graduation ceremony
9796,This 100%!
9797,"This right here. Sure, your friends won‚Äôt be there, but you can still walk and partake of the festivities. Colleges permit this sort of thing pretty routinely."
9798,"Oh that super sucks! I graduated high school in 2018.

I feel so sorry for you."
9799,"2019 here, dodged a bullet. Sorry for anyone who had to deal with that shit though."
9800,Oh üíî
9801,"I got a Associates degree (3yrs), then was only supossed to take 2 for my Bachelors, but I bungled it during the pandemic"
9802,Im sorry friend. We started the same year and ended it the same year as well. You worked really hard. No one Can take that from you.
9803,I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you! Hopefully when you feel better soon you can still have a grad party! And good job on all your hard work!
9804,"Once you get better, I say take your cap and gown and go get some really nice pictures and still celebrate it! Maybe go out to eat with family and friends and whatnot!"
9805,"*Insert bad thing that happened to someone*

You: at least you‚Äôre not dead haha ü§™

Got fired from your job? At least you‚Äôre not dead!Your house burned down? A least you‚Äôre not dead! See how this is not helpful? Stupid point to make because it is obvious and useless."
9806,"Ceremonies means little. If you had a good college experience, then you have one regardless of whether you attended the ceremony. A lot of students in my university did not attend the ceremony because it is after term time and they are already back home or moving to a new place to start a job. Often those who enjoy uni the most didn't attend."
9807,"That is so rough, I‚Äôm so sorry but super proud of you!"
9808,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
9809,So sorry you missed your graduation but just know all of your hard work payed off in a amazing way! Congratulations on your degree üéâ‚ù§Ô∏è
9810,Apply to walk at end of summer. Ask your  assigned counselor
9811,"I know it‚Äôs not the same, but you should have your own graduation ceremony. You can‚Äôt change your situation so try and make the best out of it. Congratulations üéâ"
9812,"I graduated last year. Due to COVID - I didn‚Äôt have a ceremony. They offered a ceremony after I  graduated, but I didn‚Äôt see the point. 

Honestly, I haven‚Äôt given it a second thought. I know you are disappointed, but in the scheme of things you missed an event. Congratulations on your hard work!"
9813,"Take initiative to reach out to those people who meant something to you in college. Please don't capsulate your college experience with the 'missing of graduation' event. Rather keep the good memories in heart, reachout to people and say thanks, and look forward to the wonderful life ahead. Also don't forget to take care of your health from the very beginning in this new phase of your journey. Good Luck Friend!"
9814,Good bot
9815,Hey I missed my grad too this year because I got covid and I also took more than four years!! Solidarity
9816,Your family should throw a little party after your graduation
9817,"Hey, you still graduated. Go outside with your cap and gown and take some pics, you deserve it!"
9818,"I'm sorry. This sucks. My son graduated last year and he said closing his computer after his last class on zoom was the most depressing thing he's ever done. He got 1.5 years of a normal college experience and my heart broke for him. But he's moved on and you will too. My suggestion is to mourn it but not too much and move forward. If you ever chose to have children, you can double celebrate the crap out of every graduation they have and know a little piece of that is for you too."
9819,Go out with a mask
9820,I would have just attended and kept my mouth shut.
9821,"Ok there was definitely more that happened here between showering barefoot and getting his foot amputated. The bigger lesson here is probably to go to the doctor if you‚Äôve got some kind of big infection that neosporin isn‚Äôt helping. 

Is your friend diabetic? Diabetes will significantly increase your risk of something like this happening to your foot. If you have diabetes pay extra attention to your feet because you may not feel pain from an infection until much later than you would otherwise."
9822,Reading this as I accidentally stepped on a shower floor without shoes yesterday
9823,"That person most definitely also had a wound on his foot, and not an insignificant one. Probably also ignored signs of infection for a while. You won‚Äôt get your foot amputated just by walking in a communal shower."
9824,"To be fair, he probably had a wound on his foot, it got infected, and he didn‚Äôt see a health professional in time. You don‚Äôt just get your foot amputated from a shower floor. I still feel very sad for him though, hope he recovers well- physically and mentally."
9825,"yup!! sad that in the US today, people might end up avoiding or waiting on medical care because it costs to much.

There was a [youtube video of a girl who got bacterial meningitis](https://youtu.be/PDpWTJHmevY) and felt sick but didn‚Äôt go in soon enough. She got all four limbs amputated in the end."
9826,Is MRSA like the one your roommate has contagious?
9827,"It‚Äôs contagious

Usually nosocomial/spreads in a hospital though"
9828,"you need an open wound for it to infect you. also catheters. basically anything that can bypass your skin. the skin is a very good barrier. we have colonies of staph aureus (MRSA is methicillin-resistant-staph aureus) in our nostrils. MRSA tends to be nosocomial, so it's relatively rare to just get it while being out and about. if you don't have a compromised immune system you shouldn't worry too much.

there are a lot of precautions in place to reduce the chance of MRSA infections in hospitals."
9829,or get a bamboo foldable bath mat! that's what i use. can't stand shower shoes
9830,"unbelievably rare for something like this to happen. you have to have some sort of immune issue or poorly controlled diabetes to worry about amputation

it tends to be pretty hard to walk around on a severely infected food, so there's no way he didn't go to an emergency room before it was bad enough to require amputation. 

the most common shower infections are fungal and viral. viral will be HPV (think warts) and fungal tends to just give you athlete's foot. 

if it was MRSA, then he must have just let it rot, or he must have had an enormous wound on his foot (or immunocompromised). MRSA will present as any other folliculitis / abscess. if you've ever had an abscess, that's probably staph aureus, and MRSA is just staph aureus that is resistant to methicillin. it is a freak accident for it to get to the point of amputation."
9831,"It can spread from person to person via skin contact though, but yeah its usually hospital spread"
9832,MRSA is a bitch. I got it at rowing camp from getting lake water on my hand(we have a lot of cuts and bruises on our hands). Pain woke me up in the middle of the night. Could not move my fingers at all and the spot turned a strange shade of red. Had to rush to the ER
9833,It was a pleasure knowing you.
9834,"Yeah idk if most people today realize bacterial infections are still urgent and can be deadly. Like people were shocked when Jim Henson died, and he might have lived if he‚Äôd gone to a hospital  hours sooner"
9835,Not even a pair of dollarstore flipflops?
9836,"To be fair, USA doesn't have universal health care and as a result this student mightve been more likely to avoid seeking the health professional in time."
9837,"MRSA stands for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, it‚Äôs just the name for a staph infection that is resistant to certain antibiotics - antibiotic-resistant bacteria are indeed growing much more common"
9838,"fucking scariest post on this sub ever lmaooo 

everyone who read it will wear sandals in the shower from now on 100% chance"
9839,Flip flops are so cheap at almost every store just buy some damn.  Or take the slides you wear outside with socks on like they are actual shoes and out them to their proper use as shower shoes.
9840,"I always wear my shower flip flops, not risking anything üòÖ"
9841,Definitely had a bruise. It got into the blood stream. However these infections spread rapidly.
9842,"More like an open laceration, but yeah MRSA is nasty."
9843,This can't be the full story as to why someone's foot was amputated.
9844,"My dad got an infection like this growing up because he had a blister on his foot. In his case it was worse because he also had a broken toe from kicking a football. The infection that got in the blister traveled to his broken bone and gave him osteomyelitis. He ended up having one of his metatarsals totally removed and was very close to getting his foot cut off, and was in the hospital for like two months and on crutches for some insane amount of time. He's now 80 and has a weird floating toe that isn't connected to a bone in his foot. 

In his case, dirty sock + blister + broken toe was the magic combo. He was totally healthy, very physically fit and in high school at the time."
9845,"MRSA is staph. they are not resistant to all antibiotics, but they tend to be resistant to a large amount of antibiotics.

naficillin will work against staph aureus, and vancomycin will work against methicillin-resistant-staph-aureus (MRSA). if not vanco, linezolid and ceftaroline both also have activity against MRSA."
9846,"There are many well documented procedures to reduce MRSA and other infections, especially post-surgery, however most hospitals in the United States do not adhere to these procedures as strictly as they should, and many, many deaths and complications from infections are entirely preventable"
9847,"Coach checked the top of my hand, towards the wrist. He said if the veins looked dark and you can see em through the skin, it‚Äôs not a good sign"
9848,"You say there‚Äôs no way he didn‚Äôt go to the er, but some of us have to worry about money when it comes to medical issues. If he thought he could push through, he might‚Äôve tried. I have nerve damage making it nearly impossible to walk and went to work for a week before it became unbearable and had to get it looked at because I‚Äôm poor and my insurance sucks."
9849,"nooo thank you, i hate wearing shoes of any kind in the shower"
9850,"If you‚Äôre talking about this happening from the dorm showers, this is probably why they recommend you to wear shower shoes in the dorm showers."
9851,So the whole class is wearing hoodies for the rest of the semester right?
9852,"This almost sounds like a set up to some weird ethics lesson. Out of all the things to come after why hoodies? There are worse clothing choices out there they could have banned and if he‚Äôs offended by people thinking it‚Äôs cold why not mention flannels, jackets, and other things like that?"
9853,"Yeah, I'm thinking it something like that cause this guy is borderline crazy."
9854,"Lol does this include women too? He starts out by greeting both genders but then mainly refers to the men in the class. Also, he never said anything about wearing coats, jackets, blazers, etc‚Ä¶ so do what you can with that."
9855,"Hell, if any of you are brave I'd say get a binkie and see what happens"
9856,"Option 3. Interrogate the metaphysics of a ‚Äúhoodie‚Äù. What even constitutes a ‚Äúhoodie‚Äù? How does one ‚Äúwear‚Äù a ‚Äúhoodie‚Äù? 

Also, I guess ladies are still allowed to wear hoodies lol"
9857,"Are they drunk or what? Hoodies? You‚Äôre paying to be there. 

Wear a hoodie, record the response"
9858,"Exactly this, it's a philosophy class, and based on OP's post, this seems to have popped up out of nowhere"
9859,I might actually do that now. Walmart is 2 minutes away
9860,Email him back saying you need to wear your hoodie do to your suffering from a medical condition known as ligma.
9861,"Sounds like a philosophy test, or a demonstration. Humor him for the moment, if it turns for worse, file complaint."
9862,Those swishy parachute suits that make noise no if even an inch of fabric touches something!
9863,Please post an update to this later on
9864,"He‚Äôs a philosophy professor, this is definitely some sort of social experiment lmao"
9865,"any chance you could convince the entire class to come in hoodies AND binkies

I would pay money to see that."
9866,"I‚Äôve literally seen people wear pajamas to class. Also, I‚Äôm an adult and I wear a hoodie almost 3/4 of the year. who tf does this guy think he is?"
9867,"Yeah, my philosophy professor always wore track pants and dirty t shirts to class. What does this guy wear, a tuxedo or something?"
9868,I personally wouldn‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôd make sure to wear a heavy jacket with a huge hood though next class.
9869,"Faculty here.  This might very well be the dumbest thing I have ever read from a fellow faculty member.  Unless this school has some special dress code regulations that aren't clear from this one post, wear whatever you want to class as long as you're fully dressed.  I can't even imagine how problem-free the life of this professor must be if he or she has time to monitor what ordinary items of clothing people are wearing."
9870,I refuse to believe this is nothing more than for a class lesson.
9871,"My philosophy professor didn‚Äôt own a television for metaphysical reasons, which he explained and no one could refute. This reads like the start of a class experiment."
9872,Does that mean the ladies of the class can still wear hoodies?
9873,yeah wondering the same thing üòÇ
9874,This may he a philosophy test of some kind
9875,I once had a teacher that hated lollipops and a good chunk of the class started eating them during her class. Good times
9876,"I'd try to get a group to bring blankets and Snuggies to use in class. Bonus if it's all actual baby blanket or for also bringing a pacifier.

Get some malicious compliance going."
9877,"Dr. Xavier,

Thank you for the update. I can appreciate that you feel that a hooded sweatshirt is inappropriate in your classroom. However, I notice that it isn't in the syllabus, the document that laid out in the beginning of this class how we will operate. You further singled out a gender identity, and barred just that gender identity from the attire; is it safe to assume that women are free to dress for their comfort as they see fit? How about those that do not conform to traditional gender identities? How are they supposed to react.

However, levity aside, I feel that I must inform you that you are breaking Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, of which prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Your program accepts federal financial aid, and you may therefore not do that. I have copied the chair of your department, and the Title IX coordinator for <institution> in case you have any questions about the particular discrimination in which you would like to partake. I look forward to being warm in your classroom."
9878,This is the way.
9879,Agreed.
9880,"That's a more interesting question than it has any right to be. Really, I guess any hoodie has at least three ontological sailences. 

First you have the white people hoodie. A normal, comfortable, casual, outfit choice that no one one really thinks twice about. It achieves salience via its interplay with white skin and white skins relationship to society at large.

[Second you have the black people hoodie. A type of clothing that can lead to racial profiling and oppression. It achieves salience via its interplay with black skin and black skin's relationship to society at larg](https://mlk50.com/2018/11/08/why-i-stood-up-against-racial-hoodie-profiling-at-a-memphis-mall/)e.

Then you have the hoodie-as-this-guy-sees-it, a terrible sin on fashion for some reason. It achieves its salience via interplay with the stick up this dudes asshole and the sticks relationship to his massive ego.

So, you have at least 3 different possible ontologies of the hoodie depending on the circumstances it engages with, or what Deleuze may call its position and movement within its field of immanence. 

This was my Ted talk."
9881,"Yes, yes it is"
9882,Just make sure you throw your arms back and lean forward.  It makes it more normal.
9883,"If I saw someone running on campus I‚Äôd definitely think to myself that they are just a tiny bit weird. But that‚Äôs just me. Lol. Do whatever you want my friend.

edit: most upvotes ive ever gotten. Haha. Thanks guys."
9884,[deleted]
9885,that would be chaos
9886,If you're running late you aren't saving time...
9887,It‚Äôs a lil weird. I could see it as even rude if you were maybe running very close to ppl or almost running into them so maybe do it away from narrow sidewalks. Otherwise if you‚Äôre not bothering anyone you do you I guess
9888,I guarantee he‚Äôs known as the ‚Äúweird guy who runs everywhere‚Äù.
9889,"It is hella weird. People make fun of people who run everywhere. Usually when I see someone running, I assume they're late to something very important. If I knew someone was just running to get around, I'd definitely be judging them."
9890,"I'd just assume they are going to be late for an exam or something. But if I saw them running regularly, I'd just assume they don't care if they get judged by others for doing something harmless and I'd respect them. It's still weird tho."
9891,[deleted]
9892,"Perfectly said, I couldn't explain it better lmao.  
  
OP, if you're really weirded out by it too, you could also get another transport method. Skateboard, bring back the heeleys, bike, etc. Or just you do you, that's OK too. I've gone running too during my commute, but it's normally just when I'm transferring (I take public transit) so most probably just think ""oh they're running late for the bus"""
9893,"
-are you really saving that much time?  Are you on that tight of a schedule each day that an extra 5-10 minutes actually makes a difference?

-proper planning can avoid requiring you to run everywhere to make it to things on time

-If you really want cardio in your day its probably better to do that in a more organized routine at the gym, and not flailing around on the sidewalks in jeans and a backpack

-Wear a coat?  Also, how does this help on hot summer days?

-no rebuttals to this point


You‚Äôll definitely get a reputation as that weird kid who runs everywhere for no apparent reason, but if youre cool with that then I would say go for it"
9894,It would at least get rid of the slow walkers.
9895,it‚Äôs weird but i really wish it was socially acceptable bc ur right
9896,Or a bike
9897,"dont ever stop though, op"
9898,"So true, fuck the slow walkers"
9899,"It's weird, but it doesnt really matter. Try to maintain your schedule so running becomes more of a hobby and less of a necessity

But know homies talking about you"
9900,That‚Äôs why you schedule your classes in locations close to each other... or take 1 hour breaks to chill
9901,I HAVE THE POWER OF GOD AND ANIME ON MY SIDE
9902,"ngl, weird."
9903,Just saying if I see someone running to class I would think they‚Äôre late. If they‚Äôre running to class because they don‚Äôt want to walk for some reason I‚Äôm going to think they‚Äôre weird
9904,weird unless its a naruto run
9905,"I pass by several people a week using a scooter, like the ones kid use. I'm kinda jealous, lol"
9906,Like fucking figure it out buddy. People got places to be I don't have time for your slow ass
9907,"I could NOT have said it any better

Don‚Äôt forget the massive backpack that bounces back and forth as you run"
9908,Or a motorcycle
9909,"> cute commute time


#EVERYONE GET ON YOUR BIKEY WIKEYS, IT'S CUTE COMMUTE TIME!!!"
9910,"Not always possible. This semester I literally had one option for two of my classes and two options for one class, though they were the same time and building just different professors/rooms."
9911,"Expanding on the answer by milk690, I have noticed a pattern to replies to the ""I'm lonely"" messages.  

Replies which encourage the lonely to take active steps to meet people and make friends are often not as well received as ""misery loves company"" style responses.  It seems ""take the initiative and talk to people"" recommendations generally get fewer up votes than ""I'm the same way, college sucks"" responses."
9912,"Jumping onto the bandwagon:

This isn‚Äôt a movie. This is real life. You‚Äôre not going to have some random once in a lifetime encounter where suddenly a group of people who are meant to be your best friends and the love of your life just magically appear in your dorm room.

Go outside, talk with people, go join a club or something, I don‚Äôt fucking care just do something with your life lol."
9913,"And in the meantime, take some time for yourself. Get settled, familiarize yourself with campus. Try to connect with your roommate. Get your class and study schedule organized. Do all the foundational stuff and the social stuff will fall into place."
9914,"Yup, you just have to do it, as corny as it sounds. I got the phone number of a really pretty girl my freshman year of college but i ended up getting ghosted a week later. Do I regret it? Nah. It‚Äôs two years later and we both probably barely think about it. Life has gone on. Moral of the story? Just do shit because nobody will probably remember it anyway. It‚Äôs the only way to try and NOT be lonely. Nobody will come to you first."
9915,"I‚Äôve just started downvoting the ‚Äúhow do I make friends‚Äù posts. If people want to see an answer to that question, they can look at how *half the posts on this sub* have been answered."
9916,"I think the problem is that most people haven't had to actively go and make friends since... Forever? When you're in grade school, you kinda just fall into a friend group since you're stuck with the same people all the time. And kids are in general, more accepting. So now that people have moved to college where you need to ""manually"" make friends, people are at a loss."
9917,"I don't want to be that guy, but is there like a college/university subreddit that excludes freshman students?

The vast majority of posts I see here are from people who are very self-conscious about what they're going to wear to school, concerned about eating lunch alone, and what kind of social cliques they are trying to get into. This a high-school kid's mentality. Meanwhile, I'm worried about getting internships, and what job I'm going to get when I graduate."
9918,I'm fairly sure OP was just giving a general example of how weak many people's communication skills appear to be on here. There have been many roommate conflict posts that could be easily solved by talking it out.
9919,"seriously. all of this. ALL. OF THIS! I‚Äôm back on campus after my freshman year where I had an easy time making friends (took a break during covid last year) I can tell that I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs scared or feels like I have to start over. Most of my friends from freshman year dropped out or we lost contact.

I‚Äôve been going up to people in my classes and striking up conversations. I‚Äôm also doing this with my professors if I have something to say about the lecture, which I NEVER did as a freshman, I was too scared.

People like to talk about themselves and you‚Äôll quickly discover who matches your major, hobbies, interests, etc. I talked to someone who seemed disinterested in the class and said she was going to get drunk later. I wasn‚Äôt eager to talk to her again because that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm in college. In my other class I talked to a neuroscience major in her senior year who switched from pre-med. I got her number for a study group because I want to be around intelligent people who have the drive to get their degrees and be successful."
9920,"Yes! Please! That would be amazing. I am also so sick of the ""I am 23-years old. Is it too late to go to college?"" posts"
9921,"I‚Äôm sorry, can someone please link me to the roommate that shit the bed post? I need context"
9922,"Yep, some people may not reciprocate and that's alright. Just keep on being your friendly self and friends will come your way."
9923,"I'm an old person now, but when I started college someone told me, ""The first week of your Freshman year is such a unique opportunity. It's one of the only times in your life that mostly everyone will be in the same boat of not having a solid friend group yet. It's completely normal to just walk up to random people, introduce yourself, and try to strike up a conversation.""

That, combined with the old ""fake it til you make it"" helped me talk to people when I was new."
9924,"Sometimes Freshman need a good 'ole ""no one cares, this isn't high school, do what you want responsibly, and don't stress over being popular"" from the upperclassmen (or oldies like me). Post it enough times and they'll either start to listen or realize we were right :)

If you're looking for industry-specific info, maybe try subreddits or other communities specific to that industry. I'm skeptical you'll find much good industry info here unless you plan on teaching or doing research."
9925,[deleted]
9926,"I find that the best way to make friends is by forming a study group/group chat with a few people in your classes. That way, you all have something to talk about and relate to, and it can eventually turn into a real friendship."
9927,Sample bias. Redditors are the people who can't make friends irl
9928,Some people may reciprocate and later on you will find that they are actually assholes that you don't want to hang out with.  Making friends ~~in college~~ is a process.
9929,"My roommate just ejaculated into my ramen, why don‚Äôt i have friends? am i ugly ?"
9930,Do you have any idea how goddamn anxious this makes me?
9931,"Agree, it can be really hard to break the cycle of isolate even in non covid times. Eventually you just need to force yourself to do the hard, uncomfortable thing and reach out to the people around you. Took me so long, but one successful interaction is worth 100 failed trys. 

Building a social network is like gardening; plant 100 seeds and expect 1-5 to actually sprout and grow. Also provide proper care for the sprouts you already have so they grow strong and healthy."
9932,"Also want to point out that I think a lot of what students (especially freshman) are stressing out about is certain ideals that are portrayed online and on social media, which sucks that most of my generation expects to get exactly one someone else‚Äôs experiences *seems like* but in reality is not"
9933,"Talking to people is a skill. To develop that skill you need to talk to people. Consider the alternative, do you want to feel awkward in social situations for the rest of your life? 

Easiest way to start a conversation is to use the immediate situation as a foundation. Example:

Yesterday I went for a hot coffee at Starbucks. Girl behind the counter says, sorry the machine‚Äôs broken. I only have iced coffee. I asked, Who broke the machine? She shrugged and said it happened yesterday when someone ordered hot chocolate. Machine started smoking. I laughed and said, who the hell orders a hot chocolate on the hottest day of summer? She laughed and passed me my iced coffee. 

And that‚Äôs it. I have conversations like this several times a day. Some long. Some short. The key to doing this is practice practice practice and being present in the moment. You have to hear what people are saying to respond to them effectively. Over time you‚Äôll discover people you vibe with."
9934,what
9935,this was so hard to read
9936,"It's just freshmen being freshmen, nothing new here. This is probably the first time they've ever left their families so they are nervous, scared, stressed, you name it. They don't know how to deal with social situations as an adult so they are just looking for advice."
9937,"My roommate actually did this my freshman year,  But he went into the room of one of our sweet maids and and shit there bed instead of mine. That particular suite mate   Had somehow managed to acquire a girlfriend/whatever you call a repeat hook up you buy dinner for three day a row the second week of freshman year  And he was crashing at her place so so not home so I so I and the guy who actually lived in that room whose bed was not currently bio hazard had to. get my drunk shitty roommate out of that bed into the shower ,  And deal with the grossness since  

The roommate/suite mate  Was the guy that was somehow getting us into into parties because his because his sister was the president of her sorority on campus so no one wanted to piss him off and and the guy whose room it was really didn't want to sleep with  d the smell.

 Fortunately our other other suite mate  In the 3rd room which was a single actually was actually was a neat freak and had all kinds of cleaning supplies just sitting in the closet in the closet in the common room so we used that stuff bleach and some other stuff to clean the bedding the betting and cheats and basically everything else to disinfect the bed.

Thankfully there were also rubber gloves so we didn't actually have to touch anything.

But yeah college it's one of those things almost everyone deals with when you find out that 1 roommate you have that's from BFE South Dakota that has never actually seen a larger town than 2000 people living in it is now living in Chicago in Chicago for the 1st time and the guy's dad was a preacher so yeah...  You tend to deal with that kind of thing  With the guys that whenever actually allowed to have any sort of social life  Because of their parents so they go nuts that 1st semester in college which which admittedly we all had a lot of fun fun but he was almost like like desperate to have fun  It's like a tightly coiled Spring that was finally allowed to to uncoil releasing all the energy from lit's not the energy from like years of compression if you know what I mean"
9938,I think it's also important to familiarize yourself with yourself! Being comfortable in your own company will ultimately help you make those lasting social connections.
9939,Shit in his bed to assert dominance

I literally lost my fulltime job because of Covid, but because I'm a student I'm not ""available for full time work"" during the hours mandated by my state gov. and don't qualify for regular UI. I haven't worked since March 19th and haven't gotten shiiit besides the $1200 in early April.

So basically, if you live in Wisconsin, it's probably not even worth the effort to apply, imo."

10008,"Hey just FYI its not free money you do have to pay taxes on it at the regular income tax rate. If you didn't select to have the unemployment office take the taxes out when you applied for it, you will get hit for these taxes when you file taxes at the start of next year."
10009,"The debt never goes away even with filing for bankruptcy as treated the same as owing taxes. Fees and interest will be added. Automatically seized tax returns. And eventually wage garnishments of 15%. Plus if you owe enough they can seize from bank accounts, but that is more for higher amounts from taxes or improperly received grants/funding."
10010,I would imagine ‚Äòdouble dipping‚Äô is either illegal in some way or a loophole that would inevitably end in you being on the hook for one amount or the other. I‚Äôd recommend waiting until after your first UI expires or close to the date.
10011,"For anybody thinking about this, make sure you actually qualify before you apply. **The money is taxable, and starting next week most states will require you to show proof of you applying and actively searching for a job since FEUC expires on the 25th**. Don't try to play the Department of Labor, they'll hit you hard if you're faking it."
10012,That's identify theft and will cause a lot of problems for the victim. If someone gets caught that is definitely a felony. Federal if across state lines. I think federal if you even use the postal service to accomplish your fraud even within the state.
10013,So I had a campus job that was cut short due to covid. I also had a work study and was paid the last $200 to fill it out over the course of 3-4 pay checks. I am not working due to health risks of my siblings. Am I still eligible?
10014,This happened to me in Illinois. I just had to call the offices every day until I got through to someone who reviewed my claim and cleared it up instantly. Took hours of hold time though.
10015,"Very good point, I chose to apply taxes now so I wouldn't forget about it later and get hit with them."
10016,"Usually, you are not eligible for unemployment if you are the one who quit. Unemployment is reserved for people who were laid off, at least in my state."
10017,"SC, Ive basically said fuck it and i‚Äôm holding out living on eggs and rice and not driving anywhere for the next month till i get my financial aid/loan refund that pays my rent.

Can‚Äôt really get a job during the school year having class and my puppy, so i do online odd jobs for like $400/mo to pay for food and gas and things. The summer jobs are where i build my savings, but i guess i‚Äôm just gonna live on the edge until next summer since financial aid is my main income lol."
10018,"Did you have your own, separate application or was this an add on to your mom‚Äôs?"
10019,"My friend had a small work study job that she lost. She was receiving over 700 a week unemployment, way more than she previously made. They were making it easier to qualify because of the pandemic. I've also been making 713 a week for 2 months now."

Like I still wanted the job, I was just following the advice of my doctor and it just kind of sucks to have to dip into my tuition savings to stay on top of things because of him being that petty. I legit have to take out a 3K student loan now that I didn‚Äôt need before. I had 4K saved aside for college now I only have 1K.  I actually loved the company and worked at a previous chain before so it just sucks to take a genuinely enjoyable job away from me because I was doing the right thing, and since I was fired I don‚Äôt think I can even get hired at a different store he doesn‚Äôt manage."

10032,"Actually, nowadays, if you have an ipad, you can copy and paste a picture on google into your notetaking app and trace over the shape (as well as any important details).  Then, delete the picture itself and---voila! you have drawn something in a few minutes."
10033,I bet they have it memorized though
10034,"Y‚Äôa know, I do have to say that when I made my notes more ‚Äúcreative‚Äù I actually retained the information. 

I took something like 8 years of spanish in elementary/middle/high school collectively. I can say hello, good bye, how are you, I‚Äôm good, some colors, and numbers up to 10. That‚Äôs it. 

I always thought I was just crap at languages. 

Flash forward to college and I had to take two sequences of a language (German, Spanish, French, or Hindi I think was the last one or maybe it was mandarin idr). I opted for French bc why the heck not. 

I sucked for like the first few weeks/month. Then I started writing the French in purple and the English translation right under it in pink. 

I did it for verb conjugations. Ex: parler means to speak so ‚Äúje parl‚Äù would be in one color but the ‚Äúe‚Äù that gets tagged onto ‚Äúparl‚Äù was a different color. 

It helped so much I was mad I didn‚Äôt think about doing it sooner."
10035,Pretty much. It‚Äôs good practice for me at least to draw things out and visually see the process. Also explaining it to myself while I draw it helps reinforce that I know the content and finds weak points where I might not
10036,I think you underestimate how artistically challenged some people (cough me cough) are...
10037,"It probably took 10 minutes tops to get the outline of the heart done and then maybe like 5 minutes to do all the proper color matching of oxygenated versus deoxygenated blood. And labeling all the parts was as a review to make sure I knew the order of blood flow. So while a print out is faster, I‚Äôd argue that taking the time to understand placement is worth it"
10038,I can barely draw a circle or plus sign
10039,"I think with this drawing, it does look complicated but most of it is just tube like shapes and variations of ovals. I think if you chose one starting point, I bet you could get a general outline and fill in details later"
10040,"And then there‚Äôs me, who can barely draw a straight line ü•≤"
10041,"I think making creative notes, even just taking time to make things bold and have color is easier to understand and retain as the visual senses are drawn towards things that are different from the rest. Good for key points and such"
10042,I think im watching too much F1 cuz i immediately thought you were drawing a F1 Circuit.
10043,"My thing is, fuck it. I‚Äôm already sitting here taking my notes. If it takes an extra 2 mins total to take my notes bc I swapped pens who tf cares if it means I can pass a class and actually retain information instead of just regurgitating it for an exam."
10044,Fuck they doin ove there
10045,"Admittedly, I think some of my drawings are more complex, but I know a couple of people in my class who were CONVINCED they couldn‚Äôt draw but when one of our class activities was to draw bones with charcoal, they realized how much they underestimated their artistic skills. Practice makes perfect!!"

10050,"Staying alive, staying alive üé∂ in reality, it‚Äôs just my cardiovascular notes for Anatomy"
10051,Writing out notes in different colors and a good handwriting does all the difference for me! It doesn‚Äôt even take long and helps me retain all the information.
10052,"My ‚Äúargument‚Äù for using sketchbooks in science based classes just really comes from the freedom you have with unlined paper. Drawing diagrams helps comprehension and can make you see connections as well as test yourself on if you can label things correctly or explain concepts while you draw. Lined paper is always distracting and then being able to add in any little notes, charts, etc is helpful with a sketchbook too. You can organize all your thoughts and do creative note taking and use stylistic techniques to highlights major points

10064,Sadly for the Florida program people tend to view it differently for some reason. We actually had quite a large amount of people here from SoCal
10065,I told them everything. Absolutely everything. Mom didn't believe me at first and thought I was covering as if I got fired
10066,"It's an ""internship"" but not really an internship. You either take a semester off or do classes at the same time, and yeah basically it's just a sneaky way for Disney to bring in workers and then give them absolutely crazy hours and low pay. What's funny too is I hear if you're taking classes during the program Disney gives you a scheduled study hall. Guess how much time the give you outside of work...my friend got 2 hours 1 day a week"
10067,"Went to Disney recently and could barely make it 8 hours in the parks in the heat and almost had heat stroke one day. I cannot imagine working a 12 hour shift on your feet in that heat, I‚Äôm amazed workers aren‚Äôt carted off in ambulances regularly."
10068,"This sounds very similar to those coal mining towns that owned the housing, stores and workers. That song 16 tons ""I owe my soul to the company store"" popped in my mind reading this. Someone needs to do a documentary."
10069,"The sad part is....they are. It happens actually all the time. We had code words for it. Needing an ""alpha"" meant we need an ambulance and needing an ""ROS"" meant relieving someone of their shift. Like I said my friend had that diabetic emergency and they wouldn't let her go home, wouldn't even let her sit down, and recently had to be taken out in an ambulance due to dehydration. Then another friend (the one with celiacs) had to be taken out in an ambulance twice due to dehydration. Another close friend didn't have to be taken to the hospital from work, but after she got home had to get IV fluids pumped. And then a few other people I know actually fainted on the job, one friend even fainted in the Pirates of The Caribbean area and fell into the damn water and Disney was like okay see you at work tomorrow"
10070,"You'd be surprised! Hearing your kind words actually means so much more than you know. I'd say that's a success! And I appreciate your comment, it really was a ridiculous experience. But I definitely love Florida, Florida itself is a fantastic, absolutely gorgeous place to live. I mean where else in the US can you drive one hour and get to a turquoise blue water, white sand beach, lined with coconut palm trees in january"
10071,"I should probably mention when there were lightning storms, which in Florida is often, if ur greeter you still have to stand out in them"
10072,"> Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave.

Fuck Disney, and this is a particularly important point I want to emphasize. There's a huge difference between enjoying a place and enjoying working at a place. I had to find out the hard way, like these people did, so I hope anyone reading will learn from my mistakes."
10073,"I'd almost say it's even gotten worse cus now you can't even put preferences for roles. It's all based on need, they just throw you wherever they need people"
10074,Did you try sending this text you posted here to them? They probably only have a rosy view of the place which is cultivated in media.
10075,"Thank you for posting this. It's awful and inhumane how DCP workers are treated.

This next part I don't say as judgment but more as a wakeup for anyone considering this: you are out of your mind if you think one of the biggest corporations in the world cares about you and needs your money to work for them. The fact that they sell a product you enjoy, a family-friendly one at that, does not mean the experience of being at the company is like that product. Disney has been involved in some monstrous shit, even apart from this. They aren't your friend and it's not healthy to make their corporate identity your identity. Please, like what you like, but respect yourself enough to think critically about what you need, where you work/live, and what you consume."
10076,So what exactly is the college program? You just work for Disney while you‚Äôre in college?
10077,They say it's a customer service internship but in reality it's just exploitation of young people.  There's nothing that couldn't be gained working part time at Panara or any other place locally.
10078,"Going off of this, Disney made everyone I know quit/pause college and come work for them... which was longer than a semester."
10079,I know my sister's friend went to this. I'm not sure if he still does but it makes me happy to know my sister decided to not go.
10080,Why'd u take the time to comment thenüòÇ
10081,"I‚Äôm not surprised at all. This is actually not the first time I‚Äôve heard about this. My friend‚Äôs older sister did it years ago, it was very much the same situation. She started having health problems while there, but they wouldn‚Äôt even let her go home at first. She battled them for a month or two before she was finally allowed to go back home. She was 19 at the time. It‚Äôs unfortunate and sad to hear about, but things like this do need to be exposed."
10082,Does Disney make the workers pay their own medical bills and ambulance rides when they are forced into harm through their working conditions?
10083,"Total honesty, fear about what my parents would say. That really was the only thing."
10084,"[Tennessee Ernie Ford - ""16 Tons""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIfu2A0ezq0) for those who've not heard it."
10085,"You should be recording conversations, getting written documentation and witness statements otherwise you're just another student who has something negative to say."
10086,Agreed. It's a great learning lesson but also very devestating one.
10087,Not sure but I wouldn't be surprised
10088,"Not to detract from that terrible experience, but what a lot of people dont realize is that there is a big distinction between the Disney ""College Program"" and Disney ""Professional Internships"". The PIs tend to work in office/corporate settings (Operations, Finance, HR, etc.) with higher pay while the CPs are pretty much park employees running the attractions.

Either way though, Disney greatly under pays for both programs."
10089,"Honestly, fuck Disney.  They get away with treating their workers like garbage because people have bought into the idea that working for Disney is a magical privilege.   I had friends who did the college program and a friend who works there now as a regular employee- hearing about the shit they went through has permanently turned me off of the company.

OP, I'm sorry to hear you went through all of that.  It's borderline inhumane what you've been through; I hope you go on to do much better things post-Dinsey.  Thank you for speaking out and sharing your experience."
10090,Sadly cus I'm not in the program anymore I'm unable to do so but maybe I can ask my friends who are in it to do that
10091,"They‚Äôre prob employees who work at the dining facilities on campus. That‚Äôs wild that they have a contract, most people at my college didn‚Äôt work there for very long and it was at-will.

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre the ones out of touch here."
10101,"It‚Äôs not in the US. Especially not in Boston. And remember, they‚Äôre taking home maybe $1400 a month. Rent is usually around $900-1500. 

I make $2800 a month. My rent is $1400, 700 with a roommate. I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to eat on that crap.

And I‚Äôm sorry, but there is no such thing as unskilled work. These workers are on their feet for 8 hours a day, operating a kitchen and dining hall. They are dealing with drunk and hungover college students and their trash and dishes. They are doing good service, which is hard as crap in reality. I know, I had friends who worked at Chartwells in college. 

And they do not finish after lunch. There is breakfast, lunch and dinner service. Chartwells are usually open from 5 in the morning until 9in the evening, with breaks between. 

And I have worked theee jobs to bring home about $400 a week. Do you know how I lived? In bedroom of a house that was down the streets from a crack house. I lived in the meth capital of my city, because it was all I could afford. 

Do not tell me that they are making good money. They‚Äôre making shit money for a shit job that has shit conditions."

10108,"I live in panhandle Florida. I do live close to the water, but that‚Äôs only maybe a $300 increase on rent than northern panhandle. I know because I was trying to get a cheaper apartment. 

I am single with no children and no pets. My car is old, but gets good gas mileage for its model and I live less than 10 miles from my apartment. I don‚Äôt drink at bars or do drugs (teacher). Utilities come out to about $200, again split between me and my roommate. Add in phone and insurance, another $100-150. I still spent the week before payday looking at double digits and wondering when my bank account would go red 

Rent in the US is terrible. Average rent is $1400 across the country. 

Boston‚Äôs average rent is $3600. That‚Äôs 1 and a half the amount of what they get paid monthly. And you think they don‚Äôt deserve a raise?"
10109,"Very surprising everything is that cheap for you (given that you live alone too). But do know that your rent is definitely on the lower end for one person alone. But also that 35k mentioned is before taxes, so it really still doesn‚Äôt leave someone with much, even in a mid-cost of living city. And it doesn‚Äôt include clothing, gifts, entertainment, eating out, hobbies.

And they‚Äôre making 22,000 CURRENTLY. 35,000 is what they‚Äôre aiming for, which is fair. 

So I‚Äôm confused on why you think 35,000 is super normal, even if it‚Äôs not a high cost of living city. It‚Äôs really not much, especially for older people."
10110,"You mentioned the person being out of touch about normal incomes (35k) and how your monthly expenses are easily $2100>, so I thought it was an obvious implication you were referring to the 35k as very livable"
10111,Solution: Unionise
10112,REST IN HEAVEN
10113,I think this a global thing. Wage inflation and regular inflation is the problem and not just one entity doing it. You should really consult with an economic professor just see what‚Äôs going on atm with the fed
10114,"OK sure, but that's not what they are asking for.

All they are asking for is increased labor costs for dining hall expenses.

Which they will have to pay for."
10115,"Actually that specific stuff is usually just contained in student fees. If they cut the frills out, I don't think you would see more than a 10% reduction in total. And a lot of that stuff like gyms, events, etc. contributes to your wanting to be there and not another university.

Most students want the extra stuff. A lot of students also ask their university to provide things like extra counselors, new facilities, and new chairs (of programs not actual chairs). Then they complain when tuition goes up. None of this is free and they have to get the money from somewhere. Schools in the 70s and 80s had a fraction of what we have today at some campuses."
10116,How much is your rent + utilities? Food? Car payments + gas? Health insurance? Phone? I‚Äôm just curious how your expenses add up.
10117,"Yeah, you‚Äôre right. There is a lot of factors that go into situations like these. But I don‚Äôt like the idea that getting workers an almost livable wage is hurting someone else. It shouldn‚Äôt be. If the heads of these colleges can afford more than one house and a yacht, then their employees should be able to afford food and rent. 

What‚Äôs bad is that $35k still won‚Äôt cover the cost of living in Boston. But that‚Äôs probably the highest that the company would consider ‚Äúreasonable.‚Äù"
10118,"What are your expenses like and what city is this?

I'm assuming a single person in any US city outside of the dozen or so very expensive ones."
10119,"The current definition of livable wage doesn't assume a family. When you throw insults it just makes your argument worth less.

Also, I understand where you are coming from but no one *needs* to have kids in the first place. Birth control is very cheap in the US and very *very* effective. Kids are expensive and people have the option not to have them."
10120,"First I would like to say separately that I didn't know this college was in Boston. So my original statement doesn't hold the same weight in that specific city.

1150 for rent, 100 for utilities, 40 for internet, 10 for gym, 400 for food, 180 for car, 200 for gas and insurance.

So it's actually closer to 2100. But for 2500 monthly net that would mean I could still take a vacation once a year and probably cover all my pop-up expenses. I'm also near Philly and you could get a 1bd for 900, in a so-so but safe enough area, if you are flexible on location.

Also I'm younger than a lot of those workers so my insurance is likely much higher. And I'm living alone in a larger 1bd, not a studio or shared 2bd or 3bd."

Some math and science professors consider their field to not be part of liberal arts, meaning they like to gripe about liberal arts professors and students and such. The comments are all in good fun, but I‚Äôm just saying not all people would include math and the physical sciences in the definition. I guess it ultimately doesn‚Äôt really matter though.

I do think people from science and engineering backgrounds can definitely look down on social science majors and such, and that is a problem. As an engineering major, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs actually useful to take your core classes seriously, because subjects like psychology and economics are very applicable to so many things in life."
10151,"https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/t66y3j/if_you_didnt_properly_research_your_major_dont/

This one has quite a few people trashing liberal arts while either not knowing what it means or knowing what it means but it doesn't really apply to the conversation."
10152,"OMG people think Liberal Arts means being politically liberal?? TIL! 

I'm studying Sociology at a Liberal Arts school and...
Ok, now that I think about I'm not surprised at all."
10153,i'm a poli sci major and the one major i feel qualified to look down on is business
10154,Liberal arts isn‚Äôt the opposite of stem. Physics and chemistry are liberal arts degrees.
10155, Same. I heard about how going to school for business isn't a point because you can make your business up and coming without a degree. But the same ppl who preach this drop out of college and don't start their business.
10156,"I'm so tired of the circle jerk where ""right"" major = scads of money and life-long career and the ""wrong"" major means you'll be in part-time gig work the rest of your life. It's so wrong it's laughable, but too many students here buy in to the trope."
10157,[deleted]
10158,"Ah, I read that whole thread. People on Reddit kept telling me English was a useless degree until I did research, talked to a professor and told me I could work everywhere and I research what he told me. And it was true. I could work in healthcare, marketing, copywriting, libraries, paralegal, sales, Human Resources, business, finance. Basically any field that needs writing/reading part of the job"
10159,"Yeah I think these people are confusing liberal arts with humanities. I'm going to a liberal arts college, hopefully coming out with a chem major and engineering minor.
Our college also has very strong math and bio departments."
10160,"Oh yeah it's huge, especially among the older conservative crowd. They hear the word ""liberal"" and automatically assume it instills politically liberal values in people or something.

(I mean sometimes it still does, but ya know)"
10161,"Probably in today's world, but keep in mind it comes from latin"
10162,"Yes, I definitely think there's a distinction to be made there. Yes, all of these subjects fall under ""liberal arts"", but there's a separation between math and science and the social sciences/humanities.

I've often heard the term ""liberal arts"" expanded to ""liberal arts and sciences,"" to highlight this distinction while still showing how it applies to both areas."
10163,You're thinking of Liberal Studies (its related but not the same thing)
10164,"Yeah it's really annoying and honestly downright offensive. It's like:

""Angry on reddit? Oh guess you must be having mental issues and need serious help."" Like dawg am I not allowed to be pissed off at people?"
10165,"Think of it as the kind of things that were studied during the Renaissance, back when being a ""scientist"" was an actual job description, and every scientist was interested in like 20 disciplines at once.

If you want examples of majors that are generally considered not ""liberal arts,"" then some examples might be Business, Finance, Accounting, Engineering (to a degree), Architecture, Economics, Political Science, Education, things like that. These degrees aren't really considered part of the liberal arts degrees because these are more modern and more *applied.* Not to say for example a philosophy major doesn't apply their degree, but philosophy is more about theory rather than practical applications. Another example like this would be Pure math vs applied math"
10166,"Understandable, it‚Äôs gotta be hard for you too"
10167,"My problem are the breakout rooms. My professors requires us to do them and that we actively talk. I‚Äôm always the only one with cam and mic on, and he‚Äôll pop in and get upset nobody is talking. It‚Äôs definitely frustrating."
10168,"Sometimes it's not about what's true but what feels true.

Zoom with a camera feels invasive and intimate.  It puts your picture on top for you which tricks your mind into thinking everyone sees you when no one is paying attention at all.  If you can't get the background eraser to work, people see a small part of your room which is the most intimate and private part of your house. Even when my friends come over, no one actually goes into MY room with my computer but in inviting my professors and all these other strangers in.

In truth, I think people notice you less on Zoom than in class because there are less one on one interactions. In break out groups I am still juggling reading my notes, thinking about the questions/answers, and my own video to really truly concentrate on someone else's video.

My point is your feelings are valid because the system is engineered to make you feel seen and noticed (even if you don't want to be) and you can address them because the truth might not match the story your brain is telling you.  And also there are 100% legitimate concerns with effectively inviting strangers into your house through the camera."
10169,"As a student, I apologize. I see my professors every week yearning for questions from people and conversations."
10170,"Yeah it‚Äôs easier but different teachers do different things.

One of my professors keeps everyone‚Äôs mic/video off and just teaches. One of mine is smaller & we actually have to participate and it just feels so awkward every time."
10171,No worries.  I don‚Äôt blame the students at all.  This whole thing is bizarre.
10172,"Agreed and I hate recorded proctored exams. When math classes were in person, my prof would just sit in the corner of the room and maybe play solitaire or just look over the class a time or two

But recorded zoom exams are TERRIBLE, I cannot relax because I feel like a criminal even though I didn't do anything wrong, they suck"
10173,Have to do a group capstone project using a simulation. I‚Äôm the only one literally texting the group trying to set up a zoom meeting smh. It‚Äôs frustrating af
10174,I have a professor who calls on us and if we don‚Äôt respond she will give us a whole lecture on how ‚Äúthis won‚Äôt prepare us for the real world if we continue to stay silent.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt know how to use the chat function & has short term memory loss so she‚Äôs always blaming us for things. Sometimes we have background noise aka family that makes it hard for us to speak. Professors need to be understanding of that even though I know it‚Äôs probably hard on their end too.
10175,"my professor makes us present on zoom often, records it, and makes us watch it back and grade ourselves. its actual hell"
10176,"Yes. For me personally, I have anxiety about other people recording me. Part of that has to do with past experience, and part of it has to do with social media nowadays."
10177,"When you‚Äôre sitting in a physical class, pretty much nobody is looking directly at your face. But if you think about it, everyone in a Zoom meeting (if your camera is on, and if they‚Äôre in gallery mode) is looking directly at your face the entire time. Plus, I tend to turn my camera and microphone off and on and I‚Äôm so used to fidgeting with my face in front of my computer that I‚Äôm worried that the bad habit will persist when I leave my camera on."
10178,"That room intimacy part is very true. Same here, I don't put my video on for fear that everyone can see my private room space."
10179,Its really hard to avoid talking over people in Zoom sometimes
10180,"I think it sucks when professors make you put the cameras on. I have one professor who says that we have to put the camera on the whole class or it‚Äôs an unexcused absence, and if we step away for whatever reason, we have to tell her. She‚Äôs a nice professor and a great one, but that gets on my nerves I have to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the bathroom‚Äù when before, I just stepped out of class."
10181,"Breakout groups are a nightmare.

Asking/answering questions and having your face become the centre of attention isn't nice either."
10182,This sounds horrible omg
10183,My professor didn't like that I was laying down on my couch during a zoom lecture.
10184,Lol. This sounds horrible. I'd give myself an A just for putting up with it.
10185,Now imagine a student trying to talk into said void...
10186,I can understand nobody talking. Nobody would small talk in a room that they know is bugged by their boss.
10187,"A guess that shows you‚Äôre thinking is great even if it‚Äôs totally wrong.  I do get annoyed at people who talk just to hear themselves speak but if you have enough sense to be concerned about it, you‚Äôre not one of those people."
10188,I feel like I've been thriving or atleast handling presentations better through zoom. I used to get so much anxiety when I had to present things in person it was bad. The only thing I hate is being called on to answer questions out of nowhere. Because I'm either not paying attention when it happens or it's a class where they usually only lecture. And the breakout rooms are annoying too.
10189,"I always try to guess at least. As a teacher, what do you think about it?

Edit: teacher, not teachers"
10190,"ngl, when we do breakout rooms in class i usually leave and come back after they‚Äôre finished lol. they dont help me learn and theyre so awkward :/"
10191,"I'm so talkative in IRL classes so as long the subject isn't completely intimidating. For example I barely spoke in my Intro to Philosophy class last semester. But yeah, I only speak unless spoken to in Zoom meetings, and for some reason my thoughts don't seem to translate as well as I would like. It's odd."
10192,Yeah because this one time my microphone won't turn on and I was getting called on.
10193,"I was so happy when the TA set up the break out rooms and I was by myself. Hahaha I already had the lab done so I just sat there doin hw til class was over, he was fine with it üòÇ"
10194,"I hate what zoom does for discussion, too. I talk a lot in classes, but with zoom, I feel rude or feel like I‚Äôm talking too much."
10195,"Yeah free flowing conversation is hard. It feels like someone speaks a paragraph then another person does. It's very difficult to go back and forth and build a thoughtful conversation, in my experience.

I usually just say my piece and shut up right after that."
10196,"Wait, I submitted an essay on font 11 last week, now I just remembered the required font was 12...

Why..."
10197,[deleted]
10198,[deleted]
10199,"I‚Äôve always done this, made it seem like I was writing more than I had to, then changed the font and double spaced it. Kabaam. 7 page essay done in 2-3 hours."
10200,Smart -- very smart!
10201,"I love doing this! I'm doing this for my current paper and I only enlarge when I'm getting anxious. The wash of relief that sprays over me when I see that I'm nearly at my goal or past it is *amazing*.
It almost feels like a reward lol. 

For me I keep the paper at Arial, single spaced, and at 11. When I'm stressed, I put it to the required, then I change it back and keep on writing. Idk why it happens, but it's great and I'm not trynna question it to ruin it."
10202,Huh most of my essays are by word count not pages but I will check it out
10203,"So, after a couple years of suffering from long stretches of procrastination (like right now) and subsequent essay panic, I've figured out a decent system for getting a 3000-4000 word research essay in roughly 6 hours from scratch. This means I wake up at 9am with no progress at all, and finish by 3pm with a completed paper. In the process, I build an outline by stringing 3 quotes in 400-500 word chunks, and use that to rapidly finish a paper.

First, you want to come up with a good number of sources. Note when an essay required peer reviewed, scholarly sources. For that, a lot of people go to the pain of looking at physical books, and I say fuck that. Instead, open up your university's library webpage and see if they have a search engine for that library. If so, you might be lucky and have access to a database of scholarly peer reviewed sources, usually in research articles posted to research journals. Do a bit of skimming and collect ones that work with your argument and have quotable material.


Secondly, read your sources, obviously, and remember to grab quotes that support that thesis and put those into a word document. This will come in handy later. If you don't have a thesis, just grab interesting quotes that you could build into a thesis. For my Saudi Arabia history class, I had to come up with a way of critiquing King Faisal's attempts at reforming the state government, and noticed that they poured millions of dollars in supporting an agriculture industry while I was doing research. Stuff like that.

Finally, the research usually takes me 2-3 hours, and this includes building what I like to call an essay skeleton. As you collect quotes, start organizing them by common argument. Multiple quotes about agriculture sucking might be sorted into a ""agriculture sucked, therefore [Argument]"" kind of deal. That's the good shit that forms the bulk of what your thesis is arguing towards. For a 4k paper, I ended up with 1 main argument, and 4 sub arguments at 1k words each, usually well quoted.

Finally, the dastardly writing phase has begun. I find a good 3 quotes is sufficient for a decent 400-500 word chunk. My formula is always; [Present Argument] 

[Either use a quoted paraphrase or a blended direct quote to further an argument] 

[Explain why the quote furthers your argument] 

[Set up sentence for next argument]

This setup allows you to blitz an essay in 500 word chunks and provides for richly detailed word chunks with research supporting a majority of your essay. If they're sourced from peer reviewed databanks, even better. I always have quotes left over as I finish and that's a good sign."
10204,This is definitely plagiarism.
10205,"What psych major names his reddit account bigcheese, bro?

Edit: It is a joke people."
10206,My problem is always writing too much and having to spend hours figuring what I need to cut.
10207,"This is bad advice don‚Äôt ever, ever copy a paragraph into your essay. This is just asking for trouble."
10208,[deleted]
10209,"Plagiarism isn't just when people find out. Yes, knowledge is built on previous knowledge, but that previous knowledge must be cited and only used as support for your own original ideas. There's no getting around the fact that this is plagiarism and grounds for expulsion. It also can be caught by plagiarism software, just so you know.

Nobody fucking do this ever."
10210,"Yes, but, trust me, when they're paper essays, us professors aren't literally counting the words. Hell, we're barely reading them. We just know it's \~250 words per page. Why do you think almost every essay is a multiple of 250?"
10211,I wish I could have that problem
10212,that‚Äôs also very useful but make sure it‚Äôs a credible source
10213,"Yeah... that‚Äôs still plagiarism, and TurnItIn is getting better at spotting substituted text. 

My advice: find something you want to use, read it, think about it, close the original source then write it in your own words as though writing an email to explain it to a friend. 

Even better; find two (or more things) you want to write about, and do the same thing BUT now you blend them together to create your own remix. 

As a prof it simultaneously amazes me the efforts that students put in to try and circumvent the exercise, but also the sheer laziness that my colleagues show in not giving two f*cks about whether their students learn anything...

I want my students to be a better scientist than me, I would *love it* if one of them becomes my boss one day - it means I‚Äôve done my job well. 

Page counts in essays suck..."
10214,But doing it sentence by sentence is just a bit too close to what the original text says. You should try to paraphrase things by gathering big ideas from a text not just individual sentences.
10215,"hol up, it is bigch**ea**se.

Silly me."
10216,Exactly. I had to do a 4000 word essay back in high school. Accidentally went up to 5000 and spent five hours trying to cut out what I didn‚Äôt need.
10217,"Yeah, but I think it's a waste of energy to care about them, if someone managed to get to college using ""alternative"" ways that's not my problem. Every single student is responsible for their actions and it's their duty to do something about it. Moreover, maybe getting to college could be a wake up call for some of them, we don't know for sure, every persons has the chance to improve themselves and start to get serious, we should let them live their life haha."
10218,"I think it is totally fine to use other's words/ideas when explaining an abstract or theoretical concept because, oftentimes, you need an expert to accurately describe the concept and lend credibility to it--that is where citing sources comes in. But, at the same time, sources should be used to support *your* ideas, expound upon concepts you wish to discuss, or provide necessary context. 

The OP in this comment thread is suggesting essentially plagiarizing other people's ideas and paragraph structures which is definitely plagiarism."
10219,"If you want to paraphrase or summarize a source, it's always a good idea to read the source, then set it aside and write it in your own words. What you are suggesting is essentially changing the word choices while keeping the overall structure and ideas from the paragraph which constitutes plagiarism. 

While YES you need to include sources, an essay is supposed to be \~75% of your own material and \~25% cite material (this differs for higher-level research papers where you might have to include significantly more sources). If the majority of your paper is just rewording other people's ideas, the paper is not original work. Remember plagiarism includes copying word choices, sentence structure, *and* ideas!"
10220,"Well, I mean, even to copy-paste things you need to do some research and work, if you don't even do that, then why are you're in school on the first place?"
10221,"No, it's not actually

The basic idea is reach a conclusion or insight about a specific topic. Sources are only for creating the foundation of the composition, which is usually the hardest part"
10222,"I think I‚Äôm mostly annoyed because she took points off my first essay for ‚Äúnot enough details‚Äù and points off the second for having to many.  I definitely know that my essay was longer than expected, but I did not think it was too detailed, nor did my proofreader.  Hopefully third time‚Äôs the charm as I have another essay due for her this week."
10223,"""repeat previous steps until you've copied the whole text""

Bruh"
10224,Omg thank you! Such a great tip
10225,I also only write it single spaced until the end! Single spacing + tiny font = happy me when I finally see how much progress I've really made!
10226,1/1000
10227,"I party Friday and Saturday, rest of the days are reserved for school work and such. The people who party 3-4 days a week don't have their priorities straight and likely suffer from that."
10228,"I‚Äôm 1/1000 then! I go out Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Unless I have a test Friday, or a lot of homework due Friday, I go out on Thursday. Yeah it‚Äôs tiring, but you gotta go out and have fun man üòÇ"
10229,Fun for me is staying in my room with my work finished early and doing whatever the hell I want
10230,"I did this in college. I mainly did it because I was depressed and I needed the alcohol to get me through what I was dealing with. That, and I‚Äôm Scottish."
10231,I feel the same ways. My neighbors are like that and they party super late in the middle of the week. It‚Äôs so annoying because I try to work on homework and they‚Äôre just blasting music. I don‚Äôt understand how people function like that.
10232,Totally unrelated to OP but it‚Äôs so odd to me that more people now see Reddit as just an app rather than a website with an app
10233,"I‚Äôve been doing this. It‚Äôs fucking rough on your body and mind, I‚Äôm not gonna lie."
10234,"Id say it all boils down to that: people doing whatever the hell they want. Some people want to go out and party, and some like to stay in and relax. Thats about the only difference"
10235,"I partied 3-4 nights a week in college and graduated with 2 degrees in 4.5 years with a 3.1 GPA. I certainly prioritized partying in my freshman to junior years and my GPA paid for it.

That all being said, i got a decent job afterwards, got into grad school, have friends that I still keep in touch with a decade after graduation, and currently make well into six figures. Enjoy your time in college, it's the easiest time in your life to make friends, and you won't have that kind of free time later in life."
10236,"Freshmen will have it out of their system once their gpa‚Äôs drop. Also, kids are still rushing, I think, so there‚Äôs that."
10237,"I‚Äôm struggling with kind of the same thing. I usually finish work around 5-6PM, so I just go have dinner and then by default I either go to my kickboxing class or back to my dorm to watch YouTube videos and chill.

Parties *exhaust* me, so I never get how people can go to that many, much less on weekdays. I am doing engineering at a school that‚Äôs not so STEM-focused, so that may explain part of it. But maybe it‚Äôs also because I‚Äôm introverted, and for extroverts, parties are probably their different way of ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù and releasing some tension from classes."
10238,fear of missing out (fomo)
10239,This is the one and only correct answer.
10240,"> Enjoy your time in college, it's the easiest time in your life to make friends, and you won't have that kind of free time later in life.

I feel like free time in college varies depending on major, socioeconomic status, school culture, family situation, and other factors. Even if all of those were kept equal, don't you think it's kind of bleak that so many people just accept that working life takes away your free time and limits opportunities to socialize? You'll spend many more years working than in college. Shouldn't we seek to arrange our working lives so that the expectations are more humane?"
10241,Truth lmao but it‚Äôs fun
10242,"Two days a week means Friday and Saturday nights. 3-4 days means weekday nights. The difference is that the latter means class is the next day. To some, that's a leap."
10243,It seems that most younger people came across the mobile site first or app first. A lot of friends of mine didn‚Äôt know there was even a desktop site.
10244,This.  Give it a year.  The biggest parties may be gone entirely.  Others will have mellowed most likely.
10245,"I do this, I just do all my work on weekdays and haven‚Äôt had an issue. I wouldn‚Äôt be doing homework on a Saturday anyway."
10246,Gonna catch downvotes but you only live once! College is the perfect time to party your heart out before life hits you in the face. I met great people at parties!
10247,I‚Äôve been going since Wednesday night. I can literally feel my brain cells malfunctioning lmao
10248,Please teach me how to be fun and social... I‚Äôve been trapped in my dorm room for 3 days.
10249,"If you are coming to Reddit for politics then you're destined for darkness.

Edit: Your vs. You're."
10250,"I am lucky in that I don't get hangovers really ever, and I love parties bc I go to meet people, not to blackout. Usually I'll wake up the next day, get some shit done, then get ready and do it over again usually 2-3 times from Wednesday-Saturday. I make a lot of breaks for myself during the week for alone time bc I can't focus if I study with others and I spend my free time in my room w my dog

Edit: my mom's motto she gave me for college, (which she found online on Facebook or something lol), was to sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as much as you possibly can ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
10251,"Not everyone has Friday classes, that opens up Thursday nights"
10252,What's fomo?
10253,"Also these comments saying they don't have a heavy workload are fucking infuriating. I have close friends that study all day so they can go out and enjoy the night. I'm a math and physics major taking 19 hours right now and I'm in 3 involved clubs and yes, I still go out. No, I don't get bad grades. Fuck the mentality that you can't be hardworking or smart and enjoy partying at the same time. You're not better than anyone for taking hard classes and staying in on the weekends"
10254,"From my personal experience it's that people don't like not doing anything and going out is seen as a requirement, as someone that doesn't go out is seen as boring.

I may be the 1/100 the previous comments said as I go out quite often but I don't always enjoy it and it does get really tiring. You'll see that this will calm down during the year anyway when exams come closer"
10255,I literally would not be able to function on 4 hours
10256,Wtf are you doing that you spend 16 hours a day doing schoolwork?
10257,I feel like that is not normal in the slightest to have no free time with a normal course load.
10258,"Do you study in the US? This seems so crazy to me, many of my required classes take up that much time on their own."
10259,"I don‚Äôt doubt you‚Äôre busy but I‚Äôm a bit confused and concerned that there might be more to it, because that definitely does not sound normal.

Anecdotally, I was a computer science major, put in a slightly mediocre amount of effort and graduated with a 3.2 GPA, and honestly could not ever relate to being that busy, averaging 15 credit hours per semester. Maybe like once per semester for like 2-3 days if I get unlucky but long term it seemed very manageable.

Could you perhaps ease off on some hard classes? You sound like the high achieving type, I assume you‚Äôre striving for 4.0 Perhaps you could ‚Äúnegotiate a deal‚Äù with yourself: sacrifice .2 off of your GPA for some free time. How much is that really GPA worth if it ruins every waking day of your life for several years?

Or maybe you need to work on studying more effectively? Unless you‚Äôre PHD student, To be studying that long every day for an undergrad degree sounds like lots of ‚Äúdead brain time‚Äù where you take 3 hours to do a realistically 30 minute task. Improving sleep and only studying in the morning when I‚Äôm most alert is huge with this in my experience."
10260,"Been there. Get your priorities straight, kinda dark but imagine everyone else around you, your loved ones banish and you never see them again. Do you want to remember your life with them as this workaholic void? Do it before someone you love is gone. Trust me"
10261,How many classes are you taking that this is necessary?
10262,"It's a normal four course load. This is just always how school has felt for me. Frantically working to cross off all the todos, and then as soon as you cross one off, two more appear."
10263,"Honestly being a history grad student could do it. I didn't work 16 hours a day but worked close to it and often worked 12 hour days between 3 hr classes, teaching, grading, reading several books, and writing it can be a lot."
10264,"Have you considered you may have some sort of attention disorder? You shouldn't have to put aside more than 3 hours per credit hour per week. So for example, 15 credit hours, 45 hours set aside a week for college. If you have attention issues it is possible not all that time is spent productively"
10265,"I'm in Canada, sometimes if I have projects dues it'll be a lot more work in a week but in an average week where I'm just doing assignments and lectures I rarely lack free time."
10266,"No offense but you have to be procrastinating or just plain not working effectively. I'm a double major with a minor all in stem and have no problem getting work done with good grades and a social life.

Detail how you work and study and we can see where we can help you tidy it up."
10267,"I‚Äôm an engineering major going into senior year, and although my free time is limited, I manage to work 20hours/ week at a job outside the university (less around midterms), have a part-time girlfriend (she knows she is number 3 on the priority list behind school and keeping a roof over my head but loves me anyway, and find roughly 5 hours a week to exercise and run/week. That said some nights I only get 5 hours of sleep but I have never gone a week without having a few hours to relax whether it be going for a jog or a few hours of Netflix/ video games. I‚Äôm kinda terrible with time management, but manage to manage my time well enough."
10268,A normal courseload should be 8 hours of work a day with breaks on the weekends. Worked for me atleast. I‚Äôm in IT
10269,"Dawg, I am Chemical engineer and even my hardest working friends are on the 7-8 hours a day MAX and that's like Monday-Thursday. 

There is a huge diminishing return on additional hours. I start working at like 8am and I wouldn't do schoolwork past 3pm or so most days. It isn't that much of a grind even for like 3.9+ 

Especially like Friday-Sunday, maybe dip in an hour or 2 a day. If you are working 10+ hours constantly you're fucking up something major."
10270,"I think this is great advice--surprised nobody else seems to have mentioned the perfectionist angle, that OP may just have insanely high standards for themselves that need to be adjusted. The diminishing returns that kick in at these levels of studying are insane...99% of people can't remain productive at a high-level for those stretches of time."
10271,"Doesn't mean it's normal and it shouldn't be necessary to study and revise that much unless you're either inefficient or simply not smart/good at memorizing and learning.

Personally, I'm slow. I had to spend more time studying that my classmates to learn the same things, and even I didn't study all day every day. Even managed to work in academia for a while. What OP is doing is most likely completely unnecessary."
10272,"I‚Äôm in the US, and I find this to be on par with my engineering experience as well. Especially with being virtual now I can include studying time as watching the recorded lectures. Idk what OP is doing"
10273,"I ate coffee, drank tears, and slept never. Things haven't really changed since I left school, except now someone could die if something gets calculated wrong. Shrugs."
10274,I am jealous to say the least.
10275,"I have the same issue. The causes of it seem to be:

* Not pacing work properly (i.e. a mix between always trying to finish things as soon as they are assigned + procrastination as well)
* Not taking breaks while working or studying
* Poor sleep --> making it take longer to complete tasks and focus
* Putting in more effort than required even if we KNOW the difference in the result will be negligible (e.g. if I already have enough buffer in my grade to take a few hits, don't grind too hard!)
* Not knowing when to give up on an extremely difficult, thought-intensive assignment (either come back to it later after doing other work that's less stressful, or accept the loss)

I also agree that 9-5 jobs allow me to feel like a human for obvious reasons. Even when there is work to do after working hours, it's never even close to the amount and difficulty that comes from college work, and it's probably in your area of expertise.

Want some actionable advice right now? Get an app like Toggl which will help you track how much time you're spending on tasks every day. It's pretty eye-opening.

See if you can correct some of the pitfalls I listed. I'm still far from feeling free, but I'm seeing gradual improvement each semester."
10276,"Nobody has posted this yet, so I'm gonna go ahead and put my two cents.

Have you talked to disability services? You should. I always felt burnt out by school and like assignments that took other kids one hour took me three. Even with good or mediocre grades, if you are struggling with 

* concentrating
* general mood or disliking school
* spending a lot of time on school/taking a long time to finish or learn things

you might have undiagnosed ADHD or a learning disability. Sometimes, these are also symptoms of an underlying mental health problem (you don't have to feel very sad or anxious for there to be something chemically different about your brain!). 

At the very least, I would recommend talking to your advisor and asking for study tips, then contacting whatever mental health and disability services there are. Most schools will have a psychologist on hand who can talk to you more about what you're experiencing and see if it's a symptom of something, or at least recommend you to someone who can help if they feel like it isn't."
10277,"I usually take six classes a semester on top of having a son, dogs, a cat, and a husband. I don't know how four classes would keep you busy for literally 16 hours a day, every day. You really need to schedule in a good break every day to do something you like, go on a walk, or just to lay around and do nothing. It sounds like you're burning yourself out"
10278,Not even normal among the medical students I‚Äôve known.
10279,"That was me throughout high school and college, my friends spent countless hours studying and so on so they could get a 4.2, 4.5, 4.7, our valedictorian had a 4.97... 

The lazy side of me realized that the amount of work to get a B compared to an A was just not worth the effort, I only did the work that I had to do, rarely studied unless I felt like I needed to, graduated with a 3.7 and got into the college I was planning on attending.

Now that I'm in college I'm definitely struggling with the studying part though, I've never sat down and read a textbook or worked on practice problems by myself and trying to pick up the motivation / skills to do these things is still a difficult task."
10280,"You might want to talk to a doctor or therapist about this because that isn't really a normal experience. It's possible that you have a learning disability, and if that's the case, there would be additional resources available to you (accomodations from the school, medication, strategies to make things work better for you)."
10281,"I try to keep people around all the time help prevent stuff like this. 

I don't mind grinding cause I find it really fun and rewarding, but I understand that it isn't for everyone. 

But like if I am working on a class assignment I keep 2-3 people on the line who are working on stuff, same project or different and just shoot the breeze. 

I also find a strict cutoff, like everybody puts down the work at like 6-7pm and just kick it from then on out is pretty solid. If there is something lingering that needs to be done, just wrap it up quickly as a group."
10282,"I‚Äôm not sure which of the OPs you‚Äôre talking about, but they do seem to be pretty far on either extreme. I guess to a large part course load does end up depending on what you actually decide to take, at my school especially there‚Äôs a massive variability in how much time even people from the same major spend."
10283,probably a STEM major
10284,"Interesting, at my school my professor just said ""I expect you guys to do 20 hours of work outside of class every week"" it's a computer science class so I understand it, and my last computer science class was definitely 16-25 hours a week on the assignments. Top that off with 5 classes of varying difficulty, my social life seems to be put on pause during the semester"
10285,STEM majors have a good bit of free time too as much as some of us would like to say otherwise.
10286,"I hate writing papers and doing projects (mostly cause of ADHD and they can't be busted out in a hour) but I like them more than exams and tests. Papers and projects are the best way to review and retain info and I feel way more confident in my knowledge turning in a project than any multiple choice exam. 

I also appreciate professors who don't use textbooks. Providing articles and videos can help leads students to relevant info if they choose to dive more into a topic outside if class."
10287,THIS! I‚Äôm in a class right now where my prof. has just an outline of what she talking all on one slide. Sitting there staring at one slide for 1.3 hours is so boring and I tend to just drift away
10288,I feel like after an exam I forget everything
10289,"Unpopular opinion but this really depends on the class. If you teach English or another (idk how to describe this but) ""not really learning facts but how to do something"" like a hotel management or public relations class then yes that is great. But if any of my STEM teachers (bio major) did this it would be annoying bc I wouldn't learn anything esp if it is a foundation for another class. The majority of students hate tests but they do help you learn stuff bc you actually have to study ALL of the material not just one part you chose for a project."
10290,love profs like this!! exams are so stressful and I honestly feel that papers/projects are better indicators of a student's learnings
10291,Yea stfu
10292,it's like you get so stressed your brain deletes everything relating to an exam
10293,"You would be my favorite teacher I imagine. I think it‚Äôs good to not focus on heavy weighted exams and have the time to build on projects. Maybe quizzes are a good small assessment but I absolute hate 100 question exams. Textbooks are nice to add and build to concepts especially if people miss class and feel shaky on some of the material. In general, I like having a textbook for reference and in the event someone wants to get ahead."
10294,I would hate this class method
10295,"It is scientific proven. I read a book where one Person noticed that a waitess was able to remeber so many Tables and numbers, but after the customer paid she was unable to recall must stuff. I you think you wont need the knowledge anymore, you will forget most of it"
10296,Then don't give orders
10297,"How do you assess learning? 

Like do you give worksheets? 

I mean I took a intro to sociology course and the guy didn‚Äôt do exams (but did do that ‚Äúpopcorn reading‚Äù(probably so we are actually reading it) with the textbook. 

We watched videos and in class movies, wrote responses and turned them in. 

He graded based on the basic ideas in our responses."

10299,Go away. We aren't in class
10300,"If you wonder why you don't have friends, this is the reason"
10301,"**THIS IS AN EXTREMELY GOOD THING**

It's scientifically backed that when subjects are not tested, students do significantly better. This is because they are learning the material to *understand* it, not to memorize it for a test just to make the passing grade. That leads to cramming, which affects longterm memory in a negative way. Students will not retain the information as much as they would without testing.

Now, I understand the need for exams in rigorous STEM fields like engineering or medical (i.e. Surgery classes) because you have to know your shit or you could seriously fuck something up with extreme consequences, but as for general courses like business and psych and etc. this is an extremely good method of teaching because students will probably be more willing to engage with the course material.

EDIT: https://www.edutopia.org/article/what-does-research-say-about-testing

SOURCE! Looks like I actually misspoke a bit. It's not that *all* testing is bad, it's the way most testing is done currently that has a negative effect on understanding and long term memory retention."
10302,"Yeah, I feel the same for physics and maths.

The few projects and papers we did (outside of labs) were okay, but they were *so incredibly niche*. You'd be lucky to cover even 1% of the course in a project or paper, so if we didn't do exams then we wouldn't really be assessed on the other 99% so we wouldn't have learnt it. And then of course you'd struggle or fail in the next course because they all built from one another. 

The only time projects could really work was in upper level electives where there wasn't any other class that came after it. Then you could go all out on your binary star observations or galactic core radio observations and not worry about the rest of the course."
10303,"""Those who want respect, give respect."""
10304,[deleted]
10305,"I love this - my consistent psychological struggle with school is that I feel too much is based on just learning material to spit it back out and forget about it the next semester.

I like practical work, or things that seem to have some application instead, which it sounds like you give.

Thank you for your way of teaching"
10306,"It really does depend on the class imo. Psychology I thought the textbook was crucial. Idk if the exams were crucial, but psychology is mostly memorization and exams are very good at testing just that.

Sociology had a textbook that was semi-used/useful and helped fill in the gaps from lecture. Projects facilitated learning better than the open-note exams.

Intro to software engineering and PLC. No exams, just projects and that makes complete sense to me. *Maybe* an exam in software engineering is okay, but its much more useful to apply what we've learned."
10307,"This is not true. You may be graded for spelling errors, but someone can be perfectly communicative without having amazing grammar.  Frederick Douglass was never taught how to read in his early years, but that didn't keep him from becoming a leader.
 By ""proper"" grammar you mean prescriptive grammar. Which is bullshit. The grammar of a language is how people speak and write it. You could understand what the original commenter meant."
10308,Idk I still think tests aren't that necessary as a stem major. Without them I would still learn all the material. There are other ways to test knowledge than just handing students a test that they will inevitably brain dump on and possibly not retain a single thing from the class.
10309,"I agree. I think the mostly major focused class definitely effects it. I‚Äôd rather have tests and exams for something that‚Äôs required that I don‚Äôt really care about, but would rather have projects for something in my major."
10310,"Depending on the class, this is totally fine to me.

Like I needed 1 poli sci credit. I found the material interesting enough, but not so interesting as to want to have a super involved class. 3 exams and done works for me.

Not every class needs to be Socrates and his pupils. Let‚Äôs turn and burn this shit and keep it moving."
10311,And sometimes I don't remember things until after.
10312,Okay good thing this reddit forum isnt college :)
10313,"this is actually a great way of teaching. nowadays, school is the same material but re-worded. I appreciate that you're trying something new!"
10314,I feel like that makes class a lot more enjoyable and you still get the same amount out of it as long as the writing prompts are decent
10315,"But most people will forget the stuff they do for a test afterwards. I learn better through doing projects. Projects are a huge part of STEM, almost every STEM major has projects."
10316,I feel the same. It‚Äôs so hard to be motivated
10317,"If you hate studying, why on earth are you in a master's program? My masters was challenging and stressful but I enjoyed the material and derived satisfaction from learning it. 

Honestly, if you don't care about your studies, are ""just pushing through,"" and are exhausted, you should quit your program. It obviously isn't a good fit for you. 

The reason why most of your peers are able to be ""try-hard"" is because they, at some level, enjoy what they are doing. It isn't a grind for them because it provides fulfillment. If you aren't being fulfilled, look for different opportunities."
10318,[deleted]
10319,"I have the opposite problem. College and grad school were relatively easy and wasn't pressured to do anything I didn't want to do. But trying to find a job 5 1/2 years after graduating college in corporate finance and then data analytics after grad school, even temp jobs for crying out loud, has been the most stressful thing I've had to experience. It gotten worse when the job I thought would bring some stability, was been nothing more than rage inducing because of the lack of work I've been able to pick up."
10320,"i‚Äôm not op and not in the same situation but i would like to offer: i had untreated ADHD for most of my high school career and i absolutely love learning but the mental toll of the constant studying was too much. i want to learn things and i will push myself to learn things and study but i agree with them that it becomes so, so exhausting. but i‚Äôm not gonna give up on college or a masters program or higher ed because it‚Äôs hard. i still want to learn and i will. 

now that i‚Äôm medicated, studying has become much easier and much more fulfilling to me. but i completely understand and empathize with anyone who hates studying but isn‚Äôt willing to give up learning. america has made learning far too competitive, it‚Äôs sad

edit: also wanted to say, they never said they didn‚Äôt care about their studies, they said they didn‚Äôt care about their studies to the point where they‚Äôd sacrifice their mental health for it. which sounds to me like OP could use a therapist instead of dropping out."
10321,I had this conversation today with my family. I told them how miserable I am in college and how there‚Äôs really not any fun parts of it left because of COVID. All they said was life gets worse after graduation. Genuinely not sure what the point is anymore.
10322,"This is terrible advice. OP, you should not quit your program just because you dislike studying. Disliking studying does not automatically mean that you dislike the content of your program, and just because your peers appear to enjoy ""grinding"" more than you do doesn't mean that they are more fulfilled. In my experience, yes, many graduate students *do* grind just to grind. Picking up extra research opportunities, taking on huge course loads, and agonizing over grades are all common issues in grad school that often lead to burnout.

As others have suggested, OP should most likely work on improving their mental health rather than making the rash, impulsive decision to quit."
10323,"So needed to read this right now. At the height of placement season in college - we're expected to prep for interviews, apply constantly, deal with rejections from your target companies AND attend classes and do assignments all at the same time. I understand life is hard, but really? This hard? Is it honestly so necessary to struggle THIS MUCH to succeed? I don't understand why we are constantly fed this narrative that if you're not struggling under capitalism, you're 'lazy', 'unsuccessful' or a 'loser'. I spend over 15 hours every day in front of my damn laptop and let me tell you, I've had enough."
10324,[deleted]
10325,"That‚Äôs one thing that really grinds my gears; some professors that patronize and condescend to us students about the workload when we all know damn well that they didn‚Äôt have to deal with a full-on global pandemic, political instability that almost ended democracy, and wild weather events that are due to unaddressed climate change. People who expect me to not be emotionally exhausted while earning high grades in an engineering program can shove it for all I care."
10326,"Well, I‚Äôm not doing a masters but I‚Äôm finishing my bachelors and I‚Äôm a bit miserable at times because of it. I‚Äôm tired of studying, of school, and everything in between. This is my last semester before I graduate though so I‚Äôll be giving it a hard push to hopefully perform at the level that is expected of me during my field experiences. Thank fuck for that. I intend to relax when Summer comes around and by that, I mean that I‚Äôll be taking care of other important issues but at least they won‚Äôt stress me out every waking moment of my existence."

10329,"Gosh, this brings back memories. Unpleasant ones, mind you. When I was in grad school I was putting in easily 50-60 hours a week on my school work ALONE, never mind actual work and other life responsibilities that still had to get done. I‚Äôm also disabled, and sitting at a table for 8-10 hours straight hunched over a book would get extremely physically painful for me. My dissertation was graded as one of the top in my cohort. And all that work kind of led to bum fuck all, since the eventual job I landed was, at best, very tangentially related to my degree.

It sucks. My advisor, who was infamous for being a huge hardass, would have be the one to tell me to slow down. I‚Äôll never forget the time I scheduled to meet with her to discuss my progress, and I leapt right into my notes and began rattling off my thoughts and she just stared at me and asked me when I‚Äôd last slept.

Although I feel guilty for it most of the time, I think I need to cut myself some slack as I was in dire need of a break. I wish my school was understanding and supportive of our needs and considerate of our mental health. I'm not even in the States so I don't know what it's like over there, but here at my previous uni, our counselors didn't give a damn about our mental health even though we complained about the amount of work and the deadlines. I dropped out and am thinking about getting a job and then going back to school later on!"
10337,"biomedical science major here: last semester, i'd wake up, immediately start chemistry/physics/lab work/genetics/psychology, and did not stop until at least 11:30pm on a good night. the students that have plans for after college, like grad school, tend to try harder because their performance and grades matter more in the scheme of things. what do you teach??"
10338,"So much more goes into this than just the number of credit hours someone's taking. Specific majors/tracks/courses, how ""naturally good"" someone is at learning, extracurricular activities, financial obligations, etc. Taking 21 credit hours in some majors requires less work than taking 16 credit hours in others. Just bc OP is struggling, even if they're only taking 14 credit hours, doesn't mean that they're not working smart. We have literally 0 context."

10351,"Same with people who can just crap out math problems with no issues, i cant do that.  Honestly after that assignment I re-evaluated how to write papers. It was not to brag, because bragging about procrastination is kinda silly."
10352,I‚Äôm best at writing in as few sittings as possible. Idk what it is but if I can sort of ‚Äòget in the zone‚Äô I‚Äôm able to spit out much of an essay at one time. Most often right before it‚Äôs due and I have no other options
10353,"As an FYI, writers and writing professors consider all of that part of writing. Even thinking hard in the shower. Anything that contributes to the final product is writing. You‚Äôve got a really good system going for you here!"

10357,"I typically write a paper and revise it at the same time all in one go.

10359,"Writing major here (graduated): ditto. Maybe for stuff like weekly ‚Äúreflections,‚Äù or journals, but for any assignment that you‚Äôre given a week or more to work on, it can feel like this, but it‚Äôs not true. It feels better because you start and complete a task in the same day or within one big time frame, not actually because the quality of your writing is higher. 


You said you just started college, so that makes sense to me. But please please do not try to write big, important assignments in that frame of mind. If you would write two entirely different papers because of your mood or the ‚Äúgroove,‚Äù you get into, then neither of those papers are your best work or an accurate reflection of the learning and research you have completed. 


Also, if you‚Äôre struggling with a project, or it‚Äôs just a  really big one: Write down your ideas. Check in with professor or TA if you‚Äôre on the right track (this can be brief, in class if it‚Äôs a small class or via email). Write an outline. Go to office hours. Write a draft. Go to office hours, and for the love of God don‚Äôt just do this ONE day before it‚Äôs due. Then write your paper with the feedback you‚Äôve been receiving."
10360,*yes*
10361,"Back in community college, I had a class at 2 pm. Every single paper I'd camp up in the cafe around 8 am (drove friends to their morning classes) and finish before 2.

10362,"I'm in my graduate program now and still write most of my papers in one day. It's definitely possible to continue doing it in the long run, though it can be very stressful. Just do what feels right to yourself."
10363,"Personally it depends how long the paper is and if its easy or hard. If its a short, easy 2 page paper then yeah I can probably do it in a day. If its a long, hard 6 page paper that requires a lot of research then I certainly can‚Äôt do it in a day."
10364,depends on how your brain works because some people work really well under immense pressure while others simply ‚ú® die ‚ú®
10365,"I usually have some sort of plan or brief outline in mind a few days prior to writing it, then I write it in one day, and then review / proofread the next day (the day it's due)."
10366,This is me too. I want to add that it also helps if I'm alone as I've learned that trying to write a paper when I'm with other people doesn't work out as well.
10367,I wrote a 10 page ethics paper in about ~18 hours and it was the worst decision of my life.
10368,"For me, I have found that I write papers a whole lot better under a time constraint. I know it may seem stupid, but for that reason, if a paper is due on the 10th at 11:30pm, I normally don't start until the morning of the 10th. I do a ton of reading and gathering sources (most of the time) the week before, and then don't actually start trying to write until the day before at the earliest. It may sound odd, but I just write papers better, closer to a deadline. Its not like that with everything though. For example, math and physics, taking timed tests, stressed me the crap out. I ""can't"" do it (air quotes bc I can, it just stresses me), but with papers, I work way better closer to the deadline. It may be in part because I like to procrastinate, and it may just be in part that I actually do write more information dense and better papers when I have a deadline to beat. Not sure if I subconsciously take it as a change or what, but thats just how I write. Sometimes I would have a major paper due on the 13th at 8:00am, and I would start writing it 9:pm on the 12th. Most of my good papers are written in the span of a few hours. I feel like if I start a paper in the beginning of the week it just isn't formed right and it doesn't flow good. I can't keep my mind on it, and just drift to other subjects that I have. So I am 100% with you on that!!!!"
10369,Writing papers or crapping out math problems?
10370,"Prep work for the paper is where I‚Äôll take my time and figure out what I‚Äôm writing about. I‚Äôll do the research and gather quotes and for each quote I‚Äôll get the reference for that source. All on one document. Then I‚Äôll sit down and write my paper and if I use a quote I found, I‚Äôll put it in the references section properly (alphabetically). But yeah, I write my papers in about half a day, generally a day before it‚Äôs due. Or the day it‚Äôs due, I write better under that stress. 

Literally, I get solid As on those papers vs ones I do over time, I generally get Bs or sometimes even high Cs on."
10371,Yep I almost always write whole papers in an evening. They turn out better that way.

10373,"I do the same thing! I have a 20+ page paper due in a week, and I fully intend on writing the entire thing tomorrow. Gonna down a few shots of espresso and bang it out."
10374,"Yeah I need total silence when writing papers and write all my papers in one sitting.  When I get locked in, I get locked in. Always get a good grade.  I never need to revise my papers because I revise them while writing them because I‚Äôm picky about how I present it. It can take me an hour on a paragraph or so because it doesn‚Äôt sound right to me."
10375,My composition teacher hates you. I'm still on the fence.
10376,"i know i know, just waiting for that time to come. thank you! :)"
10377,You are not alone my dude. I failed one of the midterms for the most important subject this year. I know how you feel. 
10378,"At least you're getting all the shit done early in your college career. its a big adjustment, but the important part is that YOU ARE DOING IT

You didn't fail

You didn't give up

You didn't quit

You put on foot in front of the other, showed up, cried it out in the shower, and kept going. 

That's how you succeed. Good job. "

10380,i had no credit for one of my major classes until after the final and miraculously came out with a C. i really shouldn‚Äôt have passed. 
10381,"No holiday feels like a holiday.

It's just like any other normal day."
10382,"i really feel you on that last part. i plan on moving across the country for work when i graduate, and even though i know those plans might change in the next few years, i‚Äôve always seen myself being alone wherever i go. i was in a relationship at the beginning of the semester but now that we‚Äôre broken up i have no interest in finding a partner. he was the only person i really saw myself having a future with, but since we aren‚Äôt together now i kind of want to be alone. i‚Äôve never really had a lasting friendship, but maybe it‚Äôs just because i‚Äôm an only child and i‚Äôve been kind of conditioned to do things on my own. my younger stepsister and her boyfriend are likely to get hitched when she graduates and i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll start popping out kids of their own soon after. it‚Äôs probably just a part of growing up. Christmas isn‚Äôt running down the stairs to open presents anymore, it‚Äôs just trying to get everyone together for few hours to eat and catch up. "
10383,"You are not alone.. this is my first Christmas alone. All of my family is over seas and my SO is out of the country visiting his family. I booked a snowboarding trip but I am afraid to go and spend more money as I am a government employee and do not know when my next paycheck is coming in. At least I have my dog. Some friends were kind enough to have me at their family‚Äôs Christmas dinner last night. However, nothing beats being home for the holidays. Today I am spending the day with my dog, making us a special meal, taking a long walk by the lake, dancing around the house, etc. The best thing you can do is enjoy what you have and hope for a better holiday next year. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year !"
10384,"Welcome to college, bro. It doesn't change, you just get better at handling it. Stay strong"
10385,"Well, I'd suck my professors dick for a C, but he's a physicist and he has none.

10387,"Well, kiddo... the older you get, the less and less like Christmas the season is going to feel.  That's a part of growing up. "
10388,"i appreciate this so much! i was diagnosed with GAD and PTSD (car accident) at the beginning of the semester, and among other things to happen i‚Äôve just been really discouraged. 

i‚Äôve started counseling and while that‚Äôs seemed to help some, i‚Äôve always known that it starts with helping myself. i know that i can‚Äôt just sit in bed all day and never go to class, even though going to class makes me anxious. 

im sure once i get through my 101‚Äôs and start taking more major classes i won‚Äôt feel that way about class anymore. 

i know brighter days are ahead, and i‚Äôve just got to roll with the punches right now. 

thank you so much and i hope you have a great day! :)"
10389,"that sucks. hey, barely meeting is meeting though

have a drink. it's the holidays. you're old enough even if ronald reagan doesn't think so"
10390,"It's been too over maketed, right next to two other over marketed holidays. I petitioned to alternate years between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
10391,yeah Christmas has always kind of been just a ‚Äúget together‚Äù day for us.  just feels different this time. 
10392,"Good for you, but basic human psychology says you are wrong "
10393,"Nice post history. Judging by the downvotes, literally no one cares for what you have to say. "
10394,"I‚Äôm a senior who felt the exact same way freshman year. It‚Äôs definitely tough being back home but try to make the holidays nice for your family. They haven‚Äôt seen you in so long and are probably so happy that you‚Äôre home. Try to relax and remember you don‚Äôt have any homework left to do, honestly I don‚Äôt even remember what grades I had freshman year that made me so upset. 
"
10395,thank you! and yeah i‚Äôve kind of had that feeling about it. college has never really felt like my thing but i know i need it to get the job i want. 
10396,"As cliche as this sounds, this hurt you are experiencing right now is all a part of growing up. Yeah growing up sucks! First semester of freshman year I failed three classes, I fell severely ill right before the finals, and I hated every minute of class because I was expected to do something I didn't love nor want to do. But things change, people grow, life moves, and oddly sometimes the very things you want you end up finding miles and years away from where you were looking. 

I have since moved miles from home on multiple occasions. I have met new people, made new friends, and forgotten more friends than I care to remember. There is nothing constant in life but what you make of it. So this holiday cry; shed every tear, till you have none to shed anymore. And then spend time with your family, enjoy lunch, dinner, a walk in the park. Start a new tradition, or redesign an old one. Festive seasons are not festive because of the presents you find under the tree, even though they surely feel that way as a child. They are festive because of the people you have around you and the memories you make. 

Yes things will change, and it wont always be wonderful and fun. But never give up that child like curiosity you had each time you saw those presents under the tree and the wonder when you opened the wrapping to discover what was inside. Direct those towards finding your passion, your hobbies, and your love. Spend this Christmas expanding your horizons even if you know it will be painful."
10397,"Yeah same. My mom had me at 16 so I lived with my grandparents, so I‚Äôm pretty close to them. My grandpa died a few weeks ago. It ruined Christmas for my whole family. 

And of course, the stress from his illness plus my own laziness means I failed out from college this semester. So I‚Äôve lost my financial aid which paid for my apartment down there. It‚Äôs all a mess."
10398,"Old enough to serve but not old enough to be served.

Americas laws never fail to amaze "
10399,"You're not alone either! Hell we are here. 

My wife is a government employee too and we been through the last shut down. Things will be fine. "
10400,"It's like that for all of us bud. If you play Dark Souls, college is just like that. Trial and error. Just stick with it and you'll be golden. Keep your head up are recognize when you can just forget about your responsibilities. This is one of those days. Relax and smell the roses while you can. It is hell while you're still in it, but you'll always look back at it as the best time of your life. Really think about finding the balance between fun and school. There is a way to do great in school and still have all the college fun. Just maybe not on Tuesdays haha. Good luck mate, you'll be fine. Merry Christmas


Edit: and my friends and I all felt the same about the holidays. This is a huge transition period in your life. There will be many more down the road. Just embrace it. This is a big ""growing up"" period"
10401,"It's just another way of saying something like ""water tastes better when you're thirsty"" "

10403,[deleted]
10404,"I just graduated and can‚Äôt find a job. I‚Äôve never really been a fan of holidays, but this year is a bit of a downer. "
10405,"The Christmas you feel in college and even after college will never feel the same. Sounds fucked up probably, but that doesn't mean that it's not a great time of year or that Christmas will forever suck, but I guess it's all part of growing up I suppose. The ""spirit"" gets a bit lost, but the time with family will never get old, so you still cherish it in a different way"
10406,it‚Äôs crazy how people think stating the reality of making friends is considered being bitter üò≠ like this shit is difficult if you are constantly trying and nothing is working and people act like they want to be friends with you but only hang out in their regular group from freshman year or high school!  all that fake positivity that people give out as advice is so empty
10407,"You‚Äôre right. I visit clubs all the time but there‚Äôs never anything personal from it. Making close, personal friendships takes‚Ä¶ luck almost"
10408,yeah its crappy blanket statement upvote advice. clubs are shit
10409,"I just made a post about feeling lonely today and a ton of the replies were like that. Im in 3 clubs and it‚Äôs exactly what you said. It doesn‚Äôt feel like anyone‚Äôs making friends, we just do what we do in the club and then leave. It‚Äôs all small talk or short conversations that don‚Äôt go anywhere. Initiating and initiating conversations doesn‚Äôt do anything because it seems like no one‚Äôs interested. It‚Äôs not just you."
10410,"That's why you arrange club events. Or enjoy the club meetings as social interaction in itself.

Instead of thinking of using the club to collect phone numbers and springboarding to other hangouts with just the ""cool kids"" from the club, just be president and announce, ""Ok, the club is getting together for bowling on the 7th, at Deer Creek Lanes at 5. Be there!"""
10411,"I was about to scream reading comment after comment telling another lonely college student to join clubs in another thread today.

I tried clubs.  Nothing came of them.  Clubs simply bring a group of people together, but so do classes, dining halls, dorms, etc.  It creates the potential, if the stars align, but they don‚Äôt most of the time.

I am in the same boat as a junior.  At this point, I‚Äôm just working on becoming content with the fact that I did in fact make zero friends in college.  It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but I can‚Äôt seem to change it."
10412,"First of all - the title cracked me up. Second, I feel ya OP. Relationships shouldnt be forced - like being dumped in a pot of people: club meetings where students who do ice breakers and exchange socials - just to never see each other again. 

Relationships take time. Believe it or not, friends are better found in lecture and discussion. Just spark a conversation with your seatmate. Join a group project, reciprocate when they reciprocate, and of course. Learn to be patient and handle rejection. Don't overthink it. Don't blame other people for making excuses. Just always say yes whenever you get the opportunity, and always shoot your shot whenever there's a chance to ask people if they wanna hangout."
10413,"And I just wanted to make sure everyone understood that I don't take this frustration with me while I'm in the moment trying to engage with people. I'm positive in the  moment, and I don't act desperate, because I know that people are turned off if they feel like you're desperate. 

I'm not asking for a big group, either. I just want a couple good friends."
10414,Try joining a club that does something competitive. Having to work together on something gets the convo started & usually helps people to bond easier.
10415,Unfortunately friendships are indeed completely based on luck. I haven't made any friends outside of a friend group formed during the first week of orientation at the beginning of last semester.
10416,"I'm usually the one initiating everything in a friendship, so I'm not going to do even more work for what could be nothing. Also, like others have mentioned, clubs don't always work. Some people in them only want to hang out in a club setting. That's not all I want. I'm not looking for an answer on Reddit. I know how I can try. It just doesn't work most of the time. I'm not gonna give up, though. I'm just venting."
10417,"I managed to slip into the friends' group of the seniors as a junior. Half of them will graduate in July, sadly. I'll just have to look for another friend group then... but then I'll practically be THE Boss in my club by then."
10418,Yup. The few close friendships I do have are pure luck
10419,"It‚Äôs not the same for everyone, that‚Äôs why it really hurts to deal with. I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with it this way. It‚Äôs fucked up. I share your sentiment ‚Äújoin a club‚Äù but I haven‚Äôt even had a chance to have an in person meeting since starting college. It‚Äôs some bullshit to just say that as the response to pleas of loneliness on here. But the people saying it don‚Äôt have bad intentions, they‚Äôre doing the best they can to do what they feel may help the situation. It‚Äôs preposterous that the US college system has failed so many students, it‚Äôs not just you, and that‚Äôs what this subreddit tells us. But there is really not much else that can be done from Reddit, the pleas for help go unanswered and met with ‚Äújoin a club‚Äù because there just isn‚Äôt that much else that can be done from Reddit. There really needs to be more and better resources for the lonely college kids across the US, especially with covid, but there just isn‚Äôt a lot Reddit can do to help. I‚Äôm right here with you feeling abandon and alone in this stage of my life, try therapy? I wish I could tell you other ways to meet your peers or make friends but if I knew any I would be on them right now. Good luck friend, we can only hope it gets better."
10420,"In my college, clubs don't work like that. The leadership of the clubs initiate events, club members just go to them"
10421,"I joined my debate team and made some lifelong friends that I wouldn‚Äôt have in any other space. I also got heavily involved in a research center on my campus through my minor and have also made numerous great friends. I joined a club associated with my major and I can see what OP is talking about but I think that you‚Äôre pretty close to the mark. Something with cooperation and camaraderie may be a good option!! 

I will say when I did an internship in the summer of 2020, people were still adjusting to remote life, and it was kind of awkward. It was difficult to make friends or relate to other interns, especially because they were primarily located on the other side of the country. But I went out of my way to invite them to video calls and chats and stay in touch. I also was the one person that was consistently contributing in our internship meetings to basically make a name for myself. Two years later I still talk to several people from my internship cohort. Not super close friends but definitely people that would make time to hang out if I were in their city. Just saying there is hope out there!"
10422,">That's why you arrange club events.

That isn't ""join a club"" though, that's ""make a club"". I don't think you should have to make a club or society just to casually meet people."
10423,"I found this at uni. I got around it psychologically by making LOADS of surface level friends and packing my schedule full of activities. Eventually, 2, maybe 3 people would become a close friend of mine but I had stretches where they grew distant and I was on my own. I still had fun by knowing I'd be seeing someone at the events. I also made sure to join clubs that involved ""doing things"", rather than talks so as to always have the base fall back of an activity to consume myself in. Eventually you might see the same face across multiple clubs - they are your best bet for making a deeper friendship with as you see them more and have more in common"
10424,"The social world is brutal. I did two years in community college before I went to a four year and lived in an abusive home while doing it. I learned that most of my old friends I would of gave my life for genuinely don‚Äôt care about me. In this world, people are friends with you based on what you have to offer. Do you have a car? Are you an attractive woman? Are you already popular? People are very manipulative and picky with their friendships. I think that‚Äôs just human nature. So I focus on success in my career and make small talk with as many people as possible. I do not chase friends. I do not feel anxious about making friends. If it happens, it‚Äôs natural. If it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôll probably happen later as long as I remain focused and continue to shine in my area."
10425,Yea friendships should be natural and not forced. You should be joining a club because you are interested in the activity tbh. The friendship part should be an afterthought. Chances are the people who make a lot of friends in clubs would have done so without them.
10426,Making small talk with classmates >>> joining a club
10427,"Dorms were the key for me-- and it had to be the right dorm, which involved some luck and, I think, some help from the building itself .

My first year I lived in a dorm without much in the way of common areas. People just slept there, and spent the rest of their time out doing other things.

But later I moved into a dorm that had an actual dining hall and comfortable lounges and a theme that got us together for events regularly,  and then I made friends, a few of whom I'm still in touch with over 20 years later."
10428,"Join a club no longer works. Honestly nothing does, were in an era where everyone is kinda doing their own thing and socializing isnt as big anymore. For me, I'm double majoring in software eng and math, on top of going to the gym, studying to maintain a 4.0, doing coding projects when I can, cooking meals and working on my Evo X. Outside of that, I have time to hang out with one chick I met on campus every week or three. You gotta be content with being alone is my best advice. Focus on becoming the best version of you and maybe you meet some friends down the line. But generally people who are busy and doing well financially dont have friends like that. Theres only so much time in a day to handle shit and the reality is people with friends prioritize that over other things"
10429,There's no right way to form relationships and people shouldn't be forced to take this route? Holy shit what a revelation.
10430,"There‚Äôs always gonna be someone that just clicks with you. Ive gotten so many peoples snapchats over a couple years and conversations never went anywhere and I always had to initiate. Met someone at an event one time and they asked for my snap after and we talk and hangout pretty frequently now, just gotta find that right person that works with you. Making friends still sucks though, I find its easier to make long lasting friendships online than in person surprisingly. I only have one friend I met in person, the other 4-5 I met online and have known for almost 10 years now"
10431,"As I‚Äôve gotten older, I realized that people are more busy than ever. With social media, no one really goes out or socialize as much. Plus we have to take into account the pandemic and the insane price increases. People just don‚Äôt have time to have fun like we used to as a society. We have to change with the times. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs personal honestly. I‚Äôve joined clubs and didn‚Äôt make any friends throughout my entire college career. I‚Äôve made more friends forming study groups. So try taking the initiative to form or join a study group."
10432,"This isn‚Äôt about people‚Äôs beginning perception that clubs are guarantee to make friends. This is countering the common advice on the subreddit that joining clubs will introduce you to lifelong friends. 

Also, study groups are not that effective either? I‚Äôve done a ton of study groups and the people I‚Äôve gotten along with there are only interested in spending time  outside of class with you when it‚Äôs time dedicated to studying. Nothing else."
10433,it‚Äôs crazy how we have to go through mental hurdles to not showcase how lonely we are enough to talk to people/potential friends then people are still uninterested
10434,"Just joining a club definitely won't get you anywhere, but joining *leadership* of clubs actually did help me a lot. Having a group of people that you have to work with to achieve things (so leadership, a competition club, or a performance club) lends itself to forming relationships a lot more than just sitting in a room watching a presentation or whatever else."
10435,We‚Äôre in the age of social media where today‚Äôs kids aren‚Äôt accustom to socializing like back in the days. It is nothing personal.
10436,It‚Äôs called a break because you‚Äôre supposed to get a break from this bullshit.
10437,"No. This is not okay. I would honestly ask this person's department head to step in, because this is totally unreasonable. 

I could see \*one\* chapter over break, but definitely not more than one and certainly not 4 chapters. 

Source: am college professor. 

Even during the worst of COVID when classes were all suddenly cancelled for two weeks, the worst I ever did to get back on track was 2 chapters in 1 week (when I normally would have taken a week for each chapter). 

This is really poor teaching on the part of the instructor."
10438,I‚Äôm a 5th year engineer and not even engineering professors have done this to me. May god have mercy on your soul‚Ä¶
10439,The only break that actually feels like one is Christmas.
10440,"Thats still like entire exam‚Äôs worth of questions, and a 160 question calculus exam doesn‚Äôt even make sense"
10441,They could be like 5 questions.
10442,My experience was the opposite. I would always have some kind assignment over break
10443,That is beyond fucked up. I am so sorry.
10444,"While I wouldn‚Äôt call this ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, it‚Äôs certainly in the realm of possibility. Generally there‚Äôs no rule saying professors can‚Äôt assign work over breaks. 

But I think what you‚Äôre really asking is if there some kind of action you can take to make the professor rethink this assignment. I would, in this order: 

1) Email the professor and explain that you think it‚Äôs too much work to be done in the time frame, especially with students traveling to see family and whatnot. Maybe ask for an extension or for him to cut down the amount of work. 

2) If he flat out denies your request for some flexibility, you can contact the department head and explain that the only reason he is assigning this much work is because he has failed to keep on track during class. The department head will then (ideally) negotiate with the professor on your behalf to determine if the amount of work is too much for break or if some flexibility on due dates needs to be allowed. 

3) This is a final and really extreme measure that I think you should only take if both the professor and department head refuse to work with you at all (unlikely). If that is the case, and you feel like this amount of work over break constitutes an academic grievance, you should contact the dean of your college (not of the whole university, but of the college of business/ science/ liberal arts whatever you‚Äôre in) to file an academic grievance report. At this point the dean steps into the situation and determines whether this assignment has basically affected your grade or ability to perform in the class. Again, this is the LAST thing you should do. College deans take these reports pretty seriously and only consider them valid if you, the student, have done your due diligence in remedying the situation. 


That being said, this isn‚Äôt unheard of. The best route may just to be to complete the work (or as much as you can in good faith) and then when professor  review time comes at the end of the semester, note the professor failed to keep the class on track and that lead to you falling behind. 

Good luck, I promise it gets easier workload wise as you go on."
10445,Email the chair?
10446,Here go the struggle-elitists saying this is normal
10447,"100% get the department chair involved and possibly dean if they don‚Äôt do anything. This is unacceptable. 

Approach it from a business perspective. If prospective students learn this will be their experience‚Ä¶ not good."
10448,"Faculty here.  What you're describing doesn't sound normal to me.  But, on the other hand, it certainly isn't against school policy or anything like that, at least not at any of the universities where I've been employed.  What you have to remember is that Thanksgiving break, or spring break, or any school break that takes place while the semester is underway, is merely a break from the normal formal daily schedule of attending classes.  It's *not* a total cancellation of all academic responsibilities of any kind.

So, while it's not unreasonable for there to be some modest expectations of studying or assignments over the ""break,"" it definitely sounds to me like your professor's expectations are less reasonable that most.  You've gotten unlucky, and the only thing to do is to charge ahead, doing the best you can on the work.

Good luck."
10449,"Ya, assigning 4 chapters in 10 days is insane for one class."
10450,"True, true. My school only gives us like 2 days off for Thanksgiving. But I‚Äôve been blessed enough these past 2 and a half years to have professors who respect breaks."
10451,32 quizzes in that timeframe is not in the realm of possibility cmon
10452,Leave a ratemyprof review while youre at it
10453,Hell I'd report it to the school in everyday possible
10454,I didnt get anything assigned but have time for final projects
10455,"This is weird. Was there not a schedule on the syllabus for chapters/assignments? I can't remember having a college course where the schedule of coursework was ever pushed more than a couple days in either direction.

I guess my only actual advice for you is to shoot for one chapter a day, over the course of four days. That way you at least get a few days off before staring back up. 2 hours of lecture, 4 (I'm guessing short, section quizzes) and whatever homework assignments each day is actually pretty doable when you break it down. Don't get me wrong, it sucks. But sounds like you just have to do it. You might be surprised- maybe you'll get through the material faster than you expect.

Good luck dude."
10456,"This is absolutely not normal though. I've had a few hours of HW assigned during Thanksgiving break, no big deal. This? This is ungodly. This is 10 standard deviations away from normal on how fucked up a professor can be."
10457,That‚Äôs more than 8 hrs of work. The 8 hrs is for the lecture only. OP have to take 32 quizzes on top of that.
10458,"No, that's not normal. Frankly, I would complain to your department about it."
10459,It only gets spicier from here. Good luck to you.
10460,That's the lecture only. He has to take take 32 fucking quizzes. You think that's easy?
10461,"Unless you‚Äôre working full time over Christmas, which means that you don‚Äôt get a break full stop."
10462,Literally no one said it was normal.
10463,I have an exam to do over break lmaoo
10464,"This, email the chair/assistant chair. I'm just gonna add that you should reach out to as many of your classmates as you can to go in on this with you. They're more likely to take a bunch of you seriously (or even notice)"
10465,Either way. To have 32 to do? That‚Äôs unheard of.
10466,"There are spaces on a campus where the idea of institutions of higher ed being a business is appropriate: the dining commons, residence halls, student centers, etc. The classroom should never be one of those spaces."
10467,"Very good correction to make, I appreciate you posting this!!"
10468,"One additional thing to note here is that even when it does belong the university, the university will sometimes sell it or release it for cheap or for free."
10469,"> the dining commons, residence halls

I'd argue these shouldn't been profit driven either, especially residence halls. Those are essentials, and turning them into an engine to price gouge teenagers living on their own for the first time is unacceptable."
10470,"
I live in Norway and I have payed a total of approximately 460USD for my entire bachelors degree. Can't relate"
10471,"Right, because your government actually supports your institutions of higher education. You cannot run a university on $120 per student per year.

In the US, state support for universities has been consistently treding down as legislatures cut subsidies."
10472,"I know you're just giving a surface-level overview here and not getting into all the nuance and details, so don't take this as a stereotypical angry internet ""you're wrong you f-ing dummy!"" rant. Just adding a little more flavor...

>Faculty are your professors and researchers who teach courses, contribute to scientific papers, and experts of a given field.

Up until last year, not a single member of my department had a degree in their field (composition studies). We're not experts. We're mostly creative writing MFAs and literature MAs who just love teaching and writing.

>Thing is, any bit of discovery or research faculty yield, their intellectual property in other words, belongs to the university.

Probably depends a lot on the department and even more on if there's any sort of research grants involved, I'd guess. In the humanities, it seems to be the norm that faculty own all their own research.

>Their job is to keep amenities usable, create safe environments for all on campus, and create learning/social opportunities outside of the lecture hall.

Kinda... but ultimately their job is to make sure seats get filled. Maintaining amenities that get shown off on tours will often take priority over maintaining things students and faculty use every day.

>Let‚Äôs talk about how your money breaks down further: your fees pay for all the above staff and faculty, as well as dining halls, programs on campus, sports and clubs

I want to quibble over the terminology here, because ""fees"" has a specific use in college costs, distinct from tuition, housing, and meal plans.

>think Alabama

Roll Tide

>One last thing I‚Äôll cover here is power.

For students, the most relevant wielder of power is usually going to be the department chair. Even to tenured professors, the department chair still has a lot of weight to throw around, and can usually force the troops to get in line. Their boss is the dean, but a dean is going to be reluctant to get into a fight with a department chair over a dispute between a student and a professor."
10473,That is well above the average adjunct pay per credit. One credit is 1/3 to 1/2 of that nationally.
10474,"Very informative, thanks!"
10475,"If you need some one to weigh in on Technical Colleges, Tech Centers (huge difference) and CC's, let me know! They are great ways to get educated without putting yourself in debt, because they often don't have a lot of the auxiliary services, such as housing or sports teams that cost a lot of money."
10476,"And even in STEM fields / medicine, it totally depends on the contract with the university, which can vary wildly from ""the university owns it all"" to ""the faculty member owns it all"" and everything in between."
10477,"There is some truth to what is said here, but I find myself cringing at some of the finer points. The left/right brain analogy is. . crude. 

To add context, in the past universities mainly consisted of faculty. Faculty taught, mentored, advised, administered. They did it all, except cleaning and preparing meals. Over time there was a need for people to specialize in certain areas and institutions found that parents expected them to take care of their students in many various ways. This is called ‚Äúduty of care.‚Äù Duty of care is the reason services at universities and colleges have expanded so much over the 20th century, and most especially in the last 40 years. Institutions are expected to provide for the mental, physical, and social health of their students in order to provide an environment that is conducive to learning. 

These expectations coupled with dwindling state funding are two major forces in the rise of cost of attendance. In 2011, it cost an institution on average $12,000 per year to educate one student ($14,000 for universities, $9,000 for colleges). That‚Äôs the price to educate them (teaching, student support, and administration). Not the price to provide counseling, health centers, student activities, or sports. 

Institutions must offer these other services. It‚Äôs both expected and can be contributing factors on whether incoming students decide to attend the institution, which yes, does affect the caliber of student and alumni population and the cycle of donations to keep the school operating and growing. This is all not to mention the institution‚Äôs responsibility to their community. 

Yes, institutions must keep business practices in mind for continued operation. But don‚Äôt let that fool you into thinking education is exactly like any other business operation out there. Higher education has many more nuances as well as regulations that make it unique from other fields."
10478,"I‚Äôm really sorry to see you invoking the ‚Äústudent as consumer‚Äù paradigm. The corporate model is not appropriate for higher education (nor for health care). If we must use this model, the students would be the *products* and their future employers or graduate schools would be the consumers. The faculty are quality control."
10479,"Just tuition. Dorms/apartments we have to take care of ourselves, but we get 800USD per month throughout our studies, of which we only have to pay back 40% if we pass our degrees.

Not sure how many attend colleges after HS, but the system is like this, so everyone who has the required grades/classes, can attend. The required grades and classes differ throughout the various degrees/studies."
10480,"Many universities, including the one I work at, require all incoming freshmen to live on campus. So it ends up being an essential service for nearly all students, even if just for a year or so, and only approximately 25% of the university student population at a time. And when they charge exorbitant prices, well above the local market value (plus requiring an additional, equally overpriced, meal plan), I'd definitely say that's an area they should improve."
10481,[deleted]
10482,How about we just cut some of the useless administration positions to make college cheaper?
10483,"To the degree that residence halls and dining commona provide amenities beyond essentials, they are a commodity that students are renting/purchasing. So I agree with you to a degree.

That said, residence halls are essential to only a portion of a given university population. Nontraditional students, online students, and commuter students come to mind as students who do not require residence halls."
10484,"Wow. So I‚Äôm making 30-50k more than my professors and I don‚Äôt even have my degree yet? This really puts things in perspective for me. I always felt my lack of degree was holding me back. 

(Context: I‚Äôm a returning student that already has a 15 year career in marketing but no degree.)"
10485,"Seconded. There a lot more nuance in this field than what is described in the post.

ETA: It‚Äôs why there are even *graduate* degrees to allow people to understand how everything works."
10486,"And legislatures cut spending to increase spending in other areas because federal parent plus loans without any limitations made it possible to shift a thousand or two thousand dollars per student per year away from the university over many years. The students and their parents did not notice it.This is a state problem, not a federal problem, and the worst places age generally blue states. And with the Covid-19 reducing state revenues, it's going to get worse."
10487,"Yup. A number of my students make more than I do a job or two after graduating. 

My salary as a professor is somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of what I would make if I went to work in industry. Most professors don‚Äôt do it for the money- they do it because they like it and think it‚Äôs important work."
10488,"Even a large proportion of non-adjunct faculty get paid significantly less than 6 figures. 

The average for pre-tenure (assistant professors) at doctoral research universities is 90k, going up to right around 100k for tenured associate professors and around 160k for tenured full professors (usually 15-20 years in). Obvious variation applies. But that's not a majority of schools nationwide, and includes both public and private and really high-paying fields like business and medicine. 

If you drop to institutions that have masters programs or are focused on undergraduate teaching, it's closer to 70/80/100k for the same ranks (again, average across all fields). Many faculty are pulling in salaries in the 50-70k range."
10489,now factor in for the fact that we are getting none of these resources with online classes and a much diminished academic experience yet universities still increased tuition for next year
10490,Staff and custodial are the biggest expenses? Try administrators
10491,"I'd quibble with your last point. My department chair has absolutely zero power over me as a faculty member. Dean of the college is the person with power over me. 

That said, I've made (and will continue) to make the point that on aggregate, students have more power to effect change than even tenured faculty. Faculty are employees (and expensive ones), but students are the source of income. Sufficient student and alumni unrest, properly focused, will do more to effect change than anything the faculty can do. 

All you have to do to see that is watch university systems where the faculty vote no confidence in the president (united front) and the board backs the president and nothing changes."
10492,"I Would add that at most state universities, tuition is less than 40% of the cost, with the state and feds picking up the balance ot the tab.

Dorm, meal plan, other living expenses are really not part of the cost of your education. They are your living expenses whether you go to school or not go to school. No such thing as a free lunch.

The trend in student housing is moving away from university provided services to private companies building and operating these nice student apartments with individual bedrooms and bathrooms and dining halls with greater diversity in meals. Those cost more to provide than the old three in a room, common bathroom down the hall, with everybody eating the same meal.  Many of these are built on university ground under a ground lease agreements without government bonds paying for the building. Therefore the price is higher than those old dorms when parents and grandparents attended colleges. Side note, the state legislatures are shifting money away from providing affordable housing to other spending. A state issue, not a federal issue.)"
10493,Do you believe that some people aren‚Äôt met to be professors or teachers? I noticed that some students struggle in course because of the professors structure the course.
10494,"I would love to see something similar in the US, but I have to be realistic that it‚Äôs not likely to happen in my lifetime. 

Seeing your post made me think about my own education expenses. I was extremely fortunate and honestly lucked out in several ways. Through my undergrad and grad due to scholarships, merit grants, and tuition waivers, I was paid $8 to attend school over 5 years of my life. This is tuition and fees, income tax on the waivers, and books fees subtracted. Housing and living expenses were separate. 

I probably sound ancient, but I‚Äôm 28. I graduated with my Master‚Äôs 5 years ago. I‚Äôm the first in my family to attend college, so it even being an option was a miracle. 

I work directly with students and I have seen extreme ends of the spectrum. I wish my experience was the norm. It‚Äôs far from it. Some students have parents that pay for everything. Some get Pell grants (due to being very poor) and have to take out excessive loans to make up the difference. Some have parents that make just enough for them to be ineligible for federal aid but their parents have other financial obligations/refuse to help. The majority of my students face significant debt that will be with them for at least 10 years with how some payment plans work. These loans mean people wait to buy a home (or never do), wait to have children (or never do), or wait to travel (or never do). And if they have loans but did not graduate for some reason, it‚Äôs even worse.  

Don‚Äôt take your experience for granted. And tell anyone willing to listen what the support you received has allowed you to do in life. So many people don‚Äôt have that option here."
10495,"This seems mostly accurate, although I take issue with you saying universities are run like a business. The accounting may look lots like a business, but the element of profit is missing. The university may try to cut costs or to increase income, but this isn't usually at the detriment of its students--usually the goal is to decrease tuition (or increase it more slowly) or to allocate money for other things which will benefit the university. A business on the other hand might cut costs by charging the same price for a lesser service."

10527,"My Calc III professor used to always say, ‚Äúcome on guys it‚Äôs intuitive!!!!‚Äù Which like when you‚Äôre learning multi-dimensional math for the first time it‚Äôs NOT. 
Also fast forward to a few months later, he told me I should drop out of the math program and try philosophy or something because I was having such a hard time grasping it. 


Fast forward again two years later I‚Äôm finishing up my mathematics degree and working as a stats consultant for non-profits. 

Some professors are fucking out of touch idiots."
10528,That‚Äôs my classroom rule too! It‚Äôs worked wonders for everyone‚Äôs confidence.
10529,no shit it‚Äôs easy for you. you‚Äôve got a phd and have been teaching it for years. i‚Äôm only going to be taking this class for 3ish months lmao
10530,"My math professor always says ""see? easy peasy"" after he sprints through an example while the entire class has no idea wtf he just did

people have just started chuckling every time he does it because of how absurd it is"
10531,[deleted]
10532,I had a 6th gr math teacher who banned the word ‚Äúeasy‚Äù because of these same reasons. She didn‚Äôt want our confidence shot just because one kid could do algebra better than the other.
10533,Exactly!
10534,"Wow, shitting on a student *and* belittling his colleagues in another department at the same time. Sounds like a dude who needs a little less time being ""intuitive"" and more time thinking things through slowly."
10535,"I always tell my chem students that if it seems easy for me to do something that does not mean it is easy.  Many of the things I use on a daily basis I have been doing for 19 years.  What we, meaning professors, forget is that easy is a relative term.  For me constructing a complex natural product from commercially available materials is fun but to a student it is impossible or daunting.  Gaining some perspective as a prof is necessary.  However, that same perspective is also gained by students.  When I introduce resonance in organic 1 students think it is the hardest thing ever.  But by the end of the semester most of them think it is easy and by the end of organic 2 they often wonder why they thought it was hard in the first place.  It is all about perspective.  Now some things, like basic algebra, should be easy for most college students.  But having taught dimensional analysis and chemistry for gen Ed students I know that is not always the case."
10536,Oh my god he sounds great. I wish more professors were like that
10537,"My dad was told to not study mechanical engineering. He did.


During his time studying mechanical engineering he was told to drop out, he didn't.


He graduated and has given me and my family a good life working for good companies.


Don't give up, show everyone they're mistaken."
10538,"One of my professors said ""If you don't get this I can't help you"" and I dropped the class as soon as I walked out the door."
10539,"Or for the quarter system, 10 weeks üòî"
10540,Prof here. I budget 3-4x the time it takes me. For a burdensome but straightforward calculation I'm not much faster than the students. For conceptual questions I am probably 10x faster.
10541,"Or when they say it‚Äôs ‚Äúobvious.‚Äù
Ima pop off next time someone says that shit"
10542,"I hope to find more professors like that. My astronomy prof refrained from using the word easy, too. It‚Äôs what really helped me maintain a sense of confidence while I was tackling the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù material."
10543,Math prof here. I do this as well. I also give students extra time if they want to continue taking the class after ‚Äútime is up‚Äù because I don‚Äôt want them to believe that being good at math means you have to be fast at math. I was labeled as the slowest kid in all of my math classes and I am a professor of mathematics now. So math is not about speed (in my opinion).
10544,"I agree with this. I recently had a midterm for one of my classes which included some formulas. I asked my instructor if she would provide a formula sheet. She said no and that I just needed some practice and I would have the formulas memorized. This is my first time taking the class and I always have trouble with formulas. It was easier for her because she's been teaching this class for a while. So, she probably has the formulas memorized while I don't.

I'm honestly thinking of dropping the class and taking it in the future with a different instructor."
10545,"please learn how to read (both the first amendment and reddit posts). 

that is not a first amendment violation. you are still allowed to say the word but someone else gets a point for calling you out. say it all you want and boost other people's grades. he's not taking points away from you, restricting your speech, and you're not getting punished. it's a fine rule"
10546,The fact they can not see what wrong with their assumption says enough. Most of these professors basically can not be fired and do not care what their students say about them.
10547,"She sounds very considerate :) And at 6th grade it's especially important, being at that age where you really start developing your sense of identity"
10548,"What? Ive never heard of this - maybe for a quiz but for an exam, ive always gotten the whole class period which is 55-80 minutes.."
10549,"Yeah it's annoying, one of my prof does that too"
10550,Ugh that sounds so frustrating. What do you guys do to help with learning the content since he's not doing a great job teaching it?
10551,"That guy sounds like a fucking douche, holy shit. Sucks to think about other students he might've discouraged with his comments"
10552,[deleted]
10553,"I would've done the same, wtf"
10554,I wish there were more too. He was one of the first professors I‚Äôve had since that was during my first semester of college. I lucked out then since the department he teaches in is notorious for having not-so-great professors at my uni.
10555,This is correct. A 1hr exam for students should take the professor 10-15 minutes to complete.
10556,"If he asks you directly can say something like, ""I've worked hard throughout my academic journey to find stratigies that allows me to thrive, taking notes is part of what allows me to thrive I would like you to respect the commitment I've made to my education"""
10557,You should tell him then what‚Äôs the point in going to your class?üòÇ
10558,bonus points if you either start talking pictures of the slides or copy it word for word.
10559,Ignore him
10560,"‚ÄúI pay $5000 a semester to be here, I‚Äôll take notes whenever I got-dang please‚Äù"
10561,"Auditory learning I guess, being engaged in learning"
10562,"Better yet, raise your hand and ask him to repeat something because you were writing it down and missed the last part."
10563,"College note-taking culture is directly influenced by education structure. You can‚Äôt blame students for taking notes when they are taught, from the moment they can write, to write down what they are learning.

Also, taking notes as the professor is teaching the material vs taking notes while teaching myself the material is very different. I prefer to learn and take notes the way the professor is teaching it during class, since chances are, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going to look on the test/quizzes/homework/whatever. 

Plus, it never hurts to write stuff down in case you forget it later!"
10564,Take the notes when it's most helpful to you.
10565,Yeah I‚Äôm thinking the Prof intended his class to be a discussion on the chapter
10566,"He can‚Äôt tell you what to do, you‚Äôre paying for his class for him to teach you, and you will continue to take notes during lectures if that‚Äôs what helps you retain information."
10567,If a professor has nothing to add to the notes based on the chapter then he is not really adding any value.
10568,Why not both?
10569,but even then you‚Äôd want to take notes on the discussion right?
10570,"Engaged? Okay. But how are they learning if the textbook can so easily replace him? What's the point of going to class and listening to him repeat the book back to them. If he's not repeating the book back to them, why can't they take notes to remember the additional info? He didn't make any valid points and argued against the value of his class"
10571,"I'm a visual learner, can only focus on auditory input if I try very hard to keep myself from getting distracted by my thoughts. If you're right about the professor's intention, that's pretty specific to one type of learning and frankly ridiculous."
10572,Thats really weird usually professors advocate note taking
10573,"That is very weird and somewhat insulting. All my professors heavily encourage note taking and tell us to learn which note taking strategies work well for us. The only time a professor has ever told us not to take notes is when A) it's really long equations/text on a slide and the professor will just email it to us after the lecture, or B) it's not strictly relevant to that course and is just an interesting thing the professor wanted to share."
10574,"Doubt he would say that haha, but it‚Äôs valid"
10575,[Both. Both is good.](https://youtu.be/DSCGoefBO7Q)
10576,This is the way.
10577,"""what would be the point of coming to class?""

Being engaged and learning? I stopped taking 90% of my notes a few years ago. Test scores have gone up and I remember so much more of the class discussions. This professor shouldn't be judging students for their learning preference but does bring up a valid point about college note taking culture."
10578,Someone's gonna get expelled from the class... Instant reproval I guess
10579,"Yes very, your supposed to take notes in class, to help learn and study. Your professor is to harsh and strict then, he wants you guys to fail."
10580,I can't pay attention in any sort of meeting or lecture without taking notes. This would make me really mad.
10581,I have adhd and taking notes allows me to concentrate because then I'm an active participant.
10582,Not to mention that some exams are based on one specific sentence the professor said during a live lecture
10583,Seems like an odd way of being annoyed at not doing the reading.
10584,Yeah I'm auditory but would never support forcing that on everyone.
10585,if I can just read the textbook then why THE FUCK would I show up to class

10640,So cozy looking.
10641,"First of all, private room, Wth. Secondly, that‚Äôs a lot of stuff to have to move in a few months. Lol"
10642,And mine was a light maple! There must be a company that makes it all for cheap.
10643,Nicer than most NYC apartments!
10644,Why is this so aesthetically pleasing?
10645,"very cute.  Also nice turntable, AT-Lp60?"
10646,"I‚Äôm glad my college doesn‚Äôt have a PE requirement. Why on earth would I pay for this level of bullshit, you must run on Tuesday + Thursday, and once more another weekend but not Wednesday."
10647,"I took Anthropology 101 as an elective one semester and it was the easiest class ever. I finished with a 102 average. Because it was so easy, I signed up for the next anthropology course, ANTH 104, for the final semester before I graduated from undergrad. 

Anthropology 104 required four 10 page essays, single spaced, 11 point font. There was also a midterm and a final exam, plus a weekly discussion, readings, and 3-4 recorded lectures a week. 

I worked harder in that class than I did on my capstone research paper, which ended up being 15 pages, plus a 4 page book review. I wanted an easy final semester, but it ended up being my hardest semester in that major."
10648,I‚Äôve had three credit hour classes that were less work than this jeez
10649,Immediate drop for me
10650,Mine doesn't require it i just needed extra credits
10651,I guarantee you he/she is one of those professors that talks a big game on the syllabus but then the actual class is a breeze. I hope for your sake at least.
10652,"I took an anthropology class that was basically a history class, last summer. Was really easy! Took another anthropology class with the same professor this quarter and fuck-some kind of paper due every single week, watch a movie, discussion posts and an open ended final project."
10653,"No, the weekends are mandatory. ""The third day must be between Friday and Monday""."
10654,Yeah this really seems like a 3 credit course.
10655,"The fact that they say this but that it doesn‚Äôt count implies that weekends not only don‚Äôt count, but are actually prohibited."
10656,"It would be reasonable to spend an hour and a half on the writing assignments each week. And then on top of that you have any class meetings, reading, studying for the exams, discussion boards, and all the running."
10657,Holy shit a fucking 5k
10658,ngl i need that
10659,"Is it just me, or does that have way too much outside of class stuff for a 1 credit class?"
10660,We don't get to decide the runs for the week. I dropped the class and I'm taking some 2 credit music appreciation class now
10661,"I thought the same, but my CC offers a lot of fitness classes. Some of them are just easy As and are actually fun, I decided on golf. Seems great that I can fulfill some of my gen ed by golfing once a week"
10662,All that for 1 credit :/
10663,you got the professor's easy eh whatever class that they don't pay much attention to and then the fucking hardcore fucking destory your fucking balls and clap them with two bricks class
10664,"A 5k is NOT that difficult lol. It‚Äôll suck the first few times you do it (and tbh will probably suck every time if you try hard enough), but anyone (who is able to walk regularly) can do it."
10665,There's no time requirement so you can just walk when you get tired.
10666,when i saw all that in the syllabus i woulda dropped it and taken recreational golf or something lmao
10667,I only took it because I assumed I'd just have to log some run time every week. I work 12 hour shifts and there's no way I can go running after those.
10668,"Wait, they have PE in college? I‚Äôm about to graduate and I‚Äôve never heard of that lol"
10669,I thought my 1 credit PE class was bad by making us write a three page paper. Good luck.
10670,i wouldnt be risking it and straight drop that shit lmao
10671,wow imma run... the other way
10672,"I guess you can say this class is one long running joke. 

Wonder if the prof‚Äôs a stickler for grammar. I tend to have a lot of run-on sentences. 

I‚Äôll see myself out"
10673,i did golf too and im really glad that my prof didnt make us do all that. he didnt even make us come in on days when it had rained or there was a chance of rain lol
10674,"I took one that was an intro to archaeology. 4 days a week was a mixture of lecture and hands-on learning (i.e. examining bones, rocks strata, etc.) and then fridays were essay days. They were only 2 pages each but imagine that for 10 straight weeks, plus a midterm and final essay, plus an essay for every chapter of the textbook, **and** 2 - 3 peer reviews for every single one."
10675,"Dude, you‚Äôre definitely lying because I have also had a PE class like this and this is easily around 3-4 hours of work at minimum"
10676,"We are almost exactly the same person. I was never a great student in high school academic wise. I got C's and D's. The only A's I got were in art, pe, and band. I never took the sat nor the act so community college was my only option. Like you, I graduated high school in 2018 and I heard all my friends who were excited to be moving out, living in dorms, meeting new people, etc... meanwhile I was stuck at home in community college. I used community college as a way to redeem myself and give me a second chance to going to a university. Right now i'm in my last semester of community college transferring for fall 2021.

Community college was great academic wise but it was really lonely. You get mixed in with a bunch of older folk (people who range from their mid 20's to 80's). Yes, I legit had an 80 year old dude in my calc 1 class. Anyways, to this day I felt like I got robbed of my social experience in college. I hope that will change when I transfer."
10677,"This is exactly how I feel. I struggle with this every. Day. We‚Äôre in literally the exact situation. I hate that we feel this way, but knowing that I‚Äôm not alone in this makes me feel better. I have no idea what I‚Äôm even doing in school tbh. I don‚Äôt have a direction and its terrifying. All I want is to be past this part of my life, but i have no idea where to begin, and i dont want to rush it. I want to have the typical college experiences but i don‚Äôt really fit in to the culture here. My school is full of sororities and southern charm and being skinny and pretty and that‚Äôs just not me. I feel so out of place.

I‚Äôm about to turn 21 and I‚Äôm dreading the thought of taking all the pictures because I hate what i look like. but at the same time, i want the pictures to remember this time and i dont want to push it away because i‚Äôm uncomfortable. 

I wish i could say it gets better, but if someone told me that right now, I would want to punch a wall because optimism is annoying. 

My time at cc was not spent wisely. i dropped class after class and didn‚Äôt care about my gpa so i got c‚Äôs and called it a day. Fast forward to today and i am way behind (like 2 whole fricken years) and have terrible academic habits and wasting my money at my university. On top of that, I have no idea how to make friends here and I‚Äôm lonely and anxious and just not sure about anything. I want to get counseling but I have no idea how to start that and I‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll tell me what a mess I am. 

i wish you the best <3"
10678,This isn't the norm but here in Utah the average is 23 iirc. It's not uncommon at *all* to see people even get married the summer after graduating high school. The things people do when they're horny but premarital sex is a no no really is something lmao
10679,That last sentence resonates with me. Social media can make you feel like crap. The majority of what‚Äôs on there is fake
10680,who the heck gets married at aged 23?
10681,"I finally got to go to a 4 year university myself, just to have it taken away by covid. I perpetually feel like my youth is being wasted with no foreseeable way to stop it."
10682,"Yes. 

Was just telling my dad (because he‚Äôs like my only friend these days) that I feel like i‚Äôm stuck in the shell of who i used to be. I was introverted in high school, but I was an athlete so I had my team and friends and events and everything. In college, all that has been taken away so now I have no team, no friends, and I‚Äôm fatter. And because all my friends were forced upon me through proximity and mutual struggle, I don‚Äôt know how to build friendships on my own. 
Snapchat really has been adding to my depression too. I look back at videos of me being silly and having fun and i don‚Äôt even remember ever being that easygoing and happy. Everyone says college is the prime of your life but it‚Äôs halfway over for me and I haven‚Äôt lived."
10683,I currently go to college in Utah and pretty much everyone in my classes is already married but me. it's pretty weird to think about since I'm 20 and have never even thought about marriage once
10684,"I'm 22 and at a CC rn and sometimes I get FOMO but then I realize were in the middle of a pandemic (or close to the ""end"" hopefully idk) but I'm not worried particularly about making ""friends for life"" rn. Adult friendships are often based more on common interests than ""convenience"" friendships like people form in elementary-high school. So when you get the opportunity, join clubs. Start volunteering. Go out to the places where you'll meet people who like the same things you do. Whether that be concerts, festivals, even the Renaissance Faire or something lol. The reason friendships like you described don't really last long is because the only thing y'all might have in common is you both have the same class but beyond that, what else do you guys have in common? Probably no serious shared interests. 

Find the people who are passionate about what you're passionate about."
10685,Just remember that Instagram is a highlight reel. Don't compare your everyday to another person's best day.
10686,Next year will be better. You have an entire decade of your 20s to go through.
10687,"I'm not going to tell you it gets better.

At 21, you have plenty of time to *make* it better, if you so choose.  Make everyday count!  A ""good life"" is not the destination but the stuff that happened along the way.  The past happened like it did and you can't change it now, but you can do differently every breath you're taking.

God speed.  I'll be cheering for you!!"
10688,Yep I‚Äôm in pretty much the same boat as you.  I no longer talk to most of my high school friends and haven‚Äôt made a bunch of new ones in college.  But the way I see it is those ones getting married and having kids are really the ones waisting their youth.  They‚Äôre about to get punched in the face with HUGE responsibilities while I‚Äôm still chillin at home.  I think it‚Äôs okay to take some time to relax plus college is stressful enough on its own.
10689,"People really need to realize this. You got influencers who can pay $50/hr (something like that) for a ‚Äòprivate jet‚Äô photoshoot in an LA studio... it‚Äôs not like it seems AT ALL. And some people would take pics of their friends together all partying, but in reality, they‚Äôre on their phones the whole time..."
10690,"America is crazy buddy, in Ireland someone getting married that young is judged. Oh boy are they judged. 20 is a kid"
10691,"This isn't the norm for all of America. Utah is weird in that regard to those of us in other states. Where I live/go to school, I've known at least one or two people each year who have gotten engaged their senior year, but that is far from the norm. Most people that I know are still single. Despite what some people may say about America, their are massive cultural differences state by state, city by city, rural vs urban, etc."
10692,"I‚Äôm 28 and I joined the USAF and just now got my degree while I‚Äôm the military and I wish I would‚Äôve knocked it out in my early 20s.  My advice to you:
There is no ‚Äú convenient time‚Äù to get your degree so suck it up and do it young while you have the energy and the study habits (at least somewhat).  The stars won‚Äôt magically align one day.  You‚Äôll always have stress, it will always feel like your wasting your time in some regard or there is something more fun you could be doing.

I hope what I said doesn‚Äôt come across cold hearted, I remember being in my ‚Äúyounger 20s‚Äù and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I had a blast, but I still wish I had done college back then.  

By the way, I still have fun and can whoop ass in beer pong (I also don‚Äôt have kids).  The point is, it‚Äôs not like you wake up one day and ‚Äúyour youth is gone‚Äù.  Sure hangovers hurt a little more, and the fun you have does change, but life never gets any easier.  And for whatever it‚Äôs worth, I still feel 23-25ish.

Hope it helps bro take care of yourself now and I promise you, your future self will thank you."
10693,"your university should have a counseling center you can make an appointment with, just call them and explain that you‚Äôd like to talk to someone. it‚Äôs usually covered under your student health insurance I think. you can get a few sessions with a therapist. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done but don‚Äôt stress over them telling you ‚Äúwhat a mess you are‚Äù. they‚Äôll point out issues in your mindset and help you get back on your feet at least in some way."
10694,"Same man. I sacrificed my social life up until now to transfer; and now its all been taken away by something out of our damn control.

Feelings are beyond frustration."
10695,Is it because of the high amount of religious people? Mormons I think? Not sure I'm genuninely asking
10696,"  
Maybe try to start an introvert's club. Don't have to meet in person, can do it over Zoom or by emails/texts, whatever. Can advertise it as an opportunity for introverts to network, something we often miss out on because of being introverted."
10697,"Oh my gosh! I just turned 21 and I feel the exact same way to the point I become really jealous of current high school kids living out the life I wished mine was. This strong feeling also caused me to spiral into depression and took a huge toll on my life and studies. I thought I was the only 21 year old feeling this way and it bothered me a lot because it also made me feel extremely immature when I‚Äôm supposed to be an ‚Äúadult‚Äù

I‚Äôve gotten a bit better at overcoming this but I definitely need A LOT of work. Good news is that I‚Äôm slowly becoming more social. My studies, though, is a different story :/ currently trying to find a therapist to better help myself. 

I guess it‚Äôs true when they say your early 20s is a weird time in your life. I still really wish a lot of times that I did/learned things earlier in life, but I‚Äôve kinda come to the realization that I just need to get over it and move on in order to find my true self and also become the best version of me, and that acceptance of reality has to happen quite often for me instead of a one time thing. Hang in, there! I know we both have the power and are very capable of overcoming this. We just need to seize it."
10698,"None of us have this past year, looking at past times were reality was different doesn't help. Things will be back like they were though, and most will come out of the pandemic stronger than before."
10699,"Yep. The average for Mormons is probably even lower than that, if I had to guess. The other 40% of us are most likely bringing that average up a bit for Utah overall.

Mormons believe masturbation and premarital sex both break the law of chastity  to a fault. Your church leaders will ask you about it in your meetings with them and deny you access to the temple to get married or whatever, it's a big deal. And when you combine that with 18 - 20 year old hormones, this is what you get.

There's other reasons too, but that one is a major one imo. My (Mormon) cousin is 25 and engaged now, but she says she's an old maid, and that kind of thinking is fairly common.

EDIT: Looks like I remembered my stats wrong, 23 is the average for Mormons. Still much younger than the national average."
10700,"I'm at the 2nd year of community college part but I feel this. I really haven't made or have any really amazing friends I can even really talk to, everyone is too busy or maybe it's more me and not them. It gets lonely, I have my family and they are great but sometimes that's not enough. I hope you have family that supports you and cheers you on, and I hope you find some people that you can be comfortable with. I'm just a random dude on reddit but if you ever want to talk I can listen. Honestly, good luck, I hope you make some good memories soon."
10701,"You know what sucks? 20s are supposed to be the best parts of your life, yet we just study and work all the time, to the point where our mental health deteriorates"
10702,"It took me until after I graduated at 22 to go on any dates, try alcohol, go to any parties, make any lasting friendships. I have since experienced all those things, but they didn't make me feel less anxious about socialization and about wasting my prime years. Those feelings didn't go away until I went to therapy and worked on getting out of my own head and enjoying my own company."
10703,"Hey! Class of 2019 for starters, and while it might not help, I was in a similar situation. Graduated, and cut off almost everyone (excluding two buds in the military now) when I graduated. They just weren‚Äôt the kind of group I wanted to be around. My biggest tip is, as weird as it sounds, try Facebook groups. I‚Äôm in some aquarium keeping and kayaking groups, and gained some great friends this way. It‚Äôs been difficult during the pandemic, but we‚Äôre still all in touch. Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out! It feels weird to send a text out of nowhere, but they‚Äôll almost always appreciate it."
10704,"Most of the posts on  this thread are in the same boat which is the same boat I was in
 47 years ago when I was in college. The college 'scene ' has obviously radically changed since I was in your situation. What doesn't seem to have changed is the excitement of being, on your own with no parents to tell you what to do.   Or pull you out of a bad situation you accidentally got yourself into. 
Yes, some of my friends got married upon graduation. This is obviously a very personal decision.  People in their late teens and early twenties WILL grow and change a lot. People who get married at this age must recognize this and be prepared for it. Marriage, especially at this age is a challenge. (I strongly recommend avoiding divorce).
If you choose not to get married at this Time,Representativeone521 who posted above has some excellent tips and ideas. 

Remember,  your most important reason for being where you are is to prepare for your working life. I am surprised by the changes in the last 50 years and I  can't imagine the changes coming in the next 50 years!  So prepare for growth and change in yourself  your significant other, your workplace and I'm sure I'm leaving something out.

Good Luck whatever you choose."
10705,This is so similar to me and my situation I genuinely considered the possibility that I posted this and forgot about it.
10706,"In my calc 3 class, one of the students stopped showing up halfway through. When he showed up for the final, teacher called him out: ""Why are you here? You have a 20%, there's nothing you can do to pass. You haven't showed up to class in months, it's too late for you. You should just leave.""

&#x200B;

Was very surprising, he was a super chill dude who was generally very nice"
10707,"Wow that is so rude, I would never speak that way to a student (although I definitely have those thoughts!).

The frustration is real though, it's so confusing. I had a student this semester who stopped coming to class after the first month. Then recently they started submitting late assignments (I give 50% credit for late assignments). Still wasn't coming to class, but they showed up to the final. Totally bombed it and of course failed the class. I really don't get why they would bother, it was such a waste of their time and money."
10708,"I recently had a final and I heard the person in front of me say ""theres literally no way I can pass this class. I'm drawing a flower and leaving."" Dont know why he came, but he left in 5 minutes so I believe him"
10709,">I would never speak that way to a student

I might well do so privately, but doing it in front of the class is a FERPA violation in the US-- grade information is confidential and ""outing"" a failing student like that is beyond unprofessional."
10710,"Unfortunately people don‚Äôt know how to manage their time or just don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs funny cause I had my bio final yesterday and the room was jam packed with people that I hadn‚Äôt even seen for the whole semester. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll understand the logic behind that, but hey, it is what it is."
10711,"i was a person who actually did show up for a majority of the classes, but going into the final i knew there was no mathematical way for me to pass

the reason i did show up however was because i knew i had to retake the class next semester, and wanted to see if i could see what this year's final looked like to get a leg up next year"
10712,"I was one of those students last year. Long story short I fell very behind in my classes due to a combination of extenuating circumstances, mental health issues and just sheer laziness.

I still showed up to my finals because, although it may not make much sense, I wanted to make myself take responsibility for what had happened even though I knew I didn‚Äôt have much hope of passing. I made myself go to my finals because giving up completely and skipping finals seemed too much like a cop-out, and I thought that maybe the embarrassment of showing up at the final after being M.I.A most of the semester would motivate me to take better care of myself and stay on top of things next semester. Looking back, it didn‚Äôt really make any difference but it made sense in my head at the time.

But I would be willing to bet that some of those students may not realize they‚Äôre failing as badly as they are, don‚Äôt know how or are too lazy to calculate the grade they would need to pass, or have somehow convinced themselves that they might get a curve or extra credit that will help them pass. Sounds ridiculous, but some people are just that dumb/entitled."
10713,"Yeah I realize you were ranting, but those are the honest reasons I see that person I haven't seen in 2 months show up lol"
10714,This is like when I straight up write ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know‚Äù  on some quizzes.
10715,"I have the same questions.

Sometimes maybe it's a financial aid thing? If they fail the class but show up to the final then the penalties are different? I really don't know, just something I have heard at my university."
10716,federal educational rights and protections act. makes it illegal for professors or other faculty to share info like students grades and other personal identifying info like addresses
10717,"Before I dropped out of engineering, I did this a lot. I knew I wasn't going to pass, but not going to the final would raise suspicions & all of my friends were going anyway. 
I think peer pressure plays a big role when it comes to class (& exam) attendance."
10718,"I'm not sure if that's the case 

In my medical cohort not many people show up to lectures at all but do all the coursework and compulsory classes (Dissections) 

People have different ways of learning and they find success in that hence when exams come up I feel like I'm in the wrong exam hall because so many people idk show up

But yh while most do the work a lot just do the bare minimum"
10719,"I write ""you wrote this question, you should know the answer """
10720,"Yeah, at my college, students who don't attend classes the entire semester may have to give back financial aid based on when they stopped coming to class. If they show up to the final, their last day of attendance is the same as everyone else's."
10721,"Additionally some financial aid requires the last date of attendance if the student fails. They don‚Äôt always have to pay the aid back for failure, but will require the last date of attendance to prove they tried in the course. If they fail, they may also have the option of retaking it later for a grade forgiveness. I‚Äôm assuming they realized they were struggling after the drop date or they would become part time by dropping the course and have to repay money for that. The GI Bill uses these rules due to some vets struggling with college or certain courses"
10722,"Since you know, you won't pass, you might as well come to have a look a the exam to be able to prepare better for the next attempt.  
You could realize how easy or how hard the exam really is and adapt your effort accordingly and structure your next semester accordingly."
10723,"Not ridiculous. I‚Äôm just trying to understand. 

Did you reach out to the professor(s) during the event? Not everyone will, but I have some students I‚Äôve given extensions due to the reasons you listed. I suspect that‚Äôs happening with some of the other students. I let the class know they can talk to me. Have you had this message effectively communicated? If so, how?

I had mental health crises in college too. Definitely willing to help."
10724,Fantastic effort in your part. Did you pass the next time you took it?
10725,"Not a professor, but I‚Äôve also seen those kind of classmates lol. Shows up for a couple first week, and shows up the day before final. Like what the fuck?"
10726,"sorry to disappoint you, but I don't think i did. I think I dropped it before the deadline, and found a different way to get around the requirement. looking back, i think i had some sort of learning disability"
10727,"Family* educational rights and privacy act. Fwiw. 

Quick Q, though. Anybody ever had a class where the professor laid out graded work with scores on them on a table at the front of class for everyone to just go sort through and pick up? That's illegal, right? I wasn't too phased by it, but if my scores had been bad I would have been embarrassed..."
10728,ferpa violation?
10729,"A lot of college students are in some way dependent on their parents though.

I can also imagine that plenty of people still care about what their parents think of them, even when they're already adults."
10730,That‚Äôs really fucking funny
10731,"Many funding agencies (including military and some state funds) require profs to report attendance rates for F students. We have to indicate the last day a student was ‚Äúactive‚Äù in the course and penalties for failing courses are different if you ghost versus show up and fail. So if you attend final, prof has to indicate that you were ‚Äúactive‚Äù for the duration of the semester, even if that‚Äôs the only class you ever attended. It‚Äôs a nice idea (less penalty for students who tried but failed) but as with anything, some people use it as a loop hole to game the system."
10732,"Understandably so but there's a pattern of questioning that the student can take into account. Multiple choice or essay questions? Exact data or just general descriptions of things. Stuff like that which makes a huge difference while studying. Asking a lot of questions on one subject and asking a few on the others, meaning that subject is probably really important."
10733,"Oh cool a new troll account to block, Nice."
10734,"> Wow that is so rude, I would never speak that way to a student (although I definitely have those thoughts!).

I guess maybe not in front of other students, but I feel like this is actually a necessary conversation.  If someone shows up for a final when they are clearly going to fail, even with a perfect score, I need to know if they've misunderstood something the entire semester, or perhaps they had a death in the family that they didn't tell anyone about, etc.  If nothing like that occurs, I feel like it'd behoove me to let them know that they are going to have a rough time in life if they don't change some things up."
10735,"At my university we give UF and EF ( = unearned F and earned F). If we give an UF, this means that the student disappeared early in the semester and just didn't complete the class, we have to note the date of their last recorded activity. If we give EF, that means they were active throughout the semester but still got an F score.

On student transcripts it just shows up as F, but it has something to do with financial aid requirements and university reporting."

10753,And emphasize OP literally could‚Äôve died due to (would this be considered) negligence.
10754,"So they did end up testing them afterwards to make sure they worked, and luckily they did. And I have a slight correction because they‚Äôre claiming they went off but it‚Äôs really on a technicality: The fire alarms didn‚Äôt audibly go off, but the fire department was alerted."
10755,That's a very good idea. Especially if it's not a large community because they'll totally hop on it quickly
10756,Call your area‚Äôs Fire Marshal‚Äôa office and tell them there was a fire and the smoke detectors haven‚Äôt been going off. They take those allegations very seriously and they‚Äôll inspect to make sure things are up to code.
10757,[deleted]
10758,"OP, also report to your campus newspaper if they are not affiliated with your university (most are not affiliated) Bc will have the ability to report this"
10759,Have you considered that panic is an appropriate response to this situation?
10760,"Nah, that is a lot more than negligence. Covering up something like that constitutes malice in most jurisdictions. 

I would highly recommend reaching out to whoever the appropriate DA is for your area to refer them for prosecution. If the DA decides to pursue it, them filing charges will mean that evidence can be collected by warrants. 

Pushing it to a news agency is one way to get it out there, but if you want solid evidence, the best way is referring to a prosecutor."
10761,"That‚Äôs true, I just don‚Äôt want to get anyone in trouble. Like the Campus safety employee, for example. He gave up a lot of information that would be crucial to inform people that this is, indeed, an arsonist."
10762,"This type of shit is why fire chiefs have a gun and handcuffs in America.

There might be intentional tampering to save money."
10763,"Call the police/fire dept, covering up for an arsonist is a crime."
10764,Exactly! The reason for the loud sounds of fire alarms is to warn people to get out of a possible burning building. Colleges and schools legally need to have a working fire alarm system. People that have recently posted saying that this needs to be reported to OPs local fire department are absolutely correct.
10765,I think not getting students killed takes precedence over RAs being stressed or making it easier to administer finals. If they're keeping quiet about two attempted arsons in a residential building that's a little bit fucked.
10766,I‚Äôm speaking as a student journalist
10767,Yikes! You could get your own smoke detector to keep yourself safe. Good luck!
10768,I would also ask you cut slack on the RAs since they are probably just saying what their higher up told them to say.
10769,I thought I was on r/nosleep with that title. Wtf are they doing. Arson is something that they should‚Äôve taken seriously and tried to find the culprit rather than hide it.
10770,"This, you‚Äôre school will get on top of shit immediately once local news starts coming in with questions."
10771,"I mean I‚Äôm not giving them shit for it any of this, but unfortunately they are still involved. I was extremely close with my RA‚Äôs before shit similar to this went down, I spoke out about it, and they stopped talking to me altogether."
10772,">	in your attempt to be some kind of hero. 

Speaking out about the school keeping arson quiet in a building with faulty smoke alarms is ""trying to be a hero"" I'm dead üíÄüíÄüíÄ Not like those students are about to be if the arson gets worse, but still."
10773,"Order a smoke alarm for yourself. They are about $10. If you've got Prime you can get one tomorrow. Order two and put one in the bathroom while you're at it!

I agree with telling the newspaper/local news and the parents."
10774,I would report it to the police (not campus police) and maybe local news. If you can get the name of the campus safety officer to corroborate your story that would be even better.
10775,"Nah, that college doesn't get to get off scot-free for that. Those mfs get away with too much as it is. Absolutely report it. You could potentially save lives by reporting the faulty smoke detectors alone."
10776,"No, stuff like this has been happening all semester, but I‚Äôm fed up at this point. And I‚Äôm definitely not the one adding to their stress, it‚Äôs their fucking bosses who are telling them things that mean that none of us are safe and isolating them from the rest of the student body by not being able to say anything or warn anyone. This isn‚Äôt the first thing they‚Äôve tried to keep hush hush, which I‚Äôve said several times now."
10777,Panic is a valid emotion we have it for a reason
10778,More likely intentional tampering by the person lighting the fire to delay response from fire department. Or just an old unit with a faulty speaker or something.
10779,"Contact a fire inspector. By law your university has to have working fire alarms. When you report it, detail why you know they don't work and that will spark an investigation and visit from the fire inspector."
10780,well this sounds like a forensic files episode üò≥
10781,It‚Äôs basically the plot to the second episode of Criminal Minds
10782,There are stages of alarms in most buildings.  If the fire doesn't meet the criteria to evacuate the building the audible and visible alarm systems will not go off but personnel will be alerted (such as the fire department).  From OPs description it sounds like the evacuation alarms should have gone off but who knows.
10783,"Same here. I‚Äôve also never been to any in person classes at my current university but I have too soon. Add in the fact that I have to take the bus, which I‚Äôve never done in my current city, I‚Äôm a nervous wreck. I‚Äôm trying to distract myself with movies just like you‚Äôre doing it‚Äôs comedy. It‚Äôs never that bad once you start it. We‚Äôll get through it."
10784,"100%, same here. Thinking about an event is way worse than experiencing it haha."
10785,"Take the bus trip before you have to, do a dry run. Makes a huge difference."
10786,The fuck is a power pose
10787,The idea that power poses boost confidence has [largely been debunked](https://time.com/4949675/power-poses-confidence/). There's little evidence to suggest that they have much of a benefit to anything.
10788,"Definitely do it! It's worth the 2 dollars. Use your free day to scope out study spots, coffee shops, or places to grab lunch that you want to try."
10789,My anxiety has gone up knowing that I start the winter semester in 1 week. The feeling of butterflies in my stomach and no appetite has gone up and I feel like it‚Äôll keep me up Sunday night before class.
10790,I‚Äôm on the same boat...the anxiety hits me so hard and it only get worse as I drive to school. For me it‚Äôs always with new classes that gives me the worst anxiety. Since there‚Äôs so many ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions running through my head.
10791,"I can never sleep the first day of classes. I will always be on a few hours worth of sleep because my brain simply cannot deal with starting new things, or perceiving being late for the first day. It sucks."
10792,"A lot of us are in the real world with real jobs and whatnot. Sure, some member of this sub may not be employed, but that doesn‚Äôt invalidate their anxiety.  Your comment isn‚Äôt very helpful."
10793,"I‚Äôve been debating whether that‚Äôs worth the money, but considering it probably costs less than $2 I think it could be fine. I think I‚Äôm gonna try that tomorrow or the next day."
10794,Thanks! I think I needed a little encouragement.
10795,"Tbh it doesn't really matter for me that classes are starting up again in a week. All I know is that I HAVE to do well in college no matter what the costs. That might be bad for me in case I overwork myself and overheat, but there is no other way around it. In this world, you can either catch up or eternally fall behind unfortunately. Its a lesson that took me a while to learn :("
10796,"I usually get a spike of excitement the week before classes, since i get to be back and hanging out with friends and get to start classes. Anxiety doesn't kick in until words ""Exam Review"" are mentioned by my professors."
10797,"Haha, I've worked and gone to college full time the entire five years I've been enrolled. This year will be the first year I *don't* start the semester with a job and it's not for lack of trying to have one (I just refuse to go back to retail during this pandemic). Only reason I can afford to hold out for a non-retail job is because I yeeted a good portion of my last jobs paycheck into an emergency fund. Even so, I may have to go to retail soon if I don't find something.

You may have gotten lucky, based on what you wrote, and never had to work while you were taking classes. But many of us here had no choice but to hold down a job and classes. 

Like, man, check yourself before you wreck yourself. For some people, starting a 'real' job is less pressure than the college experience."
10798,"This happens to quite a lot of people. I usually get everything done before Sunday and on Sunday I go skate or hit a trail up, by the time I get home I‚Äôm asleep and fucking tackling Monday, ya know?"
10799,"Normally I do. Normally I get very anxious and excited, I bounce off the walls the entire week before.

This year, as like with most of 2020, I'm just numb/apathetic.  It's my last semester and it just doesn't feel real to me. Like, it's hard to believe I've been in college for five years and it's about to be over. 

Idk. It might start to feel more real once it starts. But for now it just feels like a dream."
10800,"Absolutely, I tried to sleep in the day before the day before the first day of school. Good luck to you!"
10801,I bet you get lots of pussy.
10802,Bro I wish
10803,Did you do it? Keep us updated!
10804,"Yes, I feel like this every Sunday! And the entire week before going back after a long holiday.

An exercise my therapist gave me was to talk to anxiety conversationally. Anxiety is just your mind's way of trying to protect you. It's a good thing to acknowledge those thoughts- what is your anxiety trying to tell you? What does logic say? I usually journal mine- so the journal entry may look like this.

Anxiety: I don't do well under pressure. I don't know what the assignment is so I can't prepare. Therefore, I'm going to do really poorly. What if the assignment is too overwhelming and I have a panic attack during the lecture?

Logic: I've done really well in the past. I am intelligent and budget my time well. Even if I am overwhelmed with an assignment, I can always ask the professor for help and/or an extension. 

Another thing that's really helped me is keeping my sleep schedule the same through the weekends and breaks. It's helped loads. Sending you good vibes. You can do this!"
10805,"Tbh I‚Äôm just really stressed because my school doesn‚Äôt allow student to receive more than, like, 4 packages for the first couple of weeks. But I need to get books for classes and can‚Äôt do that because I have to order them in but I can‚Äôt do that cos it‚Äôs more than 4 books, so I won‚Äôt have like any books in time for classes. Which is stressful."
10806,"Yes ! What helps - as someone else said - is writing it down. The psychological explanation is that if you write your intrusive thoughts, it tricks your brain into thinking that you already ¬´¬†processed / took them into account¬†¬ª and so they won‚Äôt be so present ‚Äî> it frees some space in your mind and 1. you won‚Äôt be as stressed 2. You‚Äôll actually perform better at school because there won‚Äôt be a huge chunk of your ressources used to cope with stress !"
10807,"I had the same feeling a lot, not every week but pretty often. This last semester I picked up golfing and spending the day outside doing something else besides waiting for Monday to roll around eased my anxiety a ton. Maybe try filling that time you spend worrying with a hobby to try to get your mind off of things."
10808,"If I have a busy week and I know it‚Äôs gonna suck I‚Äôll feel anxious, but generally it depends on whether imma be swamped or not."
10809,I have this same type of anxiety (used to call it sunday night panic as a kid) and it turns out it‚Äôs actually very common and linked to general anxiety disorder! If you‚Äôre enrolled in college in the states I‚Äôm pretty sure you should have mental health services. Use them! Everyone should be in therapy to an extent.
10810,Faculty member checking in. Your teachers get it too.
10811,"This is a very real, documented phenomenon called the Sunday scaries! There are some great tips here but if you Google ‚ÄúSunday scaries‚Äù you‚Äôll find a lot more tools and resources, but it might just help knowing you‚Äôre not alone!"
10812,"Oh absolutely, I hear you, man. I really hate college and COVID and learning from home has just made that a LOT worse. I failed two courses last semester (I might even fail a winter semester course I‚Äôm taking right now) and I‚Äôm just really worried I‚Äôm gonna flunk out. I think a good part of the fault is my own, but another part is really that COVID is just making me one of the unluckiest people in history."
10813,Happened with D2L too
10814,I‚Äôm on the west coast rn and canvas is still up but it‚Äôs super fucking slow:(
10815,My plan is to nap until it‚Äôs back up and running
10816,Couldn't have picked a worse time
10817,Amazon Web Services is having issues today.
10818,I been playing a bunch of Halo while waiting for canvas to be up and running again LMAO
10819,I had an assignment due and was f this. The prof extended it though
10820,And Blackboard...
10821,Or better time...I‚Äôm still debating on that
10822,my only time  window to take one of my finals was during the shut down üôÉ
10823,West Coast here.. definitely not up.
10824,When the fuck did it go down I just got out of class rn bro fuckkkk
10825,i was panicking over how i was gonna turn in my final english portfolio but my professor extended the deadline so all is good
10826,When tf are you taking your exams?! Christmas?!
10827,Bruh y‚Äôall take finals the week of Christmas? RIP
10828,"Email it to the prof, so you have a timestamp."
10829,Incorrect. Blackboard is also affected.
10830,My first quarter of college was already pretty rough and Canvas not working just feels like being kicked while I'm already feeling down at this point.
10831,Uhhhh the study guide for one of my finals is solely on canvas so
10832,My essay worth 20% of my grade is due tonight and I can‚Äôt submit it‚Ä¶
10833,Yup.
10834,Oh dang didn‚Äôt realize it spread. RIP.
10835,My school is down. And students are panicking. Maybe different schools are on different servers?
10836,It screwed up D2L in the Midwest too
10837,At least I got an email from my profs extending deadlines
10838,Yay for our excruciatingly long semester calendar. We've got two weeks until finals.
10839,"Just jumping in (assuming your not on campus internet that cares) you could prob get away with a vpn to access different servers to get work done‚Ä¶.if you really need it that is, could arise some unexpected complications"
10840,Oh dang I was just about to do homework‚Ä¶.. what a shame
10841,No issues with blackboard for me ü§î
10842,I heard it went down at 10:15am cst.
10843,"That's the 4th S

Substance abuse"
10844,I‚Äôm able to do all 3 every week with the help of marijuana
10845,"So 9 hours sleep

8 hour study

7 hour party?"
10846,"never had a social life, and now that i'm doing college online i don't think that's gonna change either lol"
10847,Some of us have jobs that prevent a social life
10848,"You can't forget about the 5th S

Smore substance abuse."
10849,Or anxiety.
10850,Yeah the math checks out.
10851,"My motto was always : Sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as much as possible"
10852,"ive never cared for socializing with my classmates, most of them are still 18-23 trying to get wasted as much as they can."
10853,"With discipline and moderation, I think all 3 are possible. This is obviously an anecdote. I schedule myself for 40 hours a week, including class time. Most weeks I have ""overtime"", but striving for a 40 hour week has made me much more productive. My ""overtime"" is roughly 2-6 hours a week spread over Saturday and Sunday.

I make it a point to list my tasks for the next day prior to sleep. I also assign a a priority level to each task. This system works fairly well, but again requires moderation and discipline."
10854,[removed]
10855,Adderall solves it all.
10856,Very major dependent and not college dependent
10857,I don‚Äôt have a social life to worry about anyways so I‚Äôm chillin
10858,What kind of colleges are y'all going to? It's really not that hard to hang out with friends 3-4 nights a week while still getting your work done and getting some sleep
10859,I feel this. I‚Äôm not really interested in socializing with kids I can‚Äôt relate to :( I transferred this Fall to my university and I‚Äôve been looking for my fellow non-traditional college students.
10860,mmmmmmm smores
10861,"Thank you man, I‚Äôm a freshman at a heavy party school and I‚Äôm constantly being told to socialize with as much people as I can when the mass consensus just seems to get as smashed as possible or die trying. I don‚Äôt want to sound pretentious but jesus it feels so suffocating to have this pressure of people telling me that if I don‚Äôt follow this same path I‚Äôm essentially wasting my time. I came here to set the foundation for my career and meet a few likeminded people along the way, not get my stomach pumped every weekend with burnouts. It‚Äôs just not interesting."
10862,If you have a chronic illness while in a double STEM major there is no sleep and there is no socialization and there is just studying. lmao. and if youre like me and your meds knock out out for a weekend there is only sleep and no studying on weekends. and in the summer it is just full time work to pay for school and thus the cycle repeats itself. its a good thing that i am the studious type
10863,That too lol. On the good old Lexapro
10864,A Pok√©mon?
10865,I wish lol. My major (criminology) isn't particularly hard but it's a hell of a lot of writing and I am the slowest writer on the planet. üò≠üò≠ I try my best to give myself 1 day to hang out or 2 days to just not study lol
10866,"well a lot of the young folks at that age are getting their first taste of true freedom and adulthood. im several years older than most of the students in that age group and its amazing what a difference those years make in mentality. dont feel bad, youre not missing out."
10867,"You forgot the 4th S, Sadness.
This includes things like crippling anxiety , imposter syndrome, and depression!


Oh and the 5th S, Sports (and recreation, and hobbies)"
10868,Maybe not the sleep part lol
10869,"Same, I don't think there are very many in my school. They supposedly represent 18% of my school, but I(34) am the oldest in all of my classes. It's a bit awkward, but I'm not letting it bother me too much. But, yeah, socializing with them outside of class is a definite no."
10870,"I guess I don‚Äôt vie for freedom and the want to feel like an adult because I never felt like caged in or mistrusted by my parents, but some of these people I mean you would swear they just served 20 years in prison and are trying to make up for it with as much piss beer as they can get their hands on."
10871,Lucky for you i have insomnia
10872,"As a full time grad student with a full time job, your job certainly places limits on a social life, but it does NOT prevent one. You need to work on finding a balance ASAP. You WILL burn out if you don‚Äôt."
10873,Am I the only loser who has never skipped a class in college? This shit is expensive! And I am sure to pick cool classes. 
10874,[deleted]
10875,"But also a PSA: mental health is a thing that can fuck you up.

Being bored by [random class] or feeling overwhelmed with 4 tests in one week is normal. Needing to take just one day out to reset is okay.

But if your sleeping and eating are highly disturbed, you find yourself crying a lot, you just *can't* leave the house, you're slow and lethargic even on 15 hours of sleep, there are substance abuse problems, you have difficulty keeping up personal hygiene, you've lost motivation for things you used to love, and/or you're having thoughts of suicide and self-harm: you need to get help from someone.

It may mean getting a medical withdrawal, or taking some approved time away from class. But it's important you get help, because unless your class has an attendance policy and a professor who gives a damn, it's entirely too easy to fall through the cracks.

I was a straight A+ student who started missing classes, dropped 20kg, slept for far too long or not at all, and was clearly dishevelled when I did show up. People saw something was wrong, they asked me how I was going, but when I said ""I feel like absolute shit"" no one did anything. People simply don't know how to act, or don't want to presume, so they'll watch you crash and burn. You need to take the first step to treatment yourself."
10876,">Truly cannot fathom why some students just completely skip and check out

- I have homework for more important classes

- I have to study for more important classes

- It's an early class, I'm tired, and attendance isn't mandatory

- I don't get much if anything out of going to the class and class isn't mandatory

etc. etc.  I don't particularly care about class - I don't learn well from lectures.  I care about the letters on my expensive piece of paper, because that's what employers care about.  I have no problem skipping class if I'm still getting good enough grades."
10877,"‚ÄúA lot of people go to school for 7 years‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah they‚Äôre called doctors‚Äù "
10878,SEVEN? what are you studying? medicine?
10879,"Agreed. Truly cannot fathom why some students just completely skip and check out (not including those struggling with health issues). College is so fucking expensive, you should make the most of it


Edit: Okay, some of you are taking this quite literally and I didn‚Äôt mean it that way. What I meant is not coming to any of your classes or tests, just completely failing the course. Not skipping classes to learn from the book yourself, or taking a mental health day. What I meant is when students utterly stop trying "
10880,"i have met or read from a shocking amount of people who say things like ""yeah I missed half the lectures and never went to the discussion sections and got like a 32&#37; on the exam, wtf is going on?"" Like, they are honestly surprised that this happened to them."
10881,"It‚Äôs not even anything cool like that, it‚Äôs literally just a bachelors. My father is an actual doctor and I am starting to approach how long he was in school, for a bachelors in a field I don‚Äôt even want to work in anymore.  
Truly living the dream."
10882,[deleted]
10883,"This honestly should go deeper. If you're an incoming freshmen that is only going to college because your mommy and daddy told you, you don't need to be going. Instead of putting yourself in debt for the sake of ""having the college experience!"" go out into the workforce, job shadow, join the military or do anything else that's going to better yourself financially and mentally. College is a great tool for people that take it seriously, but it's not the only stepping stone in life that leads to success and fulfillment."
10884,[deleted]
10885,Sunk-cost fallacy
10886,"I think a lot of this boils down to immaturity. Think about it: the *average* college freshman probably doesn‚Äôt work and is for the first time getting a taste of freedom from school. All their lives, since kindergarten, they‚Äôve been at school from 7/8 am to 2/3pm. Seeing that they have the option not to take that 8 am algebra class and instead start their day at 10:45 am looks good. Oh snap! Attendance isn‚Äôt mandatory?! 

This newly found freedom backfires a lot more often because of this. I‚Äôve seen it happen my first two years and these were common scenarios. 

On the flip side, then there‚Äôs kids like me. I didn‚Äôt really have it easy growing up and had to work at 16. So going to college and seeing advisors/professors tout unpaid internships or clubs makes these types of students eyes roll. They have to work. I had to work to make ends meet and help out my family. Sadly...some required classes are only offered MF at 2:15/4:30. Bosses say they‚Äôll try to give you those days off. Oh but someone called out...you need those extra hours. Fuck Professor Sanchez and that 2 pm course. And sadly it begins a weird and too often cycle. Skipping out of necessity. I‚Äôve also seen this happen, it happens a lot with students who come from a working class background. 
"
10887,[deleted]
10888,"Fuck, this is me. I started out college really strong: got good grades, rarely missed classes, involved in clubs, etc. Now, I have no motivation, I can barely pay attention in class (to be fair, I have been diagnosed with ADHD and am in the process of getting new meds, so that might have something to do with it), constantly feeling down about myself, constantly feel stressed, never can keep up in class, eat way too much, etc. The motivation is completely gone and I feel hopeless sometimes. 

Maybe I should get some help."
10889,[deleted]
10890,"Your comment may sound a bit mean but I agree with it. I‚Äôve encountered other freshman who are studying something their parents want them to that they have NO interest in (they‚Äôll be miserable), and those who since their parents have money, they spend more time partying in frat/sorority than in class and end up failing class because they never showed up or showed up to class drunk. You can go to college and have fun but having fun should not be a priority."
10891,"while this may be true, taking on that attitude towards classes is only going to reinforce the idea that the classes aren‚Äôt worth anything. in my opinion, the mindset you have going into classes, or anything really, will decide a lot about how you feel about it. if you think the classes are a waste of your time then they will be. however if you go into the class with the mindset that you‚Äôre excited learn, you can really get a lot out of it. this has really helped me be more positive about school. 

i‚Äôm not trying to say you‚Äôre wrong, i actually agree with a lot of what you said, but just offering a different view. "
10892,"I second this, skipped 18 out of 36 lectures for General Chemistry 2 that was recorded online. Ended up failing the course, having to repeat it in summer school and realizing that skipping lectures was the reason. Definitely do not recommend at all ever. Especially with lectures that are recorded online, the temptation is even higher to fall behind. "
10893,Liberal arts degrees can be your best friend and you can still find work if you learn to use that to your advantage
10894,I'm not surprised because I used to be one of them. Sometimes these kids have to make these mistakes and fail before they learn. I certainly did.
10895,"You raise some good points. If you skip class in a calculated manner, that's totally different. What I was talking about was just skipping to skip. Good call. "
10896,"I'd skip if I ever felt that my mental health would benefit more from the hour+ of rest than my education from the hour of lecturing. Sometimes going to class just isn't ""making the most of it."""
10897,"Yes, that would be one (good) way to use what you‚Äôve gained from the experience. 

But no matter what you choose to do, pursue a related field to that of which you studied, or start over from scratch, those seven years and money spent are gone forever, yet the rest of your life is still ahead of you. Why make it miserable? 

It‚Äôs analogous to being in a toxic relationship. You might‚Äôve really loved this person at one point, but after a few years, you‚Äôve grown to realize that you absolutely can‚Äôt stand certain quirks or they‚Äôre actually draining your happiness and you‚Äôve built resentment towards them. But you can‚Äôt just break up, you FEEL obliged to take care of them because you‚Äôve been through so much together already, you‚Äôre comfortable, you moved in together, mutually own a pet, etc...so a relationship that should‚Äôve lasted two year turns into 5 years and counting... 

(1) You can continue this relationship and be miserable because you don‚Äôt want to deal with the aftermath (homelessness, loneliness, loss, drama) 
or 
(2) Breakup and focus on yourself and your happiness. You‚Äôll have to deal with a temporary instability but learn in the process to find yourself again.

It doesn‚Äôt mean that 5-year long relationship was for nothing; sure the gifts and money and stability and all the benefits of being in that relationship are gone. But it gave you experience you wouldn‚Äôt have gained in any other way, vital for soul-searching and searching for future partners. 

Point is, what‚Äôs gone is gone. What you choose to do after recognizing the fact is up to you. "
10898,"To be fair, maybe they did this with other classes and got away with it.

I had GE classes and low level core classes I skipped all the time and still did fine. I was smart enough to realize that wouldn't apply to all classes, but some people might not think that far ahead."

10900,"I have never missed a class without cause before (ie being sick) but I will say, some things are worth skipping for, like I wish I‚Äôd skipped class to spend time with my family. "
10901,"I agree, to a point, but occasionally, in undergrad, there were just days when I had no desire to go to class at all, and knew that I would be better served by sleeping in, or going to the gym, or something during that time. Under no circumstances should missing class be a habit, but missing, say, one meeting, or maybe two, in a semester isn't really bad. (At my uni, at least, the standard policy for a class which met twice weekly allows for three unexcused absences.)"
10902,"When my parents were paying for my school and I was straight out of high school, I didn't care and cut lots of classes to my detriment. Now that I'm back and paying my own way, it takes nearly an act of god to make me miss class."
10903,It‚Äôs not that simple for a lot of people. I was basically forced to start college this semester because if not I would‚Äôve lost most of my scholarships and been unable to afford my school
10904,Same here. My social skills were basically nonexistent for  the longest time
10905,"This could last years, man.  Why do you think it will end in a year or two?"
10906,"Tell me about it, modern day problems. Both of classes hold study sessions where half the time we just talk"
10907,"My college hasnt changed tuition AT ALL. They havent even changed the breakdown of payment, so we actually still get charged sports and gym fees and shit."
10908,"colleges won't be able to stay closed for more than year or two. it's not about the pandemic, it's about paycheck"
10909,"My scholarships apply to four years strictly, not an option for me :/"
10910,"All the discussions feel so bland, and there's no interaction after. Why do we even bother with them"
10911,"I appreciate it, and likewise, if you ever wanna reach out I'm sure we could help rehabilitate our social skills lol"
10912,They are still getting tuition

10916,"im sorry :( maybe see if you can do a study abroad in the spring. I know some schools are allowing it for the spring. if not, maybe take a leave of absence?  You can get a job or something that will let you get out of the house. good luck."
10917,I‚Äôm so sorry that you are going through this. My son graduated this year (C/O 2020) He also worked really hard in school & was awarded scholarships. He (& many of his friends) were looking forward to starting college & getting out of our small town. I can‚Äôt count the ones who went off to college & have come home already so discouraged. Those & the ones who have just completely dropped all classes bc this is their 1st year & they were just not prepared to navigate their 1st year of college online... it all just breaks my heart.
10918,This is madness. Yet again young people  are being sacrificed by old people. They even get stuck with $5T in incremental debt that no old person will have to pay back.
10919,"I feel you. I live 45 minutes away from my university, but even I still have to do school online there right now too, and it's such a huge disappointment. There is so little socializing, and it's hard to pay attention to lectures outside of a traditional classroom like that. I've managed to make some friends this semester though. One of the ways I did that has been to swap contact info with others in the classes. I ended up making a friend and we text about the classes we have together and help each other out on assignments. And that's made all the difference in the classes I attend with them.

Everyone's situation is different, but my advice is to try to reach out to other students in little ways like that. You may bond with some other lonely students. There are a lot of us right now!

If you weren't looking for advice though, just know that I feel you. It's rough right now dude :/"
10920,That is crazy ass.. I would be mad if I couldn't access the things I paid for...
10921,">I feel like I'm being cheated 

You were cheated, so it's appropriate to feel that way. 

This year has cheated many, many people.

I'm sorry for you getting cheated, and for everyone else who's been cheated by this accursed year."
10922,The other day I held the door open for someone and said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù as I held the door open.....
10923,"I'm poor and study abroad is always expensive, leave of absence isn't an option since my scholarship is strictly four years"
10924,"It fuckin sucks, yeah. This is gonna be my last year and it feels like it‚Äôs being wasted. At least we can look forward to the overthrow of the ruling class that exacerbated this pandemic and put us all in debt"
10925,"The young are told to take sacrifices for the old.  But the media peddles that this will end quickly to ensure compliance; if people believed otherwise, many wouldn't follow the rules."

10927,Colleges are hemorrhaging money. They are not profiting in the slightest.
10928,"All my professors (all in my major department) have decided that for every class a pair of students must present the material and design a lesson plan around that to ‚Äúget us engaged‚Äù. More like it gets us enraged. Group work over zoom is impossible, I hate having to teach my own classes or learn material from other kids while the prof just sits there nodding his head. It‚Äôs just so lazy I just wish they would teach their own material. I‚Äôm a senior so the only reason I‚Äôm here is to get this all over with."
10929,"Wow, I feel like your college situation is almost the same as mine! Like you, I'm also an international student who is a sophomore in college. Like you, I was only able to go to a college in the us because of my scholarships. Like you, I've also been forced to go back to my home country due to the whole corona pandemic. Fortunately, I'm a really introverted person, so this whole staying-at-home situation hasn't been as bad for me as it has been for others. That being said, that doesn't mean I haven't had my fair share of mental breakdowns throughout this whole period. All I can say is hang in there! I know that isn't good advice, but I believe in you!"
10930,I think there are but the people in it arent the best at socializing (duh lol) and thus no friendships.

10940,"It's not about regret, it's about the abstraction of ""homework,"" ""essay,"" and ""assignment"" and related terms as intangible obstacles that induce more anxiety (from thinking about the work required) than they (probably) really warrant."

10942,"My professor doesn‚Äôt even check it, they assign it and forget about it next class"

10948,I‚Äôve never thought of it like that! You might have just changed my view a little bit!
10949,You'll most likely only regret the student loans.
10950,"I‚Äôm glad it helped! I‚Äôve started looking at school and self-care habits as ‚Äúhave I ever regretted doing this? Am I likely to regret *not* doing this?‚Äù For example, have I ever regretted washing my face before bed? Nope. So why not?

It‚Äôs helped me because it makes future emotions/thoughts more real in the moment. I hope it becomes useful for you too!"

10963,"I've attended three universities. How do they keep getting students if they don't care about them, you ask?

NEW BUILDING! GUYS, HAVE YOU SEEN THAT COOL NEW BUILDING WITH THE PIZZA PLACE IN IT?? ONE WHOLE WALL IS WINDOWS!

YOU'RE FUCKING WELCOME!"
10964,"I don't feel like that but, I feel like my University doesn't give a shit about its students which is probably true."
10965,Smaller universities are usually private and cost more money to attend. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs any different
10966,"My community college was a public school and is a lot smaller than the university in my town which I currently attend, and I can definitely say the quality of education was so much better than the one I'm getting rn at my CSU. The professors at my CC cared so much more about us actually learning than at my university. From what I hear from my friends who go to private universities, you actually don't deal with a lot of administrative issues and do end up getting a decent education, though it costs a lot of money. I complain to them about having to call a million numbers, send thousands of emails, pay tons of fees to get something small processed, and they don't understand why the university doesn't take care of all of that for us. That's one of the benefits of going to a private college."
10967,"I go to a small private university, so they have more incentive to try and please their students and are more receptive to feedback. They do screw up some things, but I think that's inevitable in any institution."
10968,RIP. Good luck homie.
10969,UCF is building a lazy river. Go Knights!
10970,College is a business. As long as their bottom-line looks good then they don‚Äôt care about you. And non-profit is just a fancy word for ‚Äòtax-break‚Äô
10971,"I understand your point, but I‚Äôm not willing to go 200 thousand dollars into debt just so I can feel like my professors ‚Äúcare‚Äù about me.

It‚Äôs only natural that a school with 1,000 people has a more personal feel than a school with 30,000 people. But, since the school wants a lot of money, they‚Äôre gonna charge those 1,000 people an arm and a leg to attend. 

I go to a public school with 30 thousand people and I‚Äôve had a great experience and had some wonderful professors. You have bad and good professors at every school."
10972,"My college is absolute shit when it comes to handling covid. Its horrible. If u want to look into it search up @covid.campus on Instagram

So, yeah my college is not great or effective at all when it comes to caring about its students and that's just one example"
10973,"I got an email saying not come onto campus until the 25th of Jan, there's still some indecision in the UK about schools reopening. And I have an exam this Tuesday. No lecturers are responding because they aren't in office until tomorrow"
10974,"I transferred because my last school was such a mess. I couldn‚Äôt deal with it anymore, so I left. My current school isn‚Äôt too terribly much better, but I don‚Äôt live in a dorm with black mold and asbestos, so that‚Äôs something!"
10975,"Can confirm by experience the part about ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt actually deal with a lot of administrative issues and do end up getting a decent education, though it costs a lot of money.‚Äù 

My private college is not ‚Äúknown‚Äù or ‚Äúgood‚Äù for my major. It is not going to give me a Name Brand degree. It is *only barely* more expensive than my city‚Äôs major public university, after calculating parking fees (I don‚Äôt have them), activity fees (mine are cheap and optional), and other fees like ‚ÄúDepartment Fees‚Äù (only sometimes I have these). It is a *somewhat* closer drive to my home, but has way easier traffic (not all the way into the city) and easier parking. My program director is given a lot of responsibility (in reverse perspective, I will say she is admittedly overwhelmed), so she is directly coordinating my entire education almost completely one-on-one. My own graduating class is less than ten, and my program is less than 50. I‚Äôve gotten an extremely customized and targeted education, with the amazing personal touches of having your professors care about your well-being in times of crisis. 

That was a lot of info, but in general, my advice would be to look at the logistics of your own life first, determine under which circumstances you can succeed in, and search institutions accordingly. Make it about you first, so you guarantee yourself success, and consider the logistics in correlation. Bam"
10976,I go to a small public liberal arts college and I feel the same way. My school actually cares about its students and it shows.
10977,"Small private colleges are *waaaay* more of a money scheme, if not *the* money scheme. They are significantly more expensive, often have limited research, and indulge in hiring adjunct faculty while padding a bloated administration‚Äôs wallets. Oftentimes they produce diplomas, not world class research, nor patents, nor properly accredited individuals. 

Larger flagship land-grant universities generally cater to a more diverse, multinational, and merit-based crowd, which provides significantly more economic mobility to 1stgen/low income students. Look no further than Michigan, California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, or Illinois. They also have the dual purpose of producing research and being academic/industrial kingpins of specialized industries, which allows them to produce something and bring in funds to provide more knowledge. Meanwhile private schools only offer obtuse student fees and tuition. Of course, these are generalizations, there are plenty of good private schools and *plenty* of bad flagships, but as a general rule it holds true.


Edit: your experiences with bad teaching aren‚Äôt uncommon, specifically because in many cases it is world class *researchers* teaching them. This is an advantage at the higher levels, but not always at the lower ones. This is actually good, since unlike small schools the admin isn‚Äôt hiring adjunct faculty in favor of TT professors. My experience with community colleges has been poor because they often do not have the course selection, nor the same rigor of education, that is needed in my field. As a STEM field everything builds on itself, and if you find yourself weak in the fundamentals you will not do well in advanced classes."
10978,"Yeah, college is expensive and unfortunately at a certain point you need to spend money to get the quality. Luckily I live in CA so my first two years of CC was free, and since my uni is in my hometown I only pay about $8000/year, which I have in savings after saving my whole life. So I'm going to graduate with no debt, but I'll leave my university knowing about as much as I did after earning my AA degrees. At this point, I'm basically just paying to be able to put ""BA"" on my resume and not paying to actually learn or be taught anything new. College is a scam, but most people know this"
10979,I'm not looking forward to this spring semester. I just want to stay back home until the end of the pandemic.
10980,"I studied/have a Master‚Äôs Degree in Higher Education and I can echo a lot of things said here- colleges/universities are run like businesses. It‚Äôs a huge issue. However, there are many individuals working within the institutions that care about students‚Äô experience on campus/wellbeing/life and really dedicate a great deal of time and energy into maintaining those values while working within a system that puts profit over humans. 

It is pretty much a universal thing, and I know it sucks to feel like your only value is how much you contribute monetarily. I hope that you are able to find those individuals that are willing and excited to advocate for you and your peers within the shitty system that is higher education."
10981,Yep.  I can tell you that they don‚Äôt do it by greater pay for faculty-
10982,My group didn't have classes for a full month  because my Uni couldn't prepare the schedule on time
10983,"ay same! Down to the fucking rooms. I had the 'luxury, apartment style' dorms facilitated by an 'accessory corporation', aka, I had a room big enough for a bed and a desk and shared an unfinished kitchen + bathroom with 4 other guys. We got scolded just for changing a light-bulb once, the rules they tried making adults follow but still charge full $800 rent was insane. 

I mean unfinished. Bare brick and concrete. And my roommates were fucking sucky. At times I literally jumped out the window (first floor) rather than deal with em.

Like OP I was also trying to be involved with student gov and holy shit... Fucking awful. 

Now I'm a commuter. I live at home. It sucks in many aspects, but uh, much better in others."
10984,"I go to a small public university. It's one of the cheapest options in my state, and is considered the best school in-state for post-graduate employment. It's very well-respected, and I'm glad it was an option for me. They have great programs for students and the professors are very accessible and helpful (for the most part). The drawback is that it's a stem school, so you're not gonna have a very diverse campus life or options for your major. But I think schools that focus on a specific field are probably the best option since they are better able to meet the needs of students."
10985,As soon as I read this I knew where you were talking about. I was dreading my away semester this spring given that I couldn‚Äôt get an internship but the more I hear about admin‚Äôs indecision the more relieved I am that I don‚Äôt have to deal with that. I‚Äôm sorry dude!
10986,"I wouldn't mind the remote access, but I feel like there's no support for students and being able to contact someone for an issue is practically impossible. I've heard a lot of good things about them (it's the main reason I transferred there besides the fact you can't beat the tuition prices for a university) but I wish they would give SOME support to their students even if it's in the form of tutoring."
10987,"Woot woot fuck that shit hole, I just transferred and am starting this spring in a new school. If you're reading this Hawkinson, you and your shitty adminstration lost you at least two students. Take your ""coal miner grit"" and shove it up your ass."
10988,"I feel like my school just doesn't coordinate between things. The Housing office clearly doesn't talk to the accomidations office, the dining is run by a contractor that clearly doesn't care, academics obviously doesn't bother to push for reasonable schedules for students, or maybe they can't? Our campus certainly doesn't integrate with the local town aside from aesthetics."
10989,I have felt like this since I first stepped foot on campus. But I realized campus professionals were full of a lot of people who got their job because of nepotism/ connections and not merit. Then when they got in the role they became butt kisses who were afraid to go against bad decisions so they could move up the food chain. Seeing this culture made me realize absolutely nothing would change. Everyone is just trying to keep their job. They don't give a damn about the students in a way that would cost the university something they're not willing to give.
10990,"I'm a fellow knight in COBA. The only reason I'm sticking around to finish my bachelor's is because of the accreditation. Screw UCF, I'm going to Valencia to work on a second degree untill UCF can figure out how to have in-person classes."
10991,"My son graduated from UCF (in law school now) and could have gone elsewhere, but we love UCF. I'm in CA now, working at a University here, but love UCF even more for sticking to remote-only (as our entire university system is remote-only). What I find excessive is the ""leisure pool"" and ""lazy river."" It's incredibly anti-intellectual to build these as recruiting tools. They don't have to. It's a fabulous institution."
10992,"The main upside to private colleges is they offer a ton of scholarships through the school. My school costs 70k to attend a year but after they apply in school scholarships so far it‚Äôs been free and I‚Äôve only had to take out a 3,000 loan"
10993,"Yup. I feel that. 

I have been told I was ~gifted~ since like the 2nd grade and college made me realize I‚Äôm not fucking gifted, the school system just sucks. 

So it‚Äôs a constant reminder of how dumb I actually am. "
10994,"I broke out of it after being in it all my life. It happened my junior year.

It literally just came down to the realization that I'm going to be doing the exact same amount of work regardless of when I start it. That's all.

So why not do work once it is assigned? You can get it done sooner, you're more relaxed while doing it, you can ask the professor when you're stuck (and they'll appreciate fielding questions when an assignment is new, rather than the day before it's due), and you can guarantee yourself a good grade. 

What I would say is that determination, inspiration, motivation -- these words mean nothing. It's nice to have motivation, but it won't last you 4 straight months. The only thing that ever matters in college is discipline. If you can work when you don't want to work and can manage your time accordingly, you'll go far in life. "
10995,"I feel that. I had a lab report due and did it the day before (and the morning of). 

Bad idea. It was 11 pages. "

11002,"Same here! I'm looking at being a math major, and my English course last semester damn near killed me. I did my 7 page final essay in 6 hours the night before it was due and somehow swung an A overall. I'd much rather do 6 straight hours of calculus than English homework."
11003,"This is me. I start the semester off doing my readings (wow), getting ahead in classes, feeling so determined. Nowadays I'm starting my homework 2 hours before it's due. I don't know much about psychology or anything but I would bet it's a symptom of burnout. "

11032,"That just depends on how wealthy/big your school is. Journal subscriptions are very expensive, so those of us at less wealthy schools just get them for free using an interlibrary loan. For digital journals the turnaround time is usually less than 2 days."
11033,"On No. 3 Speak up in class. Engage in discussion. Ask questions if things aren't clear. If the instructor thinks you are trying to learn and understand, or just that you are contributing he might be a little more lenient on grading.

7 yeah If you have a rubric, for heavens sake use it. It lays out what you need. It's a literal checklist that I've seen people just ignore."
11034,I dropped out of college the first time with no intention of coming back so I never actually dropped 3 of my classes which basically ruined my GPA. When I decided to go back years later at a community college I had to get it up to a 3.0 so I could transfer to University. Took 3 semesters of getting straight As. Was pretty tough but I did it and now I'm transferring to University in the fall!
11035,Absolutely agree with this. Doing well early on saves on so much stress later on in the semester/during finals
11036,"To tack on to this 
1. Make sure you understand the notes that you take and not just copy word for word
2. Make sure you get a good nights rest and eat well. It‚Äôs important to take care of your body
3. Take advantage of the programs your school offers and or make appointments for tutoring.

My GPA was a 1.9 after my first year in community college and I raised it to a 3.4. It was not easy and it took me 3 years to correct my grades. I am now transferring to a CSU this fall. I‚Äôll end this by saying that if you‚Äôre struggling right now it is alright to take less classes or even a semester off."
11037,"Agreed. I usually head into finals with all A‚Äôs, and I definitely still have to study and work hard, but it‚Äôs not the panic that my other classmates have who are in danger of failing. I once got a 0 on a final because I messed up the date and missed it, and still got a B in the class, which I can deal with. Its way better to have breathing room during the stressful part of the course instead of during the easy beginning assignments."
11038,"I read the material covered by the proffesor BEFORE class. 

That way when they go over it I can mostly take notes on test info, and I'm able to ask questions about the material while it's fresh on my mind. 

Made a MAJOR difference in my grades."
11039,"Also with human nature it‚Äôs impossible to avoid bias, even a positive bias."
11040,"As a prof. I had some students who were on the cusp of that elusive next letter grade or misunderstood an assignment. Guess who gets leniency or an email asking them to clarifiy or redo an assignment? 

It is always the students who show up to class, ask questions, turn their work in on time, etc."
11041,"Agreed. My boyfriend talks to the professors before/during/after class, goes to office hours, and makes study guides for everything. He gets straight As every semester. Study guides don‚Äôt help me much because it all blurs together and I get anxious trying to talk to professors so I usually end up with a C and a couple Bs with an A in a class I liked."
11042,"Put hard work into the easy part of the class, that makes the hard parts easier. It's ironic but true."
11043,"Ayyy, congrats! That's excellent!"
11044,"Here‚Äôs 3 that I can immediately think of: 

- Looks good on your resume
- makes it more likely you‚Äôll graduate with honors 
- helps your application to law school or other post graduate endeavors. 

People on the deans list at my school also get invited to special events with employers."
11045,"Also, if you have time in your schedule I recommend taking any classes that you‚Äôre confident you would be able to do well in‚Äî elective ‚Äúeasy A‚Äù classes have been a big help for me in boosting my GPA!"
11046,"My GpA is no where near yours but I‚Äôve literally brought my GPA up from 0.0 to 2.8. 
If you‚Äôre not good at keeping a physical planner use the app I studiez pro! I swear by it."
11047,Yeah I think forming good relationships with your professors is super important
11048,Alright I‚Äôve never heard anyone summarize my experience I literally thought I was the only one with anxiety about speaking to professors
11049,It is amazing how prioritizing quality sleep and nutrition helped me.  As it also made me keep on my study schedule.
11050,"Thank you for this! I‚Äôm finishing CC with a gpa similar to your beginning gpa and want to bring it up as high as I possibly can.

I‚Äôm a little anxious and insecure but pumped to get the next semester rolling to make myself work and prove myself wrong!"
11051,Yuuuuuup. We have instructor's discretion and we spend it on students who demonstrate that they care and try.
11052,also if extra credit is offered do it no matter what.
11053,I am sorry you feel that way about higher education. I have not had this experience.
11054,Yes. Having good grade at a community college is better than having bad grades at a community college. The dean's list shows that you have performed well academicaly.
11055,"Also, if there's a small presentation or assignment that you can choose to do early or late in the semester, always do it early. 

For example, some of my biology classes had one student per class presenting a ""plant of the week"", or had 5 options for a field trip and you had to go on at least one of them. Doing it in the first couple weeks means you never have to think about it again."
11056,"No one will question your resilience, fuck me that is a lot of work."
11057,One thing that saved me was i stopped waiting until the week before to start grinding for a test. If you can start grinding two weeks out its a shit load less stress
11058,"Out of curiosity, what does being on things such as the deans list do for you?"
11059,"I did AP and IB in high school so I quickly learned all of these tips and by the time I started college, it was already normal to me. 

I just finished my second semester of college with a 4.0. This is exactly how it‚Äôs done. To add on, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help! Professors are there to help you out and they definitely will if you reach out early enough. Even ask fellow classmates for help. I‚Äôm majoring in something I‚Äôve had background knowledge on so I‚Äôm always helping out my classmates as much as I can so they can succeed too. 

Good luck throughout your future endeavors OP! And congrats on bringing that GPA up!"
11060,"I know this may not help, but they are just people. They have been where you are. Most had bad instructors that they don't want to be. They obviously enjoy their subject area so use that for common ground."
11061,"Here's the biggest tip I can offer: make sure you get all of the free/easy points -- we design our syllabus around them.
Let me explain:

There are generally two competing concerns when evaluating students. Should we be grading for mastery of content? or should we be grading for effort and improvement? Ultimately, both matter, so on any syllabus there are assignments that are meant to gauge mastery and assignments meant to reward effort. Mastery assignments will often be labs, exams, or major essays. Because we want to prepare students for the real world, these are going to graded by a high standard that tells students what the real benchmark for excellence is; i.e. the grading will be hard. 

But we also want students to be rewarded for their hard work and determination, and we realize that not everyone comes from the same high schools with the same degree of preparedness. For this reason, there are parts of the syllabus designed to reward effort. These are usually attendance, participation, small quizzes, and low-stakes assignments. These are all graded easily.

Together, these assignments let professors have it both ways. We can grade you harshly on certain assignments to show you what is essential for mastery of content, but we can also reward you for effort and still allow you to finish with a decent grade because of the easier assignments. 

Why am I telling you this? -- to prevent you from making the same mistake as many students who assume that the small, easy assignments are not worth doing. They lose the free participation/low-stakes assignment points, thinking that they will simply do very well on the larger, mastery based assignments. And then they are shocked when they get their grades back on the major assignments and see that the standard for grading these assignments is high, that they couldn't get an 'A,' and that now their final grade is going to be a 'B,' or even a 'C' because they skipped the easy work.

tl;dr  Get all of the easy points on the syllabus. They are designed to mitigate the tougher grading on major assignments."
11062,"A 3.55 is a good gpa, depending on what you‚Äôre going into. I have that and I‚Äôm in finance. This year coming up i plan on 4.0ing both semesters to bring my gpa up to a 3.7. Judging from what I‚Äôve heard and experience, don‚Äôt skip class, make sure you know your professor knows who you are, and study hard for exams. I speak quite a bit in class, and there has not been one semester in which at least one class hasn‚Äôt been curved for me individually. If they know who you are, you get rounded, etc."
11063,Jokes on you I‚Äôve got a 0 credit lab. (But agreed completely)
11064,"There's a reason behind this (although in practice it's not a very good one).

Back in 1906, someone decided that a credit hour should be equivalent to 3 hours of work by the student, per week of instruction. It was thought that a lecture hour should require approximately 2 hours of work outside class, and therefore one lecture hour per week is equivalent to one credit hour.

It was also thought that labs do not require any additional student work outside the scheduled lab hours, and therefore one credit hour is equivalent to 3-4 lab hours.

For anyone who has actually taken a lab in most modern classes, it's clear that some of those underlying assumptions are fallacious.

If you'd like to read more, you can look up a ""Carnegie Unit"" of instruction."
11065,You spend half the time cleaning or waiting for stuff to heat up. (chem/organic chem labs). Then you screw up your sample and have nothing to work with for a month because the basis of your lab was from a day one sample. Then your lab TA who has a super strong accent scolds you and forces you to write a 10 page report on it =(
11066,"My college did this, in the sense you had to take both the lab and the lecture and the grade was combined, 75% was lecture and 25% was lab"
11067,Yeah. Our chemistry lab is worth one credit at most. Some labs are separate classes but worth none. They require so much work and are so stressful for almost no benefit besides passing it as a requirement.
11068,In some schools that lab is worth 0 credits but you still need to take it.
11069,"See my sibling post on ""Carnegie Units."""
11070,Yeah I honestly find that weird. My uni has it so that both the lab and the lecture are in the same class. So to take the lecture you must also take the lab. It's a bit wild.
11071,Yes. I laughed when I saw my anatomy lab was one credit‚Ä¶
11072,Labs are usually a smaller number of credits because the expectation isn‚Äôt that you do 2-3 hours outside of class for every 1 hour of ‚Äúface time‚Äù like it is for lecture sections.
11073,"Same here. Most science labs are grouped together with the lecture component and graded together (e.g. chem 2 has a lecture and lab component, combined 4 credits). Some classes have a separate lab (I think bio 2's lab is 2 credits)"
11074,r/oddlyspecific
11075,"Many schools have the lecture and lab split up, but taken as co-requisites like you're describing. Not all of them do this...in many places, the lecture and lab are a single ""course."" The advantage of having them be separately numbered courses is that if you fail one, but pass the other, you don't have to repeat as much work."
11076,What is annoying is that sometimes you do end up doing this.
11077,The explanation I heard is that you're not supposed to have to do work outside of the lab. But you're expected to do several hours of work outside of classes.
11078,"Right? Memorized like 100 muscles and their movements, major nerves and what they enervate, and the axial skeleton for one exam. One credit my ass."
11079,"My college made it 4 credits all together so the lecture and lab is combined. 

The only class that is different is organic chemistry. The lecture is 3 while the lab is 2 credits. 

\*this is a community college\*"
11080,"Yeah my school is like that. Luckily, I‚Äôm not a stem student though so I only had to do labs for my music theory classes."
11081,Dissecting stuff is only worth one credit? Jeeeez
11082,"Damn, chill out. 

Sounds like you are a peach of a lab partner. People have infinitly different skills sets, just because you were good at O Chem doesn't mean all others will be, but of course you are not good at everything and someone can be much better than you at something they consider easy. Shaming people for struggling is one of the most asinine things you can do.

 I think you said it best ""well if you suck you suck"" and it is true, but I feel in your outlook on life. 

You suck, suck the joy out conversation or banter."
11083,"I would agree with this if there weren‚Äôt exams in some labs. Granted, there‚Äôs a lot of overlap between the lab coursework and the main course, there‚Äôs still differences so you have to study separately. This was in labs that were 2-3 credits though so that seems fair I guess."
11084,"They‚Äôre not really ‚Äúlabs‚Äù in a traditional sense. Basically, we had music theory lectures and then the labs were just for actually applying what we‚Äôve learned. It involved piano playing, sight reading, dictations, etc."
11085,"This is me but instead of the TA having a super strong accent it's the professor and she laughs at us (in an ""I'm better than you peasant community college students"" type of way) when we make mistakes

Edit: grammar"
11086,Honestly it being 1 credit makes me feel better for getting a B
11087,My orgo lab was 1 credit. And the lab was 3 straight hours every week. On top of all the work outside and the exams we had for it. It suckkkked
11088,"Instrumental methods of analysis for chemistry majors at my school is scheduled as a 1:30-6:00 class once a week.   Yet only 1 credit hour.

Oh and formal lab reports are expected every week, which takes a few hours."
11089,Right?! I sweated blood for that lab. Don‚Äôt get me started on the STENCH of the cadavers/specimens‚Ä¶
11090,"This is what all labs are.  Actually applying what you learned.  It can be in a test tube, in a design, in a workshop etc."
11091,What happens in a music theory lab?
11092,YES. 3 hours of my life for a stupid experiment when my lecture is also 3 hours spread throughout the week. I‚Äôm there for the same amount of time but only get 1/3 of the credits?
11093,"Happy cake day, Prof!"
11094,\^This.  I'll be more interested in the course overall if the prof shows interest in the material rather than just giving off the vibe that he/she is just gonna read off lecture slides.
11095,[deleted]
11096,I would also wake up if I heard a professor say ecstasy is cool
11097,My bio professor does the same thing.
11098,"Keep on Dorking, it means a ton these days"
11099,"Normally I hate it when professors do this, but I‚Äôd kill for my math prof to baby us a bit. He apparently thinks we‚Äôre all mathematical geniuses capable of keeping up with his rapid-fire lectures and it‚Äôs stressful af. He‚Äôs onto the next topic the second he finishes rushing through a problem and my head spins trying to keep up."
11100,"Same, my religion prof announces when he is totally going to geek out over a topic and does not disappoint lol"
11101,Honestly professor enthusiasm is one of my favorite things.
11102,"When you geek out over your subject matter, we geek out too! It‚Äôs very engaging!"
11103,"Dude yes! If a professor says something is cool, and they‚Äôre visibly genuinely enthusiastic about what they are teaching, that trumps almost every shortcoming in lecture style for me. Because if they‚Äôre engaged, I want to know whats so cool and how it is applied."
11104,Happy Cake day
11105,"My Korean professor got super excited to show us how to make emojis using Hangul today and it made my week :)

Your efforts are appreciated!"
11106,Same with me when my professor says that some specific types of cell appear in different ‚Äúflavors‚Äù
11107,"I smile when I realize I get to say it, and I smile when I say it.

And that's because I only say it when I mean it."
11108,"I genuinely enjoy in particular when a sociology instructor mentions that something is cool or an unusual thing that has developed recently and engages with the class and makes it sort of course material. I had an entire sociology course where the professor guided the conversation with the reading topics but related it to things like house hunting, music even, internet culture. She was my favorite professor and I feel like I learned and appreciated the discipline in that time."
11109,"Totally agree. My Calc 3 prof is awesome, talking about all the math tools we're learning, saying stuff during lectures like, ""this is a *nice*, versatile tool to do x or y! "" or ""look at that pattern, it's beautiful!"" He changed everything I thought about math before I took this class. I gotta thank him after this quarter.

edit: watching a lecture of his today. He always talks about the math we're doing like ""let's play this game"" or ""that's the story"" as if math isn't just writing numbers down on paper, rather it's an art form like anything else and it can be fun, too."
11110,This was my first thought lol
11111,I‚Äôm currently taking a mind-crushingly boring class that‚Äôs a requirement for my major. The professor‚Äôs obvious enthusiasm and passion for the subject is the only thing that makes it bearable. Seeing her so enthusiastic makes me want to try to see things from her perspective instead of just zoning out doing the bare minimum to get my A.
11112,"I once woke up to a professor saying ""and that is how you make meth."" Unfortunately I had really been asleep before that... Damn 8am classes..."
11113,"same! idk but something about passionate people talking about their favorite things, may it be academic stuff or not, really just warms my heart."
11114,"My history teacher is a literal history fanboy (his words, not mine). It's always fun listening to him ramble about what he's passionate about :))"
11115,"Add context - your prof is struggling, just as you are.  It just looks different and from the instructor on the other end of the screen, it‚Äôs a beast teaching to a blank computer!  üòâ"
11116,"I concluded this, I appreciate your opinion very much though!"
11117,Yess I get so much more into it when I know professors are excited to teach it
11118,Yeah I love when proessors know what you're talknig about when talknig about geek stuff.
11119,"lol also ""This will be on the test"""
11120,"It gives me a reason to give a shit about the class. Struggling wirh my OOP class (CS) right now for this reason. The topic interests me, but the professor is monotone, no slides, talks w/ no questions or interactions in the lecture. I would love some slides to look at or something."
11121,I always love when I see a Professor get excited about a topic. It makes the course more interesting and me more excited to learn
11122,"prof here, we love hearing this.

also, we get how hard a year you just had (I had one too). hang in there guys"

11126,The only calc class I ever understood ‚Äúmost‚Äù of was calc 1 and even then it was hard.
11127,"Thanks, and please don't even think of retaking algebra if you get a low grade, unless you're confident enough. Don't be a retard like me. It's too stressful"
11128,Wow I am jealous üôÇ
11129,tf 91%? Hope it's online then xd

11136,"Yeah, we are working with vectors currently, and I have very little experience with them in general."

11145,"If you ever took physics in high school, calculus based physics should not be that different. You're taking calculus and applying it to the same concepts from physics. Calculus was literally made for physics."
11146,W
11147,LETS GOOOO
11148,Congrats. Currently on Calc3 and it is stressing me out ü•≤
11149,"Amen. Physics is on a whole new level conceptually. Plus online resources are extremely scant relative to Calculus and at least in my school, there are no support/tutoring servicez for it unlike Calculus."
11150,"Probably because most people taking algebra in college never passed it in high school, hence they're not as great with math. Compared to someone who passed and took higher level math classes in high school and then went to calc in college.

I.E. Most people taking algebra in college are probably not great at math."

I am so fucking serious there was a line of 20 people outside this professors door one time and this one kid everyone knew about was in there trying to get brownie points with the professor. I ended up never being able to use office hours for that class. "
11156,"""Professor, I know this is an art course, but I'd like to take this time to ask you about your views on socialism.""

There's almost always at least one kid per semester that tries to gravitate the lecture to politics. No clue why."

11158,I do like the kid who answers the questions tho. Especially in a class that has a lot of participation...I'll just sit there and zone out. Lol
11159,"I appreciate the crap out of profs who will shut these kids up.    

There was one girl that I had in a few classes (intro classes that had to be taken in sequence, so a lot of people ended up in a few classes over a few sems). There was one prof who shut her up, but it was the second time he had her in a class. It took toooooo long"

11168,Oh I guarantee it 
11169,I remember a guy some years ago who would mouth off and thought he was hot shit.  There was a presentation where business attire was mandatory and he just showed up in a t-shirt because he thought it didn't matter.  He wasn't allowed to do his presentation.  I hope he got a zero but he probably turned in his work and got partial credit.
11170,"Maybe. Sometimes people want a tiny bit of privacy when talking about their work and their courses, so your presence during the entire time either makes things very uncomfortable for others, or it just straight up prevents them from attending. They're not likely to say ""no, I need you to leave"". Imagine going to the trouble of attending office hours, hoping to catch just a few minutes to talk about your grades, and then finding out you'll have to organise a separate time because one kid just refuses to leave the room. 

I would never stay in my supervisor's office without having a question for them. There are other conversations he needs to have that I have no right to listen to. There is work he needs to mark that I have no right to see. Professors cannot (under regular circumstances) close the door of their office if a student is in there, so the door being open doesn't mean that discussions are public. "

11172,"I dealt with that kid in high school AND college. Seriously, small town with liberal arts colleges, at least half the students went to one or the other. This guy thought he was such hot shit in high school and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else speak, or would speak over them when he disagreed. Fast forward to senior year of undergrad, we happen to be in the same non-major course together. He starts debating (over a question that the answer was right in front of us in our textbook). The professor let it happen and then responded with, ‚Äúwould anyone else like a chance to speak on this topic since we got a lengthy, and incorrect, response from a peer.‚Äù DON‚ÄôT be that person, please. "
11173,"My worst is the kid who asks a question along the lines of what the professor just explained. ""So 2 plus 3 equals 5, and this is why.....""

30 seconds later,

""Wait why does 2 plus 3 equal 5?"""
11174,I was in a small class and the prof actually seemed kind of sad and desperate for people to come because no one did. She even told people to come if they just wanted to discuss random stuff. I probably should've taken her up on the offer but I didn't need help with anything and couldn't be bothered. :(
11175,[deleted]
11176,"I can understand that you're in a tough spot, but you have to see that that behaviour can be problematic for other people. Some students just aren't going to want you there whilst they're asking about the course content. 

You can say that you asked them if it was okay or that you were happy to leave if they'd told you to, but that's just paying lip service to the problem. There are so many students here anxious over what they'll wear to class, how they're supposed to say hello to someone, and how office hours are even supposed to work. You can't reasonably expect them to stand in front of you and the professor and directly ask you to leave. It's a very confronting experience for someone who is so private they don't want you there to begin with. 

Yeah, they should probably organise a separate time, but if their question will only take 30 seconds then it'd be nice for them to be able to slip in and out without needing to go through that rigmarole. Office hours are also not usually just for your class and not just for your work. They are a promise that the professor will be in their office, for *anyone* to talk to.

You usually share that time with all years, all courses, all graduates, and also all faculty. If that time was truly like another class then it's a different case and can't really be discussed as ""office hours"". "
11177,"Let me go for a Counterpoint. I have been a professor and a student. During my studentship I was one who spoke a lot in class. I know for a fact it annoyed some students. But I paid a lot of money to get all I could out of those classes, and what may have appeared to some as me just wanting to hear the sound of my own voice was really me filling in the gaps in my own knowledge and bouncing ideas off of an expert. Instead of worrying about what other students do and how other students look in class, try and get as much as you can out of class. If the outspoken student is ruining that, that is one thing and is worth addressing either to the student or prof. But generally in my experience this is not the case, and quieter students are odten either shy, unprepared, or not willing to put themselves out there, which isn't helpful anymore than it is helpful for someone to interrupt with trivial stuff all the time.  "
11178,Politics have been especially touchy on college campuses since the start of the 2016 election. Which side of the aisle is more prevalent among the students and faculty depends entirely on the school and location. 
11179,There was always that one kid who would ask the nutrition professor if rolling their own tobacco makes it safe. And goes into specfic detail to argue about why it‚Äôs safe. With a dietician.
11180,"I wish this could be announced at the beginning of every lecture without discouraging students with real questions to raise their hand. It is so disruptive and annoying. Yes, we know you're smart on this topic. But nobody cares. We're here to learn about the material and the professor is here to teach it; not to awe in your knowledge.  
"
11181,I always end up sitting behind the sociology major who's the class bobblehead. Nodding and shaking her head with loud grunts of agreement or disagreement depending on the lecture. 
11182,"Shit that's me

&#x200B;"
11183,"My school gave quite a bit of that money to students based on their credit hours.

Haven't seen a detailed report on how all of it was handled or how much of it actually went to students, but I ended up with like $750 from it, which was a great surprise considering I didn't expect to see a penny of it."
11184,">Half of it goes to financial aid for students.

I know that this was the case for the CARES Act, but I'm not sure if this will be the case for this bill. Do you have any sources for that or a reference from the bill itself?"
11185,"Well, my problem is that these colleges started operating like corporations. Now they are too far leveraged out. They also were financial predators of students. So, in my POV, fuck the Unis that don't survive, and fuck the ones that are surviving. They should only be getting money that will go towards the student's financial aid. They have been taking advantage of students for decades now and they need to be put on a short leash."
11186,Same. Mine did a flat $500 for every enrolled student regardless of PT/FT to make it even. That was nice.
11187,I'm not opposed to the meals at all! But putting the athletes up in private hotel rooms when my school took away scholarships from all of the students who had to move to online-only classes really pisses me off.
11188,"Very much depends on the school, mine hasn't dispersed their initial CARES act funding. They say that they have reduced cost by X amount, but it didn't show up on anyone's tuition bills this semester, so nobody really knows where the money went..."
11189,[deleted]
11190,My school used it to give all work study students their work study salary even if they did not find an online job. They did that for both the Fall and Spring semesters.
11191,"This is a situation where it would behoove you to go and learn a little bit before you vent. I‚Äôm trying to be very patient here, but your perspective is both naive and uninformed. 

Why do they need help? Because no one‚Äôs staying in the dorms or using meal plans, so the uni‚Äôs refund that money. Meanwhile they‚Äôre still paying taxes and upkeep on those dorms, so they‚Äôre losing a ton of money. Meanwhile enrollment is down, so they‚Äôre losing a ton of money. Meanwhile donations are down, because the economy is bad, so they‚Äôre losing a ton of money. Meanwhile they still have to pay their full time staff and their benefits, so they‚Äôre losing a ton of money. Meanwhile states are cutting their budgets, which means less money to the colleges, so they‚Äôre losing a ton of money. Meanwhile financial aid needs have gone up, so they‚Äôre losing a ton of money. Meanwhile they have to pay for covid testing, and new tracing protocols, and new pandemic training, and new online platforms - you don‚Äôt think zoom is free, do you? - so they‚Äôre losing a ton of money. I could go on. 

Textbooks are not a significant source of university revenue; in fact, at most places (like my current uni) they‚Äôre subsidized by the college and so actually cost money. Unis do not buy tech just to show ‚Äúidk, stuff.‚Äù 

I understand that you‚Äôre frustrated, and no ones ever been happy to hear this, but you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about."
11192,Then you should read what the bill actually says as well as the comments people are making here. Sounds like money is actually being provided to students at some places.
11193,"A lot of the power-5 schools are kinda disgusting with how they spend money to pamper their revenue sport athletes.  Consistently going into the red competing with other schools to offer the greatest and newest facilities, locker rooms, etc. to attract athletes all while they cut non-revenue sports without blinking an eye.  Really grinds my gears (as a non-revenue sport college athlete lol)"
11194,"In the first package my school bought a new online learning system (we were using a low end cheap one before). I‚Äôm guessing you will see lots of things bought related to online learning, covid saftey, and student retention efforts."
11195,"Haha wat. You guys are getting paid?

Seriously though, I go to a public school and I don't think we have anything like this. The closest trying was a $1000 relief fund you had to apply for."
11196,"In the first package in spring my school gave us the work-study cash we should have gotten after we were let go from our campus jobs early, which was like $400. We also had to fill out paperwork describing how covid impacted our college plans to get like $400 tuition relief

They turned around and sent out an email to everyone asking us to consider donating our first stimulus check to keep the school open..that didnt go over well.

They told us this fall though they didnt have the money for spring 2021 work-study so a lot of us have to go off-campus for jobs in january"
11197,"I‚Äôve gotten up to 1500 from cares act funds and I go to a large public university. I‚Äôm hoping I can get that again. But yeah, this is good news. Make sure to keep up with your schools financial aid office to see how you can apply for your piece of the cares act!! Make sure you have financial aid on file too."
11198,"I‚Äôm not exactly sure, but I know that many universities are hurting financially now because of fewer students + reduced government funding + not being able to hold in person events like sports and those issues are causing some schools to be very strained to just pay faculty and operate. Online classes are also expensive since schools have to ensure that students and teachers have the technology they need to make it work. My best guess is that this is going to mostly just keep people on payroll and stop some schools from going under entirely rather than aid students that much, but I could be wrong."
11199,Student union buildings (no one asked for) and football courts. Duh.
11200,"Every college and university I know of has already taken pay cuts, some above 80k, most above 100k, all above 200k. They‚Äôve also cut retirement benefits for anyone making over a certain amount, frozen raises, and are furloughing everyone. They‚Äôve stopped hiring anyone and laid off people, including adjuncts. It‚Äôs not enough. You‚Äôre radically ignorant of how the pandemic has affected schools. The budget gaps are enormous, everywhere from small CCs to elite institutions. It has nothing - nothing at all - to do with over extension. You should learn something, anything, about uni finances before you opine about them. 

And we‚Äôre not talking about churches or corporations here; don‚Äôt change the subject."
11201,"I got 1,150 from mine in October which suprised me cus I didn't know they were distributing any money then"
11202,"The money not going to cover budget losses - which were inevitable in a pandemic and not due to over extensions - would mean working class people losing their jobs. Unis closing would likewise. And if you think the guy who stocks the vending machine is exploiting you, you‚Äôre not an intellectually serious person."
11203,This should be a *ONE PAGE BILL* that helps American citizens who were hurt financially due to Covid; everything else should go into a separate omnibus spending bill. Congress is a joke.
11204,"Its federal money for student aid. That's why it is tied to student aid, and not all students. Idk what you are learning there if that basic fact escapes you. 

Fed aid is based on need hence why you get it. But way to shit on someone less privileged by birth to live where INDIGENOUS PEOPLES LIVED prior to the government whose handout you just took displacing them and calling them illegal. Ass wipe."
11205,This is incorrect information. [(Source)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.borderreport.com/health/coronavirus/exempting-dreamers-from-university-stimulus-funds-could-impact-families-and-not-intent-of-congress-lawmakers-say/amp/)
11206,It actually has to be spent things for students. Its not a free fund for anything.
11207,"Why do they need so much help in the first place?
From my perspective, most Unis have used students as piggy banks to increase their advantage in the marketplace. Buy more land, build newer buildings. Buy a bunch of technology nobody needs, like flat screen tvs all over to show, IDK, stuff. All apple computers, a projector system that is super advanced that doesn't work. And the list probably goes longer. Likely in the realm of textbooks."
11208,Last semester was covered by my school from the first stimulus. They wiped a ton of students tuition that did not have any type of aid. I had to call them because I thought it was an error. I can't speak for any of the funds elsewhere or about this bill. I can say in confidence that my school did good by a lot of students last go around.
11209,^ This. My school sent a check out to any students eligible (not sure what the eligibility was) for about $750. Was pretty nice considering students didn't receive the initial stimulus check and I heard we're not getting anything this time either.
11210,"These are students/kids we're talking about here. They're trying to better themselves and I personally think that's worthy of some support. Also have to consider the fact that the current admin hasn't exactly been kind or fair to DACA recipients.

Edit: Typo meant to say hasn't instead of has"
11211,"You're very bad at reading my points. I never said people should lose their jobs. But, if they had jobs based on exploiting students, then maybe they shouldn't be doing those jobs in the first place."
11212,"You both have valid perspectives.

When I saw the correlation between the average sizes of Universities' Administration staff and the cost of tuition, it was eye-opening also. There's also a correlation between the rise in the cost of tuition and the state-subsidizing of student loans.

Universities need to be more fiscally responsible. There's a lot of administrative bloat. How did colleges and universities survive 40 years ago?"
11213,"Ah, yes. That's usually when I have to go to the bathroom and cool down. I hate blushing, especially in public. In reality, nobody will remember that you blushed by the end of the day.

Edit: also, I would say nobody will remember the joke tomorrow unless it stood out to them as funny. 
Idk about you but I read or hear things that are flipping hilarious, but I don't react outwardly except maybe a smirk. I just feel the bubbles of laughter (without actually laughing) in my chest and if it's funny enough, it'll stick with me and I'll tell someone else about the funny thing.
When I say things openly like that, I feel embarrassed but then I tell myself that someone in this room gets me lol"
11214,Congrats on going out of going out of your comfort zone and succeeding in your field!!!
11215,"Same, man. I was the quite kid in highschool and hated talking to people. Now I'm a therapist. My career is nothing but talking to people. It's been such a liberating transformation. Keep it up!"
11216,"I would say it's a bit stressful at first. At the end of the day after being a ""social butterfly,"" I would feel mentally and emotionally exhausted. I found it important and helpful to give myself a couple of hours of me-time at the end of a day like that"
11217,Literally the reason why I joined my college's speech and debate team. My confidence has skyrocketed. Good to see putting yourself out there has also worked for you!
11218,"I cured it by really facing it. Over and over. I consistently, over a course of a few years, put myself out of my comfort zone. I learned to laugh at myself about the embarrassing things. I actively pushed myself to change my mentality and I had a vision of myself that I wanted to reach.

I got jobs that required me to talk to people a lot, one in a sales environment, and one at a hotel, which is a hospitality people-pleasing environment. 

But I learned quickly that it is important, since I'm naturally introverted still to this day, to allow myself me-time. A few hours in the morning or evening to just avoid tf outta people and decompress.

Keep in mind, I'm not a professional and I've never seen a professional (too expensive for me). I'm sure there are professionals with better advice or tactics than what I have done.However I think any professional could agree that change takes time.
 
Baby steps, don't push yourself to the point of breaking, be patient with yourself, and be proud of every achievement, even if it's as small as ""Hell yeah! I ordered the shit out of that food"" (my social anxiety made even ordering food difficult lol)

Edit: Correction, I didn't ""cure"" myself. There was nothing to cure. I just pushed myself to a healthier mentality and to be the best version of myself"
11219,"How bad is the first time? Going outside your comfort zone, approaching someone and talking to them?"
11220,"As a person with social anxiety, please tell me how you over came it or what you did to make it better?"
11221,Thank you!
11222,Me too. üòä When I started college I had horrible social anxiety & completely avoided classes that required a presentation or class participation. Until I decided I wanted to go to grad school. Now I‚Äôm a college prof & talk in front of people for hours at a time. But it took a lot of pushing my comfort zone in little steps. Worth it!
11223,Omg I had a similar experience!
11224,Hell yeah! I hope you're proud of yourself
11225,That‚Äôs when I follow it up with another joke I know will be funny. If they‚Äôre too busy laughing now who cares if u bombed a second ago.
11226,That's freaking awesome üëç
11227,I love this so much. Way to go üòÑ
11228,Good for you!
11229,Yessss! That's what I'm worst at to this day so props to you
11230,My journalism/public relations class taught me about headlines ;) (got you! Haha) and storytelling. Good class! I suggest it if you ever get the chance
11231,"Fake it till you make it. In my early presentations I would try to adopt the mindset that I‚Äôm the teacher for the next 5 minutes, because really, who else in the room researched this topic. And then I would ‚Äúchannel‚Äù my favorite professor - how would Dr So&So teach this? Didn‚Äôt make the anxiety go away, but pretending to be confident made the anxiety less obvious & that helped my confidence."
11232,This was inspiring. Thank you!!!
11233,[deleted]
11234,Yo im so happy sucking balls was not what I was expecting. Thank common sense that this was not one of those posts. Good on you with that pitch though.
11235,"Man, I should use that dad joke next time I have an in-class presentation! 

I'm glad we're both attempting to get better at handling social anxiety. I had a PR/News conference presentation Monday and I patted myself on the back for not immediately crying afterwards (a situation which happened my first year of college during a speech class)

Every day isn't easy, but we got this!"
11236,Headline made me neck snap back lol
11237,My face when I read the title vs. what when I finished reading the post is a complete 360¬∞ difference lol. This was a great share and speaking as someone with social anxiety i love your tips.
11238,Hmmmm maybe I'll take off my glasses for my speech class.
11239,[deleted]
11240,"Wait, maybe I'm missing something but, why did this need to be ""approved""?"
11241,Thank you :)
11242,"Indeed we do :) lol I warn you though, that dad joke didn't go very well. I couldn't really see their reactions since my glasses were not on my face but it was dead silent lmao I'm pretty sure they all wanted to strangle me for how bad it was, but I think it's hilarious thinking about how many people I made cringe with a bad dad joke.

Those speech classes are brutal but good practice. I do a lot of speeches and presentations as a Communication major. Definitely not easy.

Baby steps! I give you a pat on the back too. That's awesome"
11243,"This is the first semester out of the past 3 years that I'm going to fail a class. Not only that, but I'm going to fail multiple classes. This semester was a nightmare. Every day of homework and classes made me feel like I was on the verge of a panic attack. I've never received anything less than a B, and now I'm failing 3 out of 4 classes.

This semester fucking sucks...

edit: Just a few hours ago, my uni extended the withdrawal deadline for the Fall Term, so I was able to change those 3 F's into 3 W's. Words cannot describe how much of a relief it is now to not be failing, and also not have to take finals.

I'm switching majors."
11244,"Everything will be ok if I just

‚Ä¢find all the motivation that left me

‚Ä¢catch up somehow

‚Ä¢don't need sleep

‚Ä¢lower my standards

‚Ä¢get a time machine and a personal assistant"
11245,"I‚Äôve never really failed a class myself, I‚Äôm literally at the point you‚Äôre at and the feelings are awful I know what you mean man. Stay strong we can do it!"
11246,I'm failing two classes right now. I've never failed a class.
11247,"Honestly these connections, small as they are, are probably how we're gonna make it through this"
11248,I know at least 2 people and myself have felt similarly. Don't be so hard on yourself. There were things out of your control this semester that affected your motivation and ability to get things done. You can't do anything to change your past grades but you can finish strong. Just keep doing the next right thing.
11249,I'm just glad that my last final was today and I'm all done with school.
11250,In like 5 years that won‚Äôt even matter. Try your best to take care of yourself and most importantly give yourself time. Whenever you finish you‚Äôll be great at what you set out to do!
11251,"Just saw that I posted wrong format of file(word instead of pdf) so I got 0 marks for an assignment which took 3 days to complete and then there is surprise quiz tomorrow which will be added in our cgpa.
Man it sucks.

Update-Turns out it was just a mistake and only my assignment was checked and graded. Im not sure it will be checked again but she told me to resubmit it.
Hope it does and only way to find out is by waiting."
11252,"It does, indeed, suck. I realized today I've failed statistics for the second semester in a row. Like I failed so bad that even if I get a 100% on the final I will **still** fail. Something about this semester sapped my motivation like nothing else, but then again I have had apathy issues for the last year or so. Worse within the last few months, tbh. So the fucked up thing is that I care that I failed but I also kinda *don't* in this odd, emotionally detached kind of way.

So, it do be rough. It do be that way, sometimes. All you can do is analyze what went wrong, decide on potential fixes, and then resolve to do better next semester. That's my consolation to myself and so it's the only real piece of advice I can give you."
11253,"You're not the only one. My motivation to do assignments and study has been pretty much shot this entire semester. With my awful study habits and using my phone too much, I've been doing awful in my classes. Also, pretty much everyone I've talked to has been having the same issues you've been having. So you are definitely not alone."
11254,"Same. This semester has taken a toll on my mental health. This was the first semester I started getting into the difficult classes in my major and I felt that the workload and lack of structure was too much. I felt so lethargic and anxious thinking about schoolwork and my grades tanked a lot. I‚Äôve never failed a class either and seeing my grades rn makes me feel horrible. :,)"
11255,[deleted]
11256,same mine is tomorrow then i'll be done for the sem
11257,"It's such an odd feeling, isn't it? Looking at something knowing you should care but you *don't*?

Like, ngl, I still care a little. It bothers me, obviously, otherwise I wouldn't be posting here. But that went away really quickly and faded into that emotional detachment.

Thanks fuck I will pass every other class, otherwise I'd be pretty pissed."
11258,"I relate so hard to the emotional detachment part, I‚Äôve felt this same exact way."
11259,"I can completely relate. Before the pandemic struck I was traveling with a club at my university, getting good grades, coming out of my shell, and overall THRIVING. Now, I‚Äôm flunking a class and I already dropped another. I‚Äôve been struggling since we went online and being at home hasn‚Äôt helped when everyone else is caught up in their own mess. I‚Äôve lost motivation, but I‚Äôm at least trying to re-discipline myself.... I‚Äôll have to try again next semester for that though. I‚Äôll be on campus next semester so hopefully it‚Äôll be better for me in terms of academics and having my own space to myself. I‚Äôve kind of gotten over being emotional towards my grades and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúdamn... okay.‚Äù"
11260,"Definitely, I have three writing assignments, 2 of them being essays due this weekend. Next weekend, I have another 2 due, and by Dec 15th, I have 2 final papers due lol. These coming weeks will be an endless barrage, no breathers, but I feel like if I were in a normal semester, I‚Äôd be able to handle it better since I‚Äôd have paid attention more carefully, but it‚Äôs almost like I have to rewatch all lectures and re-learn information for my classes lol"
11261,You got this homie
11262,Yeah I‚Äôve been crying everyday.
11263,I'm in my final semester ever and I honestly have to say I've never been this mentally drained before. Stay strong! We will get through this üí™
11264,I‚Äôm a prof and I feel this way
11265,I have gotten lazy and have lost motivation and have been in a slump. And some days I just stress about the slump and how I‚Äôm falling behind but am having a hard time finding the motivation to break these bad habits
11266,Did you ask if you could resubmit it? I completely missed a part of an assignment recently and didn't realize it until after it was graded. Prof let me fix it and resubmit. It's worth asking.
11267,Thanks I needed to hear that.
11268,"Honestly just existing in the world is hard right now. Sometimes it feels like a personal problem, but the reality is stress and misery is everywhere I look right now. Even though I‚Äôm in a personally decent situation it‚Äôs still incredibly stressful just to witness all of this. Turns out living through a deadly pandemic - and all kinds of political turmoil in the US, where I‚Äôm from - really sucks. It‚Äôs been a long time since I could get on any social media site or turn on the news without reading constant upsetting shit."
11269,Studying for a final you know your gonna fail is ass
11270,"It has fucking sucked. I think I'm gonna fail a course for the first time this sem too.. feel awful thinking about it. But there are lessons to be learnt from the experience, it's all part of the process. Don't be afraid to seek help !"
11271,"Yup, got some of the worst grades I ever got."
11272,Nah bro shits same thing different day
11273,"Mind you, we are taking this in person as well. So we are being proctored by webcam and in person."
11274,Nahh y'all need to take this to someone higher up. This is ridiculous.
11275,Yeah I fail to see how this is a helpful policy at all
11276,That‚Äôs really weird because I mouth a lot of words noiselessly during exams. It helps and I wouldn‚Äôt be happy if they didn‚Äôt let me
11277,">If you need to eat something, that is fine but chew with your mouth closed

But you have to open your mouth to ingest the food in the first place‚Ä¶

Also eating and drinking are exceptions but a cough or sneeze aren‚Äôt?"
11278,I cover my mouth when I think so I‚Äôd be fucked
11279,I was lowkey thinking about having a conversation with the dean about this policy
11280,Everyone's going to be preoccupied trying to avoid common absent-minded gestures and do worse on the exam.  A classroom inhospital to humans.  People are not machines you can program to your will.
11281,When I saw webcam- I was like oh that makes sense because you can cover your mouth and could talk but then you said AND in person‚Ä¶ makes no sense why it has to be so strict
11282,All this for in person. Prof is a right cunt with this bs. I could just barley understand it if it was online; but for in person this is fucking ridiculous.
11283,This is fucking dumb. How tf are you supposed to breathe? What about people who talk to themselves while taking exams???
11284,Please do that. And then update us!!
11285,"Uh, no. I'm a professor, and this is *insanity.* There is NO 'previous cheating scenario' which could justify this level of surveillance-state madness. If professors cannot give tests without acting like unhinged baby-fascist tyrants, they need to find some other way to assess student learning. If I had ever been asked to submit to such a ludicrous policy as a student, I'd have been in the dean's office filing a (successful, I'm sure) complaint within 45 seconds or less. Because this is *appalling.*

We are not running a Panopticon. Our students are neither Victorian-era felons *nor* contestants in the Hunger Games. 

This instructor needs to CALM THE FORK DOWN or find a new career. Immediately."
11286,Maybe you're supposed to store the food in your mouth like a squirrel until you get hungry.
11287,this is not an exam policy this is an attack on mouth breathers. your professor is targeting someone. you comrades need to keep them safe. see you in the exam room soldier
11288,"Go to the department head first, ideally with as big a group of students as possible/with names you can tell them of people who concur"
11289,"That‚Äôs illegal to an extent‚Ä¶ people have the right to wear a face covering too. As someone at higher risk, that‚Äôs ridiculous"
11290,"During the exam a voice rings out saying ‚ÄúQuestion 8 has no correct answer, the instructor must of been drunk while typing up the exam!‚Äù Unbeknownst to the instructor student Q has a hidden talent as a ventriloquist. And used an opposite gender voice with an Ethiopian  accent.  No one in class is Ethiopian. Twenty students get a zero on the exam due to covering their mouths while laughing. The resulting uproar over the grading results in the instructor being fired. All the students are regraded and pass the course. To this day no one had admitted to being the culprit."
11291,Me too! Or when I get stressed or overwhelmed. I‚Äôm constantly putting my hair over my mouth or my shirt. It comforts me and I dont know why ü§£ü§£
11292,Maybe the prof added this after a student read questions out loud and someone off camera looked up the answer and somehow communicated back to them what to answer.
11293,"This could potentially become an ADA issue, there are so many different kinds of disabilities that would require an official accommodation for this kind of policy which is a terrible burden to place on students."
11294,"I can understand not wanting specific things during a test or exam to reduce cheating, but this seems really excessive and way too strict. I‚Äôve never had a policy like this, nor have I seen anything like it."
11295,"This is extreme. It is indefensible no matter the reason it was implemented. Rewrite the test, or make it on-demand during class."
11296,This is laughably unenforcable. Talk to the obundsman and department head.
11297,My thoughts exactly
11298,"My bet was that it was online and that the prof had had someone cheat by having someone stand on the other side of their computer and then read the questions aloud to them, then that person looked up and answers and replied back, and that this policy was in direct response to that situation happening. The fact that this is an in person policy is absolutely bonkers. 

Also the fact that apparently a prof this strict hasn‚Äôt encountered a student cheating my writing stuff on their drink‚Äôs label is hilarious."
11299,Most schools allow masking and say it‚Äôs for Covid. If they argue that their rule over trumps disease prevention then report it. If it‚Äôs in the school policy mask are allowed even better if the say encouraged. Have classmates wear them in his class.
11300,"That might make sense if it wasn't an in person proctored exam. For in person, that's just ridiculous"
11301,"It's always C-tier professors who come up with these ridiculous rules, require cameras, so on and so on, all because they can't teach or design exams to save their lives. Hopefully more and more of them get fired."
11302,"I have a deviated septum and can't nose breathe well üòÇgranted not I'm a ""mouth breather"" huffing and puffing but I breathe through pursed lips when stressed"
11303,"Now, that‚Äôs not nearly as fun."
11304,Proof that getting into college doesn't mean you're intelligent

11332,My dude has 8 ability score in int and wis
11333,"I accidentally slept through my midterm somehow and emailed my prof asking what I can do now. We already had the choice to do the midterm with our final but we had to let the prof know by a certain time which I obviously didn‚Äôt. He emailed back saying that I could do the midterm with my final but there would be a penalty, which of course is reasonable. The penalty he decided was that 8 of the 25% the exam is worth goes to zero. I replied saying ‚Äúthank you for being understanding‚Äù and the image attached is what he emailed back and I‚Äôm confused now.

Update: my prof emailed me back recently and decided to not give me a penalty after all (something to do with the syllabus), so I will just be writing my midterm with my final without 8% of my grade amounting to zero. I‚Äôm super grateful, and I thank you all for helping me understand my profs email (my brain wasn‚Äôt working this morning). I‚Äôm confused on how this post got this many upvotes"
11334,Great job explaining  this.
11335,"He‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs gonna give you a penalty equal to 8% of the overall course. (from the 25% that the exam makes up) You though it was 8% of this 25%, which equals 2% of the overall course."
11336,"The penalty is 8% of 100% of the course overall, not 8% of 25% of the course overall which is what the exam is worth."
11337,"dam u a genius. Here, take my free award"
11338,Are you a professor yourself? Feels like this is the equivalent of doctor‚Äôs handwriting
11339,"To further explain, he wanted you to be more upset and you saying ""thank you for your understanding"" and not begging and pleading with him for less of a penalty made him send the follow up.

Unless more transpired than you're saying"
11340,This is how I read it as well. Taking the 8% class penalty out of the exam score means that you'd lose about one-third of the exam points to the penalty.
11341,It means he‚Äôs docking you a flat -8% on your final grade for the entire course
11342,"Weird he would say I think you misunderstand instead of ""just to clarify"" or something like that. Comes off a little aggressive I feel"
11343,"My guess would be that this isn‚Äôt the first or second time something like this has happened and the response was more in line with someone who previously thought it would just be 8% off the final rather than 8% off the class. He just doesn‚Äôt want the fight at the end of the semester. 

So, less wanting OP to be upset and more concerned that OP didn‚Äôt understand the reality."
11344,"8 of the percentage points I would say. But you know, you should be allowed to write it how you like. I personally don't approve of enforcing grammatical rules like a fascist... You know, it's not like my username is based on a grammatical correction or something."
11345,Your schools policies aren't universal. How is it unreasonable for someone's grade to be penalized when they slept through an exam?
11346,Basically you‚Äôre taking 8% off your final grade for the course.
11347,"Gotta disagree here. Frankly, offering up any alternative for simply missing an exam is already being generous. The ""normal"" way to go about dealing with this would be to simply assign a zero and move on. 

I'm assuming here that the midterm was worth more than 8% of the course grading."
11348,free award my guy. Haven't bought reddit coins once üòÖ
11349,He comes off as a jerk from this message especially since he gave people the option to take the exam later
11350,"Same, this totally deserves a free award!"
11351,Missing the midterm will cause him to lose most of a letter grade. FTFY
11352,Who the fuck has notifications on for upvotes
11353,"The exam is worth 25% of your total grade for the course.  The 8% refers to 8% of your total grade for the course, not 8% of the exam.  Whoever receives this 8% penalty will lose 8 points off of their final grade for the entire course."
11354,"You‚Äôre going to need to figure out how to wake up on time. ‚ÄúI set ten alarms but somehow slept through them all, whoops!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut it in the real world. Thanks for coming in, but we‚Äôre going to find someone else who can be consistent."
11355,i hate when prof and teachers at my highschool emailed and used .....
11356,Depends on the transgression. And on what it says in the syllabus.
11357,[deleted]
11358,"Maybe putting it in a different way will help.

The highest you can get in the course with a 0 on the exam would, under the previous scale, be a 75. The exam was worth the other 25. Your professor is going to take 8 of those 25 points away because of your retest. 8% or 8 points off of your total grade, but that 8 comes specifically out of the 25% 

So if you get a 100 on the exam you only get 17 points instead of 25. The highest you can get in the course with a 100 for all other coursework and tests is now a 92."
11359,"So you can just skip the test in order to study more, or get the answers from another student? THAT seems unreasonable and way too exploitable."
11360,what the hell is ur prof saying
11361,"You lose 8 of possible 25 points on the exam as a penalty. Your exam is capped to 17 of 25. 

So you'd need 20.5/25 on the exam in order to get a 50% on the exam, after taking the 8 point penalty into account."
11362,"I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúforget‚Äù my exam, this is the first time I ever missed one. I genuinely was prepared for it and I studied my ass off. I really just wanted to get over with it this morning but I was super exhausted and closed my eyes for literally a minute and ended up waking 40 minutes into the exam. I felt super guilty emailing my prof for another chance because I know I don‚Äôt deserve it since I‚Äôm at fault. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt get an instant zero because it doesn‚Äôt say so in the syllabus, so I was expecting a penalty. I said ‚Äúthank you for being understanding‚Äù because I was honestly expecting a worse penalty, which I do deserve because it‚Äôs not fair to other students if I‚Äôm let off as easy as I was. I understand how hard it is for professors dealing with this kind of bullshit, especially during this time where everything is online. I hate to have become _that_ student."
11363,"Why do you think she's using you as an example? Do you sit in the front row or something?  You absolutely don't have to answer this, I was just curious."
11364,"college prof here,  please just email them or talk to them after class. they likely mean well, but this isn't appropriate. they'll probably feel really bad, but will be happy you said something to them rather than bringing it above their heads to the dean or something."
11365,Simple: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not comfortable being used as an example in class.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. No explanation needed.
11366,"Oh wow that's... *seriously* not okay. Like, I would get fired instantly if I did this levels of not okay. I would talk to them after class - ""Please stop using me in examples for the class. I understand you're trying to make things connect more personally with the class but it's making me feel singled out and highlighting ways I'm different from my peers."" Be direct and firm but professonal and polite. If you're not comfortable doing this, you can talk with the department chair. There's also probably offices on campus to deal with this kind of thing."
11367,I don‚Äôt really blame the professor because I‚Äôm sure she has some form of autism. She has an awareness poster in her office and we share a lot of the same mannerisms. So like I don‚Äôt want to be mean about it and I really like the prof it‚Äôs just annoying lol.
11368,"Yes definitely send an email, and if that doesn‚Äôt help, you may reach out to your school‚Äôs inclusion and diversity chair to see if they can help advocate for you. This definitely sucks and I‚Äôm so sorry she‚Äôs acting like this"
11369,"I think that might be all the more reason to talk about it, though you'll have to think about how you phrase the conversation. Obviously you know them better than I do, but what they're saying still isn't okay and you're absolutely reasonable if you address it."
11370,"Just ask her politely to stop using you as an example because you don‚Äôt like the extra attention. She‚Äôs not trying to be malicious, she‚Äôs passionate about her field, and I‚Äôm sure genuinely thrilled to have an example to help teach the class. I was pregnant during a biology class once and I was constantly used as a genetics example just to make the material more relatable. Professors do this all the time. If she knew it bothered you I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd be mortified that she made you uncomfortable in class and would stop immediately."
11371,"Just explain it to her like you're explaining it to us. Say, ""I know you don't mean any harm by it, but I'm a shy person and I would rather not have attention drawn toward me during class."" Or whatever. She will almost definitely apologize and thank you for saying something, I would want to know if I were her"
11372,"This is why college professors are hilarious. 
They live in their own world. They don‚Äôt see you as weird, they see you as a beautiful anomaly, worthy of praise."
11373,The paper trail is vital to CYA- cover your ass. With an email you can show how you addressed the issue and how the other person responded. It‚Äôs solid advice in professional situations.
11374,"^^ This. That‚Äôs the appropriate answer. 

If you want the inappropriate answer, my snarky response would be to say ‚ÄúWill we be picking on the gingers at some point? That MC1R thing some of them have is kinda freaky-deaky.‚Äù 

(Spoken as a chaotic neutral ginger professor.)"
11375,"Ask in person either in office hours or right before class if they're there. Be kind and courteous about it, not defensive and demanding."
11376,"‚Äú Hi *professors name*

While I understand the examples may be helpful, I‚Äôd really appreciate if you wouldn‚Äôt use me as one in class (full stop or ‚Äúin class so often‚Äù to soften it even more). 

It makes me feel pretty uncomfortable having the entire class stare me down after you‚Äôve referenced some of my unique features in the lecture and I honestly find it hard to focus afterwards. 

Regards

*Student Name* ‚Äú

That‚Äôs how I‚Äôd go about it. Sure you could be blunt but remember who‚Äôs in charge of your grade here. It‚Äôs unfair and ridiculous how that it even matters but the favor goes a long way."
11377,[deleted]
11378,Wholesome ending
11379,"You are such a lovely person!  This professor is highly inappropriate and yet you are so kind. You are even looking for excuses for their behavior. 

Your comment includes 'I look weird'  I can't believe that is true.  If your professor has any kindness at all, which you claims she does, she would not point out anything about you if you looked weird. She may think it's okay to use you as an example because you have a difference, but that you are beautiful.  It's still not okay. But she wouldn't say a thing if you really looked weird

Maybe send an email if you'd prefer not to have a conversation. That might also be best because you then will have something in writing. if you remember dates that she did this, include them in your email."
11380,"I'm autistic, and I get what you mean, but we're still responsible for our actions and there's no need to tiptoe or sugarcoat. This is still your professor, who should stop doing this regardless of what the intention was or what diagnoses theyve got. I think you imply elsewhere that you're autistic too: would you want people to use your autism to exempt you from actions you've done? that would be a bit infantilizing. Especially as you are just /assuming/ that this person is autistic and running with what you assume are their needs and limits with regards to their hypothetical autism (which is highly individual anyway). 

There's no need to overcomplicate! I think just email the professor and say ""hey, singling out my genetics repeatedly in front of my peers feels othering and inappropriate to me and I don't want it to happen anymore"". Whatever feelings or reactions they have to that, autism or not, are the professor's to deal with as the person with power over you in that situation. And you'll have proof that you emailed politely"
11381,"THIS IS WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE.

Holy crap, email the prof.  I don't know if I'd still have a job if I did that as a prof."
11382,"And my autistic ass would be dispositioned to call her out for it!

She probably hates having her genetic traits pointed out just as much as you or anyone else

But in all seriousness she probably doesn‚Äôt mean any harm, I would just talk to her after class and ask her to refrain from mentioning it"
11383,"Or OP can just talk to their professor about it, and they can have a discussion like adults."
11384,"You know for someone who called out OP for being ‚Äúassumptive‚Äù you‚Äôre literally doing the same thing. Assuming that OP is exaggerating real world events for internet attention instead of just assuming they‚Äôre here for advice and being chill about it? 
OP gives me socially awkward vibes throughout the comments, trying to justify and make the professor seem more polite. I‚Äôve been in situations like OP before, it‚Äôs not fun even thinking about confronting people because you don‚Äôt want to hurt them or you think somehow you‚Äôre in the wrong. 
So just chill out a bit, this isn‚Äôt being woke, this is establishing boundaries. Nothing more."
11385,"As I said before I don‚Äôt blame her because she (probably) has a genetic predisposition for having autism. I don‚Äôt like having something that I have no control over dictate my job, and I wouldn‚Äôt want that on anyone else."
11386,"I agree that you should just try to talk to her and kindly ask her to stop using you as an example. From what you are saying, she seems very nice and will probably say sorry and stop doing that. I would say that you shouldn‚Äôt talk to the department chair unless she continues after you ask her to stop because she could get in trouble. I doubt she has any bad intentions, so it is best to just politely ask her to stop."
11387,this is cartoonishly fucked up
11388,Cringe
11389,"yeah what the teacher did was crossing a boundary but i get the excitement since i love biology. i don‚Äôt think she crossed the boundary with bad intentions, but probably got too carried away and blasted it to the classroom"
11390,mf you seriously resorting to making fun of people‚Äôs pronouns lmao
11391,Why not first go to the person you have issue with directly (in person or email)?
11392,"I don‚Äôt blame her because she (probably) has a genetic predisposition for having autism. I don‚Äôt like having something that I have no control over dictate my job, and I wouldn‚Äôt want that on anyone else."
11393,Problem is i have no idea what i should do during my free time. I dont have a car so getting around isnt easy. My girlfriend lives 5 hours away so i can only see her once a month.
11394,I was the same way and still sort of am. It takes time to put new roots in especially for introverts. Clubs can be a good option.
11395,"yes this is me!! im glad im not the only one ;w;

i try not to waste time, instead i make a schedule for myself to get myself to do things instead of laying on reddit all day. i put aside time for homework, meals, and whatever other activities i want to get done, like walking on the beach or reading practicing music. and i dont consider myself in my ~down time~ untill ive done the duties that ive given myself"
11396,"Go do an activity? You have to make an effort to change up your routine, shit doesn't just fall from the sky."
11397,"Find a club on campus. You can do this during the week too. I was worried I would have this experience since only 20% of students live on campus, but with all the campus orgs it doesn‚Äôt feel that way at all. I go to miracle makers (service org) on Tuesday, and campus ministry dinner on Wednesday, and table top on fridays. It really helps"
11398,"Also if you don‚Äôt find any clubs that interest you, pick the least terrible and at least check it out for a few meetings. The club might be uninteresting to you, but an excuse to hang out with people outside class could be cool. 
Also check out bus routes for local stores to check out"
11399,"Dude, I‚Äôm gonna be real blunt here. I was in a similar situation to you my freshman year of college. I focused all on my classes, and everything else came secondary. I didn‚Äôt meet people, I ate all my meals alone, hung out in my dorm alone. I had 0 friends. And life got super depressing. I felt like no one noticed me and I just existed in a kind of monotonous purgatory. For a while, I was considering ending it all just because I didn‚Äôt see a point to living, as sad as it seems. This year, I‚Äôve worked my absolute hardest to get to know everyone possible. People next to you in classes. Someone you recognize from another class. Even just talking to professors during office hours. Statistically, some of them will become your good friends. And don‚Äôt let those friendships stagnate‚Äîgo do literally anything. Do whatever you have ever wanted! Have fun! Go find a back road somewhere and get drunk with people, or meet for breakfast at Waffle House, or have some people over to play poker. Go thrifting, or have a movie night, or go long boarding in a parking lot night. Just hang out with people and become friends.

I‚Äôm not saying you or your situation are anywhere near as bad as mine were. But as someone else who struggled to not be bored freshman year, I want the best for you."
11400,"Feels the same in Uni, I recommend talking to people and hanging out, it won't remove the repetition, but you might have a blast going through CC.

Someone said activities, that basically sums things up. Activities can be anything and most of the time they're better with more people."
11401,"Working out is a great hobby to pick up! It can be free and gets you in shape and can be a great stress reliever. Other things you can do that I like to do when I‚Äôm hanging out with myself are going for walks, writing in my journal, baking or cooking something new, or going for bike rides. I‚Äôm lucky to go to school in a big city so I enjoy checking out museums and window shopping too"
11402,I started working out and now everyday feels the same except I‚Äôm slightly less out of breath lol
11403,"Clubs will be your friend! Most colleges have tons of clubs that span a wide variety of interests. I guarantee you can find a literature club or anime club on your campus. I met my closest friends and my significant other at my college's video game club after being stuck in a boring routine like you. All I would do is wake up, go to class, come back and do homework, watch YouTube, eat sleep repeat. I had to force myself out of my comfort zone in order to find something fun and exciting for me.

Also, if you think you could manage it, get a job on campus. It won't pay much, but it's a resume builder, gets you out of the house for a few hours, and they're super flexible with hours because they hire a lot of students.

Bottom line; you have to put yourself out there and actually find stuff to do. Stuff won't come to you, unfortunately. But that slight discomfort of being in a new place with new people will dwindle away eventually when you finally found your niche in your campus. Good luck!"
11404,"I was feeling this way too, then I decided to just change up my hobby a bit. I watch anime and play videogames. What I do is play something/watch something completely new (to me at least). Like recently, I have been playing through Majoras Mask to shake things up instead of playing League games on repeat. For anime, instead of watching generic shounen all the time, I swapped it up and decided to watch a comedy; Nichijou. Just adding new experiences (while not too far out of your comfort zone) helps a lot."
11405,you could try getting some books to read for leisure. or even just watch anime in the library.
11406,Get fucked up with friends is always a great option
11407,Buy a bike
11408,Progressive overload and a nice diverse routine helps keep every workout interesting for me and there‚Äôs days I look forward to in the week (bench dayyyyy) that make the hard days (Deadlift front squat day) bearable. And upping the weight is always a boost to my mood too.
11409,This was me until I joined the Rowing team. Feel a lot better physically and it‚Äôs a fun activity to do.
11410,Everything is out there all laid out for anyone. Only step you have to take is taking one.
11411,"While I'm in a different boat, I work full time and go to school part time. I make time for other activities to keep myself level headed. I'm quite enjoying everything right now."
11412,Why not get a job?
11413,"For my community college theres campus funded activities for weekends like rock climbing, its honestly a lot of fun and usually the cost of the activity is covered so great for us broke college bois"
11414,Join clubs or hobbies.
11415,[deleted]
11416,Stop watching anime and do something else on the weekends?
11417,"I feel this, but on the weekends all I do is go to parties, not because I want to but because it's what all my friends want to do. I really don't enjoy partying, they're all the same to me, but I go anyway because it's either that or stay in all night:("
11418,"Yeah I live the same week over and over, but I make them good by working out, eating well and hanging out with friends!"
11419,Thx for sharing. Will definitely try some of these
11420,Thats kinda interesting. Ill try it
11421,I can‚Äôt get a job cause I‚Äôm under 18 with an F-1 visa smh

11423,"The federal government has never financially penalized a college for violating FERPA, and students have no right to sue a school for violating their rights under that law. See [FERPA widely misunderstood](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colleges-hide-behind-ferpa_n_56a7dd34e4b0b87beec65dda)

See also: [FERPA: The joke with no punchline](https://www.aei.org/education/ferpa-joke-punchline/)"
11424,"Also a professor.  To add: small colleges may not have a director of undergrad studies and the academic dean would be the second contact.
This is entirely unacceptable, assuming you are in the US. I do see a non-US student here saying it is the norm in their country."
11425,"What the fuck no. 

I'd forward the email to the department chair with a note that you really don't appreciate all your classmates being messaged about your lack of progress. This is a major issue."
11426,No. It's a kind of weird thing to do. Kind and cruel. If there is a way for them to improve anyways. Otherwise it's bonkers.
11427,"The thing is students (and universities) tend to misunderstand what FERPA is.

The professor in this case did not actually violate FERPA. This is because FERPA is a rule that governs the university, not the individual professors.

FERPA basically says the universities are required to have rules against doing stuff like what the professor did, and if they're aware of this, they have to tell him to stop, and if he continues, they've got to do something about it.

FERPA is not ""don't give out confidential student records,"" it's ""you must have a policy against giving out confidential student records.""

That's why schools don't get punished even when individual professors screw up."
11428,"[https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html)  If this isn't your official transcript grade and just your progress in the class so far then they technically they can do that. No, it's not normal. I don't know why some professors do stupid things like this. I imagine they must be tenured if they don't care about their reputation."
11429,"No way! It seems like the professor is trying to humiliate the person who is failing rather than anything else, as if they‚Äôre trying to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô - they should email the person who is failing directly, not the whole class."
11430,"That's true, but it's because they'd rather work to remedy the problem, figure out how it went wrong, and move along, rather than shut down a school over it."
11431,Maybe they meant kind ‚ÄúOF‚Äù cruel??
11432,"It‚Äôs strange because she did reach out to me privately about my grade, but then she sends out an email to everyone about it. I‚Äôm not sure if I should ask her about it or what."
11433,"FERPA protects only student records. So, if the professor said ""These people have below a 65,"" then there would be a problem. But, if the professor said ""These people are at risk of failing this semester,"" then it's still a shitty thing to do, but FERPA doesn't care, because ""at risk of failing"" isn't a record."
11434,Perfect answer here
11435,That last comment is BS. We are free to share our own academic records however we please.
11436,"Where does it say that you can disclose someone's progress in the class? The way I see it, if someone is failing, they have an F, and disclosing that is saying what their grades are. Sounds like a FERPA violation to me."
11437,How can something be kind AND cruel?
11438,"That‚Äôs so uncalled for. If I were you I would ask her why it was necessary for her to email the whole class about your grade when that‚Äôs a private matter. If she had a problem with your grade for whatever reason, she should talk to you about it, not anyone else (or address the whole class but of course, leave out names). Depending on her response you could also bring it up to someone else higher up. There‚Äôs also a slim chance that she might not have realised that students would feel uncomfortable with her sharing their grades, but I doubt that was the case"
11439,"My first summer during college I was at my brother‚Äôs wedding and my professor released the raw grades so I immediately thought I had probably failed. I emailed him and he claimed it was department policy not to release actual grades. I ended up getting a B. What a douche. 

I still thought his teaching was pretty good so I recommended my girlfriend take a class from him five years later. Apparently he had gotten so bad that she passed the class with a C+ having gotten something like 21% on the midterm. If she hadn‚Äôt passed it would‚Äôve set her back a year due to prerequisites.

And one more thing, in the class I thought I had failed, the one time I was a few minutes late to class apparently he must have told everyone that we could have a cheat sheet on the midterm, because I showed up being the only person without one."
11440,The last names of the students.
11441,"Faculty here.

This is a FERPA violation.

Might be worth asking the dean if it's okay (for a lighter touch) or reporting to the dean as something you feel concerned over (for a heavier touch)."
11442,"This has literally never happened to me or anyone I've known, so I would not say its normal."
11443,"While you are welcome to it, your opinion has no legal value.

In contrast, the Supreme Court's opinion is that in class grading and shouting out the students grade does not violate FERPA. See [Peer Grading vs. Privacy: The Supreme Court Rules](https://www.educationworld.com/a_issues/issues279.shtml)."
11444,[deleted]
11445,Wow. Past professors of mine only used our student IDs as identifiers.ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11446,No. It does show how much of a failure the professor is for not being able to effectively teach a chunk of your class.
11447,Are the names on the list or another identifier like student ID?
11448,"Agree.
Students have rights too."
11449,"Just to clarify, it's the students calling out the grade they gave it, not the teacher shouting out the grade they recorded.

Also, man it's gotta hurt to get overturned in a 9-0 opinion."
11450,"I had professors email us with numbers of who is failing F: 0, D: 0, C: 4, etc., but never names specifically. that‚Äôs fucked up"
11451,"When I studied abroad in Chile, it was common there to send everyone's grades in one list. In the US, absolutely not"
11452,If I hand back a test and people start taking up class time comparing their grades I shut that down. Especially if people are feeling pressured into sharing their grade and they might not want to. Of course people can do what they want outside of class.  That could be what the op was talking about.
11453,You‚Äôre welcomed! I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it is to juggle both at the same time but it‚Äôll get better without a doubt üíïüíïüíï
11454,"Thank you! I'm lucky enough that my husband got a better paying job, and I no longer need to work for us to afford daycare, on top of school and being a parent. I've been taking semesters of 16-18 credit hours and it hasn't been easy but I've gotten a consistent 4.0 GPA so far! I'm hoping to keep it up"
11455,Hey just letting you know I'm super proud of you. You're killing it and life has amazing ways of getting back to you in positive ways. Lots of love and good wishes.
11456,"I don‚Äôt have kids myself, and yet, can‚Äôt even manage five classes in a semester so the fact that you can manage SIX classes in addition to motherhood is really fucking impressive. Your kids are extremely lucky to have you as a mother, and hopefully, they know this üíìüíìüíì"
11457,"I can‚Äôt even do 15 myself, let alone 16 or 18. Anything over 12 makes me anxious, and I don‚Äôt even have as many commitments as you likely do. The fact that you‚Äôre doing 16-18 per semester and able to keep a 4.0 while making time for your family is inspiring as fuck. Good luck on keeping up the 4.0!!!! You‚Äôve kept it up thus far, I have no doubt that you‚Äôll be able to continue to do so üò≠üíï"
11458,It just shows that you can do anything that you put your mind to and if you want that education you will get it and still be an awesome mum the meantime.
11459,It was HARD! Just graduated this semester while raising 3 kiddos.
11460,"Thank you! I have a three year old, and I have two years left in the Dental Hygiene program."
11461,Thanks :D
11462,"We had 2 of our 3 kids while in college, both wife and I. She made it through. Soooo proud of her to this day."
11463,Thanks!!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
11464,"I love encouraging stuff like this! I've found notes on my car at school praising me for being a BAMF who moms and goes to class, and I was featured as a mom on campus in my school's magazine. Life may not work out as planned but we're all doing amazing things!!"
11465,"It's rough at times, but if you explain things to your professors, I've found they'll usually be very understanding. Lots of them have kids themselves, and the early-career folks in particular will probably have young kids. If you can be understanding of them, they'll be understanding in return!

I wouldn't have done anywhere near as well if I hadn't reached out to them on occasion. Even if it's just a couple extra hours on a deadline, it really helps when the kiddo's sick or I have to pick him up from something."
11466,"Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Working, being an involved mother, and being in school is stressful and it‚Äôs hard to not feel like a machine sometimes but I know once I‚Äôm finished life will be a bit easier."
11467,Omg congratulations!!! üéäü§ó
11468,"6 courses on campus this semester, one infant. :) I can't imagine doing it with two!

You go, momma!"
11469,"Ah ok! Props to you, you're doing a fantastic job. Your kids must be proud."
11470,"Just saw this today...thank you!! Full time mom (ages 2&4), wife, employee and just started my masters on 4/26. So far I have a 97.33% in my marketing class. Super happy because I never did this well in my undergrad program."
11471,"It actually does, why?"
11472,"Hell, I found 4 bad enough with a toddler! Especially since he seems determined to kill himself in the most stupid ways possible"
11473,Ah. My oldest was born in 99. I am nw 41 with 4 kids and 2 grandkids. It‚Äôs beyond hard but I manage.
11474,Just please don't bring your kid to class
11475,I hope that 99 in your username doesn't stand for 1999
11476,"Sorry, that came off more disapproving/offensive, I didn't mean it that way. I'm also of a similar age ('98 born) and I couldn't imagine being a parent while in college. Massive respect."
11477,"heck yeah i will! that would be pretty iconic as well, ngl."
11478,24 is so young! keep up the hard work~
11479,*cries in 30*
11480,Cries in 33 with a year left of school lol
11481,Well I'm 26 now haha
11482,"Oh wow, that‚Äôs a big accomplishment to graduate university at 20. Congrats!"
11483,Congrats!!! üëè
11484,26 is still young :D gj
11485,"bro if anything stupid happens we need a video with faces blurred of course üòÇüòÇ

also MASSIVE kudos man üçæ"
11486,"Hey same age too for me. Although I am not as excited since I wont get a break, and will continue school in grad school. Summer i also have research, so its pretty much just my Junior year with four more years ahead."
11487,me too! im walking a week from this Friday I'm so excited! congrats! being first-gen is hard
11488,"Not eveyone's path is the same, and it's great that you are pursuing what you want to do!"
11489,"I got accepted for a scholarship to attend an early college program at a local community college. It begun my sophomore year of high school. I basically went to college every Saturday and 2-3 week days on summer break :,) It allowed me to earn my associates a week before my high school graduation and I transferred to university after!"
11490,I'll have my bachelor's degree when I'm 26... sigh
11491,"being first gen is so FUCKING HARD- but hey, we did it, im proud of u!! :D don‚Äôt trip!!"
11492,"A huge congratulation is in order, well done! Not only have you achieved your goal but you also serve as beacon of hope for others"
11493,But thank you. you too
11494,thank you ! & i got you !! it‚Äôs going to be broadcasted so if anything happens‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be taped üòÇ
11495,"besides the finances you don't have the support system or people with knowledge that people who are close to people with degrees have. especially your parents . I'm the only person I know who's in process of getting a degree + besides friends my age) so it's hard to find people to answer questions and help guide you, especially when you're younger. it's less of an issue the older you are and the further you've progressed through college but those first two years especially are pretty rough when you don't know what you're doing and have a million questions"
11496,"oh gosh i relate, im starting a masters program in the fall but this summer will consist of me filling out job apps :/ congrats to you! hopefully grad school flys by for you!"
11497,me to <3 muah~
11498,\*cries in 36\* I'll be 37 when I get to walk.
11499,"ahh nice. I graduated early from highschool + did dual enrollment so I'm also graduating college at 20, but I haven't met anyone else also graduating that young."
11500,"How did you graduate at 20, did you start college at 16?"
11501,"You should be very, very proud of yourself. I know I am proud of you! Some people pass this milestone very without a second thought, others struggle through it. Some don't reach the finish line. You and your mother both have accomplished something great for your lives! :)  


I am excited to see where you go from here.

&#x200B;

Best Regards,

Internet Stranger"
11502,I'm angry grrrr
11503,"no that's totally fair, I get it . For me I feel like  anything is better than nothing but I also understand what you're saying !"
11504,Very proud of you (and your mom)! You potentially changed the whole trajectory of your family. Huge congratulations üéä
11505,THANKS!!
11506,i also graduated hs early !! let‚Äôs gooo~ it‚Äôs really nice meeting someone going through a similar path as me!! you‚Äôve got this :D
11507,Bro. Can‚Äôt be gettin your meat grabbed by a stranger. Report his ass.
11508,Round up your friends(those who experienced SA from the guy) and ready your evidence. Now go report him
11509,"You need to report this. Grabbing your dick is sexual assault, you need to tell the RA IMMEDIATELY"
11510,At least if they one of the homies you can kick their ass for doing something weird.
11511,I mean I don‚Äôt think your friends should really be doing it either tbh
11512,"Screw his student visa. If he really cared about it, he wouldn‚Äôt be harassing you."
11513,"I let my mate slap my ass, nothing gay about it üòé"
11514,"Report it 100%. At very least, they should be able to separate the two of you"
11515,You should report him because any student who commits sexual assault on another student (male or female) should be expelled or sent to jail
11516,My one friend always says the straightest thing you can do is act gay with the homies.
11517,Same shit has been happening to me for a semester from a dude down the hall from me. Slapped my ass the other day like it was funny. Report that shit.
11518,"To be fair, that‚Äôs common between guys in sports and many friend groups. Make it clear you‚Äôre not okay with it and if it ever continues, reporting to the RA or Title IX is 100% appropriate. 

I don‚Äôt condone harassment or anything, some people just expect everyone to react like their friends or teammates and are a bit ignorant."
11519,[deleted]
11520,"Please report. I know it's scary to think of the outcome, but he needs to know there are consequences to his actions before he does something way worse (as if these aren't already)."
11521,Grab his dick and TWIST ITTT
11522,"Report him to the police then the place you live at will have to move him especially if you get a restraining order. You are being sexually assaulted and should take that seriously even though it is so difficult believe me i know, I've had to get the police involved, also you should be able to get free therapy you just need to fibd the right places. It can take a bit of looking and there might be a bit of a wait"
11523,long as you said no homo
11524,A slap on the ass is much different than a tug on the dick
11525,"Absolutely report it. Do it for yourself, your friends, and to protect anyone else from this person."
11526,"Report that shit. And if they don‚Äôt addle it immediately, call the cops."
11527,"I mean‚Ä¶ cultural/national differences shouldn‚Äôt = sexual assault. It‚Äôs plain sexual assault, and excusing it in anyway for any reason is not okay. (gives same vibes as ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù) 
Sexual assault is not okay under any circumstances, and is therefore not excusable in any circumstances."
11528,"Yeah I agree with this actually.

But if you‚Äôve made it clear it ain‚Äôt cool and he continues to do it report him. It‚Äôs sexual assault."
11529,"You don‚Äôt need to express a lack of consent for it to be sexual harassment or assault. Anything less than clear and verbal freely-given consent for a sexual act/advancement is grounds for the victim to report it. It‚Äôs the perpetrator‚Äôs job to
not assault people, not the victim‚Äôs job to tell them off. Not even Nancy Reagan would tell you to ‚Äújust say no‚Äù to sexual assault lol"
11530,THE OLE DICK TWIST
11531,Report Him
11532,"As long as he said no homo first then its okay....

/s get the fuck out of there and dont let people sexually assualt you, the fuck my guy. College /= to sexual assualt your entitled to peace of mind you fucking paid for it. Go handle this, and get off reddit."
11533,why are you even posting this to reddit? the answer is clear.
11534,I'm so sorry you've had to experience that
11535,"I hear ya, but this is a totally different ‚Äòbro culture‚Äô where two guys slapping each other on the ass isn‚Äôt viewed as sexual, more banter.

Even if a guy in my class I wasn‚Äôt friends with but cool with, slapped my ass, I‚Äôd be like wtf, and then probably laugh after. 

It‚Äôs a totally different to scenario then a man just slapping some woman on the ass, that‚Äôs likely to be 99% sexual assault depending on the context, but more often then not sexual assault.

It‚Äôs a grey area, if i was joking around with a dude in the changing rooms and slapped his ass and he reported me for sexual assault, it would be weird as hell. If he told me yo, don‚Äôt do that, I‚Äôm not comfortable with that, and I kept on doing it, then it‚Äôs sexual assault, I hope you catch my gist.

In OP‚Äôs case, his roomate is slapping his ass, grabbing his woodina, this is after OP has told him to fuck off, it‚Äôs sexual assault."
11536,"let‚Äôs talk about intent vs. impact. Joking at this topic while not intended to be problematic nevertheless isn‚Äôt the best move, but what really stands out in your comment to me is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let people sexually assault you.‚Äù Not a great move to be casually victim blaming. 

OP sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this, the dude is way out of line and you‚Äôre not wrong for wanting to report. You told him no and he‚Äôs ignored you, it‚Äôs definitely the appropriate time to report him. Hope it gets resolved easily and quickly."
11537,"My college has stated that they are going to avoid online classes at all costs, even if they have to push back the start of the semester. I might die if I have to do anything else online for the rest of college ever"
11538,"Yeah like I have an apartment in the city and why the heck would i bother going to the town if class is online, I'll stay in my hometown and not pay a lease"
11539,"If we go online for next semester, I'm taking a gap and hoping my scholarship carries over. As a film major, there is no reason for me to pay for online classes. 

My biggest worry is that we're going to start the semester on campus, and halfway through get a second wave and go online again."
11540,"You jest, yet online classes at my school cost the same with an additional $100/course ""distance learning fee""

So it's more expensive."
11541,"Given that my school added an ""economic recovery fee"" during and after the 2008 recession. They have no plans in lower anything."
11542,"i know that my school includes things like a security deposit, expenses for the rec center, etc. in our bill and tuition ‚Äî we shouldn‚Äôt be charged for them so i hope our costs decrease... i‚Äôve thought about it and i think i‚Äôll take a leave of absence for the semester if fall is online."
11543,stay at your apartment in the city. don't waste the rent and I bet you'll really enjoy the independence from home. if you have roommates too they can come back and you guys can have a fun time and have some degree of normalcy.
11544,LMFAO WHAT
11545,"I am taking a math Maymester course with one of the best math teachers who had the latter half of the semester ( sort-of) to prepare for it being online. He put together a well-organized, sort of, online course that's otherwise usually taught in-person to the best of his abilities. It's taught through MSFT Teams and >60% of the time he and the whiteboard are too blurry to take notes from. Sometimes the audio cuts out too. 

I go to a private school, and if we go online for fall I'm deferring. End of."
11546,"I (staffer) have mentioned this a few times in threads on this question, but just to reiterate. Your tuition isn't just paying for your credits at the quality you expect. Tuition is mostly for your school _to exist at all_.

Put aside the fact I literally mean schools couldn't run if they lost a chunk of tuition revenue. Here's a more mundane example of what tuition reduction would mean. I was in a meeting today where the topic of looming departmental budget cuts came up. It would mean not renewing contracts with a number of our teachers, many of whom teach classes required for our majors. There's a very real chance that we may not be able to staff a required course in the fall, or if we do, it will be taught by someone unfamiliar with the topic and already overworked. This is _without_ the loss of tuition revenue... manageable, but already losing the quality of education. But cut tuition...to balance the books schools will lay off instructors and, in turn, eliminate many classes because they can't be staffed or supported. The remote class that's not up to expectations simply doesn't exist at all.

And I'm not sure students have heard the unbudgeted costs of COVID-19. One school that was up front about the costs was MIT: as of mid-April, it had spent or returned $50 million since January. That was the cost of ""providing the technology to enable the sudden shift to remote teaching and working, supplying financial assistance to help students leave campus quickly, refunding student housing and dining fees while making sure contract dining workers and others are paid through late May"". That's before the hit it will take in lost endowment income, cuts in government grants, and less private giving.

This crisis is _really bad_. Unfortunately the math is that for your schools to stay open, they're going to have to keep tuition where it is. Some of you will decide it's not worth it and walk away, and that may well be the right decision for you. But for those that stay in school, probably with a noble exception here or there, there will be no tuition reductions."
11547,After this semester I'm gonna wait it out until we're allowed back on campus. It wouldn't be so hard if half of the professors weren't almost completely incapable of running an online class.
11548,"They won't, my school stated they definitely won't increase tuition. Ultimately, the tuition pays for your degree (i.e. the credits of the course and the professor's pay). You have campus/school fees tagged on top of your tuition to pay for the rec center, student center etc. That stuff, I feel, should be cut since they aren't in use by the students but tuition is. Your taking classes and paying per credit."
11549,Excuse me an economic recovery WHAT
11550,Did you already sign one? I know someone who is waiting to see what happens and another person who did sign and is nervous about if classes are online
11551,"Yeah I signed back in december, no idea anything like this would happen, now im worried I'll be paying for an empty apartment again"
11552,"If you're a freshman/sophomore still taking gen ed classes and your university classes are all online, do yourself a favor and enroll in community college to knock those courses out. So much cheaper and the credits almost always transfer over to exactly what your university would require. And let's be honest, if you think community college courses are lower quality or whatever, for one that is wrong, but you're not referencing anything you learn during your gen ed courses in the real world after college anyway. No harm no foul in saving yourself some money if your school is just making all your classes virtual anyway."
11553,I don't know why there is a distance learning fee when the professors themselves already has a computer at home (I'm assuming)
11554,"I agree, half of my tuition are fees that I will not be using in the Fall if my school goes  online"
11555,Honestly a good idea thanks
11556,[deleted]
11557,"My univeristy sent us an email saying they were raising tuition for the upcoming semesters.

I got a 1,200$ increase on my tuition bill for fall 2020. Like cool, thanks."
11558,"Most colleges seem to be hoping to start in person, but plan on moving online if necessary"
11559,Yup that's what I think will happen
11560,"that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm doing. even if we don‚Äôt have classes fall term i‚Äôm going to get a job in my college city and work away from home. loving the independence, ain‚Äôt no way i‚Äôm staying in my hometown."
11561,I read an article about it that said online classes are more expensive because of advertising and the initial cost of developing virtual infrastructure.
11562,but aren't they already using a platform (such as canvas)???
11563,"No no no, come explain this to us man"
11564,"Yes, I'm an incoming freshman and if tuition is not significantly reduced I'm not going until I get what I'm paying for, this is a 25k per year commitment and I'll damned if I have to watch my professor in their late 50s try to figure out how to work online classes.

I really don't want to take a semester off, but I will if tuition isn't reduced."
11565,I laughed so hard at this
11566,Yet so many colleges have millions in their endowment so instead of raising tuition for the fall semester they should just take out of that.
11567,"You‚Äôre nicer than I am. I walk around the room as I teach, and if I see someone doing something else - shopping online for electric guitars, for example - I don‚Äôt fuss. Instead, I make a big positive deal out of it. ‚ÄúOh my goodness! What a beautiful guitar! Let‚Äôs use the model of consumer behavior to walk through your process from need recognition to post-purchase processes.‚Äù

It deters others from the same behavior while also tying someone‚Äôs goofing off to the lesson at hand. A win-win!"
11568,If I know there is an accommodation I have zero problem with it.  From what I have read you retain more when you do notes by hand. Everybody learns differently though.
11569,"A follow up tip from a student. If you want to have your notes saved in an electronic format rather than in a notebook, tablets or touch screen laptops with a writing stylus is a great alternative. 

I used to exclusively use notebooks but carrying 4 separate notebooks is heavy, and in my opinion bad for the environment when you don't utilize all of the pages but still want to keep all your class notes separate. 

Writing on a tablet with a stylus took some time to get used to but now I love it. I still benefit from remembering things better from writing it, rather than typing it and I can easily save my notes, print them if necessary, and organize them on both the tablet and my laptop to study them later. 

An extra bonus: if your professors provide fill in the blank PowerPoint slides and you forget to print them before class/don't own a printer and are running late you can quickly download the notes from the LMS (canvas, moodle etc) and access them to add additional handwritten notes to."
11570,"Who cares? If they fail, it‚Äôs on them, and they are the ones paying for the class."
11571,I'm the same way. I prefer pen and paper so much more than doing laptop notes
11572,i am a slow typer so im often still typing when the professor isnt speaking. i hope u dont think every student who does that is not paying attention or smth.
11573,"I hope I didn‚Äôt come off as offensive in anyway. I probably could have worded that better. I just wanted to tell a story. A lot of professors forgot I had that accommodation and I got lectured quite a bit. It‚Äôs easy to forget which students have what if you have so many students and a certain amount of classes each day.

And yes I noticed the difference with that. When it‚Äôs by pencil and paper I remember it a lot better but I also can reheat the lecture as many times as needed so that also helps."
11574,That‚Äôs my biggest peeve. I prefer the front seat mostly because I have low vision and I hate when I‚Äôm front row and everyone can see my screen :/
11575,a middle ground is using an ipad and apple pencil.
11576,They are usually tucked in the back of the room so I don't see exactly what they are doing.
11577,"For students, I wonder if the best thing is to shut your wifi off. Resist the temptation to go outside or online. Stick to taking notes."
11578,"Assigning a grade when it's relevant to conduct/participation, sure. But if you're saying any other grades are influenced by the person's emotions, then there's a problem. Those grades should only reflect academic performance/ learning."
11579,"If they want to waste their time in college then that's their choice. And imo you come off as one of those professors that have had power creeping up to their head, resulting in them thinking they know far more than they really do. A student typing when they shouldn't need to be typing may be a student that edited their notes. Or a student that may not be a fast typer and is trying to keep up."
11580,It bothers me so much when I'm sitting behind someone who is browsing amazon or whatever while I'm trying to focus on class content..
11581,"Yeah that is also the worst. Don't need everyone knowing ur business. My friend says this is why she likes her iPad cause she can lay it flat, and if shes in the middle of the room the teacher can't see what she's doing"
11582,I‚Äôm assuming youve never taught a class. Professors are humans with human feelings. Teaching a class to disengaged students is incredibly demoralizing. Do you want a demoralized person assigning you a grade?
11583,Exactly üíÄwe are all legal adults
11584,"assuming disengaged students are ""assholes"" is just as demoralizing. those ""assholes"" could be students that just struggle concentrating for long periods of time and need alternative methods to keep listening. you can't just ruin someone's GPA because they don't follow what you call the ""right"" way to be engaged in class."
11585,"Myself and many of my classmates use google docs to take notes, sometimes on a shared doc if it‚Äôs a group project, which requires wifi. Our tuition doesn‚Äôt include Microsoft word."
11586,Still to much on my income. Pencil and paper work for me. Just takes a bit longer but my hand muscles are probably the strongest
11587,Oh boy this comment section needs to live a little
11588,"Dear God, please no. I don't want to be forced to speak and still contribute nothing to the discussion. Mandatory classroom participation should be within major-specific classes only, no gen eds."
11589,"These are the types of teachers/professors I always loved. No one was ever truly punished, but simply deterred. Eventually everyone wanted to pay attention anyways!"
11590,I have a classmate that uses that. She says it‚Äôs awesome but I can‚Äôt afford an IPad
11591,Not offended at all. It is a valid point.
11592,"How about the fact that we‚Äôre adults who paid for your course and if it isn‚Äôt disruptive then you have no business dictating what we do with our devices. If I want to come in and quietly browse reddit on my laptop for the entirety of the class that‚Äôs well within my rights. Why do you even care? You sound like you‚Äôre power tripping over the ability to dictate someone‚Äôs grades. If someone doesn‚Äôt want to pay attention then that‚Äôs literally none of your business. You don‚Äôt have an obligation to ensure they are mentally present in class. I always hated professors that thought their class was oh so important and mandated attendance. News flash, your class is probably boring as shit and a lot of students don‚Äôt want to learn from you. They attend to attain a grade earn a degree and get the fuck out of your class."
11593,"Ah, gotcha. I usually walk to the back as I teach, but I‚Äôm usually in smaller classrooms because I have upper division courses."
11594,"I‚Äôm so afraid of professors thinking I‚Äôm playing games now... I‚Äôm definitely going to be struggling to take notes (I got prewritten notes in high school for multiple reasons, but they won‚Äôt give me those anymore) and now I‚Äôm super worried

11595,"What if I learn much better not in a classroom? 
I don‚Äôt know why, but if I have full control of my learning, i.e I can read at my own pace, stop when I want, take notes how I want, listen to music, or whatever else, I absorb and retain the information super well. I had a really bad Chemistry Prof one semester, so I just read the text book and taught myself. I have a 4.0, but I don‚Äôt pay attention in class and do other things. It‚Äôs too noisy, the lights too bright, too many smells, people too close to me, etc. It‚Äôs also faster if I just learn on my own, but of course, attending most classes is necessary. But yeah, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm one of those students who gets judged initially for being fidgety and not paying attention, sometimes playing suduko or just generally doing weird things instead. Usually I get left alone after I get high marks on the first test or two and complete it really fast though. 
This doesn‚Äôt apply to lab sections. I love lab work."
11596,Yes. Your students are adults and don‚Äôt need their personal attention policed or called out.
11597,Meanwhile in my music class I'm having points off as a punishment for missing the assignment that was reschedule which means I have a total grade of -10...
11598,Congratulations on doing so well!! Music professors (at least most of them) absolutely rock. There‚Äôs just something about arts people that makes us form strong bonds with each other .
11599,"Il never forget. I actually had a professor call me one evening a few years ago. I had never missed a day of class. That day I missed class and he called me. He knew I just got out of the Marines and was struggling mentally with a LOT of stuff from the military. We talked on the phone for a good hour, him checking up on me and talked about life and everything in between. Il never forget him because he probably contributed saving my life going forward. Professors like this are a blessing!"

11603,"Maybe you just have bad professors my comp sci professors are amazing. Even if they're shitty at teaching the content every single teacher in comp sci I've had save for maybe 2 would have acted similarly to this post (or as close as the uni lets them, as giving points to specific students based on favoritism or personal hardship would probably be a big issue here lol)"

11648,"I work at a US university. A good number of students have their parents complete their application and give them access to their account. Even if you don't remember checking a FERPA consent form, your parent may have done it if they helped you with your application. 

If you check your account and you have a FERPA release, you can deactivate it at any time. If you don't have one, definitely report this incident. Your university most likely has a complaint process. If not, send the email to the Registrar and copy the Dean of Students. If you don't get a reply within 2 business days, print the entire chain and go visit the Dean of Students office."
11649,"I agree with what everyone is saying about FERPA & consent. 

I'd just add that you might have provided that consent in the various documents/agreements you signed off on when getting enrolled at the college.

so.... before just going off saying ""FERPA violation"", do look into whether you did provide consent to this, even if unawares.

I don't have the document in front of me at the moment, but we've already had one situation, probably billing related, where our daughter had to either give consent to us being authorized to act on her behalf or otherwise complicated funds transfers, etc. have to occur that we're not willing to struggle through In order to pay an invoice. - perhaps you gave such permission for a similar reason of ""convenience"".

If that's the case, perhaps there's a way to retract that permission going forward"
11650,[deleted]
11651,"> A good number of students have their parents complete their application and give them access to their account

\^\^ this right here, I can vouch for it"
11652,"This is correct.  In the US, students are now considered adults and academic records cannot be released without written consent.  As a college professor, we are told to tell helicopter parents (or Karen's) to contact our compliance officer if they are not satisfied with the answer we give them."
11653,"My university allows me to give my parents access to billing information, but not my academic information. They can check my tuition and other fees and pay for it, but they cannot access my academic records without my consent. 

You should consider this approach. I have many friends at university whose parents are constantly on them about their grades and their exams and their GPA, and I‚Äôve been witness to many a mental breakdown because of it. Consider that college is an extremely mentally taxing and stressful time, and your added pressure on your child may be more harmful than beneficial. Your daughter is a young adult and should be treated as one. 

Being left to my own devices and failing made me a better student. I was an idiot my freshman year, didn‚Äôt develop good habits, had too much fun, and my grades were not the best. My parents didn‚Äôt need to scold me, because I was harsh enough on myself. Having my parents in my ear lecturing me about being a horrible student would have made things so much worse. I was able to turn things around and am doing excellent now in my final year. Not to mention that I am 21 years old and it would be demeaning for my parents to still be on my ass about my grades like they were when I was 15. Young adults need space and agency to live, make mistakes, and learn from them. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I really hope you consider this. Everyone I‚Äôve spoken to whose parents monitor their grades has suffered mentally for it."

11655,">Even if you don't remember checking a FERPA consent form, your parent may have done it if they helped you with your application.

I teach in higher ed. Even if a student signed a FERPA consent form, I'd kindly and professional tell the parent to back off. I'm under no obligation to talk to them, and unless there is an emergency or the student themselves asked me to talk to a parent, I wouldn't share a single thing."
11656,"No this is not normal.  In fact, I do everything in my power to NOT talk to a student's parents."
11657,"Do you trust your kid? This will be so much added stress for them.  Why not just ask for open and honest communication with them and let them come to you if they are struggling? 

Your child will be trying their best and they need to learn to do this as an adult, not as a child with a parent breathing down their neck and monitoring their every move, be it success or mistake.

You funding it is irrelevant, you‚Äôre going to be doing more harm than good by making them sign it.  Let them be an adult. Let them run into difficulties on their own and learn to overcome them.  

How does you having access to grades help? Are you going to, what, ground them if they do poorly? Stop funding their school if they slip up? I hope you reconsider."
11658,">	I paid for my own college, undergrad and grad school. She is more than welcome to do that.

LMAOOOO in case you haven‚Äôt noticed, times have changed. Expecting your kid to come up with 25+k because you were able to do it, what, 30 years ago? 

Great way to make your daughter not want to come to you for issues, when she will feel like she has no independence as an adult"
11659,"As a parent, I‚Äôm wondering why I would really even want to know.  From my perspective, my child is an adult.  I agreed to financially support 4 years of university, I‚Äôve communicated the value of education and emphasized the advantages they can have in their future with a degree.  If they want to squander that and fail out, they can learn from those mistakes.  I spent the last 18 years coaching them and trying to impart productive and positive values.  This is the time for them to experience a little practical application and figure things out on their own.  I‚Äôm going to support them, but I‚Äôm not going to police them.  I‚Äôm also not going to pay for a 5th year because they decided to fuck around.

Personally, I don‚Äôt need or even want to know their grades, and I definitely don‚Äôt want to try and police them from afar.  If they haven‚Äôt gotten it by now, then maybe university is the best place for them anyway."
11660,Most parents absolutely do not share this point of view.  I wish universities would do more to push the independence of their students.
11661,"HAHAHAHA Oh man, this is how you choose to treat your kid??? You could approach this situation from a number of angles, and THIS is what you choose to do? Lmfaoooo"
11662,"That‚Äôs really sad and I feel bad for your child.  What a horrible ultimatum.  I just want to reiterate, you ARE doing more harm than good to your child by doing this.  I really hope you put more thought into this and let go of your attachment issues, for what‚Äôs best for the kid."
11663,"My parents funded my entire college tuition. Same with my brother and sister. They NEVER asked for grades or anything of the sort. You either are willing to do it and treat them like an adult, or you are not willing to do it. There is no in-between. 

If your kid doesn't do well, thats on them to fix the problem. Plus, it will increase the likelihood of your child being willing to come to you with a problem in the future if you show you trust them to hold themselves accountable."
11664,"It depends. In the U.S., this requires the student to sign a form allowing the college to share information with parents. 

(I‚Äôm not sure if the rules apply differently to minors)."
11665,"This is a great idea! At our uni, you can even log into the same site you use to check grades to see if a release is listed there."
11666,"Are you sure your mom did not reach out first, and your prof just emailed your mom ""out of the blue?""  Are you sure this is not a response to an email your mom sent asking for an update on your performance in class?"
11667,"In my experience, the academic disqualification and lying will likely be a result of the pressure put on the child, even if that is simply asking the kid what their grades are and trying to force help at every step. I‚Äôm not saying the parents shouldn‚Äôt be upset if the kid ends up failing out, but there are often reasons that build up on why kids fail out and pressure is often one of them. It‚Äôs not going to help the kid if they are coddled through college, I‚Äôve had friends who were and I still have no idea how they will be completely independent in life. On the other hand, developing a relationship of support can prevent these problems."
11668,[removed]
11669,"Yeah, under no circumstances can I imagine a prof doing this without a parent directly requesting it and proving that the student signed the FERPA waiver.  I‚Äôm a prof; I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to get hold of the parents of a student, let alone would I risk my job by trying it. The mother had to have contacted the prof."
11670,"> If your parents claim you as a dependent for tax purposes then they may have access to your grades.

That is not the case. Regardless of who pays tuition and regardless whether they are a dependent, the student's information is protected. 

However, if OP signed a waiver at the school allowing parents to access student information, then the school can share it with them legally."
11671,"I'm a college grad and I'm downvoting the parent. I also, like OC's child, know what it's like to have overprotective helicopter parents who demand to butt into every aspect of my life and then throw tantrums when I don't share information that isn't theirs to know. 

OC said that kids kid can't be trusted, but he's letting them move away for college? And the only condition to signing up for tens of thousands of dollars of debt to pay for it is to be able to see their grades? No, something else is going on here, something we're not being told."
11672,"No, this isn‚Äôt normal, and we typically feel strongly about dealing with students directly. For example, my policy is not to speak to anyone‚Äôs parents, waiver or not. I believe that students are adults, and they should manage their own affairs. Who pays the tuition, etc. is none of my business or concern. That‚Äôs between the parent, their adult child, and the Registrar."
11673,"This.  

(I also work at a US University)"
11674,"Entitlement?? To personal privacy?? FFS.  

There‚Äôs no benefit from doing this, and are many negatives for the student.

If you have the means available and want to fund your child, then tell them hey here I‚Äôll give you funding for 4 years (2, 5, however many their degree requires) and it‚Äôs up to you to get your shit done and get a degree in that time.  If they mess up that‚Äôs on them.  Monitoring their every grade doesn‚Äôt help them.  Let them learn how to do things on their own."
11675,If they continue to fail classes there is no more funding because they get kicked out of school via academic disqualification
11676,Thanks for letting everyone know how shitty of a person you are lol
11677,How in the world would your professor even have a parent‚Äôs contact info (unless they already know them)? This is pretty wild.
11678,"If you're studying under a graduate student, comments are also incredibly helpful.

11682,Ha yeah I remember the pen and paper ones. Thank goodness it‚Äôs online now!
11683,"As a physics major, I don't really have a choice. More specialized classes for my minors and major only have one professor. I choose classes based on my preferred schedule, since I work in the evenings I have to be out of class by 2pm everyday. I still have 18 credit hours every quarter, so timing of classes is much more important to me than the professor. 

Also since it's the quarter system, if I don't like the prof I'll be out of the class in ten weeks."
11684,You don't use rate my professor? How do you choose your professor for new classes?
11685,"This isn‚Äôt just the case for grad students. If you‚Äôre a prof and you‚Äôre applying for a new job you have to provide these as well.

Edit: usually a job application will ask you to provide your most recent student evals covering an entire year. You can‚Äôt really pick and choose which ones to submit."
11686,[deleted]
11687,"I'm of two minds on formal student reviews, coming from the instructor side. All professors should be held accountable to how good of a job they do, and a good way of doing that is student ratings. In principle, it's a good system. 

The issue is how it translates into practice. All these things serve to do at present is act as another form inequality between folks like me, who jump around from contract to contract (and the lack of security is why I'm leaving teaching forever after this term), and the tenured professors who do an absolute shit job, give zero fucks about students, and laugh at horrible reviews when they come in.

Obviously those aren't mutually exclusive. But anyone who is a contract instructor right now is very likely doing it out of passion, because let me tell you, they aren't doing it for literally anything else. When your employment is inherently precarious, and you care about students, you pour a lot of soul into it. Very rarely do you see a tenured professor give a flying fuck about improving pedagogy. They download all of that shit, like everything else, onto the poorly paid and temporarily employed instructors trying to cobble together a living.

Someone else made a comment about biased questions. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the faculty union imposing a temporary alteration to how the questions are asked because a lot of students this year will complain or argue their instructor didn't do enough when this year has been so fucked. It's been as difficult for us as it has for all of you. Asking questions about teaching methods might actually be more reflective of effort rather than just, ""did this sort of satisfy your desire to take an in-person class?""

Just two cents from the other side. Please review your professors, but just be aware that depending on who your professor is, it may or may not matter. Tenure is not a structure that benefits students in any meaningful way, and I think it needs to be radically rethought."
11688,"It's a stress factor. It's *one more thing* I need remember to do and then do. Which during a time of the semester where I'm already stressed, isn't something I need nor want."
11689,"Your school may have also been trying to ask questions to remove the opportunity for bias against female and POC professors notoriously receive in evaluations, where their knowledge of material and so forth is dinged where white/male profs aren't. (Based on e.g. studying online courses with identical content but different prof personas introduced.)"
11690,"It is important to base your evaluation on things that are in the professor's control. At large universities with a high rate of adjunct usage (part time professors hired on a very short term basis for low pay with no job security), the administration only looks at the numbers at the end of the term. It is beyond unfair for someone to loose their livelihood because no one likes virtual learning and rated them low, despite the instructor having no control of the university's decision not to hold in person classes, and very little control over the fact that virtual class are almost always less personal and engaging."

11692,Yes please fill out your evaluations with SPECIFIC things you liked and didn‚Äôt like and specific suggestions.
11693,Good addition!
11694,"my school just sends emails to review courses. They know if lecturers would be reviewed, most of them would have to quit"
11695,"You‚Äôre thinking that rmp and the student evaluations have the same goal, which they do not. Rmp is to help students choose professors. The student evals are to give feedback to the professors and the school. Students won‚Äôt be able to see the results of those.

Edit: I just saw that at your school the students can see them. That‚Äôs not how it is where I am."
11696,"Same! I can unfortunately attest to this.

I just failed a class for the first time, and I didn‚Äôt formally review the professor. It wasn‚Äôt the professor‚Äôs fault; it was the class itself I had issue with. It was an online class and I just couldn‚Äôt learn with the way it was designed; it was designed very poorly.

My school‚Äôs formal reviews sometimes asks about the professor only, and sometimes ask about both the course itself and the professor. I looked at the one for the class, and unfortunately it only asked about the professor.

I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to review the professor in light of my failure. Without the avenue to officially criticize the class, I knew I‚Äôd find myself criticizing the professor unfairly."
11697,I'm too lazy to read all that so I just pick whatever classes are the most preferable for my schedule.
11698,"I wonder how this works for PhD students from other countries where we don‚Äôt get student evaluations? I know for sure some of our graduates have been hired in the US direct from PhD, so they mustn‚Äôt require them from everybody"
11699,"Well in a lot of cases I didn‚Äôt have many options for who I took, because of going to a small regional campus for my first 2 years, and my higher level classes at the main campus my last year were limited in who I could choose, so I just went with the classes that fit my schedule."
11700,"My physics profess actually had us do an assignment on this topic. It just looked at gender, but the website [here](http://benschmidt.org/profGender) let's you see how often certain words are used to describe a professor based on gender.

Many other words show similar bias."

The answer to racial bias isn‚Äôt to completely remove the critical parts of the survey, how are professors and departments supposed to improve if they aren‚Äôt allowed to take criticism? I‚Äôm sure department heads can tell if the criticism is legitimate or if it‚Äôs just racist/sexist, which I doubt there‚Äôs a lot of tbh"

11715,Mostly no but I‚Äôve started doing one thing I saw a friend do for my math classes. This man kept every assignment and every test he got back and put it in a binder. So he has massive binders for every math class he has taken going up to Calc 2 and linear algebra. It‚Äôs not really THAT useful but it can be depending on the class.

11735,No. I even have a bonfire and dance around my burning homework. Sometimes I cook s‚Äômores over them
11736,"Nah I know they're gonna be useless, I just wanna keep them anyways."
11737,"might be useful in case you need to revisit concepts from the class, too."
11738,Hit me baby one more time... with a PHD program
11739,"Love it, congratulations!"
11740,Thank you! I am so eager to finally be done
11741,Oh god. The feels are real. I'm trying to talk myself out of a PhD already.
11742,Michigan has a good business school

11745,Where are you graduating from? Im tryna build a list of business schools to look into myself
11746,you're getting a Monkey Basketball League?? ive always wanted one of those! sick uniforms btw!

11757,"Yep, and even moreso - I now live in Lafayette"
11758,"This one time, my dog really did eat my homework.  She ate my flash drive that contained all my work on my thesis. 85 pages worth, all in her stomach.

I was looking for the dam thing to print out my paper and email a copy of it to my advisor.  

cost me almost 2 grand I didn't have for the vet to fish it out of the part where her stomach meets the Intestines.  

I figured my advisor and the committee wouldn't belive my 15 pound pup would eat my homework, cuz ya know, oldest line in the book, and 14 hours before I was set to present it, ya know?

I sent an email to the advising committee that yes, my dog really did eat my homework.  My vet, being awesome- followed up with an email to the same people with the xrays of her stomach showing where the flash drive was before surgery.  

Thankfully that let me have a free pass and let me present 4 days later."
11759,Not wrong
11760,"Ok i gotta ask, when did this happen? cause i just presented my thesis earlier this year and i had multiple backups on the cloud and on emails during the whole process, am i just too paranoid? lol"
11761,I had several backups as well.  I just had updated them in a week- I should have been more paranoid that *something* would would happen.
11762,[The menace in all her glory](https://imgur.com/a/qaCyee1)
11763,I love this comment.
11764,I'm surprised too.  I got dam lucky it came out all in one piece and I recovered all my data.
11765,Yikes :0
11766,Amazing how it wasn't crushed when swallowed.
11767,For a thesis. this is the correct amount of paranoia.
11768,The dog is the hard drive
11769,Picture of dog pls
11770,"Even if the hard drive was damaged you could probably get data out if you went to a company with specialized equipment. But at that point it becomes prohibitively expensive just to recover an essay, not something like a masters thesis."
11771,Wish I could cross -post this on r/AnimalsBeingJerks but can't.
11772,[deleted]
11773,"You should be able to remove the hard drive. It's likely a sata drive, but definitely check first. It could either be m.2 drive or sata drive. You'll need a sata or m.2 case with a USB port and you'll be able to hook it up to any pc and take files off of it just like a flash drive. Good luck!"
11774,time to make your dog look for a job and fill out that job application
11775,"This is actually really out of character for her. Generally she‚Äôs well behaved since we go out of our way to burn her energy so she isn‚Äôt destructive. Honestly I think it was retaliation of us all having to go to another state for my niece‚Äôs birthday and her being left with a pet sitter. 

But yeah, definitely not leaving anything important in her reach if we ever have to leave for extended periods of time again."
11776,Oh my gosh! And I thought mine was insane when I had to wrestle a rock out of her mouth a couple weeks ago. I‚Äôm just convinced dogs are like toddlers and will attempt to eat anything and everything at least once haha
11777,"That‚Äôs what you get for focusing on your academics and not your dog 

Joking^ also my dog knows how to throw shit. She has knocked me out with her kong ball before and busted my lip for not paying attention to her while doing homework"
11778,"I mean, your rhetoric to describe the situation leads me to believe you may not have been doing your homework, despite your dog, uh, eating your delicious (?) laptop. 

&#x200B;

Next time I might even just recommend lying and saying you spilled coffee on your laptop and need time to recover the files from your drive."
11779,My dog ate my homework üö´ my dog ate my chrome bookü§£
11780,"my colleague's cat chewed through his computer cord, which caused the mother board to malfunction. 

And he doesn't ""believe"" in saving in the cloud (aka onedrive)."
11781,Omg this actually happened!
11782,"Haha she did her best! But thankfully all my work is on onedrive, so I‚Äôm able to just swap devices and login and have access again. It‚Äôs likely not worth attempted to salvage anything from this one, and my professors are chill with me using my ipad for assignments until I get a new laptop"
11783,"well thats good! My dog hears me complain and just lays her head across my laptop keyboard as if permitting a permanent break lol. 

Im lucky she hasnt tried anything crazy like this considering I had to stop her from eating a rock a week ago."
11784,r/mildlyinfuriating
11785,She was just trying to provide you with a cover story!! lol in all seriousness these pictures should do it. A few people mentioned about the hard drive so maybe like....idk best buy or something could help get the work you do have off of it? I know very little about technology
11786,"That is mortifying. When this happened I was all sorts of relieved that everything I had done was backed up on onedrive. This laptop is definitely beyond trying to fix, so until I got a quick replacement I was just able to continue to continue my assignments on my iPad. It doesn‚Äôt turn on and can‚Äôt even open properly anymore lol"
11787,Looks like the hard drives are still intact. You should recover most of the files.
11788,Same i get a daily check in to see if i‚Äôm experiencing any covid symptoms
11789,Wow. Well that‚Äôs unfortunate.
11790,"My university uses outlook as well! Does anyone have any ideas for how to keep your inbox clean? I was doing fine on Gmail, but then we transferred over to outlook and it is a complete mess of spam :("
11791,Yeah same. My university is starting next Tuesday and the emails slowly escalate lol.
11792,"outlook should have two tabs, focused and other. works fairly well for me"
11793,"I graduated in December and am still getting a flood of emails (some from my old advisor about classes I've already completed) I am continuing on for a masters but in a totally different field than my major, but still it's annoying. I suppose I could ask to be taken off their mailing list. I dunno. Happy mail sorting everyone."
11794,My focused tab is always full of random newsletters and schoolwide announcements that don‚Äôt require you to do anything. Meanwhile actual emails from specific people that need me to follow up on X are in ‚Äúother‚Äù
11795,"my college blows up my email every day about not filling out the form, and every day my ‚Äúpassword expires‚Äù. 

I graduated in december."
11796,"Hey, I work at a college. Is there another way you'd rather receive this information? At least where I work, we know we're overloading students with information, which means students are less likely to actually read it, but....we still need to get it out to you."
11797,[deleted]
11798,"I created folders in my inbox. I have folders for each subject, housing information, financial information, and then another folder for my job. I have found that organizing using the folders in outlook have helped so much!! It also helps when I need to go back and reference an email or just find one."
11799,"I highly recommend using Outlook's rule function. It is very similar to creating filters on Gmail if you are familiar with that. To start, I like to make categories for each of my classes, then under settings you can create your rules. I have a rule for each class, and all it does is assign the classes' category to emails sent from the professor/ta. It makes searching easier because you can search by category for all emails in one class, and it also makes the inbox easier to look at when all emails automatically are categorized and have their own color with them. You can expand on it to put those emails in their own folder instead of categorizing them but using rules can make it much easier to take control of your inbox."
11800,"I can understand preferring gmail, but Google Sheets over Excel? Docs over word? Oh hell no. Especially Excel. Excel is one of the most versatile software packages out there."
11801,"Why would this be a problem? It's e-mail. It's intended to be read when the recipient gets around to checking their e-mail. If you're trying to catch people before they leave for class for the day, then sending it early is reasonable. Some people are going to be out the door before 5 am."
11802,Already flooded. I have all emails duplicated to an email I actually check though so when I do check my uni email it has 300+ unread emails. But the 100 course update emails that I have to delete from my main are annoying just to get the one I actually did want.
11803,"My college sends us daily COVID ""symptom surveys"" to monitor if it's safe for us to go to class, and they haven't stopped throughout break. I've also gotten tons of various email updates about the study abroad program (cancelled, obviously), vaccine distribution on campus, internship opportunities, the works. It was slower around Christmastime, but it's been picking up a lot the past few weeks.   


But the symptom surveys. They haunt me."
11804,"My school uses gmail, and it‚Äôs a godsend"
11805,Same! Those MFs spammed me all break long!
11806,I hope it‚Äôs not worse than what I‚Äôm going through as a senior/junior in hs. I put my private email into common app and now that one is infected too.
11807,"I don‚Äôt mind how my college does it. 
Weekly college wide student email, I think it‚Äôs tuesdays. 
It‚Äôs kinda like a report: summarized headlines at the beginning. 

Sections, presented the same way each week, below. 

Mentions in the ‚Äúarticle‚Äù where we can dive deeper into the information. 
Then in our college software, it‚Äôs repeated, but filtered by department.  

Beginning of term always seems to be more information, for obvious reasons. 

They title the emails well too.  Orientation for first years, science dept vs business vs law etc.    It‚Äôs helpful for scanning and deleting confidently."
11808,"I have the outlook app on my iphone and if you open any email, click on the three dots at the top, the second option is move to focused/other. So you can move stuff between the two"
11809,"I usually love not getting emails, but I haven't even received info about what the school is doing about COVID. I assume it'll be the same as last semester but I'd prefer some confirmation. The only email I got was one of those ""welcome to the class, here's an early syllabus."""
11810,"Same. What‚Äôs even more annoying is Canvas glitching. Every time when a professor sends in an update, it shows up on my inbox 10 times in 10 different email notification."
11811,[deleted]
11812,I‚Äôve shot myself in the foot with all of my unread important emails over break and those bullets are about to hit me
11813,School has already begun for me and it feels like I never have time away from college lol. My email and online classes are an extension of me now.
11814,"I started classes last week and the two days leading up to the start day, my emails and Blackboard were absolutely empty. The moment I logged in and saw my Blackboard had 98 new things added and 7 new emails lol. Even just looking at that made me overwhelmed lol"
11815,Does your college send your symptom surveys at ungodly early hours?  My university loves to send them at 4-5 am.
11816,"It depends. I did get a lot of college app emails in HS, but honestly I personally feel for me it‚Äôs double the emails I got in HS on my college account."
11817,LOL. Administrators and staff were back at it January 4.
11818,"I have a student that vapes up a dust storm with his mic on during class. Zoom switches to him every time he inhales and exhales.

I am the host and choose not to mute him."
11819,I would have thought this was in the high school sub lmao. This whole thing says 18 year old freshmen to me.
11820,Why am I not surprised this happened at a theatre school...
11821,"Completely. University students can be so uppity. Like the professor didn‚Äôt even say shit, why was the other student even overreacting so hard?"
11822,"I'm not going to stereotype theatre people, but SOME theatre people have the biggest egos I've ever seen - like on a level that's just above all others. I've met other theatre people who are extraordinarily humble though!"
11823,"She needs to mind her business and find something better to complain about. But next time, mute your mic because depending on how strong your sound is, the whole class could probably have heard you snoring"
11824,doing god's work.
11825,[deleted]
11826,Lmao ikr. Still funny tho I‚Äôd kill for some action like that in my zoom classes
11827,"Gotta be honest, everyone in this story (except the prof) sounds extremely immature, OPs edit included"
11828,Good thing she never said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but...‚Äù
11829,The host can mute anyone
11830,"For sure! I'm willing to bet that the other students didn't actually give a shit about OP falling asleep in class, they just saw an opportunity to bring someone down a notch and kiss the professor's ass"
11831,"Can a host unmute someone? 

Asking for a friend"
11832,College students need to relax. Laugh it off instead of taking things personally ya know
11833,They can request for someone to turn on their mic or video but they can‚Äôt force them to unmute
11834,They're overreacting but in general you should keep your mic muted unless you need to talk. That's just basic video conference ediquete
11835,"As a HS senior, this is definitely the kind of shit kids I go to school with would get triggered about"
11836,"The girl shouldn‚Äôt have even said anything! That‚Äôs the job of the professor if they care enough to bring it up. 

OP, in the future, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with ignoring uppity people like that. There‚Äôs no point in justifying  because she wasn‚Äôt going to listen to you, she doesn‚Äôt care."
11837,"I don't get how kids care about that. At my school the thing was to fuck with kids that fell asleep, and sometimes the teacher would get in on it. Like freshman year one teacher would have us all clap whenever someone fell asleep so they'd wake up and just start clapping lmao"
11838,"If you don't talk much, stay muted always. Hold space bar to talk and while talking. When you release you are muted again."
11839,"Literally none of her business. The only person with any reason to be annoyed is your professor, but it sounds like they weren't upset anyway (not surprising, students fall asleep in class all the time in in-person lectures, I can't imagine how bad it is online). The rudeness to disrupt class to ""call you out"" is far above the rudeness of falling asleep.

I do agree with the other comments though, best practice is to mute your mic unless you want to say something. If you're using Zoom, unmuting is as simple as hold space."
11840,Tbh she sounds like a bitch that just wants to stir up trouble. You shouldn‚Äôt be worried.
11841,If they know how.
11842,usually either they a captain class or trying so hard to be A student
11843,You could light a bong in my online class and I wouldn't give a fuck
11844,"Seriously though.  I don't give a shit what other people do with their time as long as it isn't interfering with my education.  Falling asleep on a zoom call is one of the most harmless things I have ever heard of.  On top of that it isn't my or any other students responsibility to maintain order in the classroom and circumventing the professor (who does hold that responsibility) makes it look like they can't maintain order in the classroom.

Sincerely,

A tired engineering student with no fucks left to give"
11845,You're nicer than me. After the apology if she kept acting like a bitch I would got rude(r) with her. Fuck that
11846,The host can only unmute the person they chose to previously mute. The host cannot unmute someone that muted themselves.
11847,Stay on mute until you need to speak.
11848,I‚Äôm lowkey considering to start replying with ‚ÄúI disagree‚Äù type comments to start some spicyness on the discussion posts. I always feel super fake pretending I care about what others are posting about.
11849,I agree with your post because the way you did that thing. Umm. I‚Äôm just using filler words to get to the 200 word limit that I need so I can get full credit.
11850,"I mean, sure it‚Äôs busy work but it takes me less than 30 minutes to do and is basically a free A"
11851,This was my favorite thing to do when classes were fully online. I‚Äôd just straight up argue with people and tell them they‚Äôre wrong.
11852,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ you're hilarious!!
11853,"This. It‚Äôs dumb and stupid, but it‚Äôs not hard. Easy A."
11854,That's why a lot of professors have posts due by let's say Saturday and then the responses due a day later
11855,"this is literally what ive been doing because it adds some drama, points and a show all in one"
11856,"Thanks, I'm using this as a template for future discussion posts:)"
11857,We have the same thoughts. Oh my goodness. I‚Äôm searching for alternative language in order to reach the word limit of 200 words. Disclaimer I ‚Äútotally did not‚Äù plagiarize your comment because I resent discussion posts üòÇ
11858,"My students are required to give each other feedback that isn‚Äôt just positive (they have specific things to reply on each week). The idea is to help them brainstorm on their topics, writing, counter arguments, etc, instead of just saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs great!‚Äù They are usually annoyed the first few weeks (especially if they ignored the instructions, replied like they do in their other classes, and lost points), but eventually it works better. 

Also I posted this as a separate comment also, but in case anyone is interested, discussion boards fulfill the HLC‚Äôs requirements for ‚Äúsubstantive interaction between the students and the instructor,‚Äù which is required in online classes for your institution to be able to stay accredited."
11859,"theyre such a waste, but i only see them in fully online classes with no meetings."
11860,"Oh yeah, 100%. It adds virtually nothing to the discussion since no one actually wants to respond to other people. Most people just say ‚ÄúHi so and so! I agree with what you said about blah blah blah‚Äù

It‚Äôs such dull and bland work that typically doesn‚Äôt contribute anything noteworthy to the discussion."
11861,I especially hate the ones you have to reply to during the first week of class when everyone is introducing themselves. Idgaf about your hobbies or pets names
11862,"So my professor has the initial posts due at 11:59 at night and the responses due at noon the next day. Unfortunately, I have classes in the morning so I can‚Äôt respond unless I do it the day before.

Besides, I hate waiting until the last second to get my work done, so being required to respond to people who wait until the last second forces me to do the same."
11863,TOXICCCC I love itüò≠üò≠
11864,People in my class probably hated me but I was having a great time ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
11865,"""The American revolution began in 1776 when...""

""Wrong. Drop out of college. We'd all be better off."""
11866,Well jeeze that explains the redundancy and the requirement for discussion posts in general. It‚Äôs a system that works and colleges are too lazy to fix it essentially correct? Or they just haven‚Äôt come up with a decent alternative that works.
11867,"The funny thing is that I‚Äôve had teachers who explicitly say not to just respond with ‚ÄúI like your post‚Äù or ‚Äúgood job‚Äù, and then students do it anyway."
11868,"what can they do, press you up via email?ü•±"
11869,"Yes!!!!!! I know they make up a tiny portion of the final grade, but it's mindless work, so I don't mind it. & my classmates usually have good feedback."
11870,"Oh my, this brings back memories. Online class where no one else did squat until 5 minutes before the deadline, so too late for me to reply comment. Got an unjust poor grade and had to go over the teacher‚Äôs head to finally get the grade I deserved. Whole experience was exhausting and infuriating beginning to end."
11871,My art class has these and it is fully in-person. :‚Å†-‚Å†(
11872,"Just so you all know, discussion boards fulfill the ‚Äúsubstantive interaction between the students and the instructor‚Äù requirement for online classes by the Higher Learning Commission. Basically, they are a way to make sure that your college or university stays accredited (which is important for everyone involved). 

Most professors aren‚Äôt thrilled with them either. I‚Äôve found ways to make some of them marginally better (instead of generic responses, they have a more specific type of feedback they are giving each other), but they even then, some weeks it feels really forced."
11873,My professor has the post due on Thursday and the replies due on Sunday
11874,You didn't fulfill the minimum 50 word requirement. Please edit your comment for full credit.
11875,I‚Äôve definitely picked ones where I disagreed with them before. Way more entertaining to write.
11876,"When someone completely misunderstands the prompt or fails to construct a coherent sentence, I tell them; albeit as nicely as possible lol"
11877,Lmfao 6+ hours?
11878,"Yep, exactly. If my classmates are going to judge me for it, I‚Äôm probably never going to see or speak to them after the semester ends. My GPA will matter more in the end than some judgemental rando‚Äôs opinion of me."
11879,"I think its a nice gesture and works both ways. The professor is happy to see you engaged, and youre more likely to pay attention. Don‚Äôt feel bad"
11880,I feel weird looking at myself so i dont do it. but theres usually a bunch of students in my class who do turn on their cams so i dont feel bad if my cameras off
11881,[deleted]
11882,"I think worrying about being a ‚Äúkiss up‚Äù is more of a high school concern than a college one. You are going to be competing against some of your peers for scholarships, internships, and ultimately jobs. Who cares what they think? Do the best you can in school and if you make a good impression on the professors, even better. You might need a letter of recommendation from them one day or something similar."
11883,I feel bad if i don‚Äôt have it on. like the teacher prob feels like they‚Äôre talking to nothing
11884,"Lol. I‚Äôm one of the people who turns their camera on when no one else does and I agree with the people who say I‚Äôm sucking up.

I‚Äôm sucking up to get my borderline grades rounded up since professors aren‚Äôt doing it as much anymore."
11885,"Thr expressiveness can be super helpful, it was for me in HS, although apparently my eyes are an open book.

Though I'm a freshman, the one in person class I had my first semester the prof had no skill in reading the room. From forgetting the name of the variable to messing up the basic thing he was teaching (it was business calc 1 and I took AB in HS so the first few weeks was a lot of review.) He would keep going for minutes without noticing that everyone in the room was giving him a funny look. I passed that class with a C, because the lecturing wasn't great and there was only quizzes and exams with much higher difficulty than the material in the notes, with no intermediate learning and application."
11886,"Fuck every single student who called you a kiss up for just doing one little harmless favor for a professor. In high school, people seem to compare their status a lot with those of students. Those college students who care all have a high school mindset. If anything, you should be ahead of the curve and not caring what other students think of you. If it means they think you‚Äôre a dick, then so be it."
11887,"This is where its confusing for me: I'd love to open my video but this makes me prone to be asked by the prof and I'm just heavily struggling with the courses as it is, I know for a fact I wouldn't know the answer what with the weeks worth of workload I had to catch up on. In the end, I don't open my camera, my professor is sad, I'm sad (and feel guilty)"
11888,We do feel that way.
11889,"Well *someone's* gotta do it.

I prop my dog in my lap, and we have class together."
11890,"Everyone has their reasons and that's perfectly fine. It's no issue as long as you're not making fun of others for doing so.

But I will say, putting yourself in those uncomfortable positions where you will likely be embarrassed for not knowing the answer, is a great way to learn and improve."
11891,"In some of my classes, I have one classmate who always has her camera on. My whole class thinks she's the MVP because she's always engaged when most of us find it hard to like the teacher. Not based on grades, but I also believe she's the smartest person in our class. 

If people think you're being a kiss-up, they're wrong and don't mind them. You're just a kind empathetic person; don't let them take that away from you by their awful sense of misjudgment. Sounds like a them problem."
11892,"I get distracted when I look at myself, so I‚Äôve started to turn on speaker mode instead of gallery mode while keeping my camera on. Keeps me ‚Äúaccountable‚Äù to stay focused since my camera is on, but allows me to just focus on the prof!"
11893,"As someone who facilitates Zoom meetings for work, but particularly with high school students, I do appreciate those who turn on their cameras. However, I do recognize those who don't and their vast diversity of reasons for not doing so. I initially get frustrated that students do not turn on cameras, but I became more accepting as I noticed the many types of reasons why cameras are off.

In your case, I am sorry to hear fellow classmates may think you're brown nosing. I can see why they do so. In my opinion, college students are generally insecure and that can come out in weird ways. However, if I was your professor and you might ask me to be a recommender for a future job, I would be much more willing to AND effective in doing so simply because I would know what you look like."
11894,"Same, the camera makes me too hyper aware of how people are seeing me that I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôll only truly focus when my camera is off unfortunately"
11895,You can turn off self view in Zoom so you don't have ro stare at your face.
11896,"Fuck it, be a kiss-up. I'm here to get a good education, and make good grades. The professor liking me makes that much easier."
11897,"I agree with your last comment there, unfortunately I'm too much of a wuss to try xD I tried once where I told my whole group +prof that I'm behind but I wanna contribute, and all of them said that it's fine and that the class is there so that we learn on what we don't know. Felt pretty good after that honestly"
11898,"I am a student. 

My camera stays off, why? Because I'm ugly, possibly have some sort of dysmorphia, I stim by swaying back and forth, and I can't go too long looking at myself or knowing that other people are looking at me without having some sort of panic attack. It's honestly for the best.

I only turn on mine for tests. Do I feel bad, that they feel like they're talking to the void? Yes--But we also have like 25+ other students. They can get the webcam out of them. 

I don't care what other students do with their camera. If you're a ""kiss up"", that's you. What does it matter to me? Your classmates are weirdos lol

Then again, I've had that ceitiscm before because I was engaged and answering questions whether wrong or right in a class I was in. Eventually you get over it and realize that most won't remember you past that semester (I think. I don't remember them at least). 
 If I *wanted* to be up under a professor, I would do those things too. 
Tbh, I like when others have in their webcam because it takes the heat off of others.

Overall? People just need to let others do what they want without judgement. If you want to keep on your webcam during lectures because it helps them learn or they want to help a professor out? Awesome!

Someone else doesn't? Also awesome! Doesn't mean they value their education any less. Maybe they got a dysfunctional home life or they're not in an appropriate area."
11899,"To be fair it's easy to be seen as a ""kissup"" by those equally unhappy with their current academic experience - having your camera on when trying to make the most of your education doesn't make the most out of your education as one thinks, apart from imminent teacher biases. It provides a good sense of illusion feeling like your presence is 'there' with the professor though.

Whatever makes you feel like you're getting the most out of that, I guess?"
11900,I don‚Äôt turn my on because all the traffic going on at my house.
11901,"As a prof., I do not view this as a kiss-up move by a student.  I find it very respectful.  Teaching online is hard.  Many profs miss the student interaction.  I love when students (even just one) turns their cameras on.  Most students never turn their cameras on and type their questions and responses.  I absolutely hate that.  

You are doing the right thing and I can assure you that your prof. appreciates it!"
11902,"Yeah, this is an advantage. You'll be looked on favorably by the prof, and might get some extra marks down the line. Stupid not to, really."
11903,"I'd disagree. Having your camera on does allow you to get more out of it. You are subjecting yourself to participation by being available to answer questions when asked. Prof is going to engage with the students who appear to be attentive (i.e camera on and seemingly paying attention). Answering questions and participating is arguably a great way to learn for most. This isn't high school where the teacher will call on the students who aren't paying attention. Profs are there to assist those who want to learn and improve.

Camera off is the COVID equivalent to sitting in the back of the classroom with a hoodie on and refusing to speak."
11904,You likely not the only one struggling in the course! If the prof calls on you you can have a dialogue with them on what you don't understand and ask questions you self to try and figure it out.
11905,You are also more likely to pay attention if your camera is on than if not! Just like students who sit front and center in actual lecture halls tend to retain more information and be more engaged with the materials. You are doing great!
11906,"From the teaching side, the presence or absence of confused looks dictates 90% of the pace, unless people are really vocal in the chat about whether they understand things (they never are ime). I try to get around it a bit through frequent Zoom polls which are basically ""Do you need me to repeat this? Yes/no"" but even then, it's no substitute for expressions about every sentence, concept, etc. So the students with their cameras on inevitably get the class tailored to their understanding, regardless of whether they say they need more explanation (at least the way I teach).

Also, if you're on Zoom you don't need a post-it note, you can hide self-view! I don't do this when teaching bc I need to make sure students can see everything, but I turn it off the rest of the time."
11907,This is the real MVP-level stuff right here.  That would make my day!
11908,"Bro i feel that wholeheartedly, o-chem is brutal that way. The blood, sweat, and tears required for a 80+ is very real, but it's worth it. Congrats!!"
11909,TYSM!! AND YES IT IS
11910,"First off, I FEEL YOU! Chem has been hell this semester, but I‚Äôll be damned if I don‚Äôt pursue an A so I literally try my best and glue myself to the monitor during the 3 hour zoom lectures twice a week and look at outside resources like yt.

Second, that‚Äôs freaking amazing! Be extra proud because that was all of your hard work finally showing! An 86 is great!!!

Keep it up nice and steady and take care of your mental health üôè"
11911,Oof I'm taking orgo next semester. That's another ride I'm not excited about.
11912,Nuh uh everyone knows an 86 is a good grade! Congrats
11913,i have my chemistry exam next week. i‚Äôve gotten a C on the prior two so hopefully the final exam is better. congrats my man
11914,THANKSS
11915,"Damn I misread the title haha, still applies! Orgo was the only class I wasn‚Äôt able to procrastinate in, make sure you‚Äôre writing down the reactions and mechanisms onto flashcards or whatever as you learn them. You got it!"
11916,Chem is no joke.
11917,"Ayo 86 is p fucking good, props to u my g. Keep going!"
11918,"Congratsss to you too!! College-level chem really is no walk in the park, but the hard work pays off!"
11919,"86 in Chem is really good

Is this general chem or orgo chem?"
11920,same to you. all my homies hate Chemistry
11921,"Lmao in high-school I would be grateful for a 75 on a Chem test, much less an 86 in college. Good shit!ü§ô"
11922,"That's the thing with college, you don't have to be smart but you do have to put in the work to achieve the grade you want. Then you lose all that information the first year out of graduation. Fun times."
11923,At my college the chem dept. is notorious for having the hardest classes in STEM. An 86 is hella impressive! Genuinely huge congrats!
11924,Same I've gotten C's on the other two as well! I wish you all the luck.
11925,"@me realizing this now, a week away from our cumulative final ü§°"
11926,Damn. I only got a 76 in Chem. Congratulations. Chem is a duck to learn online. Clearly you have superior chemistry knowledge. üéâ we must celebrate with copious amounts of ale!!!
11927,I loved orgo. It was way easier than gen chem 1-2 imo
11928,"Congrats!! That's so great. I read somewhere that the smarter you get, the smarter you get. Because intelligence is malleable, the more you develop it, the better results you'll experience. You're on your way."
11929,Bro that is amazing I remember when I took chem I needed a 85 studied and skipped hella other classes just to go to. A school tutor I got a 86 shit was so damn hard
11930,"that was me for the previous exam and I just took the final! I got low C's on the other exams and my grade was really showing this. I knew I had to fix it, so I studied a week in advance and it paid off! I tried to do the same for this exam, but we'll see!
anyway, I'm glad to see it! well done!"
11931,girl 86% in chem is basically a 150% LOL good job!!!
11932,"You‚Äôve got this, I got a C on my first one and managed a mid 80 on my final."
11933,Thank you! I definitely will be keeping a fresh stack of index cards with me.
11934,Im so proud of u! Keep it up.
11935,general chem!
11936,"Yes, ours too üò≠ The curves also do no justice."
11937,\~\\(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)/\~ YEE
11938,"I have so much respect for people who actually major in something they want to! Congrats to you for doing this. Rude people are everywhere unfortunately, as long as you‚Äôre happy with your choice and working hard, that‚Äôs all that matters!"
11939,"I'm accounting. I consistently just get ""ew."""
11940,"psych ‚Äî ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre going to work with crazy people?‚Äù ‚Äúcan you read my mind?‚Äù ‚Äúmy grandmother hears voices, should she take antidepressants?‚Äù

coincidentally wanted to go into elementary ed (but ended up not getting accepted) ‚Äî ‚Äúwhat a waste of potential to become a teacher‚Äù

big oof on the last one

edit: just remembered, i was in an Uber once and the driver found out i was studying psych, so he went on a 15-minute tirade about how dyslexia and adhd and other things are fake because ‚Äúin the past people didn‚Äôt have all these we just coped‚Äù....... uh okay........"
11941,People actually say that?! That‚Äôs... really something.
11942,Psyc major here. My favorite was definitely when an old man told me while I was working as a cashier that I‚Äôm not going to find a job. I told him I plan on going for my phd and he told me his wife worked in psychology for 10 years and hated it. He told my coworker she wasn‚Äôt going to find a job as a speech pathologist (communications major) as well. Apparently you can‚Äôt find a job if you aren‚Äôt an engineering major /s
11943,THANK YOU!
11944,Lol I‚Äôm a linguistics major and I get shit from all my friends about it. Like I already understand my job opportunities are shit I don‚Äôt need you to tell me again haha
11945,"""I'm a math major""

""Oh I hate math""

That's one I get alot. Like wtf? What if I did that with another major

""I'm an architecture student""

""Oh I hate buildings"""
11946,"Luckily I haven't had many rude comments, but as an English major I've gotten a lot of ""what are you planning to do with that?"" or ""do you want to be a teacher?"" (No, I don't know for sure what I want to do but I'm thinking maybe an editor. I hate public speaking and I'm not good with kids so being a teacher is out for me)

I did get a pretty rude comment as a biology major though. Basically my Calc teacher told me in front of the whole class that what I was studying wasn't ""real science"" and I'll never need his class anyway. Sucks cause before that I thought he was a pretty cool guy"
11947,I'm STEM as well and trust me we don't give a shit about thermodynamics either
11948,"It's such a backhanded compliment and I don't get it.

One girl at my school was majoring in forensics like my twin sister and then decided to switch to Elementary Ed because it was ""easier."" 

She didn't realize she was behind 7 classes and had to do practicums and dropped out of the major after the first practicum course.

I don't like that people underestimate the rigor of an education degree. It's definitely not the same as STEM degrees but I don't think they're comparable."
11949,"It sounds like a lot of these responses are coming from other college students. It's just a sign of immaturity and trying to reassure themselves more confidently in their choice of major. Take one good luck at an education degree and you will see a lot of practicum classes, which is basically field work."
11950,People will say ew but most of the accounting people I meet are down to earth cool guys and gals.
11951,"Yep, I‚Äôm a Poli Sci major and all of my closest friends are STEM. I get shit for it constantly. Sorry I don‚Äôt care about thermodynamics, but I‚Äôm glad you do."
11952,"At one point I was thinking about doing a dual degree in English and Russian history (yes I know the stereotype) and someone at a party told me ""Oh, that's so *vanilla.*""
To this day, I have no idea how Kevin was expecting me to respond to that. 
How about we all respect each other's academic choices? Like, just tell me it's cool if you have nothing nicer to say and move on."
11953,"I'm forensic chem and I always get ""What's that?"" and ""Wow you must be really smart!"" I do like the people whose follow-up question is ""Like CSI?Àú because it's really not.

Also, you can most definitely be a kick-ass forensic scientist! Fuck those people!"
11954,‚ÄúCan you read my mind?‚Äù Lmao that‚Äôs an interesting one
11955,"yeah i‚Äôve heard ‚Äúewww‚Äù and ‚Äúoh so you must be really good at math.‚Äù i just tell them it‚Äôs nothing fancy, just a couple derivatives and volumetric integrals here and there"
11956,Ugh people who think that their anecdotal evidence actually means anything are so annoying... ‚ÄúMy cousin did that job and left after 6 months...‚Äù So? I‚Äôm not your cousin!
11957,womens and gender studies.... you can probably imagine lol
11958,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a crazy misunderstanding to have if you‚Äôre not remotely involved in the fashion/television industry. People not involved generally have no reason to know about the nuances of the field.
11959,"Lol I'm majoring psych as well and the worst one I ever got was ""I heard only crazy people want to work with crazies. Are you crazy"" um no I have mental health struggles that will make me a better fit to help others in my shoes"
11960,Wait there‚Äôs a specific stereotype for a mix of English and Russian history? What is it? Also is that combo common or why did that person say it‚Äôs ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù?
11961,"I mean that one doesn‚Äôt sound rude, just clarifying. The label does sound like it‚Äôs focussed on the creation of clothes. And people have no reason to know what types of courses you take from the name alone."
11962,‚ÄúGreat sounds like there‚Äôs an opening!‚Äù
11963,"Your major *is* noble. You're working towards shaping the minds of the future. That's a pretty big fucking deal. Like imagine where the world would be if we didn't have teachers. And just because your major is academically heavy doesn't mean its meaningless or lesser. Like I said your going to be building the future through your work. 

I always find it amusing how people shit on necessary jobs. Like bitch did you and every other person in college not have to go through k-12 first. 

Anyways I don't really get condescending or rude remarks on my major cuz I'm an engineering major and (like you said) people tend to think higher of that  (for stupid reasons). 

I think you picked a great major. I've always wanted to be a teacher but I'm planning on that being my late career/retirement job now. Cuz I do still wanna do it I just feel like I need to do engineering first."
11964,"... 

> nothing fancy

*goes on to talk about some fancy math stuff*"
11965,"Ah yes, a woman's only true purpose in life: to prepare for a family, then raise said family 

/s"
11966,oh so you hate men?????? /s
11967,"First of all, elementary ed is a great major and it's an awesome choice.

I'm a forensic anthropology major and I get mixed results when I tell people. Some people say it's cool, some people have no idea what it is and stare blankly, and some people say something like 'Oh my sister majored in anthropology and now she's a bank teller.'

Like great, yeah, I totally want to know that. That's super helpful and supportive.

(My favorite is being able to explain to them what it is and be like ""I take pictures of decomposing bodies"" bc my school has a body farm.)

I think some people think of anthropology as one of those ""SJW waste-of-money degrees"" which it's NOT. We talk a lot about human rights and humanity in the classroom but I'm also focused on the forensic part so I'm climbing through leaves and around trees to put donor bodies in our decomp facility and come back to document scavenging activity and studying skeletons in the lab.

It'd be great if people who have no knowledge of our fields would just say ""oh that's cool, tell me about it"" and save us from their opinions on our lives."
11968,"any tips for people who are shy talking to strangers? i‚Äôm a college student, just transferred to a big school and i know i need to meet people and network, but i don‚Äôt want to come on too strong or scare people. what would you suggest?"
11969,"That‚Äôs great! Something similar happened to me freshman year and I ended up with a group of 8 close friends. We would go out to eat together, go shopping, see movies, etc. I‚Äôm also introverted and hadn‚Äôt had so many people around since I was in elementary school. Unfortunately all but one of those people either dropped out or transferred to another school by our junior year. It‚Äôs just me and one other girl now getting ready to graduate. We were the only two that really put any effort into our work or found time to study together. 

From my experience, I just suggest making sure you prioritize having some down time as well. Having so many friends definitely boosted my confidence, but I also found it to be quite mentally exhausting and it took some time away from my school work. Also, a group that big is bound to have drama. Stay away from talk like that. It can only lead to bad things. Good luck with this year!"
11970,"for me all it really took was saying hi. also people love receiving compliments, so I start by telling them I like something they‚Äôre wearing. the conversation usually flows naturally from there. best of luck to you!!"
11971,i‚Äôve had the opposite issue
11972,Ahhh you're living my dream! I'm moving in 12 days and I really hope I can start being more talkative!
11973,"I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre having a good time. I think something that happens to a lot of people when they go to college is that they aren‚Äôt bogged down with first impressions that they made with people in high school. When you are first meeting the people you go to high school with, it can be at a time where your social skills/confidence aren‚Äôt in the best place. Going to college and getting away from all of that can help a lot."
11974,"It‚Äôs just called being friendly and kind to people, and giving off good energy no matter what you look like"
11975,Honestly I‚Äôm always worried that if I talk to random people they‚Äôll probably ignore me. Maybe I need to be more like you
11976,Yo this is more or less what I did freshman year. I was super shy but just got extremely out of my shell the first couple weeks and it payed off
11977,Yeah attractiveness is only ever a factor if you‚Äôre an extreme (very unattractive or very attractive).
11978,I found college kids pretty eager to make new friends and it was a great change from the shit that happens in high schools.  Congrats and enjoy!
11979,"everyone i‚Äôve spoken to seems to appreciate me being the first to approach. maybe don‚Äôt think about it too much, you‚Äôll be fine"
11980,Lol same. Good group of friends in high school. Struggling in college.
11981,Join clubs or other groups if you want to meet people on a repeated basis. This is the easiest way to make friends in a big place.
11982,Teach me your ways
11983,I ended up going to a school with a lot of cliques actually cause people know each other from hs
11984,I know how it‚Äôs like I also am trying to change my role and have been talking to so many people idk what their names are but the truth is I want to have good friends like more a family kinda friends people you can rely on but still I‚Äôm going to keep trying til I get there and I wish you good luck
11985,good luck to you!!
11986,"lol all it really took was saying hi. also people love receiving compliments, so I start by telling them I like something they‚Äôre wearing. the conversation usually flows naturally from there. everyone‚Äôs new so i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll appreciate meeting someone."
11987,"The first year is usually the best time to make friends. Everyone is looking for people to chill with and they won't say no unless you truly are a dick. 

Plus since you are all in the same program(I assume) you can have a huge study group and help each other out for classes."
11988,"It will dwindle it always does...... If you only knew my child


I'm super happy for you though that freshman fanfare is fun and exciting enjoy it 



But I was serious about the dwindling, 4 months in and the gc is drier than a desert,


4 semesters in and now there are only half of you 


Senior year and the group of 4-5 left are your real ones no questions asked blood homies 



And trust me you won't want to change that outcome for the world, it's great

11989,"I can relate. I‚Äôm also a bit of an introvert, but I also find myself to be the one initiating conversation. I don‚Äôt dare call myself an extrovert, I just attribute it to having good social skills."
11990,THIS!
11991,"Nice, but remember not to get burnt out. It happens."
11992,I‚Äôm so happy for you ü•∫
11993,Fair play to you! This is great.
11994,I‚Äôm still looking forward to it
11995,Are any of your friends commuters ?
11996,"Yeah making friends in college/uni is a lot easier IMO, people tend to have more in common and nobody is trying to out-do anyone for the most part."
11997,If i see a group of students passing by I would overthink so much lol
11998,Also Fauci: just kidding ahaha....... unless?
11999,"I hope we do. But per the article (Dr. Fauci)

‚ÄúMy optimistic side tells me that we'll be able to renew to a certain extent, but it's going to be different. Remember now because this is not going to disappear,"" Fauci said. ""So we're going to have to have in place the capability of doing the things that we talk about all the time on this stage, to identify, to isolate, to contact trace ‚Äî number one. Number two, by that time, we'll have a better feel with the antibody test about what the actual penetrance of this infection was in society."" 

Let‚Äôs hope we continue developing these tools to make returning in the fall possible."
12000,zoom classes kinda suck a lot
12001,"I am NOT doing another semester of Zoom University. If we‚Äôre still doing this shit by then, I‚Äôll be doing Zoom Community College"

12003,not having school in the fall is not an option we gotta kick this shit by june
12004,I would love that. Because right now I'm already preparing to take a long break if that isn't true.
12005,Freshman 15 about to become a College 50
12006,Covid 19 pounds
12007,I fucking hope so.
12008,"Yeah I miss my classmates, also as someone who dropped out of college a few years ago and am righting that wrong, it felt damn good to be back in school walking on campus and going to class, being a college student. I just love that feeling. I hope I get it again in the fall."

12011,üò≥üôà
12012,Try just posting modules with more work than normal and saying they‚Äôre available through zoom office hours
12013,At the same time I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for tons of non immuno-compromised students to be out of school and normal life for so long. I already feel like I‚Äôm going insane. There‚Äôs no good solution tbh. I hate that there even has to be a decision like that
12014,Yeah I know so many people who just won‚Äôt go back to school and take a semester off if that happens.
12015,"How, though? How are we supposed to cram students into classrooms without a vaccine?"
12016,"not sure what you mean, that's what vaccines are for"
12017,Idk about your state but I‚Äôm in nyc and our streets are literally ghost towns. We‚Äôve been social distancing for weeks now so I‚Äôm hopeful we‚Äôll start seeing good results very soon.
12018,">by that time, we'll have a better feel with the antibody test about what the actual penetrance of this infection was in society.

Nothing's set in stone, but by then we'll have a good idea of how many people have had the disease and how much we can rely on a herd immunity. If you have a compromised immune system, though, you'll likely have to find alternatives to in-person school until we get a vaccine."
12019,Your professors are using zoom? Must be nice
12020,"My issue is that it doesn't seem possible to shut down schools and businesses until we get a vaccine. People, governments, and companies don't have the money, food, and resources to quarantine 12-18 months waiting for a vaccine. There's risk in everything we do, and maintaining society seems worth the risk to me, so long as we manage the crisis to the point where our healthcare system can keep up. 

We're not going to reopen most of society until the disease rates have died down. That's why we're monitoring infection rates and preparing antibody tests. Most immunocompromised people are aware of their conditions. Beyond that, everyone needs to decide how much risk they can live with and how much they can put their life on hold."
12021,I agree with this statement
12022,"I can't imagine what could be worse than Zoom. Webex comes pretty close, though.

Edit: My prof for mechanism design is using Webex because he claims that he can't get his laptop to work with Hangouts/Meet.

His laptop is brand new and runs Windows lol. Help your profs understand the software if you can, it'll make everyone's lives easier."

12026,"It‚Äôs considered better to limit going out as much as possible. The more you drive, the more you‚Äôll need to get gas, which could expose you to more germs/people. It‚Äôs like, technically you‚Äôre allowed to go out grocery shopping every day if you want, but they‚Äôre recommending you do big trips once in a while rather than several small trips. So I think it‚Äôs similar sentiment here."
12027,"I hope this August, I will be back in school. Real school."
12028,There are many people who can only afford to eat once a day. I think my friend told me she only had like 30 meals for 6 weeks left in the semester. They shouldn‚Äôt shame you like that especially when you‚Äôre only eating once a day.
12029,Unrelated but my university also stopped putting out thousand island dressing and you bet your ass I‚Äôm going to try this concoction tonight.  Thank you.
12030,"The student athletes at my university would probably actually die if the staff there acted like this. These dudes are coming in, drenched in sweat with their stomachs GRUMBLING so loud and these big gallon jugs for water. Like, if homie wants to eat three burgers in one go, he can have at it. I eat like a small bird anyway, but I‚Äôve never felt like any of the folks here eat so much that it takes away from anyone else. Why call it all you can eat if it‚Äôs not actually all you can eat???"
12031,Dude as someone who has recovered from an ED and used to be over weight if someone told me I was eating too much it would fuck me up I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you
12032,"#ALL YOU CAN EAT ^*

12033,Were you taking multiple helpings that other people wanted? Once I was waiting in line for a basket of french fries for a good 15 minutes. The guy in front of me took the last two basket helpings. I was starving and livid :(
12034,"No man, I was taking a little of everything each time."
12035,thx man for your comment
12036,"I got so much shit for being 140lbs and eating like I was for 4 at 6'2"""
12037,thx man for your support
12038,"As a former dining hall worker, I can see why someone would think this is making a mess (people would fill big ass BOWLS to the brim with ketchup for fries and use less than a quarter), but kicking someone out when they're clearly mixing it into a sauce is dumb

And even then, unless you're getting it all over the table sauce takes like 2 seconds to clean off. It's the plate that got stuck behind the trashcan for a week that's rough"
12039,"Great on you for standing up to yourself! If it‚Äôs advertised as an all-you-can-eat dining hall, then it‚Äôs literally in the name. You have every right to eat there and you have every right to not get harassed while eating there. I‚Äôm so sorry, OP ‚ù§Ô∏è I would love to ease your concerns, but I‚Äôm not sure if the dining staff is petty enough to do that, but to be on the safe side, try not to interact with them as much as possible and definitely stand up for yourself again if they try it!"
12040,"At my university, next year live-in employees are given only 10 meals/week. It‚Äôs borderline criminal."
12041,OP said he could only afford 1 meal a day there. If you're gonna eat a day's worth of calories all at once then yeah it's gonna be a lot. But it's just going to be the same amount of food and not spread out over 3 meals.
12042,"no man, there was always plenty of food around. Also, the staff to student ratio was always big, even on the busy days."
12043,"To your point about retaliation:

They won‚Äôt do shit. 

It‚Äôs actually extremely easy to tell if your food has been tampered with in the ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù ways, but that‚Äôs not a problem at a buffet style place. They‚Äôre not going to poison you or anything for escalating a complaint. 

I‚Äôve been in the service industry a long time, and fucking with people‚Äôs food is much, much, much less common than people seem to believe. If we do it and get caught (at least in my state) it‚Äôs an instant felony 2. No single complaint is worth that.

While our industry infamously employs felons, a felony for food tampering would pretty much guarantee you never work again."
12044,"man this is my worst fucking nightmare. Everytime I go into the dining hall and get some lunch I swear to god I feel eyes on me constantly, like they're all silently judging me. If they ever verbally said something I would collapse"
12045,If he paid for it then he can eat all he wants
12046,Dining hall staff are often chill. It‚Äôs unfortunate what happened to you. But maybe you are unknowingly being inconsiderate hoarding food from other students who need to eat.
12047,i was thinking this exactly!!!! currently attempting recovery from anorexia and if someone came up to me and said i was eating too much i think i‚Äôd lose it lol
12048,"yes, we had to pay around 12 bucks each time for a either lunch or dinner or breakfast"
12049,I think they‚Äôre asking because it‚Äôs possible OP could be experiencing discrimination
12050,It's not OP's concern if other students have food. That's on the dining hall to be providing enough. OP paid for all you can eat food.
12051,"Do you have to pay each time you go to the dining hall? I know at restaurants with buffets, it's kind of an unspoken expectation that people will leave after 1 meal. Not saying that what they did to you was fair, because it really sounds like it wasn't. I just wonder if the workers think the same rules apply there at the college. At restaurants, the concern is that if everybody did that, the restaurant would make so much less money. But I imagine the food company at your university is under a contract and the workers wages are fixed, so idk, there doesn't seem to be any legit reason for them to not let you be there for as long as you want"
12052,"And I‚Äôd be willing to bet they just toss leftover food in the garbage at night. Such a scam. I would go to my dining hall with my backpack filled with tupperware and empty milk jugs/ cereal boxes and go to town. College is a rip off to begin with, I took every single cent back that I could."
12053,Honestly... this sounds like it could be a juicy lawsuit if they continue to discriminate against you for whatever reason.
12054,"sometimes at my all you can eat dining hall i sit there and study for like 6-8 hours and eat multiple meals on one meal swipe 

i‚Äôm sorry you had experiences like that"
12055,? many schools have AYCE dining halls
12056,and why does his ethnicity matter???
12057,"This kind of stuff really ticks me off.  Kudos to you for standing up for yourself.  You're well within your right to have at it!  Those meal plans aren't cheap!  If they act any differently then that's on them.  I pray that they wouldn't but man, that really irks me.  Again, good for you and keep eating! That food ain't free!"
12058,Inb4 the mods come and remove this post because you have disturbed their echo chamber of sunshine & rainbows. But yeah I feel you. I‚Äôve felt this all 4 years of college.
12059,"Sounds like either you are a great writer, or your professors are not doing their jobs by grading professionally.

If it is the formal, then perhaps challenge yourself with more advanced projects. If it is the latter, then I don't know what to tell you..."
12060,"College honestly just sucks, and I've grown to accept that especially in the Covid era. I've had half my college career sucked up by online classes. Luckily I have the credits to get out of this hellscape a semester early but I'm feeling similar to you lol so you're not alone!"
12061,Yeah same. But honestly I‚Äôll be alright. I just want my degree because it‚Äôs going to give me a ton of opportunities
12062,"I felt that for a while. I felt like I was losing real skills for well, bullshit ones. I think you need to do something creative, an outlet for yourself. Even if you can't/ don't want to draw, or paint, or journal, try something! Even volunteering. Something to apply yourself in a fun, challenging, evolving way. Have you applied to internships? 

As for sympathy, it was hard for me to connect with my younger cousin freaking out about 500 words while I am trying to get 10 pages done. I think you can still be kind to them and let them know how much you are working on and as they grow what they can expect. Her shocked Pikachu face at my essay always made my day and made her feel like she could do hers. I think that will help reconnect you guys. 

Sometimes it's the simple things."
12063,Ive always been considered a good writer. I've never had a problem with it.. Now math on the other hand... üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
12064,"College honestly destroyed my work ethic and motivation, and frankly I am not the same person because of it. 

Day after day after day of spending hours and losing sleep over assignments that ended up graded by computer. I had maybe 2 great professors and the rest was all spent teaching myself every thing at best, and at worst dealing with psychotic ego tripping professors intentionally being hard to work with. 

I used to be so excited to learn and got immense satisfaction from a hard days work. Well that got absolutely ruined"
12065,Whether or not something else is harder doesn‚Äôt detract from the fact being burnt out is being burnt out.
12066,"I have a huge passion for music, but was told to take a degree in Civil Engineering instead. Going into second year and I'm starting to see it as a ""Just a degree"".

At first it was the usual ""Have class, do assignments, exam, rinse and repeat"" activity where I can just go along with it and hopefully pass. Eventually it got to a point where I'm starting to decline mentally since I had to juggle between my passion and the course.

It got worst when for the first time ever, me and my coursemate was enrolled into a C Programming class. It was fucking hard... The lecturer was horrible at pointing out programming mistakes and the students there are at high level of pain to work with. Considering I have two more years, I'm bound to meet these mentally draining subjects and people.

All I could say for now is I'm losing it. I'm very afraid of graduating with my love for learning gone down to the drain. The only driving force is to not disappoint and waste my parent's effort

I still believe it's worth it, I just hope it stays that way"
12067,"Ok, let me explain this. I am completely sympathetic normally. That's why I said it's my fault and not his, because I remember high school. Wasn't the greatest experience. I get where he's coming from.. I'm literally just in a weird spot right now where I think I'm burned out so I'm just being a crappy human.. And at this point I'm in too deep with my degree now so now I'm trying to refocus and pull my act together. Sometimes though you just gotta vent. I know this is temporary and I'll look back in ten years from now and be glad I stuck with it."
12068,"I get how you‚Äôre feeling, I have thoughts about dropping out, I mean I‚Äôm not gonna do it, I don‚Äôt want to do it cause honestly I don‚Äôt know what the heck else I‚Äôd be doing if I didn‚Äôt go to college, I‚Äôm gonna be honest I have failed a lot in school. I had to retake almost every class, and have to learn new skills like time management. But I think it‚Äôs worth it, cause I think everything is leading up to me being the person I want to be, and yeah I‚Äôm pretty exhausted, and sometimes I wish things were easier, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to work for tuition, I wish I could spend all my time devoted to school because right now that‚Äôs all I care about. But tough shit I guess, I gotta keep pushing, and that‚Äôs all there really is to it."
12069,That's a great ability to have. Perhaps you should figure out what you're interested in/passionate about and focus on those.
12070,[deleted]
12071,That's the spirit.
12072,"I completely agree with you. I am in the second semester of my senior year, and I am a shell of the person I used to be. I am depressed every day. I am extremely stressed out all the time. I cry multiple times a day and have since I started college. I have fought through it because I want to create a better life for myself (1st gen) but it has been really hard. Try talking to a therapist through your school. I do that and it helps A LOT. Also,  make time to do things that you enjoy and try to stay on top of your assignments. Create a specific workspace that is for work only. Make sure you are finding ways to spend time with supportive friends. It is very hard with COVID, but I have been hanging out with my coworkers (socially distanced) after work and I just talk through stuff with them, we play guitar, generally shoot the shit, etc. It really helps my mental health to have a space that is completely separate from college. Different town, different people, structured environment. I agree that college is not a healthy place to be, especially as a nontraditional student (I was never able to live in a dorm, I drive an hour to get to school every day and still live with my family) Ultimately, do what is best for you, and take your mental health seriously. Do not listen to the people who are disagreeing with you in the comments. Your feelings are valid and heard."
12073,"Dude I feel you whole heartedly. I miss waking up at the Crack of dawn and throwing coffee on , walking in to class, and interacting with the person in charge of my education. I have just enough motivation to do my work at home, but not enough to feel proud of my work. Something about being in a room where education takes place makes me more serious about my education. Locking my self in my room until my homework is done is depressing."
12074,"I felt this way my first semester when I was working towards something I wasn't passionate about and knew I would hate.

Edit: felt the need to add that all my classes are in person rather than zoom because that honestly changes things by a great deal in the fact that I would be failing zoom classes no matter what was driving me"
12075,I Agee ! It‚Äôs not necessary the workload it‚Äôs just the lack of motivation to not do anything because of how online classes operate. Instead of being in a class with a professor and students at your disposal for help and feedback it‚Äôs just you and your computer. Especially being at home with all other distractions it can be hard. I feel like because we are all at home we can‚Äôt really separate school and home life it‚Äôs now jumbled up together and it can get so overwhelming! But just know you are not alone I feel like anyone in college despite their major is feeling the same kind of emotions. Myself included ! If you ever need to vent more or need a study buddy hmu ! We all need to help each other get through another semester!
12076,Bruh...I feel personally attacked lol
12077,Everyone‚Äôs disagreeing cause they had a different experience lol
12078,"Prayers up , OP, college is gay as fuck"
12079,"Hello! As someone who followed their passion for psychology instead of the more practical degree, I can tell you the grass is not greener on the other side. I'm sorry you aren't finding your degree fulfilling, that sucks. But I can tell you there's one really valuable positive. 

You have many options. After college you will be able to work pretty much wherever you want and for good pay. I thoroughly regret following my passion and not doing CS. I did psych and it's a degree where you can't get a job with just a bachelor's, unlike engineering. It's easy to switch from engineering to another job later if you want, almost impossible to do the opposite. Maybe after college you can combine engineering with music!

As for your love of learning. Don't worry, it's not gone just sleeping :)"
12080,"I feel this 100%. I started my freshman year at a acclaimed university and barely made it through one semester before transferring to the campus in my hometown. I couldn't keep any friends because I didn't have a popular major (given what my school was known for) and I didn't party. Was alone 24/7 and I didn't want to switch because I thought the name of the school on my degree was enough to keep me going. I bs'd my way through my assignments and my lack of motivation led me to start skipping class more often than not. The only way I felt somewhat more motivated and like I was actually working towards my degree was when I switched campuses and got to stay at home... now I work part-time while going to school and living at home for free (thanks, mom), not to mention home-cooked meals, but covid has still ruined things. I am just ready to graduate........"
12081,"I've been there before. Losing the ability to truly be sympathetic and just being a shitty friend all around but not understanding what changed. I blame it on the depression. It's hard to feel for others when you don't have control of your mental state and emotions. It'll pass, it always does. We just don't know how long this is going to last. Keep pushing through. This society says you need a degree now to be successful, so whatever, finish the task and get the degree even if you don't feel it's meaningful. Because others will and that'll help you in life. 
Sometimes you just have to go through the motions until you start caring again. Good luck bud."
12082,Man if i haven't felt the same way through out my 4 years in college.
12083,"Haven't cared about any of my essays past freshman year, never had a problem grade-wise so...why bother really. The TAs don't really read them anyways, you just need to include everything on the rubric and not totally screw up the facts"
12084,Yeah I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs actually rare to get good professors who try their best to engage with the whole class.
12085,"I was bullied in highschool, but college years are still definitely much worse"
12086,"What you call bullshit might be that you‚Äôve actually built up quite a bit of skill and now can do things more efficiently and with less preparation before. I mean look at your high school brother; there was a time you probably would have felt like 800 words was a big deal and now you‚Äôre writing 5-10 pages like it‚Äôs nothing. That is actually a pretty big freaking skill; being able to write quickly and efficiently is important in almost every career. And I would bet that‚Äôs not the only thing you‚Äôve gained. It can be really hard to see your own growth though. There is even a term, imposter syndrome, for how a lot of highly educated people feel like they are bullshitting or faking their way through things without actually being qualified for them; in reality they almost always are.

Honestly just ... this year sucked for most people. Even if you weren‚Äôt in school. It could easily be more of a 2020-21 issue than a school issue"
12087," College is worthless for many (most) degree, IMO. The world could be so much better if we just did on the job training. And thinking about the fact I‚Äôm going to be 40-50k in debt after I graduate makes me so upset. I feel like my degree is worthless and I‚Äôm utterly unprepared for my first professional job."
12088,"Damn, from the title I thought you meant like you were taking the midterm and they made you leave because they thought you were chatting or something... too many of those sorts of posts on here."
12089,Best pre-spring break news ever
12090,Good idea
12091,Same. I was so ready for a drama post. I'm super happy for OP tho.
12092,"One semester I offered an incentive: If (at the time of each test) you had one of the five highest averages in the class, you did not have to take the midterm or the final.  I just gave those students full credit.

Those were the highest performing classes I held."
12093,"Jeeeeez. Damn good professor and nice work. I wouldn't have half of my GPA if it weren't for the mercy of my professors.

You know, there was this one time I had this super old foreign professor that was like, FIERCLY intelligent and a lot of other students were intimidated by him. He taught kind of shit though, basically everyone cheated through that class by copying all the procedures from homework problems on their equations sheet and made As on all their exams. 

I didn't even know that everyone was doing that though. I was actually trying to learn the stuff he was teaching, and I just continued to ask him questions during lecture at the same volume I do with any other professor.

Well my grades weren't that great still. So he brought me in to his office one day and gave me 20 extra points on my last exam because ""I'm the only one who understands his efforts."" 

And clearly you know how to get along with your professors too and I'm so glad you understand the importance of that. Professors are just the most interesting people you will ever meet if you really get to know them, even if they seem impossible to talk to."
12094,Definitely do this. I ran into an issue in a team-taught class where one instructor wasn't communicating to the other and I got a surprise zero on the final I was supposedly excused from...thankfully I was allowed to make it up before grades were submitted.
12095,Congratulations!! Enjoy a well needed spring break! ü´°
12096,I have something similar right now if you average over 85 on the midterms you don't have to take the final
12097,"I think that's a good policy.  It also simplifies how much work I had to do in grading exams I didn't want to grade.

This was at a time when students actually took exams on paper.  

I understand the world has changed since then."
12098,Nice! Good job. Get it in writing so you can show proof if anything happens. And be proud of yourself :)
12099,Is this just a US college thing? I‚Äôve never heard of it before. You got lucky! I wish it happened in other places too.
12100,Happened to me in one of my higher level English classes. The professor gave those who already had A‚Äôs the opportunity to not take the final. It was a great end to a grueling semester.
12101,Only in sociology
12102,Troll fail.
12103,Amazing  congratulations
12104,Ugh i‚Äôm so jealous. This isn‚Äôt a thing here at my school ü•≤ midterms and finals are worth more than anything
12105,Congrats!!!
12106,Congrats. Keep up the good work!
12107,omg what a dream
12108,Good job
12109,ü´°ü´°ü´°teach me your ways
12110,I‚Äôm confused. How is sociology esoteric?
12111,good job!! the real winner here is work ethic you have developed. you became unstoppable
12112,"Op if you don't mind me asking, may I know what esoteric topics you were reading?"
12113,[removed]
12114,"It‚Äôs not, in the sense of being occult, but esoteric also means abstruse or inscrutable. The fact there are reasons society is like it is, and there are explanations that God ordained it, can be eye-opening to sheltered Americans. Also there‚Äôs likely more concepts, more difficult reading, and math than expected.

So I expect OP thought it would be an easier class than it proved to be, and had to study harder than planned. But it paid off. Congratulations."

12116,"I think esoteric more commonly means abstruse than occult, and my question remains the same. I haven‚Äôt done much work in sociology so I could be wrong, but sociology (and the social sciences in general) seems to be far easier than something like philosophy or STEM. I can‚Äôt see sociology using much math beyond statistics and calculus, whereas physics or engineering regularly utilize tensor calculus, differential geometry, topology, linear algebra, and lie algebra."
12117,"Yes, the math is mainly stat, calc for economics (an adjacent discipline). I think it‚Äôs analyzing long written arguments that people have a harder time with. High schoolers often have this skill when they leave, and many times it can be avoided, particularly at state schools. History majors do a lot of this, but general ed history doesn‚Äôt require it. Even in the workplace it tends to be dying skill, or perhaps that‚Äôs my perception. I worked with engineers but they needed assistance writing and evaluating contract proposals (tended to leave the department as soon as they could.) Edited far too emails to upper management, too."
12118,"I am so sorry for your loss. Colleges are eager for near completers like you to get finished up. You need to reach out to your counseling center and your Dean of students office, let them know about your situation, and ask for information about a completion scholarship, emergency funds, and other support.

I really hope you're able to finish up. And if you need to take a term away to grieve and save some money,  that's totally understandable-- just go back and finish soon. Having your degree will be a big help for attaining your future goals.  You can do this."
12119,"I want you to first ask yourself a question

Are you in the mental capacity to finish college (I really would like you to say yes, but if you can't say yes, say no)

If you say yes keep reading

If you say no, save this and come back to this in a semester.

You are 3 classes from finishing college. That is what 9 credit hours out of a 120 credit program? You are literally 92.5% of the way to your degree. I would be willing to bet your financial aid office would bend over backwards to get you the money you need to finish. Most colleges even have endowment funds, I wouldn't be shocked with the right person in your fin aid office hearing your story they could deep into that fund and pull out enough cash to get you finished.

I am confident your fin office can find the money.

I'm not a mother but I am a father. And if I die before my son can finish college and he is 9 credit away from finishing his degree he better find a way to get that degree or I'm going haunt him. That's just how it is. You are too close to give up man. I know its hard.

I lost someone really close to me at a time where I was going through a big change in my life in my career. I used that as a change as a chance to plow through it, I put my head down, and I plowed through and I worked, and I worked and I got it done. The act of working through that career change helped me get past my grief. Maybe you finishing up those last 3 classes will help you get past your grief."
12120,"Yes, I am so concentrated on finishing. I just reached out to my advisor and financial aid office. My mom made me promise on her death bed that I would finish for her‚ù§Ô∏è"
12121,"This is the way. My mother passed away during my junior year of college and I ended up working with financial aid to complete my last year. Definitely had more debt than I wanted, but completed undergrad."
12122,"There are specific scholarships for students who have lost a parent. Google ""Scholarships for Students With a Deceased Parent."" The Life Lessons Scholarship Program is one such example. The program, sponsored by the nonprofit Life Happens based in Virginia, will award $200,000 this year to students who lost a parent and whose families lacked adequate life insurance. There are others like it. Good luck."
12123,If fin aid says they cant help create a go fund me and send me a link and ill toss ya a few dollars
12124,If you have 3 classes left from graduating I would definitely consider a small student loan. Those 3 classes will get you a degree. With a degree you have a chance to land a pretty good job. Without a degree it will be much much harder to get a good job.
12125,Can you do a payment plan or a subsizdized federal student loan if working isnt possible im so sorry for your loss ‚ù§Ô∏è
12126,"Came here to say this too! The financial aid office was able to point me in the direction of scholarships, and when my Pell grant reduced significantly due to income increases, they helped me increase the amount of grant money I got by sending me expense forms in regards to child care, costs I have for my mental health disability, car expenses, etc.

**Edit for a typo. They helped me INCREASE the amount of grant money, not reduce it"
12127,"I talked to my school‚Äôs financial aid office because I felt that not all of my circumstances were being considered. My financial aid went from $0 per year to over $13,000/year (almost the entire tuition amount)."
12128,"OP, also keep your professors in the loop. I had a housing emergency during my spring 2021 semester. I told my professor, and she told me about an emergency grant that she knew of that was put together by professors in various schools‚Äô classics departments. I was not a classics major, but since I was enrolled in her class and I was able to explain that she referred me, I was able to get the emergency grant. Your professors may know of similar resources."
12129,"This. Im always so confused as to why student loans are never considered. When you're THIS close to finishing, its never not worth it. I have friends who say they'd drop out last semester if they couldn't afford college anymore/lost their scholarships. I'm sorry but a 5k$ loan for a few classes can easily be paid off in your first year of work, if you just quit then you're just wasting 3 years of your life you spent here before.

Obviously look into other options OP but if nothing else is fruitful GET A LOAN. ITLL BE PAID OFF BEFORE YOU KNOW IT EVEN IF ITS PRIVATE."
12130,"when i was a senior in high school my father passed away from cancer without life insurance or any money as well and then not even 1 month later my mother was diagnosed with cancer. My school helped me get some federal funding, like the pell grant, even tho my FAFSA technically said i didn‚Äôt need it. I also wrote a letter for financial hardship explaining the situation and received a hardship grant. A lot of stuff like that they keep under the wraps but you need to go investigate at the financial aid office. Without my high school counselor and the office of financial aid i would of never even gotten to go to university at all for real. The only bad part is i can‚Äôt tell you how many times i‚Äôve had to dig up my dads death certificate and all his old tax papers and blah blah blah blah blah. Honestly the whole process is really hard on your mental but it‚Äôs worth it to finish your degree."
12131,My Most Sincerest Condolences on the loss of your Mother
12132,"Hell, I would send some bucks too, OP gotta finish school"
12133,Id b surprised if financial aid didn‚Äôt just give you all the money.
12134,"> I'm sorry but a 5k$ loan for a few classes can easily be paid off in your first year of work

I wouldn't say it's necessarily a guarantee that every recent graduate will be able to make enough money to budget an extra 5k for student loans in their first year. It's not that I think it would necessarily be the wrong choice for OP, but taking out loans is something to think very carefully about."
12135,I am so sorry- you need to contact your school‚Äôs financial aid office right away.
12136,"I said that I didn‚Äôt disagree, I‚Äôm glad she did that but without a life insurance policy or anything like that I am in a difficult situation‚Ä¶"
12137,"Hey, I‚Äôve been a scholarship advisor for a couple years now while I‚Äôve been in college. I also lost my mother at a young age, im sorry you share this same experience. If you need help finding scholarships or having your essays edited I am more than happy to help out, I can probably find a scholarship or two with basic information like your major. My DMs are open. Best of luck"
12138,"This, 9 credit hours or so can‚Äôt be that much, and I‚Äôm willing to bet that within a month or so it could be mostly covered with a go fund me or something of that sort"
12139,"This is a point worth thinking about, this all depends on OP's ability to get a job quickly after University to be able to pay for it and live off of it. I am not saying OP cannot do this, but all other avenues should be considered before signing a student loan because they are nondischargeable in most bankruptcy situations and can easily become a much bigger mess if interest piles on."
12140,"Sorry for your loss. The first thing to do once you feel up to it would be to contact your advisor for your major and let them know what has happened/rhat you are looking for scholirships/grants to cover the last semester and do they know of any. They may be able to do/find something major specific that could help. You should also contact financial aid at your school and let them know and ask about other funding options, they can point you to scholarships and grants or look at adjusting your aid die to the change. Those are your best two starting points. 

Try to find little things that add up if you can, or get a payment plan with your colleges buisness office and get a job to cover payments. That way they are at least split up and may be easier to find a way to make that much monthly."
12141,"In this case, I would not exclude getting a loan if anything else fails. You are basically done with school."
12142,"As everyone said, ask your financial aid office. If there's nothing they can do and you have a close knit community (or your mother did), try to get donations. You're so close and honestly fundraising a few thousand dollars is definitely do-able. If that doesn't work, you might be able to work for that money"
12143,"I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. 

My mother died while I was still in school, so I was able to get additional financial aid to make up the difference of what she was contributing."
12144,"If you‚Äôre in the USA, you can make a correction to your fasfa and tell them that your parent is now diseased. That will likely reduce your EFC and increase grant money as well"
12145,"My school has what's called a special circumstances application. You fill it out and tell them how your financial circumstances have changed and they review your FAFSA to redetermine a new aid amount. 

Also, if you are struggling with other bills like food, phone, internet, etc, there are programs where your internet can be paid for as a student who receives a pell grant and most schools have a no questions asked food pantry."
12146,"rip to your mother,  
 stay strong buddy , I don't know how things work at your place , but i would suggest seek help from your closed ones."
12147,"I‚Äôm so terribly sorry. I‚Äôd suggest talking with the financial aid office at your school, they can help you."

12149,It's comforting to know I'm not the only one who is gonna take longer than 4 years to graduate!

12173,"I'm no expert, but I have done some research on this topic. There are many reasons why many students are not graduating in a ""timely manner"" and that includes lack of preparedness, financial barriers, and lack of resources or effective guidance. According to the National Student Clearhouse, only 1/3rd of students still haven't gained a BA in the 6th year mark. [Source](https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/NSC_Signature_Report_14_StateSupp.pdf)

Preparedness: A chief economist at Georgetown University mentioned that unequal elementary and high school education contributes to the lack of pepardness and struggles students face in college. A study found that those students who come unprepared are more likely to drop out of college if they can't find the adequate support they need. ([Source](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Education/Georgia-State-University)) 

Financial problems: A study showed that 48% of college students had faced food insecurity while in college. ([Source](http://studentsagainsthunger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Hunger_On_Campus.pdf)) The same study showed that recent data from the Federal Student Aid showed that 58k students indicated they were homeless. Another financial problem is the cost of childcare for parents who are in college. (also me) The Institute for Women's Policy research found that 4.8 million college students were parents. Another study in CA found that 8% of students who were food insecure were planning to drop out. ([Source](https://www.aacu.org/aacu-news/newsletter/facts-figures/jan-feb2017)) In that same study, 65% faced housing insecurity.  I lost count of how many times I didn't eat and just went throughout the day with water in my stomach. 

Now, ofcourse, if we're talking about financial problems we have to incorperate race into this discussion. There is a growing college graduate gap most certainly among Black and Hispanic adults. A study showed that only 14% of Black adults, and 11% of Hispanic adults held a bachelors degree in comparison to 24% of White adults. ([Source](https://1k9gl1yevnfp2lpq1dhrqe17-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Black-Degree-Attainment_FINAL.pdf)) What also continues to rise is the lower completion rate for these groups of people, and the gap in graduation.  

It would make sense why these issues contribute to this overarching issue. It's tough to pay for college, eat a decent meal, get the support, learn, and graduate on time. Lets not forget about our marginalized groups too, who often contribute to the gap.

Let's not forget that colleges are businesses that don't really prepare you for the challenges and overload of college. I lost count of the many times I had to track my adviser down like a bounty hunter, and when I had questions she could barely answer them. I'd go through a list of people to get pulled in the right direction. Most of the time you will figure things out on your own. (due dates, graduation expectations, majors, minors, anything really)

Now again this is only a tiny section on the barriers that prevents students from graduating in a timely manner."
12174,Congratulations!
12175,I skated the entire campus to celebrate when I did the same. Nothing like a victory lap.
12176,Yay!!! What major?
12177,WOOHOO!! CONGRATULATIONS üéâüéâüéâ I wish you the best of luck in life!
12178,"Seriously, it's usally the opposite. They get mad at you for rushing through it"
12179,But 50 questions for two hours is still like 2 minutes per question! I don‚Äôt see why he bothered having that much of a time limit if he‚Äôs just going to complain that you‚Äôre utilizing it!
12180,Thanks for the response! We actually just had our first exam and it was 50? questions for two hours. So I could see why he felt that way.
12181,"I might send an email back explaining that you just wanted to make sure you gave the best answers possible, or something along the lines that you just wanted to make the best use of your time and the test went well. 

My guess is that they are nervous about the new format and if it is unreasonably difficult. A little feedback could really help them out it sounds like (just say you felt fine and were adequately prepared)."
12182,"Nah don't respond. 

If he gave 60 mins for the quiz he should have no reason for complaining that it took you 40. It's not like he had to sit there for it. He may be implying that you had to look up every answer but again if it was open notes who cares?"
12183,He probably thinks you cheated. I always take longer because of ADHD. I have to recheck every question to make sure I clicked the right answer.
12184,[removed]
12185,"He gave you 60 minutes to take the quiz? Next time turn it in at 59 minutes and 59 seconds. 

If there is any repercussion simply say you were using good test taking strategies you learned at your college‚Äôs tutoring center.   You checked your work on every question. If the professor gave you that much time for a quiz, you assumed he intended for you to use it."
12186,"I was thinking he might think OP is cheating. Two minutes is long enough to google the question. 

But he‚Äôs still being ridiculous with the passive aggressive comment. Even in IRL classes, I‚Äôve seen people take up literally the entire class period for a test when others got done in half the time."
12187,"I was thinking this as well, but on canvas a professor can see when someone exits out of the link etc. I was on the page the entire time, I just had my notes written down. A few of them were written questions as well. Sigh."
12188,It's sad that your first paragraph needs to be said.
12189,"I lowkey feel like he was implying cheating. Like ‚Äúoh, it took you two minutes to look up each question because you weren‚Äôt prepared for the quiz.‚Äù And in his mind, that would explain the high grade despite OP not being prepared. But he can‚Äôt accuse outright because he has no proof. 

I think OP should contact him and explain, just so that he can‚Äôt be weird about this for the rest of the semester."
12190,"I see it all the time, especially from the older tenured faculty. It‚Äôs frustrating. 

I‚Äôve even seen one of them walk into the final exam (that he had a TA proctor of course) and say loudly ‚Äúpeople are still taking it? Huh, well there‚Äôs always someone isn‚Äôt there, haha!‚Äù And left. 

Like, mfker, the final exam is hard and stressful enough without you making them feel like they‚Äôre fucking up halfway through."
12191,"I‚Äôm an instructor, it‚Äôs true. Canvas records every time you click out of the window and when you click back in."
12192,"If he thinks that 40 minutes on the quiz is too long then I want to know why the hell he set a 60 minute time limit. Whenever I take an online quiz or test, I always take a shit ton of time. And always catch stupid mistakes that way. 

I don‚Äôt think you need to respond to him. But if you do, just tell him that you like to take your time and check your work."
12193,"Are you serious I did not know that, I‚Äôll google on my phone now. Ffs"
12194,i like this- so petty
12195,"Just say ""I had to take a shit"" and leave it like that, chances are he'll be to embarrassed to ask you or anyone else this again"
12196,"No need to reply, I've never met a professor who gave a shit about how long you took on canvas assignments unless you didn't finish in time"
12197,"it‚Äôs even more than 2 minutes per question isn‚Äôt it? 50 questions, 120 minutes... prof needs to chill."
12198,So.... Do you.... Like.... Assume that means a student's cheating? I usually listen to music while taking exams and I'll switch tabs to change up the playlist or whatever. I've never had a professor mention it to me. Maybe they don't check?
12199,"Maybe you‚Äôre like me and milk the time limit to almost the last minute. Not because you‚Äôre underprepared, but because you can or are in a distractive environment."
12200,That was exactly what I was thinking. If he felt it was too long he should have the maximum at like 30 mins or something.
12201,"Its probably because he thinks that you searched for the answers on the internet, at least thats what my professor thought haha."
12202,"A lot or the tenured profs I‚Äôve had were subpar honestly. In my classes right now my tenured professor puts literally no effort into teaching. He grades exams half-assed and then wants students to appeal his mistakes to try and get points back when he should be the one grading correctly. 

Its honesty pathetic some of them are. Here you are paying money for a class where the professor makes you correct his own mistakes."
12203,"You definitely should respond even if it‚Äôs to say exactly what you say here (no privacy, I‚Äôm doing all the work). Even though his request is ridiculous, he WILL notice that you ignored his email. You don‚Äôt want to be on someone‚Äôs bad side who is this detail oriented. 

I‚Äôm a professor and I always notice who emails me back and who ignores me. It matters (grading is unfortunately, subjective)."
12204,That depends on the class.
12205,They are just asking for feedback. Don‚Äôt overthink and respond.
12206,"What a nerd haha. You were within the time limit, if he doesn‚Äôt want people taking that long change the limit. You‚Äôre fine"
12207,Because typically exam questions may build on a single question starting point or may be harder to do. So if OP is taking that long with quick quiz questions they may run out of time on challenging exams.
12208,"You're only paying $3,000?"
12209,Spent the first night of university in the Drunk Tank after tackling a mascot and preceding to square up with each other right in front of a squad car. Stayed the full night in the slammer with a dude in a shark costume. He was a pretty cool dude honestly.
12210,"One time I was in my second semester of nursing school about to go on spring break when the school closed because of a really contagious virus that lead to a worldwide pandemic and lock down. I now have every clinical, exam, project and ATI due online, missing out on 80hrs of patient experience. The funniest part is my bf and I have custody of his 3 kids. They're on online homeschool, 2 are independent enough but I'll have to basically teach a 9yr old who just wants to play video games about a math technique that I never learned in school. Being so overwhelmed my anxiety skyrockets and I actually get less done than I'd like. The hilarity, i cant! The good news is the bf still works. So, we'll make it, I just don't know in what condition lol."
12211,"Was in the dead of winter and I was leaving the gym on campus. Beside the gym is the only significant hill on campus and I see three drunk girls at the top all on high heels and skirts. So, I‚Äôm just watching them when they all decide to sit down on the sidewalk. 

Have you ever watched the Winter Olympics when the athletes perform the [luge event?](https://youtu.be/nIn9vmzWWSE) This is what the girls were doing. One of them was carrying a skateboard and they all got on it like it was a luge. Well, they go down this hill at a whopping 5mph, digging their heels into the ground the entire time. 

They get near the bottom and completely eat it. Two girls are on the ground crying and the third is to the side throwing her guts up. They finally collect themselves after a minute or so, look at each other, and walk right back up the hill to do it all again. 

There was a girl who was also leaving the gym who saw the whole thing. We just looked at each other to make sure we weren‚Äôt losing our minds and then went on our way."

12213,"A lot of my stories are either inside jokes or really inappropriate, so I'll settle for this one that happened a couple of months ago.

So this apartment company I'm renting from is your typical slumlord agency. Whenever I have the opportunity to tell people that go to my school to avoid them at all costs, I do. Not only have I been paying on average $60 for water every month, they lied about about promotions, and every time I put in a service request, their employees would leave mud on the carpet and not clean up after themselves. 

So around Christmas time, they sent out a mass email talking about a Christmas Wishlist Giveaway. All you had to do was put some random wishlist items down. So, me being the smartass I am, I put down a variety of items as a joke:
- An all expenses paid trip to Europe
- Your employees at least put bags over their shoes and not track mud all over my apartment. Also have one of them dress up as Santa and give me $500 for the time I spent cleaning after them and feeling paranoid when my stuff was moved out of place. 
- Spring Tuition & Fees paid for
- a microwave with $1,000 stuffed in it
- Non-perishable food to give to the pantry...  and also $1,000
- $500 Target giftcard and a bottle of eggnog
- Paid storage unit for 5 years so I can put all of my extra shoes and clothes in there. Or maybe I'll live in there. 

I completely forgot about it until a couple of weeks later, I got an email from them saying that they will be giving me one of the items on my wishlist! I am completely bewildered because all of my responses were expensive jokes. So I went about my daily life until one day I walked into my apartment after work and saw a neatly wrapped box 24"" x 12"". 

Not gonna lie, a small part of me got a little excited. I ripped open the present to find... a microwave. With a little hope left, I opened the microwave to see if there was any money or checks. Nope. I honestly felt like I got rickrolled as I looked up at the built in microwave above the stovetop that came with the apartment. I ended up giving the microwave to a friend who wanted one and having a good laugh about it afterwards. 

Tl;dr: the slumlord apartment company that I'm renting from gave me a fucking microwave as a joke for Christmas."

12218,"One time when I called up the elevator to go down to breakfast, my friend happened to be in there. Neither of us were fully awake, so when the elevator door opened we both jumped out of our skin and probably woke up that whole section of the residence hall with how loudly we screamed.

Also I'm from NH but I go to school in North AL. It snowed about an inch in December, and obviously from my perspective it wasn't anything of note. But my friend from Mobile was SO EXCITED. I have a video of her literally dancing and freaking out and running through the snow because of how beautiful it was; she'd only seen it a couple times before in her life."

12220,"So my school building used to be a nuns convent so ofc we have ghost stories galore, specifically of this old nun who haunts the halls seeking vengeance or whatever. It was during exam week, I was at the library cramming my ass off when suddenly the power went out. A few people screamed and it was out for a few seconds before the generator kicked in. When it came back on, one of the jocks sitting at the table next to mine facing bolted out of there, shouting something about not getting possessed tonight. We all laughed, but then the power went out again and I noped out there too."
12221,"I was taking a shower at night on Saturday and I was about to use shampoo, the fire alarm went off and I made a mad dash to throw on my robe and grab my towel. I flashed someone trying to tie my robe.

12222,"It's move-in day at the dorms. The top floor is the boys' floor, second and first are the girls' floors, and the basement is common space. It also connects to the nearest parking spots, so it's heavily trafficked on move in day. 

My boyfriend, myself, and some of the residents' parents are waiting on the elevator on the basement floor when we hear all the way from the third floor, ""^aww ^yeah ^dog we're gonna slay tonight, it's gonna be great, we're GONNA GET SOME *PUSSAAAAY*""

The doors pop open on the last syllable and a trio of freshman frat-pledge-to-bes look at all of us and turn beet red."
12223,"Once I was going to the bathroom and I wasn't paying attention as I was on my phone. I walked through the door and put my phone down and splashed some water on my face to wake myself up. As I'm drying my face, this dude walks in and is like ""oh, shit. My bad"" and walks out. I kinda laugh at him because lol, he came into the wrong bathroom. Dude, walks back in 2 seconds later, shrugs and goes ""I don't care. If you gotta go, you gotta go."" I'm like wait, what? And as he's walking to the stalls I turn and see a urinal and am like ""oh, shit!"" Quickly grabbed my stuff and ran out.

Funniest part was there was another dude shitting in there and was probably looking through the cracks like ""why is there a girl in?"" ;)"

I don't get to go to college because of covid.

HAHAHAH"
12228,"I like this perspective. I‚Äôm paying to learn the information necessary for the degree and I‚Äôm still learning it, just in a new way. I might not be learning it as well, but I will still have all the resources to review in the future if I need it."
12229,"a lot of these are way more tame. but.

i did LSD on campus with my ex and then had to call public safety on him when he lost his shit, which in turn got me in copious amounts of trouble, too.

backstory: i had just become an RA and i üëè was üëè LIVING üëè like i was really excited to be an RA at my tiny little college in the south. it was a pay raise and a job i could do in my pajamas.

so i wanted to celebrate and i acquired a single tab of reality melter and came back to my summer apartment and my boyfriend got really butthurt that i only bought one for me. so i went back out and got one for him. cool shit. i really honestly just wanted to do it alone and be alone in my dorm finally, but he insisted on taking it with me (eyerolls) even though i made it pretty clear i wanted some alone time with this. not to mention, i already was well aware that he is a terrible trip buddy.

anyway, we drop these tabs and finally i'm itching for a walk in the woods. so we get our shit together and start walking. and he's already acting like there is something coming after him (keeps looking back behind him, has a look of impending doom, acting real uneasy). i had also packed a bowl and rolled a blunt so i could smoke in the woods and just wander around the small town (let me make it VERY CLEAR that i am EXTREMELY directional on lsd and know exactly where everything is in the small town of berea, ky despite my drug-induced state). little did i know what the next hour would bring because i honestly thought he would be able to handle his shit.

so we are sitting in the woods on a bench and i pull out my bowl and we light up. i'm feeling REAL high after like one hit and so i chill with that; he basically chimneys out the bowl entirely. i think this is where he begins to lose it. he told me he wanted to walk back, so i said okay and started guiding us back. the sun is setting so the woods are getting kind of dark and moody. i'm LIVING for the dark, but he's starting to freak the fuck out and then he darts out to this clearing. I get pretty angry and follow him and was like ""what's wrong?"" and he tells me that he saw something in the motherfucking woods and it's coming after him. i looked back at the woods, back at him, back at the woods, and back at him, and said ""what the fuck are you talking about"" and then tried to convince him to just walk with me and i could take him home so he felt safer.

instead, he ran away from me. and he didn't know where to go because he generally lacks directional skills. he was relying on me from the get-go and yet wouldn't even trust me to get him to safety. and he's FREAKING out now. i even tried to calm him down with a blunt and he threw it and ran.

i was genuinely worried. and also pretty fucking mad that he wouldn't just follow me. so i kind of just left. am i a terrible person? maybe. but i was getting really fed up with babysitting my boyfriend when i just wanted a night alone.

so i get out to the alumni field. shits getting melty and i'm finally enjoying myself for a minute until i realize that my ex is still out there losing his motherfucking shit. i was torn; do i follow the protocol set in place for RAs to call public safety when someone seems dangerous or just let him live it out there alone. both felt like i was throwing him under the bus (i feel way less bad about it now and tbh would have probably just left him if it was current me, but then i certainly was torn because i cared about him). but because he felt to me to be a danger to himself and possibly others (he was sincerely delusional when i left him; it was kind of scaring me), i called the pub. my personal mistake was reporting it and then sticking around. they would have never known i was on drugs if i had left... or kept my composure. after placing the report call, i was sitting in the field and enjoying myself until i got another call. i thought it was my boyfriend because his name came up. turns out, it was his FUCKING MOTHER calling to YELL AT ME about how i PUT HER SON IN DANGER. y'all. y ' a l l. HE LITERALLY MADE ME GO BUY HIM A DAMN TAB. I WAS GONNA DO THIS ALONE. HE COULD HAVE SAID NO AT ANY TIME AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE HURT ME ONE BIT. 

so anyway back to me crying like a little baby. makeup smearing all over my face. bawling. was really mad at the same time. so while my waterworks are working at full speed, the pub rolls up and hears me crying and they get super concerned super quick which is, like, not what i wanted. they seem to start thinking this is a domestic abuse case or something since the call i placed was basically ""my boyfriend and i got separated in the woods and i don't know where he is and i think he's lost and confused."" they ask me if he's been hurting me, if i need help, etc. and finally, it just comes out. ""we're both tripping on acid. he lost his mind and i left him out there to handle it on his own."" 

then, they start freaking out. they call EVERYONE. ems, fire, police. the whole nine yards for this search team. the search takes, like, an hour. the police officer was surprisingly the only person that was nice to me. he brought me two bottles of water and a blanket and was like, ""you seem to be handling this okay"" and i responded ""dude, i don't even know what i am doing here right now."" and he laughed and told public safety it was in their hands now (public safety has total jurisdiction for campus crimes. didn't know until this day) and left and told me to have a good night despite this mess.

other stuff happened too after they found him (it took, like, an hour), such as a trip to the public safety interrogation room in which they interrogated us under the influence of drugs and got nothing really from us because WE WERE ON DRUGS. but, anyhow, that's the story of how i got fired from being an RA before my job even started and the downfall of my first go-around at college. hope it entertained someone out there."

12232,"As a person that lives in a snowy state, I forget how beautiful snow can be to people who do not experience it regularly.  That sounds like a great moment!"
12233,"This reminds me of a college story happening last semester. Before I start, obligatory mobile user. To start off, every year by college grants Christmas wishes to students a week or so before fall semester ends. One year they gave away full paid scholarships, free parking spaces, etc. my Christmas wish was to put a pasta bar in the cafeteria since my college doesn‚Äôt have the best cafeteria food. The reason I specially put this was because I heard they had a pasta bar there before I was a student, which I really wish they had kept. Anyways, we get to the Christmas chapel and my name is the first name called. I was so excited they chose me and the room was so loud I couldn‚Äôt hear what they said, but they basically said that they can‚Äôt grant me my wish but they have something better, which was 2 plates of pasta for me and one person to eat while they give the rest of the wishes, so I chose the first person I recognized who really wanted pasta, and we sat on stage eating cold spaghetti that had some weird kick to it while the college gave the rest of the wishes away. The best one being a Mac laptop. I‚Äôm bummed the pasta bar wasn‚Äôt added cus everyone would enjoy it and it‚Äôd save the school money by having pasta and not the weird food normally at the station, but still a funny experience."

12239,"If it weren't for English and Communications majors, my current STEM job wouldn't exist."
12240,I'm getting a degree in the stem field and even I'm sick of hearing that other degrees are useless. Absolutely not useless.
12241,"People forget that even STEM degrees can have difficulty getting jobs, especially nowadays. My original plan was biology, but it can be hard to find decent jobs for biology majors that don't want to continue on to a medical/graduate degree of some kind. Bless you if you want to go into environmental or wildlife science."
12242,Yeah engineering bros make fun out of anyone that is getting a lib arts degree.
12243,I mean it depends on the degree. My boyfriend has an accounting degree and I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt consider that useless but it‚Äôs not STEM
12244,"She‚Äôs 43-44.  She‚Äôs been moving up in the field for probably 15 years now, but she‚Äôs been extremely well paid.  Because she‚Äôs talented and hard working, she‚Äôs risen quickly and her job performance always mattered more than the subject of her degree"
12245,I think it was a lot easier to get into the workforce with a degree in anything/ something unrelated or tangentially related 15 years ago though. A lot of those jobs nowadays require a specific degree in that field or they‚Äôve been outsourced.

12250,"Yes, hi, professor here. You are absolutely correct, OP. They are not useless. This is the prevailing anti-intellectualism that is dominating the rhetoric right now.

Don't listen. Study your passion. There are uses for every degree. Talk to your department and the local workforce center or job placement center.

But the point of a liberal arts education is to teach you to think and solve problems, which is why many jobs require a degree.

I heard recently from a computer science professor in a graduate program that some of her students are showing up with zero problem solving or critical thinking skills. Some STEM programs are only teaching rote following steps and not how to solve problems.

Professional programs are also not STEM"
12251,It‚Äôs not about employment. It‚Äôs about ROI and employment in related fields.
12252,15 years ago was 2007 bro. That was the start of the global financial crisis.
12253,Even some STEM degrees are useless xd its about what you do in college really
12254,It's hilarious to me when people that put STEM on a pedestal have to take a humanities class and can barely pass. I've met quite a few engineering majors that can't write essays or extract themes from literature. There were a few STEM people in my upper division history classes that thought it would be an easy A and almost all of them dropped.
12255,i smiled at this. thank you
12256,I wish I could take the risk of a degree in theater. But Chem Eng is more secure. My best friend is Business and Marketing and I know she's gonna do great.
12257,"You are probably the exception, not the rule. Engineers with a four year degree tend to make some pretty good money."
12258,Yeah no bio can be a great degree as long as you have a plan. It‚Äôs not an ‚Äúeasy job right outta undergrad‚Äù major though and I feel like that‚Äôs what people are generally referring to when they talk about ‚Äúuseless degrees‚Äù
12259,"You must not know many engineers. Vast majority of engineers I know absolutely love their jobs and profession. Engineers have an easy time moving jobs so I have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about. Two of my brothers are engineers and are constantly getting hit up by recruiters on LinkedIn. 

I don‚Äôt know many people that went into lib arts and humanities that making good money with a few exceptions for accounting/finance and those that got the masters/doctorates. Many other peeps I know that got degrees in lib arts ended up selling insurance or working in sales for telecomm companies."
12260,"I have an English degree, I make more money than anyone with a STEM degree I know. Biology degrees don‚Äôt get you salaried jobs, those positions are hourly."
12261,I have a degree in molecular biology and people tell me it‚Äôs useless. There‚Äôs no pleasing some people.
12262,A friend i have completed her chem degree and now works on a tv show!
12263,"My dad has all STEM degrees and my mom has all humanities degrees. My mom makes more than him. Like, a lot more. All depends on the person and what you do with the degree."
12264,"I switched from Biology to Culinary Arts, and I‚Äôve never been happier. However, my grandparents (who are legally my parents) freaked the fuck out and said I was throwing my life away, I wouldn‚Äôt get a job, and culinary arts is useless. 

‚Ä¶guys you go out every weekend to a restaurant to eat good food. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to do shit like that without people like me. Fuck off."
12265,Im getting a STEM degree and still worrying about employment after grad. Realistically most of us are fucked
12266,"It always hits me like a sac of bricks that there are academic degrees in accounting. It's not like I don't know about it, but I somehow always forget."
12267,Accounting is nothing to do with math above a 4th grade level
12268,"‚ÄúThe first two years are classes everyone has to take‚Äù

Not true. Take this advice with a grain of salt. There are many majors, such as engineering for example, where if you wait until the end of your 2nd year to switch I guarantee that you will not graduate within 4 years"
12269,[deleted]
12270,"At the same time, it‚Äôs strange to expect 18 year olds to know what they want to do with the next 40+ years of their lives and then have this hostility toward those who find themselves in their mid-20s regretting their decisions because they didn‚Äôt have all the *data* at the time. I do agree with this piece of advice, though. Aim for the job, land it, and then later, if you want to do something else, you‚Äôll at least be able to save up some money for it."
12271,"This! I am 28 and dropped out 4 times in my life and switched my major 3 times, It doesn‚Äôt matter when you finish.As long as you finish! I have 2 semesters before I have my bachelors and I cannot emphasize enough how much of a journey it has been for me so far, you need to study what you are interested in and at the same time discover yourself. Your major does not define you :D"
12272,Also just to point out your major is not a be all end all. Your future jobs or whatever you do can have nothing to do with your major.
12273,"Knowing what fields you HATE can also be helpful as well. Sure, some people are able to come around to things but if you are bad at science, hated all of your high school lab classes, and generally don't care about it.... Don't pick a major that is science-y. 

This sounds like such a dumb piece of advice but a lot of people pick the most impressive sounding thing over the thing they are actually decent at/like. 

Don't pick a degree you have no use for AND hate."
12274,I learned this the hard way and is why I wouldn‚Äôt give OPs advice. I did 2 years at community college getting associates of science and now switching to CS. And I won‚Äôt be graduating any time soon
12275,"YES. 

And it‚Äôs perfectly okay to not go to college, find what you want to do, then go. I made that mistake when I was 18 and went directly to college. I ended up dropping out and joining the military, and actually found my niche. 

And community college is not ‚Äúshameful‚Äù or whatever people call it. It‚Äôs smart, and money efficient."
12276,this this this
12277,I work in higher ed and you would be amazed by just how many students change their major. I would wager the actual statistic is around 80%.
12278,"It‚Äôs a marathon, not a race is exactly right. When I was 18, I picked psych as my major. And I hated it first semester in. I applied to a nursing program and switched. Then COVID happened, my program got fucked up by being bought by a bigger university, and I had to transfer. I‚Äôm 23, almost done with my BSN. Life is weird, and nothing will go exactly how you think it will. The end goal is graduation (obviously) but trust in the journey. And don‚Äôt stress yourself out. College classes will do that to you enough, so don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. You‚Äôve chosen to go to school! Be proud of yourself for making that step and really think about what your interests are. Never chase the money - chase what you love and the money will follow."
12279,"this sentiment is correct but this seems more like ""got a degree I enjoyed but couldnt made a career out of it so resorted to nepotism"" not knocking nepotism btw the world is harsh and cruel, just saying its not always so easy to pivot if you dont have a backup job with your parent"
12280,"At my college, 40% of students graduate with the major they applied with coming in, so a majority of students don't. I applied as a math major, then wanted to be a double major in math and physics with a minor in music. Then math turned out to be too much for me so I decided to be a physics major with minors in math and music. Then in my junior year, I discovered that the academic side of music is what I wanted to do so now I am a music major doing a B.A. in physics and the math minor is still a maybe. That is four times I ""changed"" what my major was going to be. And I was part of the 60% as I came in with math and declared physics and music. Talk to your advisors. Talk to the department chairs. But it is totally ok to not know what you want to do as a junior or senior in high school or even for the first couple years in college. In fact, nobody expects you to know what you are doing in life in your 20s. 

Bottom line is: try to figure out your passions but relax; you have plenty of time and almost nothing you do in your late teens and early twenties will negatively set your life in stone."
12281,yeah üíÄ
12282,[deleted]
12283,"That is definitely part of it. 

Not to make a huge generalization, but this subreddit seems to have the idea that only STEM majors will be successful, which is simply not true. There are so many necessary majors out there that get pushed to the side. 

Not everyone's idea of success is based on how much money they will make after they graduate either, which is what a lot of people seem to base their judgment on here. People find fulfillment in different ways and money is not always it."
12284,I went to college because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do with my life and found something that I want to do. I‚Äôm in accounting now and that‚Äôs not something I would have decided on without being exposed to it in college. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs the right move for everyone but it‚Äôs also not a wrong move. I was in a decent financial position thanks to scholarships so if I had decided that I wanted to drop out I wouldn‚Äôt have been crushed under student debt. I‚Äôm glad I still went to college despite not having a clue what I wanted to do.
12285,"Yes and no.  EVERY MAJOR requires at least a couple 100 level English classes, couple history/humanities classes, and a couple lab based science class.  Accounting major?  Yes, you are going to be forced to take one lab based Science class.  and English 101.  Chemistry major?  Yes, you are going to be forced to take Psychology 101, and English 101 and some random humanities class."
12286,"Also, do look at the return on investment for your major. You maybe love history or film studies, or theater, but if you know that being in debt will make you miserable, maybe don't do those majors.


On the flip side, some people go to the other extreme, STEM major or bust. The thing you have to be careful about on the other end is that these majors have a much lower graduation rate than other majors. Other majors with less, or no ROI, you can often get them so long as you work hard and study. STEM degrees meanwhile are incredibly difficult, firstly, the most difficult thing about a STEM degree is that Professors believe they should be difficult, so it's nearly impossible to even complete all of your work if you're a working class student, and as such, many who pursue STEM degrees who are working class need to do so as part time students, increasing the time to graduation. It's also really challenging material that your high school education may not have prepared you to handle, and you may find yourself retaking many classes. STEM degrees ROI so hard predominantly because they are so risky."
12287,"Keep in mind that in demand industries vary locally too. Look up job postings for intended jobs, don't just assume they're available. Trades in my area crashed for example, so no electrician Jobs were available. If you are really set on something, be prepared to move if the industry doesn't exist where you live."
12288,"Honestly, I've changed my major 3-4 times and I still want to change it in my last year, but I've just decided to stick with my current major because I know I'd still feel bleh in any of the other ones I choose. 

My real problem is that I like learning about everything, yet I simply do not like doing any type of hard work lol."
12289,STEM can be overrated as well. Imo it‚Äôs mostly just engineering and CS in stem that have good ROI. If you want something with good ROI pick something APPLIED!!!
12290,"And for those who took a lot of AP/IB/Community College classes while in HS: you're in an especially good position because you can switch your major quite late into your college career and still graduate on time. The credits tend to transfer over in a very convenient way that gives you a lot of flexibility. I was a biology major for my first two years in college, and finally I had my epiphany at the end of my second year that I should have been computer science the entire time. Since I took so many AP classes in HS, I was able to switch and still graduate on time with no problems.

Even if you didn't take a lot of classes for college credit, it's not the end of the world to spend a few summers catching up so you can graduate on time, or even spend an extra year or two just catching up if you want to have school-free summers. Don't ever convince yourself that it's too late, that mindset won't do you any good and you'll get caught in the sunk cost fallacy."
12291,"My advice to all, don‚Äôt worry about what to major in. Just finish what you start even if it means you collect all your credits to achieve an liberal or associate Arts Degree"
12292,"You forgot the ones who have to go to college because of their parents, even though they really don't want to."
12293,"I disagree with this. Not everyone can/wants to/is cut out to be an engineer. Imagine if every who went to college ended with an engineering degree

Also, a lot of people pursue an engineering degree because they get told stuff like this, end up not being too great at math and physics, burn out, feel horrible about themselves, etc etc

so yeah i think telling everyone to be an engineering major is actually pretty horrible advice, especially considering freshman/sophomore engineering classes like calculus and physics are mostly weed out classes. Imagine taking engineering as your major while you figure things out and royally fucking up your GPA because you aren‚Äôt good at math"
12294,"Yes. I will say that academic advising is one of the most competitive areas to get into within higher ed, but there is a lot you can do with the degree. I would recommend reaching out to some people who work at your college and ask for an informational interview."
12295,"People with mathematics degrees get paid very well because their analysis skills can be applied to a lot of things. Average starting salary is 60,000 which isn‚Äôt super fantastic but goes up but film studies is among the worst things you can study"
12296,[deleted]
12297,"I'd argue that if you don't already know what you'll be majoring in, you probably shouldn't be going to college in the first place.

There are a few exceptions. If you come from a fabulously rich family, you might as well go to college. It likely won't matter, but it's a good place to party for a while before you assume your family responsibilities. If you're planning to go to a place like West Point your 'major' is largely just a formality - your real major is the military. If college is just a way station on your road to the NFL or NBA, then treat it like that and let your coaches tell you what the 'soft' majors - even if you don't manage to go pro, you can always get a real education at the Master's level later.

Then, of course, there are the people who've known what the want to do since they were kids. They had their major already picked out long before they ever started looking at colleges and they've spent their high school years building the exact sort of resume people in that field are supposed to have.

Finally, there's the rest of the folks. The people who are only going to college because it's what they're ""supposed to do"". These folks are making a big mistake. They've essentially become institutionalized by the educational system and are just churning along aimlessly because they don't know what to do.

No one has their life figured out at 18. The way you figure out your life - and who you are - is by experiencing life rather than hiding from it.

Go on tour with your band. Join a kibbutz and farm for a bit - it's all the good parts of joining a cult without the hassles about leaving. Sign up for the Coast Guard, save some lives and meet some drug smugglers. Become a long haul trucker and see the nation. If you must continue with your schooling, pick up a random tech degree from Community College - IT, electrician, mechanic, etc. - that will hand you a decent-paying job alongside your diploma.

*Then*, when you've spent some time out in the world and have a pretty good idea what you actually want to do, get your bachelor's degree. What you'll discover is that not only have you saved a lot of money (and time) but you're a far more interesting applicant than you were as an undifferentiated, aimless 18-year-old."
12298,omg be friends with them that's hysterical

12317,Congratulations üéà
12318,"Congratulations, good job!"
12319,"Not OP and don‚Äôt have study materials but I just finished Calc III and am currently taking the last class for my math minor at a state university. I was also a horrible student in high school and barely passed any math classes. Here‚Äôs how I made it through Calc II:

Highly recommend paying for symbolab premium for the semester. It‚Äôs only like $12 for a few months I think and gives you walkthrough steps of integrals. Makes homework a lot less painful.
Also, YouTube is by far the biggest homie there is. Reading math textbooks is painful. Having someone walk through it for you is glorious. Professor Leonard is my #1 recommendation. Getting frustrated at the homework sucks especially if you‚Äôre using Pearson, cengage, or knewton. I don‚Äôt have good advice for that, just don‚Äôt break your electronics and chill when you need a break.

 It‚Äôs important to understand that Calc II is the dirty work of undergrad Calc. You‚Äôre learning how to integrate and the different tricks used to do tough integrals. You‚Äôre basically learning what you‚Äôll be having calculators compute for you later. In Calc III it becomes important to know the various ways of setting up integrals. Be sure to check your progress in hindsight and see what the point of learning it was. I promise learning integration (Calc II) is worth it and will change the way you interpret the world around you. I was a very average joe coming into college but I learned that math is a language that explains why things are the way they are. It feels good to understand. Good luck!"
12320,"It's not that hard. It's just applying Pre-Cal into Calc problems. The most challenging for me were ""Related Rates Problems"". You were given a problem with words and had to translate it into math formulas. But, the more problems you do into your free time, the easier it gets."
12321,"Yes, please. I'm not OP but I'd like some study materials if that's okay. :D"
12322,Congratulations!!! üéâI‚Äôm currently crying my way through calc üòÖ
12323,"yeah, I think it also depends on person to person, some people just tend to understand calculus concepts pretty quickly, and for others it might not click in the same way."
12324,Congratulations üôÇ
12325,"Related rates and optimization were the worst for me, for some reason applications of integrals were a lot easier"
12326,It‚Äôs really not bad.. calc 2 is though
12327,"Recommendation for everyone reading this about to take calculus. Search for Professor Leonards Calculus series lectures, complete game changers and helped me get through Calc (I'm still awaiting on my final results but I would not have passed my class w/ just my Professors lectures lol)"
12328,"When I took calc 2 I somehow ended up with a better grade than in calc 1, but calc 3 is definitely easier than calc 2."
12329,Kahn Academy my friend. That man is a treasure.
12330,Congrats!!! Now it‚Äôs time for Calc II üòÖ
12331,"Congratulations! I tried to take Calc 1, 2, and 3 in a row and ended up bailing on Calc 3. 

Taking them all online really hurt my ability to actually understand calculus. Looking back I have no clue how I passed 1 and 2 because I really feel I don't know a single thing about calculus. I'm planning on spending some time this summer learning calculus so I can take calc 3, multivariate, etc"
12332,Lmao i passed and am now struggling with calc 2 it never gets better üò≠
12333,I‚Äôd recommend don‚Äôt spend time trying to deeply understand the concepts if you struggle with math. Just be able to solve the problems. If you ever use calculus in your major courses it will be on such a rudimentary level that the application of calculus will just click
12334,Congrats! Prepare yourself for Calc 2. Calc 2 imo is harder than Calc 1 for those who go into it with the same mindset as Calc 1. Study study and study you'll do great!
12335,god bless salman khan
12336,That and Calc II are my worst memories. I did II in the summer and I only passed because the prof rounded my grade up.
12337,Me going into calc1 this summer planning to get an A wish me luck lol
12338,Just wait till you get to calc 2 LOL. Congrats tho

12378,"I think out of class group work is a little different. In class in person group work, I completely see the benefit, and also the correlation to the real world. But online class group work that goes outside the classroom doesn‚Äôt work, even in-person out of classroom projects doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. 

In the real world you have set amount of time allocated to a job, mostly the same time period as coworkers, and you get work done in it for the most part. For school projects that you do out of class, you now are working on other peoples time, time that doesn‚Äôt revolve around the class you have the project in(other classes, part time jobs, random life things). So when trying to collaborate to do a task you are restricted to a very specific time frame, one time frame that could also fluctuate depending on the certain group.

With all these different variables at play between you and group partners, it then makes the ability to receive a certain grade somewhat dependent on group members schedules outside of the class, which to me seems as an unfair way to assess people‚Äôs knowledge on the material, or even willingness to put enough effort in their part"
12379,"I‚Äôm a physics professor. Studies have shown that the best way to learn physics is to work on problem solving in small groups, so that‚Äôs how I structure my courses. You‚Äôre supposed to still be interacting with each other. Refusing to is only hurting your education."
12380,"This is a very unproductive way to communicate with someone. So hostile, and for what?"
12381,problem solving works with small in person groups. Believe it or not its much harder to interact with eachother when all we see of eachother is a tiny rectangle on a screen.

Then today Prof was sick which is not her fault, but we were supposed to finalize the group exercise today. She said to talk with your group members. But I have no idea who is in my group and what we‚Äôre doing. I couldn‚Äôt submit anything so I guess it will get worked out when prof is well. Hopefully I won‚Äôt get penalized for late assignments.

TLDR: I hate group work over Zoom too."

Some is there so they can take the next class(aka need to kget the knowledge), others might just needed the class to graduate(aka C's get the degree).  Not everyone is there to get as high of a grade as possible; some are just there so they don't get fined.  *Not like at work*, where everyone presumably wants to keep their job..  **To use that as an excuse is ignorant at the minimum, delusional at best.**"
12386,"üòÇ agentorange's behaviour is so horrible, he'd get fired the first day"
12387,ew fuck off
12388,"This is a huge issue that professors don‚Äôt seem to want to consider. Even if you‚Äôre in a managerial position, chances are you‚Äôre going to be working within a set timeframe. 

In college, everyone‚Äôs schedules are all over the place. 

Case in point, I had to do a group project with someone who worked during the day and attended class in the evenings. I attended class in the evenings and worked at night. The professor basically told us to ‚Äúwork it out.‚Äù I can‚Äôt put into words how much pointless stress that caused. I would have preferred just doing it on my own, as time consuming as it would have been. 

I get that teamwork and collaboration are important skills to learn, but one‚Äôs experience in college is not the same as one‚Äôs on-the-job experience. Not at all."
12389,To be fair I've found that group work in a work environment goes smoother than in a class environment. I personally think this is because if you don't do the work you get fired. In class lots of people are willing to get a low grade or even a zero. But in the real world very few want to be fired.
12390,"I‚Äôd 100% prefer to give all individual assignments rather than group work. It‚Äôs not any easier for us to grade/deal with group projects than it is to grade individual assignments. However, we are expected to give them by our accrediting body as they mandate a certain level of group work for teamwork building purposes."
12391,"It‚Äôs just that peoples schedules vary so wildly in college, it‚Äôs hard to work around everyone classes and jobs and whatever else they have going on and you end up with maybe one hour window a week that works out half the time"
12392,"Prof here. This thread has inspired me. Next time I assemble groups, I'll put on the board ""available mornings"" ""available midday"" and ""available evenings"" and let them self sort. Thanks"
12393,"People are telecommuting and continuing to make the world go around by working together through a tiny rectangular screen. Group work is always justified as being something you will have to do in the workforce. That hasn't stopped just because we're not in person. I think it can be justified in school as well. In fact, not having to drive to school every time someone wants to have a meeting is very beneficial."
12394,I feel genuinely sorry for anyone who has you as a student/roommate
12395,I know some professors are simply forced to do either group work or Discussions or break out groups because the University requires some kind of peer-to-peer interaction or something.
12396,"I disagree. If you‚Äôre not in a managerial position, your work stops when your schedule says you‚Äôre off. If you‚Äôre in a managerial position, you‚Äôll be contacted even if your schedule says you‚Äôre off. I get where you‚Äôre coming from with it seems unfair, and you could debate the point that you have 2 hours of class & other, more important things to do outside of class hours."
12397,"You‚Äôre definitely right. 

However, I graduated May 2020 so I got a little of the COVID era online school AND workforce. For me, it was much easier to work online for work because it was much more focused. Like, we would only be working on 1 project at a time with our consistent team so, it felt a lot less stressful than when you have several different classes and different groups of people to work with. 

In general, group work in the workforce feels easier because I‚Äôve been lucky enough that everyone on my team always cares about the outcome and pulling their own weight since it‚Äôs their literal job lol"
12398,"It‚Äôs not even universities individually or their administration. It‚Äôs accrediting bodies that certify that degree programs in certain disciplines comply with a set of standards. So, colleges of business accredited by AACSB must comply with AACSB requirements to remain accredited. Other colleges have similar accreditations they must maintain.

So, admin isn‚Äôt even necessarily the issue. It‚Äôs sometimes an organization outside the universities.

I understand your frustrations, though. It‚Äôs no less frustrating for us. I detest giving group projects and dealing with all the drama, the plagiarism, the passing of the buck, etc. It‚Äôs much less headache giving out individual assignments, so I do that when I can."
12399,"As a student, i feel three same, but also remember that is easier to complain on subs like this then to praise. You are only seeing complaints, but that doesn't mean that no one here ever wants to work!!"
12400,We can't complain about stuff we don't like?
12401,You talk like a fucking moron
12402,I kinda like it when I‚Äôm really struggling to understand the lessons but I hate the awkward silence of some of my peers not wanting to help each other
12403,"You should be doing that already.

12413,Congratulations. I can't wait to get Mines in 2024! Associate of science just talking alot of time and if I can fit these classes and work schedules

Good on you for picking a good field, especially as a first generation student who will benefit most from the job security."
12415,Congratulations! I was the first person in my family to receive an Associates degree as well so I totally understand the excitement. Now I'm finishing my Masters and have younger siblings who are working on their Associates. Your setting a new standard for your family and you should be very proud of that.

12434,"I had this happen but already was rooming with the dude. Went home over winter break, came back with 3 soccer jerseys and my 32 inch TV gone. Dude dropped out and never came back with my stuff LOL."
12435,That's straight up theft
12436,What the fuck lol
12437,Please tell me you filed a police report
12438,"I did, same year had 400$ stolen from my room from a kid who slid under the shower stall and took keys from people showering. Nothing comes about from it, both got it on their reports but that was about it!"
12439,It happens. My sister has been through 3 different roommates this summer and currently doesn't have a roommate for when she starts in 15 days
12440,Chances are he might be switching to a new roommate... but yeah I dont understand this either. Like what the hell? Blocking ur future roommate?
12441,"Yeah, my plan was to have my brother text him but I checked and he has unenrolled from my school so I see no reason to pursue it at this point"
12442,"What kind of college did you go to lol, I lived in dorms all 4 years and never had anything stolen or anything like that. Also I feel like it would be pretty easy to find the person and press charges etc. After all the university will have their file"
12443,"Christiano Ranaldo, David Beckham long sleeve, and  Zinedine Zidane... Quite the bandwagon fan if I say so myself!"
12444,"Had this happen to me when I was an undergrad... 

Worked in my favor tenfold cuz I had a single room to myself!"
12445,"This is the right course of action. If you're living on campus, it's the housing office's problem and not yours. Here's hoping you get to enjoy a private room for a little while!"
12446,Do you have a backup phone? Or can you use your parents‚Äô phones or something? I‚Äôm assuming you can still see his number even though he blocked you right?
12447,"Honestly, I‚Äôm up for going solo or getting a new one. I‚Äôm just gonna let res life handle it at this point, this guy wasn‚Äôt someone I chose so I‚Äôm gonna let the school handle it again"
12448,What jerseys were they fam
12449,"Woah, not to be rude, but he must have really hated you to go through the trouble of blocking you rather than just telling you. Me and my freshman year roommate weren't exactly friends either, but we kinda just coexisted for the year until we could move out. I've never heard of someone going as far as what your guy did though."
12450,"Sounds like he must be going through some shit, hope he's ok. As for you, pray they don't put anyone else in and give you a double to yourself"
12451,"In my two years living in the dorms, I went through probably 4-5 roommates, including one no show, and another that arrived less than 5 hours after I was notified (which is technically against the school contract). The vast majority of those roommates weren't good people (raging alcoholic, gaslighter, only spoke in passive aggressive grunts, etc.)"
12452,"I‚Äôm in the same boat, I move in soon and all I have is my roommates email so I reached out to see if he had any social media or get a phone number and I‚Äôve gotten no reply. I just would rather not have my first meeting be on move in day."
12453,My roommate blocked me on Instagram as soon as we got our roommate assignments last year. She unblocked me the day before move in and said she was at ‚Äúsummer camp‚Äù  and we ended up living together for a week and it was the most awkward week and we barely spoke . So then I moved out.
12454,"back in undergrad had guys using the girls restroom.  when i‚Äôd go pee at night i find them in the girl‚Äôs shower singing and stuff. and their piss all over the toilet seats.

so weird."
12455,"I‚Äôm so confused honestly. He was the one word answer, avoiding texts for days at a time kind of guy. I didn‚Äôt _really_ bear him any ill will and I truly don‚Äôt think I came off worthy of being hated, but I guess that‚Äôs his problem."
12456,That is a blessing in disguise!
12457,Oh okay. That makes more sense. Then ig try to find a new roommate? Or is it too late?
12458,The guy must be horrible with his communication skills if that was his way of telling you.
12459,Are you going to RICE? Think I‚Äôve heard of the guy maybe...
12460,Wow yeah this sounds totally like me. Lol I was so concerned until I read til the end.
12461,As an incoming freshman you have a lot of balls making such a statement.
12462,"Has happened to me last year, ended up spending the entire year in my small ass dorm alone and wouldn‚Äôt change that for the world. I loved not dealing with any roommate drama and soaking up all my personal space. You‚Äôll most likely be reassigned a new roomie if you live in a dorm that‚Äôs high demand. 
Make the best out of whatever situation you end up in, and some of the best roommates are the random ones - some of the worse are the ones you pick yourself."
12463,"Nope, different school"
12464,"That‚Äôs fucking insane. Those behaviors are par for the course for my autism (‚Äústimming‚Äù), there‚Äôs not a whole lot I can do to avoid doing that, especially under stress. There‚Äôs probably some kind of major academic ethical violation there. Ethics goes both ways, students shouldn‚Äôt cheat or pawn their work on others, but professors have to grade fairly, not discriminate or power trip and not make ridiculous course-loads or draconian rules too."
12465,"I KNOW, I FEEL SO BAD, BUT THATS ALSO SUCH A CAT THING TO DO. I *really hope* the person contested being failed for that, they didn't say if they did or not."
12466,"Agreed, I guess I understand the proctoring and having to do a room scan but these rules are insane. I'm writing something up now!"
12467,Your professor is a bastard
12468,"How can a cat possibly fail somebody? Am I reading that right, a cat looked around like an animal would and walked away? Did this professor think the cat was somehow trained to help the person cheat? If this is the same professor than you gotta speak up about this moron asap bro. Some momos would say you gotta suck it and it‚Äôll prepare you for the real world blah blah that‚Äôs a bunch of crap. You‚Äôre a human being not a drone and you deserve a lot more respect than what your professor is giving you."
12469,Good luck! Make sure to emphasize how being unable to read test questions outloud/ mouth them hinders your ability to take the test. Hopefully whoever you reach out to is understanding and helpful!
12470,"You are the adult in this situation. I know, really unusual given this is a *professor* of all people. But he is acting like a child.

Best to get a copy of those rules in writing and forward them to someone who can tell him he can't implement them.

Or as a true member of our generation you could always avoid the conflict and try to follow the rules (only engaging the professor if they try to give you a 0 by saying your cat walked in). But you might get a lower test score because of that due to fear and an unusual test environment."
12471,"I'm writing about the rules right now to my school! It's crazy, I'm in my own home and already have to do a full scan of the room I'm in **PLUS MY WHOLE BODY**üö©üö©üö© to show I'm not going to cheat? 
The room scan - fine, whatever, I've had to do it a dozen times now. The whole body? This is a new one that makes me uncomfortable. The fact that I have to do both of those and still cannot read to myself to understand a question?"
12472,"Yes it's the same prof, and I'm not sure tbh. I've had other profs say ""please try to keep animals out of the camera"" I guess not to distract other students during zoom calls and such - but nothing ever to the point of being failed on a test for an animal simply *existing*"
12473,He cannot do this. And the scan of your whole body?! What the hell is this?!?!?! Pretty sure it's an ADA violation too.
12474,[removed]
12475,Alas the rules state absolutely no form of head/face covering allowed. I'm actually writing a complaint right now about this because it's ridiculous that I can't even read a problem to myself in my own home while being watched
12476,No head coverings??? That‚Äôs so fucked up like under his rules someone can‚Äôt even wear a hijab??
12477,"I had a crazy proctor on Proctor U try and fail me/end the exam because the sun was shining through the window. She paused my exam twice to tell me the light was changing in the room and if it changed again it would be an automatic fail. I was like I can‚Äôt control the sun? Before the exam she was crazy to begin with. She made me show her my ID multiple times, get up and get my phone to show her where it was twice, and get mad that I had a headband in my hair."
12478,"I was actually thinking about that. At the bottom of the syllabus it states ""no one shall be discriminated against no matter their sex, gender, religion, race,"" etc etc, but that's something every teacher is required to put in the syllabus."
12479,"> ""aww kitty"" during the class

Meanwhile mid-lecture today my professor over Zoom was like ""Look I have a new baby! Look at my puppy, isn't she adorable, look at her!""

I think it's gonna be a good semester"
12480,OP said they read the words silently but their mouth is moving.  Indicating they could be reading aloud and waiting for a response from someone not in view.  But reading words or mouthing them rather is not a violation and is being treated as such by said professor.
12481,"This is the first and only prof who has been this extreme for rules. For one of my proctored math exams I cried LMAO, it was flagged but my prof didn't care and just responded ""sorry you feel this way about math"". I'm looking for someone rn to comment on these excessive rules."
12482,"You should contact the professor first.

Anyone that you contact is going to ask you that .

Then the chain of command is chair of dept first."
12483,Things like this usually go through a disability services office.
12484,Lmao wow! What a prick! I would just do your best to not break any of his/her rules and then never take their class again. I also wonder if there is a way to talk to someone about how excessive the requirements are.
12485,"Not the showing the body (although that is heeeeella creepy in itself), the not allowing students to read silently to themselves or look up. Some people can't help it."
12486,And do this as soon as possible. Do not wait. These offices take forever to get shit done.
12487,"I don't think you should have ""accommodations"" to be allowed to stim during an online exam bro... Just complain to the disability office, that'd probably get things done better."
12488,"Yeah probably it's so kids in the chat don't go ""aww kitty"" during the class but completely unreasonable to fail someone in an exam and it's not like people would be looking at your cat anyways."
12489,"holy shit stop bootlicking lmao. why are you commenting on everyone's posts defending this obviously shitty policy? also, I don't have an eligible disability, it's just how i think. i have absolutely no grounds to get an accomodation for not having an internal monologue. a lot of neurodivergent people don't have a diagnosis and probably couldn't get one, because there's no condition for ""being just a little bit different from everyone else"". none of my professors have this rule because it's batshit and controlling, and i refuse to take classes with assholes.

it should not be the student's responsibility to deal with bureaucratic nonsense just to bypass an asshole policy, it should be the professor's responsibility to simply not be an asshole. we put ourselves into life-altering debt just to attend school and have a chance at not being ground up by the cogs of capitalism. the least our professors could do as employees whose salaries are paid by our money is show a little basic human respect.

the existence of the disability office does not justify the institution of ableist policies. we shouldn't place the burden on physically/mentally unwell and/or neurodivergent students to jump through hoops for equitable treatment. it's very easy to demand from your staff the institution of non-ableist policies. the fact that this hasn't been included as a basic requirement for syllabi reflects the persistent exclusion of disabled and neurodivergent people from everyday life. it ought not be the burden of society's downtrodden to humbly request fair treatment from the people who control their very lives. it ought to be the burden of those institutions to build inclusive policies to begin with. the disability office should be a last resort, not a first resort. kindly fuck off if you disagree because i am uninterested in entertaining this line of argumentation any further."
12490,You could try wearing a mask to get around the lip reading rule.
12491,"Similar experience here. I had a terrible proctor when I was taking the GED. I was checking the webcam to make sure I was in frame and the proctor messaged me to tell me how apparently unacceptable this was and I had to waste several minutes showing my room to ensure there wasn‚Äôt any sort of illicit material(like fucking anyone would cheat on the GED). Then he said, when I was out of frame because I couldn‚Äôt check anymore, that I needed to be in frame and that if *I* caused any more problems my test would be rovoked."
12492,"i am almost incapable of thinking coherently without talking out loud. i've always whispered to myself while taking every test in person, which has been made a *ton* easier with masks. online tests are even better because i can actually talk things out at full volume."
12493,"The professor must hate cats, there's no other explanation."
12494,Okay not advice but yay!!!!!! Go you! You have such a fantastic future ahead of you!
12495,Ive always been interested with trade jobs thats why i never considered anything else
12496,"One step forward. I wish you luck, and I cannot stress this enough, finish what you start. Seriously, I did the same thing and bounced trade school to college without a plan. Besides that, stay focused and apply yourself in trade school."
12497,[deleted]
12498,Thank you
12499,I‚Äôm happy for you. The folks I know in trades do better than most university graduates and seem to have actually learned stuff in their classes. I‚Äôm in my junior year at college and I feel like so have hardly learned anything - a bachelor‚Äôs degree just happens to be the only way to get into most jobs I‚Äôm interested in.
12500,"I did. I was studying plumbing, but I decided to change my mind and go to college for biology"
12501,"It is wonderful to hear that you have decided to go to trade school! I think that trade school as an educational option is far undervalued, unfortunately. This is especially true in high school where your counselors and teachers make college seem like the ONLY option.

Trade school is relatively inexpensive when compared to other educational options, they are typically not difficult to get to, and they aren't as long as a traditional four-year university. 

  
If you decide to learn a valuable skill such as welding, plumbing, electrical work, etc, there is definitely a lot of money to be made. 

Speaking as a law student, I am very willing to bet that you will make as much if not more money than me your first 5 years out of school as I will. You will also be out of school in a couple of years instead of eight years which is also massively valuable 

I think you made a very good choice."
12502,[deleted]
12503,Im taking lessons from larry bird videos
12504,Damn and I still struggled just to find a job since 2018 üò≥
12505,smart man! Best of luck
12506,Only advice is get your shit-talking game ready brotha!
12507,"You‚Äôre gonna be really happy you went to a trade school first. People really put these professions down but I don‚Äôt get why? I make more than enough after only two years at my community college. Learned about manufacturing  (CNC, CAD, Solidworks and all that fun stuff) and I never looked back."
12508,">Ive been poor most of my life so i cant really afford a normal college or uni

You'll probably would have been paying trade school like you will a book smart university with a loan from the government. Fafsa or something else.

But trade school is a great option. I honestly wish I would have went to one the brats at my university suck.

Once you get out of trade school in a few years you could always go to book smart university and get a business degree."
12509,"My dad made six figures just doing electrician work back in the day. Mind you this was back in the 00s, but the union brought him the big bucks."
12510,Absolutely great idea. You're going to make more money with less debt faster than the people who will put you down for not going to a University
12511,Congrats! :)
12512,"Trades pay a really good wage especially these days where there is high demand for these skills. Just be prepared for the shit storm bureaucracy of these fields. I was just a paper pusher in the construction field for a few years and the hardest part was dealing with all the red tape, rules, and hoops to jump through to get something simple done. It can get frustrating and guys on the ground are communicated with a lot but if you push through it you‚Äôll get used to it."
12513,You'll make more money than people with a degree so good on you
12514,May I be nosy and ask what law students salary expectations are for the first ten years?
12515,Good for you !
12516,"Congratulations on this big step. This shit can change your life for real. Well done.

Don ªt be afraid to ask for help. Find out what resources are there as support and use them. 

Hang out with people who are focused and have a plan."
12517,Good for you. The only advice is to make sure the school is accredited. I think community colleges have trade certifications.
12518,Can someone explain what a trade school is? I think I don't know what it is even in Italian
12519,"Awesome of you to go that route. Wish I would've done that two years out of high school as opposed to decades of bombing math classes thinking I was going to become Zeframe Cochrane or Tony Stark if I got that engineering degree. Instead it was just struggling through basic math classes and running into those ""retire by 30/my wife hasn't even born yet"" types. At 37, I haven't given up, but am not really taking any classes yet again either due to focusing more on my current trucking job and the pandemic making in-person classes a no-go.  


  
Stay with it and stay humble. By the time you reach my age, you'll be cruising down easy street and collecting the rent checks."
12520,"This is awesome! Trade schools are way undervalued, as are the people who work in the trades. They really need to bring shop classes back to high schools imho. I don't know you but I'm happy for you, congratulations!"
12521,Because people are stupid. They want to build leet computer programs and be a cool tech kid like in movies not repair military machines overseas for 250k a year.
12522,"School that primarily teaches what most would describe as blue collar occupations. Hands on, working class jobs such as welding, plumbing, HVAC, various repair/mechanical jobs etc"
12523,"It is essentially vocational training/Education. A place where you learn a skill or trade in some cases applying some theory as well as a lot practical application. Not as long as earning a bachelor degree, but depending on the program timeline can vary. Trades can be highly sought after. I think it's a pretty cool area and wish it wasn't poopooed as much in the U.S. educational system."

12531,Yes I much prefer stimulants that last longer than 15min for crunch time
12532,You must be fun at parties 
12533,Ain't that the truth
12534,Submitted at 12:01 once. Still accepted lol
12535,"I always intentionally submit my essay 2 minutes before the deadline, no matter if it were already completed earlier. I always catch something wrong with my essay when I re-check it, so I give myself as many re-checks as I can."

12555,"Yeah every other part of it seems fine. You will definitely be ‚Äòthe girl with the f-ing wings‚Äô (or more likely, ‚Äòthe girl who was wearing wings for two seconds, then ditched them‚Äô) if attempted in a crowd. 

Also probably more appropriate for a party than for going to section or whatever."
12556,"Tbh it‚Äôs Halloween. Even if you show up to class like that I don‚Äôt think it really bothers anyone, if anything it just makes them go ‚Äúwow sick Halloween costume‚Äù. At a party it‚Äôs expected to wear a costume so I think you‚Äôre covered"
12557,"Frat party is appropriate. I‚Äôd bring an alternative outfit if it‚Äôs too much. Like maybe a gold shawl, you cover your shoulders, and take off the wings, and suddenly you‚Äôre a Greek princess or something idk make it up"

Mostly bc no one wears costumes at my college for class, so while the costume looks great, I can just imagine how awkward it would be to be the only person in class wearing that (maybe less if it's a lecture hall).

But for a costume party, go wild."

12571,It‚Äôs never too much on Halloween
12572,"Depends. 

For class? Maybe. Some colleges actually have a dress code (mine does) and the professors would promptly kick you out. Not everyone does though so check out your rules.

A party? Not really, though depending on your local weather and the type of party you're attending, you might want to make sure it's practical. Like if it's cold where you live maybe you should add a shawl or some extra fabric. 

If the party is crowded and/or there's going to be a lot of drinking maybe you'd want to wither minimize the wings or ditch them all together so they don't get in the way."

12617,"I think here the DOJ found race was *the* determining factor, while with AA race is *supposed* to be one of multiple factors considered ‚Äî like a positive or negative weight vs. Yale‚Äôs equivalent of multiplying by a coefficient of zero. IANAL though."
12618,Nah it wasn‚Äôt the justice department that did that. It was a private group.
12619,"Fuck affirmative action. I understand that the concept of it was created in good faith but as a half-white AND half-Asian person, I am stuck in the worst situation.

It's a shame that any white or Asian person has to tell themselves that they might be at a disadvantage purely because of the color of their skin.

Admissions should be based on academic merit and family background. There's no way I have it easier as a middle-class Asian than a child of black millionaires."

12621,Inb4 this thread gets locked

Actually I think the Ivies do pretty well on financial aid, but the rest of the top 20 private schools probably have this mindset."
12623,"Fair. They probably had the perfect application, tbh. That‚Äôs the one issue I have with affirmative action, they should take wealth and background into account."
12624,This has been a nationwide open secret for awhile now.
12625,Ah yes because a black person who was raised in a rich family should be higher priority because he is black. Why not look at class instead of race then if your making this argument?
12626,"It‚Äôs interesting. One thing that came out from the Harvard case was that 83% of African American and Latino students are still considered ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù by Harvard itself, whatever ‚Äúwealthy means‚Äù... (to clarify, the percentage was something around high 70‚Äôs or 80‚Äôs, pretty sure it was 83). Meanwhile I grew up as a low-income asian. Single parent, under the poverty line, bad family history, the whole shebang. There were so many scholarships and programs meant to help ‚Äúdisadvantaged‚Äù students that I wasn‚Äôt even eligible to apply to. And watching all my Low-Income friends get into these programs because they were a different race than me... I‚Äôm lucky I got into an Ivy League in the end but it‚Äôs still super shitty and outright racist. Like White people didn‚Äôt totally trash Asia just like Africa and the Americas, the excuse of ‚Äúrighting‚Äù history doesn‚Äôt really make sense. It‚Äôs just so aggravating watching other people receive benefits because they got fucked over in history but you still get penalized EVEN COMPARED TO WHITE PEOPLE even though you got fucked over historically as well. I guess I finally agree with the current administration on one thing...

Either way, whether it‚Äôs right or wrong isn‚Äôt even in question. Racism is unconstitutional. That‚Äôs already been decided. If you read through the presiding judges comments on the Harvard case she basically claimed that Affirmative Action doesn‚Äôt exist (pretty well known that it does). As a judge, she can‚Äôt even argue that AA is right because the mere existence of affirmative action is unconstitutional and she knows that. Trying to argue that AA is right would require admitting it exists, immediately making it unconstitutional. So she just went around it by pretending it isn‚Äôt real. Kinda funny/interesting actually.

Edit: to be clear, like another poster said, the real and biggest problem is still legacy students/specialized wealthy athletes/ rich but mediocre prep schoolers taking most of the spots at top schools. The problem above is still a problem, but it‚Äôs more likely that the prep-schooled mediocre kid who is double legacy and got recruited for squash took your spot at Princeton rather than some black kid."
12627,Bakke vs. CA fyi :)
12628,">who didn‚Äôt have nearly as many advantages as they had 

They‚Äôre not using advantages/disadvantages as criteria, they‚Äôre using race. There may be a correlation but that doesn‚Äôt measure up because discrimination occurs to individuals.

If they found a way to use advantages/disadvantages as criteria instead of directly using a protected class, it would be fine. And a system like that would naturally favor the most disadvantaged communities/demographics.

For example, discriminating based purely on income or another circumstance would be better. Just don‚Äôt use a protected class.

Racism isn‚Äôt cool with me üòé"
12629,"> Stop blaming affirmative action and diversity quotas for unfair admissions systems.


Affirmative action and diversity quotas are always going to be unfair to some group though. If you are going to admit a certain number of people that normally wouldn‚Äôt be admitted based solely on grades, it‚Äôs going to be at the expense of someone else who did have the grades."
12630,ITT: A lot of people that don't understand systemic racism
12631,"It is sad that the colleges use skin color to determine how desirable a candidate is. This is racism, plain and simple. Ends (a diverse class) do not justify the means. Period. If we do not allow race to be used in other situations, why do we allow it for college? Imagine if you were denied an apartment because you are black or white."
12632,"That‚Äôs the name of the game. 

These elite colleges account for a teeny tiny percentage of college students. With sub-5% acceptance rates, kids get shafted for the smallest things.

Of all the 4.0 gpa, perfect sat score kids applying to these colleges, a small percent will be accepted. This means that colleges take the smallest, most minute reasons to reject a person. Dont get mad that colleges will accept an applicant based on their race, colleges want diversity for a variety of reasons. 

Even so, THESE COLLEGES ARENT JUST ACCEPTING ANY BLACK KIDS, these guys probably have 4.0s and amazing resumes. Minority or not, most kids accepted into these colleges probably earned their spot.

I just hate it when people use their wealth to cheat the system. That is what spoils the system for over represented applicants."
12633,"There can‚Äôt be quotas and they can‚Äôt have defined/assigned point values, because even if they are one of many considerations, if they have measurable values, they end up becoming the thing that determines if a person gets in or not. So just be ‚Äúambiguous‚Äù about it is the point"
12634,"Yeah lol. Apparently it's time for ""meritocracy"" at the very end of the race that is education, and it's unfair to correct for systemic racial educational advantages driven by socioeconomic realities. To get into Harvard, you still need a crazy GPA & extracurriculars even if you are a black or Latino kid. No one who gets in isn't 'qualified.' Furthermore, there really aren't that many Black or Latino kids 'using' affirmative action to 'steal' seats away from 'rightfully deserving' Whites or Asians. They're not even applying in most cases. Forget even having the elite background needed to get in with the highest probability. That's a shit joke, a fever dream cooked up by racist idiots."
12635,"You're not at a disadvantage because of the color of your skin, rather, you're put on the same level playing field as other people, REGARDLESS of the color of anyone's skin.

I'm an Asian from a lower class household (single mom w 3 kids, homeless between the ages of 12-15), but even I'm not salty at AA. Some quick Googling shows the disparity between Asian and white college admissions vs black, latino, native american college admissions is far too big to be based on any sort of organic meritocracy.

I can elaborate more if you'd like, but I doubt you'll listen and I'd just be wasting my time typing a response, but do let me know if you genuinely wanna have a conversation about AA (because I do believe there's a convo to be had there, just not the one you're trying to have in your original comment)"
12636,"Storytime that I generally don't like to share:

That's not true. I didn't go to an Ivy, but I went to a pretty elite private school (if you want to know which, PM me, I'm not putting that on blast) and the opportunities there were tremendous. I transferred to a pretty good state school to major in stats after a mental breakdown (also an interesting story) and I'm going to be clawing my way into an entry level job that pays as much as I would have gotten graduating from that school with a degree in econ."
12637,What do you mean racism isn't a good long term strategy to beat racism?
12638,"the goal isn't equality, it's equity"
12639,Fairly certain it was apealed and is going to the supreme court now.
12640,I can‚Äôt support affirmative action.  Not only does it hurt certain white and asian students but minorities are scrutinized when they are accepted. Did they get in because they deserved it or was it to fulfill a quota. That being said admission always prioritize the applicants with the most monetary value. Legacies and peoples whose parents donate massive amounts of money and buildings.
12641,[deleted]
12642,"Affirmation action helps affluent minority. I graduated from a masters program and the majority of black people in my program didn't come from inner city or ghetto. They came from upper to middle class family. These people don't need help. Rather than looking at race, look at social economic background would be most appropriate. These will help URMs from disadvantaged background.

edit:spelling"
12643,"Yeah. Even so, idk why people stress over elite admissions.

State schools do just as fine as job elevating the lower class in terms of economics. These elite schools account for like 1% of students.

Sure, they have their advantages. But why the fuck are we so worried about getting our kids into Harvard when they‚Äôll do just as fine in life if they went to a state school?"
12644,How did they die of stress? I am sorry but that part is somewhat unclear.

Instead of addressing the issue our college kept saying ""condolences but we are not responsible"" not even an apology, or a change in management. But hey i guess i paid my college fees to just die due to overworking."
12663,"Do you have an advisor or dean of students? Talk to them about it, not just some random professor. Plus, if it‚Äôs between a major change and you quitting, the university would much rather keep getting your money for a different major than not let you change majors (I would imagine)."
12664,"I did,i talked to my academic advisor,since most of my university funding were from Government tax or NGOs they don't really care about leeching of student's money,the fees were also cheaper bcs of this, but on the other hands they just dont really care abt their student's mental state."
12665,"I 100% agree,but what students were asking were a recognition of not 1 but 2 life of student that was taken due to the failed education system,sure time management is very important,yet we were not even subjected to a final study break, and were expected to submit our assignment even until our finals.which seems abit odd."

**Hi Professor -- Thank you for your time today. Based on our conversation, you conclude that I cannot make-up the test because I could not be in class due to testing positive for XYZ.**

**If possible, would you be open a re-consideration  to your conclusion?**

**I would love it if I could make-up the exam.**

Letters like this will serve two purposes: a) you had the conversation with your professor. (b) You indicated what was said in writing. (c) You have a paper trail. (d) The professor could reconsider their thoughts after seeing a start to a paper trail. 

Last, (e) it no longer becomes a he said or she said discussion because the professor would have corrected or clarified any misunderstanding by responding back to the email. Them not responding is an act of guilt."

Also, I am scheduled to do another Covid test today on campus."
12708,Forward this to the department Dean so they have it in the professor‚Äôs own writing as proof.
12709,"Oh and be prepared to send the test results and emails with your prof to the head of the department if they ask. So whatever you send  in the email, make sure you can back it up with solid proof. You don't want to get into a game of ""he said, she said""."
12710,Thank you so much
12711,"Prof here.

This is a medical issue.  If the prof knows that you have Covid, and you have proof, and they still don‚Äôt let you make up the exam‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Then you send an email to the chair of her department.  That is inexcusable."
12712,I already emailed her. And she responded in email saying I can‚Äôt make up the test.
12713,"According to the school policy that if you have any cold symptoms stay at home and go tested first then go back to the class.

Like just followed the school policy and now I am getting punished"
12714,"To be fair you already took a test and passed, it would be unfair for another attempt as other students only get one /s

I just want to add that this is a joke"
12715,"In addition to dean, go to the student union/ombudsman (If your college has one) and the accomodations office, since COVID is a medical condition he might have caught himself in moderately deep shit with them"
12716,"I was referring to the COVID test, sorry for the confusion"
12717,"You have proof that you have followed school policy, stick to that and go up the chain of command as needed. I know it's really stressful right now, but as long as you fight for yourself you should be able to take the exam or make up the points another way. 

It sucks it has to go this way, be sure to take care of yourself too! It's okay to take a break if you start feeling worse."
12718,Just show up and give your professor Covid
12719,Email the teacher and get this in writing and immediately forward it to a dean or higher up and this should be resolved. The teacher is way out of bounds on this.
12720,Don‚Äôt listen to that idiot. Email the department head anyways since you got nothing to lose. You don‚Äôt know how your other tests are gonna go so don‚Äôt just take a zero if you can help it.
12721,"Thank you, I will email the head of department now."
12722,"This is a useful skill forever after as well. I've sent many emails at work that started with ""As per our conversation..."""
12723,"Because the student is not being allowed to take the test, not choosing not to take the test."
12724,The professor replied back to me saying either way we are going to replace your final exam with lowest exam grade.
12725,"I still want to take the test since it will be easier than the final. So, should I email the head department or no."
12726,Should also check covid protocol for your school. Here you're supposed to contact the Dean of Students and they help you set up your return protocol and facilitate contact w/ professors for make up work or absences
12727,Biological warfare? This is the way
12728,"Ugh okay. I see what her line of thinking is - and yes it would be less work on everyone if you don't take the exam, I think you should still be allowed to if you want to. 

Or if you're confident that you'll do well on the final, take the 0 on this exam and it'll be replaced later. 

If not, try to explain to the prof that you'd prefer to take the exam anyway just in case you do poorly on the final."
12729,Wtf
12730,that's such a bullshit response. the school equivalent of making workers use vacation days for covid quarantine time.
12731,"We have the same policy in our class *except* for Covid. I‚Äôd be really upset because as it stands if I do well on the course exams I get to skip the final. I do better on the regular exams than the final because well‚Ä¶it‚Äôs less info and more recent. So if we miss an exam for like an ER trip we don‚Äôt get a retake, BUT if we miss for Covid, we do get a retake. So, I personally would say something to the chair since Covid is a weird time for everyone but I expect they may take the professors side due to the ambiguity in the syllabus wording."
12732,"Go over their head, like the other commenter said. Professor is useless at this point."

It's not always about money, but every career field you can find a way to make a decent living. For you, it sounds like that would be becoming licensed and doing private practice ($$$).

12741,"with only a bachelor‚Äôs, bio+chem+physics don‚Äôt necessarily pay well, lab technicians especially don‚Äôt often make that much more than minimum wage for the area

No job is going to require me to use my knowledge about the Romantics on the daily, but my critical and analytical thinking skills, my writing and communication, my language skills are going to be in use even when I'm not working. These are the skills that STEM and business people lack but who cares about falling for propaganda when you making that dough, right. /s"
12744,"Thank you for stating this.  Any major can be useless.  Not everyone is fricking genius when it comes to Math/Science.  Not everyone who is a psychology major will end up as a family therapist.  Or go on to med school.  Having a good understanding of psychology is useful in law/criminal justice, education and HR field.  

Theater Arts Majors can find great success as casting agents, screen writers, film makers, producers and in marketing.  Think of how many ads are filmed on tv for example.  

Police Officers/Nurses who minored in Theater arts can use their acting skills to help adapt how they are reacting to a mentally unstable person.  Or give them an awareness if a crime scene may have been staged.  Real estate agents can draw on their theater arts background to help sell a house.

The world can not exist without non stem major related jobs.  Money is nice, and earing 60-80 grand a year is nice as well.  But some people realize working as a Chemist, even it it means making 90+ grand a year, would make them miserable and a mental train wreck.  

Some people acutally choose happiness at 45 grand a year working as a small town HR admin for the county fire department over the misery of working in a STEM related field, even if it brings them more cash."

I‚Äôm with you though, I graduate with a bachelor of science in psychology in May and I will going through a graduate program to become licensed as a marriage and family therapist.

They tend to back out of premed and instead go into CS or business.

12763,"Yea for sure; just speaking on accounting I‚Äôd say it probably has the most intensive courses of the business majors along with finance, but on the other hand it‚Äôs very lucrative in terms of career prospects. 

It‚Äôs not unheard of in this career to earn 100k+ in less than 3 years post graduation (COL obviously varies this) after your bachelors. This is especially the case if you choose to start out in public accounting and get the CPA license early on. But even if you didn‚Äôt go that route, accounting historically been the most recession proof industry, because demand is always high for us due to the nature of the work.

But beyond accounting, what sets business majors apart from other areas is that the earnings potential is going to be very high as long as you have a strong network and play your cards right. Just my 2 cents"
12764,"I had a professor who was late to an intro class, so we went to his office to remind him. When we walked into his office he had his feet up on the desk, just chilling.

I think a program like ""Pathfinders"" would be cool, where freshmen are matched up with an upperclassman for the first week to show them to their classes, or at least signage / marked paths to help. Maybe it's not such a big deal to others as it was to me, but it really sucked being lost and anxious on top of the stress of a new place. "

You mean common and what institutions are banking on for this fall.

College instructor of 10 years here. Most of the institutions I work at don't have any kind of formal subbing system in place. You just teach through illness or cancel class and don't tell anyone. Only the CC where I worked had strict guidelines around subs and offered high hourly pay to sub in for someone's classes.

Also, there's a good chance your prof is an adjunct, or a part-time teacher, and would have been fired if it had become known he was sick. Adjuncts often piece together teaching classes at several colleges or other part-time jobs to make ends meet. Your prof could've been out thousands of much-needed dollars if he'd let anyone know he was sick.

I agree it's a fucked up system. Colleges have been broke-ass since the '90s at least."
12784,"Adjuncts are essentially contract employees who get hired (and paid) by the class. They generally have no benefits, health insurance, or other employment guarantees.

Thus, if you can't teach a large part of the class you signed up for, it'll be given to another adjunct (or full-time employee) and you won't be paid. Getting assigned classes every term is up to the whims of the department and enrollment. If you're seen as someone too ""unreliable"" to teach or make back-up plans if you fall ill, it's unlikely you'll receive future class assignments.

If this seems crazy to you, it's quite common. Over sixty percent of your college classes are taught by adjuncts nationwide. 

I was in a faculty meeting recently where our HR director was answering questions. An adjunct asked her directly if adjuncts would still receive full compensation for their courses if they got COVID. After a massive pause, the HR director said, 

""I expect we'll be able to do that.""

The adjunct said, ""You expect to, or you will?""

She eventually capitulated and said that they would ""honor the contracts,"" but that raised even more red flags to me--those contracts haven't gone out yet, so it would be all too easy for them to add a cute clause exempting adjuncts from pay in the event of COVID."
12785,"Your professor is a goddamn legend! No one should have to do what they did, but they did it for you."
12786,That's pretty solid for a professor. That's crazy. I'm glad he pulled through and everything got situated for you.
12787,"I honestly think it's above and beyond solid. He deserve a medal or something. I wouldn't give a heck about my class if I were a professor and got COVID19. I'd tell everyone to do whatever, read whatever, but I would not film from my phone. Everyone gets A's or B's. 

This is probably why I should never be a professor, but still. The guy's got to get some acknowledgement for being so awesome."
12788,"Yup! I make an effort to ask every class if they know what adjuncts are, and I'd say 1/20 does (for each class).

The college hierarchy works like this:

Adjunct (part-time instructor; the following positions are full-time, with benefits, insurance, etc.)

NTT (non-tenure track) professor (also often called a lecturer)

TT (tenure-track) ~~Associate~~ Assistant professor

Tenured (Associate and later full) professor

In a nutshell, tenure is an application process that used to guarantee profs job security and intellectual freedom--the ability to throw their weight around in the department without fearing retribution like non-tenured teachers have to worry about (because they're all trying to seek tenure). Anymore, though, tenured faculty don't have it much better off than NTT, and tenured jobs are extremely hard to come by and even more difficult to get. We're talking some of the most competitive jobs on the planet.

There's a lot more to say, but here's a start. I suppose I wish more college students were simply aware of this system, and that since adjuncts receive such shit compensation, they're often more devoted to teaching and students than \*tenured faculty are since there's not much reason to adjunct aside from the love of teaching, and tenured faculty have other reasons for working at a university (namely, research and publishing.) Appreciate your adjuncts, advocate for them if you can, and for the love of god, do not make petty complaints to the department about them without just cause.

\*I'll add that lecturers, too, are primarily hired for teaching, and are more likely to be skilled and devoted teachers. 

Edits for correcting the academic hierarchy and clarity"
12789,This is a lot of interesting information that I never knew or considered. That's really an interesting perspective on exactly how unfair some professors have it over the tenured staff.
12790,Why would he have been fired if he was sick as an adjunct?
12791,Tbf graduating in the next year is gonna be shitty and probably worse than a longer time in school
12792,"My department just had a meeting. Someone asked, what do we do if someone gets sick or dies? Answer: uhhhh we don‚Äôt know."
12793,Your prof deserves all the reddit awards in the world
12794,"The sad part is that even without the threat of Covid, a department (and/or its administration) should have at least a general game plan for what to do if an instructor becomes unavailable to teach mid-semester. Stuff happens."
12795,"Yikes, it‚Äôs good you got a solid grade still and he was kind with grading.

What class was it? Was it something critical to your major that you‚Äôre gonna have to know later?"
12796,"Some entire departments at smaller schools consist of one or two faculty. In those situations, asking someone else to step in and cover courses for another instructor might literally involve expecting someone who teaches horticulture to cover courses in microbiology, or a welding instructor to cover 3D printing courses. It's not always feasible."
12797,"You‚Äôd think. 

I used to be an adjunct in a program generally ranked 1-3 in the world. I wasn‚Äôt teaching one semester then all of a sudden my inbox starts getting flooded with emails from students that found my email on some materials from when I‚Äôd taught the class the previous semester asking for help because the assigned instructor (also an adjunct) never appeared by the first day, didn‚Äôt answer any emails, and they also couldn‚Äôt get into touch with the head of the program (an executive masters degree). I finally was able to get into touch with her and after she also couldn‚Äôt get into touch with the other teacher asked me if I could step in because she didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I also had a similar situation in grad school (same school and program) where the full professor went to China after week 3 and said he would not be returning (before the days of zoom) and not even the provost cared because there was a TA. But the TA was new and didn‚Äôt know any of the curriculum because she similarly had not received any instruction."
12798,"On netflix show ""patriot act"" they did a great explaintion on this and how universities hire TAs and adjunct prof and basically take advantage of them, making them do more work sometimes more than tenured professors and underpay them. Opened my eyes to how cruel universities are"
12799,"Stay strong, hope it all works out!"
12800,"Agreed, unless it's some super niche and advanced grad class, some other professor in the department should've been able to step in and teach"
12801,"Just FYI, you‚Äôve got the order wrong on tenure-track for the US. 

Tenure track faculty start out as non-tenure assistant professors, and tenure is usually granted along with promotion to associate. Both associate and full professors are typically tenured.

I‚Äôd also be careful about telling your students that adjuncts care more about teaching. I‚Äôve personally notes no correlation between position (adjunct, NTT, TT) and how much a colleague cares. I have tenured colleagues that go far above and beyond, and adjunct colleagues who don‚Äôt even want to know students names. I think it‚Äôs sad that anyone in such a position doesn‚Äôt care about teaching, although we don‚Äôt reward it much in how we assess higher ed faculty in the US at least."
12802,Also it seems like your prof recovered since they came back and appeared? That‚Äôs cool
12803,"> and plan on teaching yourself - while making sure to follow the schedule 

This is necessary for college in general.  The prof will present the material, then it's up to each student to consume/understand it however they require."
12804,"Instructor and the equivalent of a department chair here. My ""department"" consists of myself and one other instructor. We both teach 4-6 unique courses and a similar number of hours per week, often falling during the same timeslots. I've taught most of the courses he teaches, but he hasn't taught any I teach. If he falls ill I'll do my best to keep the students on track, but I can't ask him to do the same for me. As a college, the general plan if an instructor falls ill is either to have another faculty member lend a hand if possible, or just expect the sick faculty to teach remotely through their illness. I've confirmed that this may mean cancelling a week or two of class before the instructor is well enough to resume instruction remotely. There's really nothing else that can be done in some cases; colleges refuse to hire enough faculty to even comfortably cover normal course loads, let alone having enough to help substitute under circumstances like this."
12805,Looks like the prof was teaching from their cell phone while in isolation at the hospital. =(
12806,"We don't fire adjuncts for being sick. When they need a sub, we dock their pay to pay for it, though."
12807,Gosh... so sorry that they had to teach and deal with that!!
12808,"Yeesh, yea. I pushed my expected graduation date a year forward because of all this."
12809,Yikes.
12810,"> Over sixty percent of your college classes are taught by adjuncts nationwide

I don't think that number checks out. Nationally, about 25% of all professors are adjuncts.

It's hard to get a read on how many courses are taught by adjuncts since you can have someone only teaching every other year, someone teaching 3 courses a year, and someone teaching at 3 different universities with 10 courses per semester."
12811,"I don‚Äôt disagree with the whole of what you‚Äôre saying, but I will say that many adjuncts are not doing it because they love teaching. Some are, just like some NTT/TT faculty are. 

Many are doing it because it‚Äôs the only job they can get, and many are doing it because they hope it will lead them to a TT job where they don‚Äôt have to teach as much. I‚Äôve also seen the conditions turn a lot of adjuncts bitter who were originally devoted teachers but have decided the best way to deal is with checking out and doing the minimum, and I don‚Äôt blame them for that. 

I‚Äôd also say it seems like you‚Äôre basing your observations off of primarily R1 and R2 institutions, which are research intensive schools and among a minority of colleges and universities. State comprehensive schools (predominantly undergrad) and liberal arts colleges are very different than what you describe. There are around 4500 colleges and universities in the US, only around 250 of those are R1 and R2 schools."
12812,"So glad to hear that your professor is all right now and that you did well in the class. 

FWIW, the advice you give is good even in a non-COVID life. If you read the textbook and communicate with your classmates, you'll get a much better understanding with the class notes as the supplement. 

I hope that the second part of the class goes well for you and hope that your professor makes a full recovery."

12817,"nearly two months here :/ break starts this friday, ends mid-February 

I picked up a 7pm-11pm shift working freight mon-friday so at least I'll have money coming in and won't have lonely nights"
12818,"Same. I have some work, but they‚Äôre on winter break starting next week for 2 weeks. I‚Äôm filling in slots of time and going to volunteer so I can stay on a schedule. Cause just sitting in front of the tv all day gets old and feels unproductive. Classes ended on Friday last week but my next semester doesn‚Äôt start until the day after Martin Luther King Jr day which is January 18th in 2021."
12819,"You‚Äôre a human being, not a human doing! Just ‚Äúbe‚Äù and see ya in the spring :)

ETA: congrats on finishing an extremely difficult and effed semester."
12820,Same. Just been trying to give myself some rest and relax while doing some hobbies everyday. There is nothing wrong with a break
12821,"We have to be careful here - that phrase is emblematic of a cognitive bias. Just about everything is easier said than done.

Some things I have on my bucket list include coding side projects, reading some of the classic/great novels, starting a YouTube/twitch channel, learning an instrument, exercising, etc. 

If you dedicate an entire day to researching and brainstorming activities/hobbies you want to do (a fraction of your time spent studying), it's quite likely that you'll come up with something."
12822,Agreed. My job doesn‚Äôt have many hours to pick up either. Kinda sucks ngl
12823,same
12824,"I guess that's why they say ""be careful what you ask for"". Which makes me think - how do retired people feel?"
12825,"I keep checking canvas frantically, until I remember that I‚Äôm done with the term and that there‚Äôs no more assignments"
12826,"For me, finals aren't over yet. I have one tomorrow morning at 8:30 am and another one scheduled for Wednesday afternoon beginning at 12 pm. I tend to think that final exams are not a good way to end off a semester. Think about it, you have to take multiple cumulative exams in a short period of days, which could lead to students being overly anxious and how you did in previous exams might affect how well you would perform in the later ones. And yes, I tend to feel empty after finishing everything up. Good thing I would have some reviewing to do this year after I finish the finals which I'll probably start on next week."
12827,Yeah my exams finished 2 weeks ago and I don't start uni again until March. Just feels like I have nothing to do lol everything is getting so boring very quickly
12828,Easier said than done...LOL
12829,"For real. When we‚Äôre in school we always wish for break. Now you got it, do whatever the fuck you want! This is the only time u have free time, given if u don‚Äôt have other obligations like work or applications to do."
12830,Sounds like a good opportunity to find some sort of internship or at least part-time work. Do everything you can to stay far away from the lazy version of you
12831,"I think work is actually fulfilling. As long as it's not overwhelmingly dreadful, it makes things like playing video games and relaxing much more rewarding. Overall it adds a sense of routine and balance to your life that is necessary. I'd much prefer to work than stay home all day (in my opinion). Additionally, you're making money."
12832,"Same dude, so much empty time I don't know what to do with myself! 

Edit: Perfect opportunity to look for internships, scholarships, employment and volunteer opportunities!"
12833,Ooooo I like this one
12834,"Haha...that's human psychology in a nut-shell. All your passions fly outta the window when ya got nothin' to do, and come back with full force when you're crammed with 5-6 courses in a Sem LOL"
12835,I feel the same way. I've been trying to stay as productive as I can and actually started working on some of the concepts that will be covered next semester. That and going to the gym regularly. It still really sucks though. Days seem to drag on now lmao.
12836,Working a job with a degree you spent time to obtain to only get paid minimum wage and be extremely overworked is not what I‚Äôd consider fulfilling at all. It‚Äôs extremely dreadful. My reason for going back to school a 2nd time. In hopes to better my circumstances. But I totally see were your coming from.
12837,Lmao
12838,"I work a lot unfortunately. I don‚Äôt have the time to find something fulfilling. It‚Äôs more or less all in my head. I think I‚Äôm going a bit stir crazy with the eat, sleep, school, work, and repeat schedule. I try to fit in hobbies when I can."
12839,"Hopefully great if they have enough money to travel, or grandkids, volunteer work, a busy social life. But my grandfather was retired my whole life and basically wasted away in his arm chair"
12840,"Same. I'm just nervously waiting for my results and idk what to do. Literally nothing is exciting me atm but conveniently, that's not the case when I'm studying."
12841,"Not at all, I‚Äôm fucking hyped bro. I can just wake up smoke some weed, play videogames, eat whatever, and relax. It‚Äôs gonna a nice few weeks"
12842,"I had a terrible, stress filled semester. Every day something was due. I think I may have ptsd, because I this gut in my stomach that I‚Äôm forgetting something. 

I will never again take four classes, three of which have lab sections."
12843,"I've left a note on the sink when some asshole kept coughing up mucus and leaving it in the sink. It would crust up and dry there and stay for 4 days until the bathroom was cleaned again. It was fucking disgusting. After the note it stopped happening. Maybe try that. Maybe try confrontation next time you hear someone buzzing their fucking hair on the floor. Someone's an entitled asshole bratty piece of shit and they need to know it.


Or contact an RA to have them deal with it"
12844,This. No clue why you haven't complained yet. They will bend over for you because those living conditions warrant a health and safety condemn notice. The last thing they want is to be shut down and forced to rent an entire hotel. Threaten to call the health dept.
12845,Is that vomit in the sink? ü§¢
12846,Is that vomit and hair??
12847,The 2 essential cake ingredients!
12848,What goes on in peoples mind when they do shit like that ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12849,"What school lets a bathroom get that dirty, that has to be against some type of rules. 

Bathrooms where I‚Äôve been are cleaned multiple times a day."
12850,College kids are fucking animals.
12851,Think urine?
12852,Oh Jesus why do I understand that
12853,"I know why!!! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It‚Äôs Sunday which means that they haven‚Äôt been clean since Friday morning and they won‚Äôt be clean until Monday morning. 

Source: I lived in the ghetto dorms for two years"
12854,Shit in the sink would definitely be worse than vomit imo
12855,"Fucking yell at whoever the hell did that. That‚Äôs fucked up. Confrontation isn‚Äôt fun, but holy fuck that‚Äôs bad and needs some kind of correction."
12856,"I‚Äôm an RA in a public university. I‚Äôd go to the RD, send an email about setting up a meeting about wing concerns. Their role within the hall is to make sure residents feel safe within the building. If the RD brushes off the event. I would for sure go to the central resident life staff. Again ask to setup a meeting with photos of the issue. In the odd cases both of these don‚Äôt do anything - Dean of Students office is another option. An an RA I would not let this happen. I have all men on my floor. I‚Äôd instantly have my RD issue a wing fine for the floor or wing that uses that bathroom. I‚Äôd also be knocking on every residents door about the situation. I myself don‚Äôt want to deal with that. I‚Äôve had people shit in the bathroom shower before. I‚Äôve gotten that fixed real quick with wing fines and talking to my residents face to face. Msg me if you need help! I am an RA so this is part of my job! :)"
12857,I think it might be feces ü§¢
12858,I love how this thread kept escalating into something worse lol
12859,College kids? You mean any public bathroom that is not well maintained
12860,If it makes you feel any better at my school the bathroom I use has piss jugs just thrown in there by students and cigaret buds everywhere
12861,"I zoomed in. It‚Äôs definitely vomit. You can see the chunks. 

I just assumed piss because being massively dehydrated post binger is peak college, whereas college vomits are normally mostly booze and thus not that color. 

And side note, yellow poop? If your poop looks like that you need a doctor yesterday"
12862,You go to school with the Trailer Park Boys?? Wtf
12863,Username checks out
12864,"Have your RA or RD deal with it, it is literally their jobs to do that."
12865,"This is kinda how my dorm is. They reiterated over and over that bathrooms are cleaned twice a day, but thats bull fuckin shit. Doesnt help that no one ever flushes"
12866,No just foreign exchange students from china. Those of us from the us hate where we live it constantly smells like cigarets and piss
12867,"I had a friend piss in a piss bottle in the car. Then I had another friend accidentally drink it. The friend who drank it spit the piss out all over my car. And then an hour later, the friend who pissed in the cup threw up in my car. 


I was so pissed."
12868,Idk vomit is definitely the worst thing it could be
12869,You should see the 40-60 something year old women and what they do to the bathrooms at work this college kid has to clean up.
12870,Yeah typically the landlord code. State law.
12871,"Oh damn, this is from my school!"
12872,If it bothers you that much switch. Randoms in suites aren't as bad as randoms in normal dorms.
12873,"""Interesting"" note, but in case it's relevant to anybody if you live in Ontario in an apartment or most other rented spaces, your landlord cannot evict or discontinue your lease because own a pet. They can choose not to rent to you in the first place, they can choose to not let you start a new lease (i.e. at a new location that they own), and they ***can*** evict you if your pet is causing damage to the unit or is affecting other tenants (e.g. barking at late hours), but otherwise you have the right to enjoyment of the space you are living in. 

What I'm saying is that if you're moving into a place with a ""no pets"" policy in Ontario then I'd use this information to your advantage by not disclosing that you have a pet until you move in.

**Note:** the above does not apply to dorms owned by a university or to condos; these operate under totally different rules."
12874,"I agree with the rationalizing part. It isn't morally correct, but these people sleep well at night thinking that they had no other choice..."
12875,"I've personally never seen it but I have heard enough stories to know that people, regardless of age, do abandon pets when they move.

I also once broke into a foreclosed house (with sheriff's permission, but I still had to break in) to rescue some abandoned pets...  I've seen it. It breaks my heart how awful people can be. 

THAT SAID, if you have a pet you can't take with you/take care of, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE find your local shelter and ask to put up an adoption listing there. These are living creatures who deserve better."
12876,"Don't get an animal in college, period.
You have enough workload in your life, you don't need the extra burden of caring for an animal.

Wait till you graduate, have a job, and get settled.  THEN evaluate your situation and determine whether you're ready to take on the responsibility.



hmm... same goes for having children, I suppose."
12877,">His chances of survival will be better on the street.""

Not in my town they mostly end up dying by coyote within a day on the streets. I also live in a college town."
12878,"I agree with this, mostly for dogs. Students are not capable of taking care of dogs.

Cats, however, can be fairly low maintenance if you stay on top of things, but they're also the more frequently abandoned, so..."
12879,"This is actually really cool because in the US they make use of pet rent policies as well as pet restriction policies. A complex I used to live in didn't allow ""aggressive breeds"", but literally every shelter in the area had either all aggressive breeds or dogs that were mixed with aggressive breeds and they wouldn't rent to me if I had one"
12880,I had to leave my Cats with my parents when i went to university. I could have taken Them with me But i Love them enough to know it was best for them to stay home
12881,"I‚Äôm at school and can‚Äôt have my dog with me. So she‚Äôs staying with my parents until I finish this year. She‚Äôs been with me through 4 moves. Hell, I even took her to Jasper for her 10th birthday. I have a fish in my dorm, and brought him him home for the Christmas break - my family bought him a Christmas present... If you can‚Äôt find a way to include them in your life, it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt want to."
12882,"The worst is the morons who adopt animals (usually dogs) with severe problems and then do absolutely nothing to help them. I had a cat in college, but she was a kitten with FeLV and would have been put down as a health hazard had I brought her to any shelter, even a no-kill. From the moment I took her in, she became my priority and responsibility, and I gave up a lot that would have made my life easier because I had her. But she was the best thing that ever happened to me, and I‚Äôm so grateful we found each other.

RIP Poppy. And as an aside, spay, neuter, vaccinate, and keep your pets indoors!"
12883,Better to not get the animal in the first place. You have to really think these things through as that's what's best for the animals.
12884,"I disagree with this statement. Of course you shouldn‚Äôt get an animal you can‚Äôt properly care for, that goes for anyone, not just college kids. But as a student with two happy, healthy cats, you absolutely can manage school, work, and pets as long as you know how to manage time/money responsibly."
12885,"like I said above-rescue groups as well as shelters. 2 rescue groups in my area are wonderful about working with people who for whatever reason, can't keep the pet, and do the leg work for the person to make sure if the pet is going to a renter, the landlord is fine with it, and the person actually wants and can take care of said pet."
12886,But you still can't go away for multiple days without arranging for someone to feed a cat and clean its litterbox.  Or when you go home for break... do you have a way to bring the cat with you?
12887,This is great info. Just to add a little more info pet deposits are illegal in Ontario as well. The only legal deposits are last months rent and a key deposit (which can only be enough to cover replacement keys and fobs). If you‚Äôre worried about disclosing that you have a pet you can pay the deposit and then when you move in let them know you just found out it‚Äôs illegal and would like it returned; if they refuse you can file at the ltb to get it back. Generally I don‚Äôt condone lying but given the current rental market in most cities this may be necessary. So essentially: you don‚Äôt need to get rid of a pet because you are moving.
12888,"I'm not saying animals are worth more or have have equal worth to humans, but at the end of the day, they are complex living creatures that feel pain, discomfort, and suffering.

Imposing suffering on another creature through your direct actions because you cannot be inconvenienced to move them to a safe location is about as objectively close to immorality as one can get. You are their legal guardian in many states as well, so philosophy aside, you may also be a criminal."
12889,"I noticed this too when I was living in a college town and lived in some apartments by the school. There were a ton of stray cats around the place. 

If you also get a pet, realize they may need extra care when they get older. When I first got my pets, I didn't think too hard about the future. Now that I'm going to school, one of my pets started getting really ill. He ended up having unstable blood sugar (insulinoma) and can have seizures. He has to take 3 medicines, twice a day and fed some extra protein with one of his meds. This is costing me UPWARD of $200 a month with the monthly vet visit. I was already financially struggling. All of that being said, if you make the choice to get the pet, you should take the commitment seriously. These animals depend on us and they don't deserve neglect/ abandonment due to our impulsive decisions. Since my little buddy got sick, it's been hard making sure I'm home in time to give him his meds and making any plans outside of going to college."
12890,"I got so upset one time seeing this dude bring his dog to a backyard concert then stand right next to the super loud speakers. Poor thing of course is just gonna stay there because it‚Äôs loyal and scared of the crowd, having the music Blare in its poor ears. Some people are inconsiderate shit heads"
12891,"Most people who have dogs or cats probably live off-campus. At my college, the only pets you could keep on campus were fish and turtles."
12892,"I don‚Äôt stay on campus at all, I don‚Äôt know of many colleges that have dorms that allow you to have pets other than fish (unless of course they‚Äôre service animals/emotional support animals.) But yes, I do have a car and should I decide to go visit my parents, their house is cat-friendly. Not that any of this matters, I already said anyone who isn‚Äôt capable of properly caring for a pet should not have a pet, but the blanket statement that no college kid should have a pet, period, is what I was disagreeing with."
12893,"Is this why many colleges I go to have ""campus cats?"" I just figured they wandered from the residential area."
12894,Sure you can. That's the magic of technology and automation!
12895,"It's literally the same as someone coming to your house, feeding them, and scooping the litterbox.

I wouldn't do it for months on end, but the cat will probably be fine for a couple days or maybe a week. Might be a good idea to stick a camera by the food/water bowl in case something does go wrong though."
12896,While I wouldn't say it's a horrible idea... It does seem like a good way to get an angry land lord.
12897,"This is why I get angry when I see students walking around with puppies. I question how much time these people actually spend with their dogs? 

I hate my neighbor because he has an emotional support dog, and the dog has separation anxiety. They leave it in cage and it will bark for the entire time that they're gone. It's frustrating because my complex doesn't allow pets. Other neighbors have left notes for this guy, but he just doesn't care."
12898,"We get it. You're a philosophy major and there's no moral truth in the universe.

People who abandon animals are jerks. It's simple. Students are in positions of privilege, so they have the means to pass it on to another owner, or they shouldn't be having an animal in the first place. It doesn't matter when or why you got them, you are taking on a moral and legal responsibility to take care of another creature.

If you can't handle that simple fact, maybe you need to readjust your moral compass. There's nothing more to discuss and I'm done discussing it."
12899,"On the last year of my sister‚Äôs Grad School, she got a German Shepard-Great Dane mix and had to move to an on-campus apartment that didn‚Äôt allow dogs, so I looked after her until she could get a new place"
12900,Very much agreed
12901,"I'm so glad you brought this up. It's so true. God, people disgust me. They're just babies :("
12902,"Live in a college town and can totally back this up. The cats thing is a 100% truth and if you go to the shelter like 3-4 months after the beginning of the semester you can find purebred dogs that were surrendered. It‚Äôs really sad. 

I can‚Äôt talk to much crap because I did get a dog when I was in college and when it got to be to much I did have let him go. Luckily I found someone who was much older and looking for a trained dog so I rehomed my dog with that person."
12903,"It‚Äôs been a good mix. A decent amount of them I have bought online, but Boise State, Stanford, Iowa State, Auburn, and Michigan State we‚Äôre all bought on campus. I‚Äôve had fourteen of them sent to me from the school as well when I have asked. I‚Äôm a social studies teacher and wear a different college shirt every Friday so colleges have been more apt to send me a shirt for the free advertising to my students."
12904,When I was touring college campus's I would go to their bookstore and buy a shirt from each college campus that I visited lol. I have like 5 in my wardrobe so far.
12905,Do you buy these or do you get them for free?
12906,Me too xD I felt like I HAD to buy something so I'd always buy t-shirts so I could wear them to sleep in or workout in. I  have 13 lol
12907,"Lmaoo I have a uci, usc, and ucla t shirt that I go to the gym with. I don‚Äôt go to either of those schools but I rotate what college shirts to wear. I‚Äôm sure the people at my gym are so confused about what school I go to LOL"
12908,You pay and bribe them to give it to you for free
12909,Your math perplexes me
12910,"I‚Äôve always enjoyed watching college sports and how each school has its own unique identity and culture about it. So I decided to collect the shirts and create connections with different people. I teach social studies as well, and it‚Äôs cool to introduce different schools to my students through the shirt that I wear that day."
12911,how do u get free shirts from colleges lol?
12912,Dm me your address and we will change that!
12913,"If you sleep around, you can usually get free Tshirts."
12914,I do not have Arkansas! They sent me pennant in the mail for my classroom but not a shirt.
12915,I dunno why this makes me so happy.
12916,I try to rotate through my shirts and wear them to the gym. I‚Äôve only had a couple people ask me about them.
12917,"a lot of universities give out hella free shirts at events n stuff

i got like 25+ of free shirts from my time at uni"
12918,Have anything from anyone in Arkansas? If not let me know!
12919,I do have a VT shirt! It was one of my first shirts I got.
12920,"Your reminder me of this guy üòÇ
https://youtu.be/mNki8vIBXpE"
12921,"It‚Äôs fun! I‚Äôve always enjoyed watching college sports and how each school has its own unique identity and culture about it. So I decided to collect the shirts and create connections with different people. I teach social studies as well, and it‚Äôs cool to introduce different schools to my students through the shirt that I wear that day."
12922,Virginia Tech?
12923,Purdue?
12924,Do you have a gamecocks shirt yet?
12925,Why?  Just why?
12926,"If I do send a message to a college, it is very personalized. I‚Äôm also 100 percent honest, that I‚Äôm a teacher that interacts with about 180 different students, and I wear a different college shirt every Friday. I also tag the college on social media when I wear the shirt in my classroom. I‚Äôm guessing the transparency is much more appreciated."
12927,Ah now I see it.
12928,Wholesome
12929,Let‚Äôs Go Hokies!
12930,As an Admission Officer.... I have answered hundreds of emails from students requesting free shirts.... come and visit... apply... make me think you are really coming... and I will get you a shirt.  Send an merge email indicating I am among 1000 emails you are sending... good luck.
12931,You should get a Southern Arkansas one. They are the only Muleriders lol
12932,I proudly have a Marshall shirt! Thank you though!
12933,What was the deal?
12934,"They are offering you 1:1 support to offer you additional guidance - take them up on it. Your school most likely has a writing or tutoring center. Visit it.  


This is a professor that actually cares and is giving you another opportunity. You will not come across them very often in college, so be thankful for the few ones who treat their students like actual people instead of roadblocks to their research time."
12935,"Depending on the size of the class, the Prof. needs to read a LOT of these. Stopping when a student has clearly missed the mark so completely is understandable.  


Furthermore, if the student couldn't be bothered to read and follow the instructions and/or the rubric, why is the Prof still required to spend the time reading their submission?"
12936,"Professors have many people in your class multiplied by many classes.  They aren't going to give you detailed feedback because they have learned that students just ignore it anyway.  They get a sense for how good your paper is after 3 pages.

1) Read your paper out loud to your self.  Does it flow and make sense? Does it sound like one person wrote it?

2) How much have you copied and pasted? 

3) Take your paper to your college's Writing Center.  Have them go over it with you in detail.  Edit your paper.

4) Resubmit it to your Professor.  If you still get an undesirable grade, go to your professor's office hours, and say ""I really want to understand what a good paper should look like. Can we go over this so I can learn?""  Then go over it, edit again, and say ""I know this doesn't count for credit, but could you look and see if this is closer to what you want?"""
12937,"I interpreted it as the prof saying that, while both they and op both have an obligation in the situation, the professor isn‚Äôt going to follow through with theirs (thoroughly reading the work and providing feedback) because they don‚Äôt believe that op held up his end of the deal (submitting work that fits within the prompt). Shit‚Äôs whack"
12938,"There have been papers I've had to peer review that have literally been so painful that I've stopped partway through. One time I decided to just Google some lines from it because none of it made sense, and found out it was plagiarized from a fan-fiction paper with some vague changes (names, setting). I almost went insane trying to take it seriously."
12939,"Still go see the professor, even if they're not helpful. By making the effort to get the 1:1 with them, it shows to him that you're making the effort. Then go get the actual help from the writing center."
12940,I am wondering the same thing
12941,"> Not telling me how to correct it. 

Your professor cannot inject ""knowing how to write"" into your head. They can only give you feedback; the process of learning from that feedback via hard work and practice is completely up to you."
12942,Don't mean to sound as condescending as the professor but rookie mistake
12943,"Well the other option was being given a bad grade, right? Sounds like a blessing to have a second chance."
12944,"The answer to #2 should be ""none"", by the way."
12945,"If you do not understand his corrections, then it is on you to ask for further clarification. That why you have 1:1 time. For more in-depth explanations."
12946,"If it looks like the paper is total trash, they prob just did a quick skim and realized it didn‚Äôt magically get any better"
12947,"There are times when you do stop reading after a while and just quickly skim the rest. Particularly if the problems are that apparent, show no signs of changing, and if it isn't for a grade. Carefully reading and commenting upon each sentence is a phenomenal waste of time both for the instructor and the student when the whole paper will have to be majorly revised anyways."
12948,"I hate to say it, but this thesis is overly generic and relies on very basic statements that I feel don‚Äôt demonstrate a strong understanding or offer a greater insight. I don‚Äôt know what the ‚ÄúBig 7‚Äù is, but I‚Äôm willing to bet that you left out a reference to that in the thesis? It needs to be more specific. 

The way it‚Äôs written is also just not fully at a college level. It‚Äôs a little casual (I would remove phrases like ‚Äúof course‚Äù). I would visit a writing center to see how to strengthen your diction and line of reasoning."
12949,"You‚Äôre not going to like to hear this, but the professor did exactly the right thing. You did not put enough effort into this essay. That was clear from your ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù errors. If you proofread carefully, you will have NO errors of that type. Not ‚Äújust a few.‚Äù  

Getting it ‚Äúpeer reviewed‚Äù sounds like you had a friend look at it. That‚Äôs not good enough (and not even good). YOU need to take responsibility for your own work, and you need to be the one to be SURE that when you turn in an essay, it‚Äôs actually on-topic, fits the assignment, and shows actual care and effort (it‚Äôs not enough that you think you worked hard on it. The essay itself has to really demonstrate the hard work by being polished and correct). 

This professor is actually treating you like an adult, by putting the responsibility where it belongs‚Äîon you. The professor isn‚Äôt responsible for proofreading and pointing out every error; it‚Äôs YOUR job to find and fix those BEFORE the professor even sees the paper. 

You say you worked hard. Now you know that you didn‚Äôt work hard enough, and you are being given the option to go back and do that. Work twice as hard this time, recalibrate your ideas of what ‚Äúworked hard‚Äù should really mean, and you will do much better. Your professor believes in you. Put on your big-person pants and do the work you know you can do. 

(PS‚Äîsorry about the prof not respecting your medical issues. That sucks and is probably the real root of your resentment of this prof. It‚Äôs terrible to struggle with cancer and school at the same time. You do deserve some respect and empathy around that, and I wish you all the best for your treatment and recovery)."
12950,"It was a final assignment for a college class on creative writing, and one girl submitted a Naruto Hinata (from the Naruto anime/manga) fanfiction. We had to write a whole page with feedback and suggestions relating to our textbook lessons and a TA would grade our feedback too. That was the only time in my academic career that I've ever snitched on someone. That paper was so painful to read."
12951,SHOW US THE ESSAY
12952,You wrote in second person?
12953,Even if there aren't a lot of errors many things are critical. Like if I read a paper that has second person and it's nonfiction there's very few circumstances where I take it seriously. Professor may be harsh with grading but they're generous in that they left their phone number and are allowing you to edit the assignment with help rather than just giving you a trash grade which they're allowed to do. I'd try to edit it and take it to the writing center where they can help you or if you edit it and it looks really good to you go to office hours and ask him exactly what he wants with the thesis. I've found that even with biased professors you can get away with a thesis they don't support if you write it the way they want you to
12954,"Missing missing information. 

And this is more critique than most profs bother to give IMO."
12955,"At minimum answering the question isn't enough. Plus this is a writing course, answering questions well is essentially the entire point of the class. You can't just plonk down a bare minimum response and then expect recognition. The professor may be being a little harsh but they're giving you a second chance and offering an opportunity to work with you. You gotta get over your pride and accept that you need to improve your work. 

Firstly, your ""big idea"": ""Diversity is good"". Forgive me for putting this bluntly, but no shit. You need to ask yourself ""So what?"". Statements like ""It is very beneficial in all areas of life"" are quite empty. You need to explain why this matters. 

Your thesis needs more nuance and more strength. ""Diversity is good"" just doesn't cut it. You need to offer an actual insight or engagement with material. Consider using a format like ""Although X, blah blah blah, this is why [blah blah blah]"". I would also recommend some better vocabulary, a thesis is an opportunity to drop in some bigger words.

Are there examples in history or business practices where diversity improved things? How and why? The professor said you don't need sources, but maybe that means you don't have to formally source something, you can just paraphrase a historical anecdote or something.

Thousands of people across the country will have a literal meltdown if you tell them ""diversity is good"". Why are they wrong? How can we change their minds? 

How has diversity changed in business or organizations recently? We still have a lot to go in terms of improving diversity, how should diversity continue to be implemented in institutions and businesses? 



Introduce a counterargument or misconception. The course is ""dedicated to demystifying notions of human diversity"". What were the misconceptions covered in class? Why are they popular misconceptions, and why should they be changed?  What should they be changed to? Seems like the class covers some basic psychology concepts, but I don't see any reference to that in the paragraph."
12956,Ill try. Like I said from past experiences he was not actually helpful with the one on one. He'll basically repeat his corrections then have me leave. Not telling me how to correct it. Then barely any credit is given. This isn't my first essay. The tutoring/writing center is where I will go. They will give actual help.
12957,"I mean I don‚Äôt need to read every sentence to get the weak points of an essay. They read most of it, so the rest wouldn‚Äôt negate the points they made. Teachers have to choose a few main points for feedback‚Äî they can‚Äôt list everything wrong or right with it. 


I get that you feel it‚Äôs not detailed feedback, but writing a detailed feedback would be a waste of time if you need to change ur topic anyway. Major issue if it doesn‚Äôt follow the prompt lol you should talk w your prof to run some ideas by them for your rewrite to make sure you are truly understanding the material."
12958,"The large, angry ""NO 2ND PERSON"" at the top really speaks to OP's abilities to write a college quality essay."
12959,"What I'm about to write is critical feedback so if you aren't interested/can't handle that right now (totally fine) iplease feel free to ignore:   


There is almost nothing substantive in the paragraph you wrote. Most of what you're writing are oversimplified platitudes that are unrelated to each other and don't really establish a meaningful point of view. The issue is that all of those things suggest that you haven't engaged critically with the content and that you've only engaged at the shallowest level.   


For example: ""Diversity is something that has helped evolve us as a society""   


Who is ""us""? In what ""society""? There are thousands of ways people organize themselves into social groups, and many of them are actually organized in such a way that isolates them from diversity. Why include something so vague as ""something"" in an opening statement? You could completely cut it out and just write, ""Diversity has helped society evolve"" and essentially be making the same argument (though the argument still needs work).   


And then: ""It is very beneficial in all areas of life.""  


That cannot possibly be the case. What are ""all areas of life""? How are you deciding what's a benefit or what's a detriment? Diversity, and hatred/fear thereof, has been the root cause of significant social issues that have resulted in hardship; are you going to later make the case that that is still a net benefit? Try to avoid broad, huge, sweeping generalizations like this.   


And: ""Of course, what people think of most is race, which is a big factor that is still an issue to this day.""  


""Of course"" implies that you're about to make a statement that is universally agreed upon. Is it? What does it mean that people ""think of race the most""? The most frequently? How do you know what people are thinking, at all? Race is a ""big factor"" in what? ""Still"" an issue from what arbitrary starting point? Is there reason to belief it wouldn't ""still"" be a ""big factor"" today? If it's obvious, why state it?   


The quality of your writing is mostly fine (though you seem confused about what constitutes first/second/third person perspective, but that might not be relevant if it wasn't established as an issue by the assignment in the first place). But it seems like the professors larger concern is that the content itself isn't demonstrating the desired level of critical engagement with the course content. Obviously I am making huge assumptions and can't really know precisely what your prof was thinking, but with my professor hat on, that is the feedback I'd offer."
12960,Not none because quotes (its is easier to make sure everything is correctly copied if you literally copy paste) but minimal even so
12961,"I‚Äôve been down this path before. Make sure that the first paragraph of the first page clearly responds to the prompt using the language of the prompt. That first paragraph should be three sentences long and formatted thusly: 1) Direct response to prompt, 2)justification for response, 3) introduction/listing of evidence (to be discussed at length in the body paragraphs). Also, write in the third person without referring to yourself. ‚ÄúI‚Äù is the difference between a formal and informal response."
12962,‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt my first essay‚Äù‚Ä¶well it seems like it when you didn‚Äôt even respond to the prompt
12963,I feel the same way sometimes. You gotta remember that you're doing this for yourself. I tried working this past semester with classes and it was doable but it sucked. I'd much rather have more study time and have actual free time. Do what makes you happy. Don't worry about what anyone thinks.
12964,This. Focus on your schooling and take advantage of not needing to work. Good luck to you!
12965,"I mean I could do the same but I still work. All the money I make I save. Once I graduate I‚Äôll have a shit ton of money I can spend in furniture for an apartment or save towards a down payment for a house. Take advantage of this opportunity, it‚Äôs worth it."
12966,"I would say it is completely fine if you don't need the money, go for an internship or some helpful working experience if you have the chance to not be behind the McDonald's desk because you really need the money."
12967,"You see, I agree with you to some extent. I personally work 20-25 hours a week in a job that I enjoy (low stress, often times can be doing homework/read). Do very well in school. My parents pay for school and all major expenses so 90% of my money is ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù. I save and invest a lot it. I feel proud I‚Äôm not using my parents $$$ for personal things like going out, travel, clothes and such. While some will graduate with debt, I‚Äôm hoping to graduate debt free and be able to buy an apartment or something once I graduate to have passive income. To each their own though I guess.

Edit: Another side note and I understand it‚Äôs a personal feeling, but I enjoy the grind/balance of work, school, working out, interning. Keeps me on my toes and teaches valuable lessons."
12968,"Eh, if you don‚Äôt have anything to worry about with future jobs then sure. However, when you graduate I guarantee it‚Äôs not gonna look good that you did absolutely nothing during breaks (winter and summer especially). At least try for summer internships or volunteer (depending on what you want to do after college), even if it‚Äôs not for money expand your resume. You can relax now but it‚Äôs just gonna make it harder for you to catch a break once you‚Äôve graduated and have to start paying expenses.

Personally I work while not at school, and It‚Äôs 12 hour shifts but it makes hella bank, I do that just so I can have my own money and not be 100% reliant on family."
12969,"I didn't get any financial aid since my family is solidly middle class, but since we live in the bay area they would never be able to afford sending any of us to college. There's 5 kids in my family so it would probably put them a million dollars in debt. So I work 2 part time jobs and am seeking a degree in computer engineering. It sucks but is definitely doable. Been working since my sophomore year of highschool in anticipation for this, but its nice to have the money. I'm pretty proud that I've been able to make it this far too."
12970,"This is how it's meant to be done. College should be a fulltime job. Make sure you are putting in your 8 hours, Monday to Friday."
12971,Fuck working. Take that privilege and use it. It‚Äôs nice to have an option.
12972,You‚Äôll be in a world of hurt if you graduate with little to no work experience. No employer wants to hire someone who hasn‚Äôt worked.
12973,They said they did work during breaks. And I assume at some point they will do internships too. They just weren‚Äôt sure if it was okay to not work during the school semester.
12974,Use the time you would have to be at a job productively and you aint no bitch.
12975,"I work full-time and do school full time and it's a monster so if you are capable of not working, do that and finish up school. Side note, you're not a bitch. I struggle with depression and I catch myself using the same kind of language and it's not great. I try to remember to not accept treating myself in ways I wouldn't accept others treating me. Love yourself, finish up school, and keep your chin up!"
12976,"It's good to get work experience during college, but if you don't have to work during the semester, DON'T. I say this as someone who went to three different colleges and has had to work 20+ hours a week minimum to cover what loans didn't. Lost my job in March but my husband is full time and we're not hurting to have me out of work.

This semester, I got six As and two Bs. Spring was the same, A/B average. Before I always had one C because at least one class would take the backseat and get bare minimum from me. I could never focus fully on school, but now I can! Don't work if you don't have to. Chill out and focus on your studies :)"
12977,"I agree, do not work just to work and by that I mean don't take a job at McD's or Walmart for the money/experience unless you HAVE to. As far as internships, apply for all of them and do as many as you can fit into your schedule. Be picky, and choose internships that will benefit you in your future career path."
12978,"I disagree. I think plenty of people do fine without minimum wage work experience, especially in a field like computer science or engineering where it's more meritocratic."
12979,"Same. Like I live at home, and have pretty good financial aid, but working just to have some extra cash I think is a good thing. Also trynna save up for a car"
12980,[deleted]
12981,I think that so heavily depends on what you‚Äôre studying. I‚Äôve had coding projects that I was told to expect to spend a minimum of 16 hours a week on in addition to the 18 other credits I was taking. I was definitely spending more than 8 hours a day on school work.
12982,Are you using any loans to pay for college? If so I‚Äôd say you should be working.
12983,"Hello! I work with a recruiting agency. Working while you‚Äôre in college, even just part time minimum wage jobs, really give you a boost once you graduate. Sometimes I see hundreds of applicants for entry level, straight out of college jobs. Someone who worked during college stands out over someone who didn‚Äôt by a lot. I‚Äôm not saying you absolutely have to work, but it really does give you an edge. It also means you have more ‚Äúreal life‚Äù work experience. I‚Äôve noticed that people who never worked as a teenager or in college are often in for an awakening once they graduate and get a job, simply because they‚Äôve never experienced it."
12984,When you say 8 hours does that include class time? If it does then it‚Äôs not unreasonable at all. If it doesn‚Äôt include class time then it seems a bit extra more like 6.5 hours outside class is more reasonable imo. Also out of curiosity about how many hours do you usually spend in a week. Like Ik that some weeks are better and worse but what‚Äôs the usual amount?
12985,Im proud of you also. Proud also of op for recognizing the position they're in. Proud of this thread. Proud im treating my staph infection. Not proud of anyone whose dad would beat them with a pair of jumper cables.
12986,[deleted]
12987,[deleted]
12988,What job is it? Just curious.
12989,"I meant that you should treat college as though it were a job and adhere to a regular schedule. If you make a study schedule and work 9am-5pm, Monday to Friday, that should provide the structure and necessary hours to be successful. 

If you actually want a detailed breakdown of credit hours to work, the ratio is usually 1 hour of class and 3 hours of study/homework for each credit hour enrolled.  Most students aren't able to devote this much time, however."
12990,I spend way over 40 hours a week with online learning. Close to 70.
12991,"? Why? If you are a full time student busting your ass with 16+ credits and extracurricular activities a lot of grad schools rather see that + only break work vs easy semester and a part time job (as according to my health professions advisor). Like I work in summer and winter, I only worked this past semester cause it was a paid TA position. Now I‚Äôm in research and an unpaid TA for another class, but technically that doesn‚Äôt qualify as work. 

It‚Äôs ok to not have a job during school if you are a busy full time student, as long as you are doing something extracurricular"

12994,My university made me pay 240 for virtual orientation üòí
12995,"fuck and I thought my $60 one was a lot, thats literal dog shit."
12996,"‚ÄúLadies if he‚Äôs:

- mysterious 
- vague
- got you and your girls trying to decode messages
- always keeping you guessing which way he‚Äôll go

That‚Äôs not your man. That‚Äôs your university‚Äôs Fall 2020 reopening plan‚Äù"
12997,"i'm in community college, no virtual orientation for me LOL"
12998,"Yeah. Not everyone who lives close enough to commute can actually commute. And my college is right outside a big city so someone who lives 30 miles away may still have a 1.5 hour drive. It‚Äôs bs. 

In addition, our website that we used to pick our housing is no longer showing anyone‚Äôs room selection so I‚Äôm nervous that they‚Äôre going to take away our rooms. I‚Äôm also in the process of getting a room accommodation for health issues and that‚Äôs been put on hold as well, it seems."
12999,What kind of school makes you pay for orientation!?
13000,That‚Äôs messed up that you‚Äôre forced to go if you live close enough. You should have the right not to go if you feel sick or want to stay safe.
13001,"As someone who works on a college campus, this is exactly why. They are being vague because they don‚Äôt know, and don‚Äôt want to commit to something, only to have thousands of upset students when that can‚Äôt happen. We‚Äôre starting to see second wave numbers and a lot of states have to regress in phases and shut down again. Who knows where things will stand in August or September?

Also, teacher and staff unions may have requirements for opening they won‚Äôt know until closer to the date. I know that‚Äôs impacted planning on our campus.

And finally, if your college has said they‚Äôre going to do a hybrid, that probably means they left it up to the instructors to decide so that they can be mindful of the various needs of their professors. Most faculty are probably high risk, and a lot of students are still scared to return to campuses. I know I will be teaching in person because I‚Äôm not high risk, but two of my co-workers are choosing to offer online only courses. My advice is don‚Äôt ‚Äúwonder what to do‚Äù, and go ahead register for courses, knowing things will probably be up in the air for the first semester as we see how this all progresses. Things are much more likely to be normal for second semesters or Winter quarters. If you can, I really ask you to not consider sitting the semester out, because many of our department budgets are entirely contingent upon the number of students we have coming back, and many staff members will be laid off if we don‚Äôt have enough students."
13002,CCs for the win lads.
13003,I am community college too and my virtual orientation was free and mandatory. I had to register by myself tho so check it out.
13004,"I go to a pretty large university and they are just making masks mandatory. All classes except one of mine are online. Interesting that I am going into my 3rd year and having most classes online but all introduction classes are in person (probably because they want to give somewhat of a ""college"" experience & don't want to lose that $$). Nevertheless, tuition and rent are still the same. Can't say I'm not a little salty.."
13005,Yes omg. The university announced that Fall is going to be hybrid but with the shit show that‚Äôs going on right now in the US I can‚Äôt imagine having in person classes and making thousands of students travel and super spreading the virus everywhere. I‚Äôm an international grad student from Canada and have been holding off on finding a place to live with all this uncertainty. I‚Äôm also supposed to TA a class that usually has labs and I have yet to receive some information about that and frankly not being too excited about teaching those in person.
13006,"My school‚Äôs was $150 but included an overnight stay, meals, and ‚Äúspecial‚Äù activities. However, this was pre-COVID. I believe they‚Äôre charging the same $150 for a virtual orientation that is essentially just a few hours of videos and Zoom Q&As with advisors."
13007,"Then why don't they just say ""we're sorry, but we need more time to decide both for safety and financial reasons. We don't have any information for you right now."""
13008,There‚Äôs a pandemic lol
13009,"my school has been pretty transparent thus far, but precise details about what classes are going to look like this fall aren't going to be announced until next month - which is fair, because i think the last freshman orientation is during the first week of july and i imagine they're waiting to see how many students they have enrolled in different classes before making decisions on what classes will be in-person and what classes will be hybrid. i wouldn't be surprised if that's why schools are waiting to announce more plans. that, and cases are spiking in several states... i'm not sure how that'll affect university reopening plans yet."
13010,"> Part of me thinks that they‚Äôre going to wait until most of tuition and housing are paid and then say it‚Äôs predominantly online

I've got a professor I've taken 5 or 6 classes under swear that that's 100% the plan. She swears that the general consensus among all the professors she knows at the major state uni she teaches at is that as soon as the deadline passes for tuition refunds, that they're all rapidly switching to online-only."
13011,[deleted]
13012,"My opinion: if it is so uncertain, they should just take the safe route and do all online."
13013,"This is TOO REAL.  Man or university, either way I get screwed by someone."
13014,"My school is being similarly frustrating. If enough students voluntarily back out of housing (which gets them their $200 prepayment back) then it won't be an issue, but otherwise I'm within commuting distance and will probably not get housing. I can't drive (+ live in the countryside so no public transport) and two of my family members are high risk, so going to and from campus to home is really reckless."
13015,"Damn, that would be a major dick move IMO. I understand why the schools would do that, but it's not fair to the students and their families to not be able to make an informed decision."
13016,But money. It‚Äôs all they care about...
13017,"In theory I find out before I have to pick classes (mid-July). So, that's nice, but still is frustrating as I just feel like I'm sitting around waiting for that decision.

I'm an Art major, and an incoming transfer (so only really have upper division left), so am super ???? about the situation. Would be nice to save money on housing and not move/possibly commute twice a week (it's a ways, but like....can manage for twice a week), just the unknowns of Spring following it make that iffy. I just want to know, but very much feels like they also don't know."

13019,I'm pretty happy my school decided on fully online months ago.

13025,"There's a LOT of sugar coating going on in the comments.

""*My best friends cousins friend made it through with five kids, you'll do fine!""*

*""It'll be tough but lots of people do it at my school and get great grades!""*

Here's some facts. You're [65% more likely](https://powertodecide.org/sites/default/files/resources/primary-download/briefly-unplanned-pregnancy-college.pdf) to drop out of college after an unplanned pregnancy. [Over 1/3rd](https://powertodecide.org/sites/default/files/resources/primary-download/briefly-unplanned-pregnancy-college.pdf) of Female dropouts were due to a pregnancy at one school.

Even worse, that study was done from community college students -- who usually aren't on a pre-med track taking a full course load and having to prepare for the MCAT.

It will be insanely difficult, and that's being nice about it. Too many people in this thread are acting like it's just a speed bump -- this isn't a speed bump, it's a mount everest."
13026,If your family is going to be supportive in raising the child you can absolutely do this.  Especially if grandma is willing to be basically a stay at home grandma for you.
13027,Having a child is like having a full time job. Your child will be your responsibility til the very end and how you help your child grow now will affect how the kid is in the next years. Make sure you and your boyfriend is ready. Good luck.
13028,"Having a kid won‚Äôt directly impact your chances of getting into med school. You‚Äôre not even obligated to tell the school you have a kid. 

Indirectly, though, having a kid in college is kind of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it (obviously) makes things more difficult because you have to balance schoolwork with raising a child. On the other hand, though, every college-mom I‚Äôve met graduated with a really good GPA because they essentially have a living, breathing reminder of why they need to succeed in school.

Best of luck with everything."
13029,[deleted]
13030,You don‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre being realistic about this honestly. It sounds like you‚Äôre not accepting you‚Äôre going to have some extremely tough years ahead of you and med school is almost definitely  not going to pan out. I hope you have a backup plan for you and your child‚Äôs sake.
13031,"have you considered adoption? i was adopted and i got to say it‚Äôs worked out pretty well for me. definitely better than having a parent who would not be able to take care of me. obviously the situation varies from person to person but it could be something worth looking in to. just keep in mind that if that is the course you take, have no expectations of seeing that child again. if at any point in their life they‚Äôre interested in seeing you, they will come to you (that is if you even want to see them again)

13033,"I have 4 children, one only being 4.5 months old and I'm in school. 

But labor, delivery, a newborn,  AND school? 
This is going to be very difficult for you. And I don't say that to discourage you. 

They tell you over and over and over how tired you'll be with a new baby. And you know what? It was worse with my first than I thought possible. And she was an ""easy "" baby.

That level of sleep exhaustion blindsided me entirely. 

If I were in your shoes, I would be *very* worried about trying to keep up on school, a baby, myself, and everything else in life. It is absolutely exhausting.

Any amount of having a schedule will go clear out the window into another country. You won't be able to sit down and say ""i have X amount of time to do X for school."" Because there's a good chance your baby won't sleep well,  will poop everywhere for the third time in 45 minutes, or just straight up cry for 2.5 hours for seemingly no reason. Possibly every night for 6 weeks or more. 

Please think this through. I know you're pro-life. I was too. But if it's best for *you* in *this* situation, give yourself some grace. Can you financially care properly for a baby? Provide formula  you choose not to breastfeed? Buy diaper, wipes, clothes, bottles, crib, car seat, stroller? If not, if you aren't 100% ready, is that fair to the *baby's life*? Life is more than being alive. 

You do what you need to. But you need to look at this from all angles. It is a lot. A lot a lot."
13034,"They can't hold the baby against you for med school, but... I will say that you are going to have a really difficult time with med school and rotations and the like if you have a newborn. Somebody else is basically going to have to raise the baby during that time. Being a doctor is very much a profession where it assumes that you have a stay-at-home partner to take care of everything domestic. (Source: one of my best friends is a pediatric oncologist.) 

This doesn't make it totally impossible, but a baby is a huge time-suck... and so is med school."
13035,"These comments are kind of insane. There's way too much sugar coating going on here. College, especially college with the intention of going on to med school, is not the time to be having an unplanned baby. Med school requires a shitton of devotion. Tons of time. Do you have a job? Does your boyfriend have a job? If yes to one or both of those, does at least one of you have a decently paid job or are you both working low-paying jobs? No shame in working such jobs while you're young, but exactly how much are you about to depend on your families? Having your family help you out is one thing, but expecting family to be the main financial providers and caretakers of your child while you get to spend all your time in school and residency for the next 15 years just isn't right. Note: if one of you has a wealthy family then I would say it's acceptable for them to be the main financial provider.

From the brief details you've given, it is clear you are an intelligent and hardworking young woman with an inclination toward responsibility. That is great and you've got a lot of potential in your life. But that awesome, accomplished life you're on track for isn't guaranteed. Someone's in this thread talking about motivated mothers doing well in college. Yeah, 99% of those women became mothers first, THEN went back to college. They made plans and set off on a certain path. Having an unexpected baby isn't the same, it's like walking down a chosen path and having a sudden landslide divert you. Yeah, maybe you'll climb that landslide and continue on that same path, but maybe you'll end up on a different path, or you'll end up lost in the woods, or you'll be crushed by the landslide and lose everything. You're young with a lot of life ahead of you and you're about to sacrifice much of it for a baby, when you're too young to be a fully fledged adult yourself."
13036,">They had services like babysitting when you have class etc. for cheaper

One thing a lot of people don't understand is how hard it is to get childcare, *especially* ones on universities campuses. There's often a waitlist of *years*, as in, if you sign up when you first fall pregnant, there won't be a spot open for your kid until they're 2 years old. What are you going to do in those 2 years? Other daycare facilities also have waitlists, and you don't skip the queue. Private babysitters are expensive and the cheap ones may actually kill your child. 

No matter how hard a young parent-to-be works, or how diligently they organise things, there may be absolutely no choice but to drop out in order to care for them. Especially when they're still babies, kids need constant supervision and attention. You can't just bring them with you and still do your own thing."
13037,"Internships, jobs, etc. cannot LEGALLY say that if you have a child you will be rejected over someone who does not. However, what makes you think that companies don‚Äôt perform actions like that on the daily? It‚Äôs almost impossible to prove that X person was rejected from a position simply due being pregnant."
13038,"Those are some scary statistics, damn."

13040,"I don't want to upset you but having this baby and then raising it is going to put you at a significant disadvantage. Not because med schools will just favor someone without kids, but because those without kids are going to have had much more time to study and prepare for medical school. You're looking at having to keep up really good grades in your classes, volunteer work, internships, even research projects, studying for the MCAT, etc. People without kids sometimes barely make it because it really is that draining. Then comes medical school, then residency, and so on. There is a reason so many people wait to have children until they're out of the woods.

This is also just an extraordinarily heavy decision. The baby will definitely put your studies at risk, there are statistics to back this up, and they will change everything about you, your life, your boyfriend's life, forever. You're preparing for 24/7 care, prioritizing this human life you've created, trying to give them the best life while also trying to create one for yourself, paying the expenses for their needs and for medical school, and you can't go back from that. Nothing will ever be the same for you and your school life is going to get much harder. 

I am not saying that this is impossible but you really may not be able to have it all at the same time. And if you try, it will be one of the most intense challenges of your life and you're going to be putting yourself through unimaginable stress for years, and you have to consider how that will be for not just you, but also for your baby, because they will absolutely feel affected by your experience as they grow up. There is just no way around it, it will be really hard. Mentally, emotionally, physically, financially...This is nothing like high school. Believe me.  It's worse.

I cannot tell you what to do but I think it would be wise to consider adoption, or to seriously evaluate what the next 10+ years are going to look like with a baby in the picture. I wish you all of the best, I really do."
13041,"My girlfriend delivered our son at the end of my sophomore year. I am now a Junior and I‚Äôm working my ass off to make it all work. Some advice: 

- Make as much $ as you can now before your baby is here. 
- Consider transferring to a school closer to home to get as much support as you can. Leaving the baby with the grandparents > paying for daycare. 
- Do as much research about financial aid as you can and talk to somebody in your schools office. Seriously, my tuition is soooooo much cheaper and I have access to a lot of scholarships now that I have a dependent 

You can do this. I was scared as hell every single day until my baby was born but it does get easier and you will get so great at time management. I‚Äôm not going to lie it is extremely hard but if the father and your parents can help out it will be doable. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions or want someone to talk to."
13042,My friend wants to go to med school to become a doctor but is so terrified of becoming father and having to drop out. I told him its doable and he wouldn't be the one nursing the baby lol.
13043,"That's not a totally unreasonable worry, being a med student involves four years of heavy work without a paycheck. Can't imagine it'd be easy to have a child in that situation, because it'd basically be on the mother to both raise the kid and win the bread."
13044,"You do not have to keep the child if you don't want to. Please don't do that. It doesn't matter how your family feels, it's your body, your life, your expenses. Take care of yourself. It isn't morally wrong to have an abortion. Shit happens. I read somewhere... I don't have a lot of time right now but there's a statistic of women who have abortions and it's like 95%+ are very relieved and content with their decision after a few months and that number jumps to something like 99.5% after 5 years. Do what's best for you, you may have regrets now, but you won't in the future. Unless you can truly care for this child, don't bring it in. I'm sorry if I sound rude or mean, I just know how damaging to both you and the child to bring it into this world unprepared, or just because your family instilled toxic thoughts in your head throughout your life. Best of luck."
13045,"I‚Äôm afraid that in the times we live in nowadays it is not that easy. A company can easily search your social media (if you have any) and since most people post about their pregnancy on there the company will sooner or later find out. It costs tens of thousands to simply hire someone, so a company will pull out all the stops to make sure they find the best fit. Sadly, that will sometimes include rejecting candidates using protected classes (such as race, gender, religion, etc.). If a company sees that you posted on FaceBook saying you‚Äôre one month pregnant, what reason do they have to hire you, train you, and the work, if you‚Äôre just going to take maturity leave in less than a year? Don‚Äôt get me wrong. This is wrong on all accounts. I am merely stating that while illegal, it does happen and is almost impossible to prove"
13046,">OP has said she is not comfortable with an abortion. And it‚Äôs not your place to say whether she can handle school and a child at the same time.

I know I read that. But I was sharing my opinion. If she doesn't want to, then power to her. Its her choice.

I was just sharing my thought on the matter"
13047,One of the most stressful things I ever went through as a parent was arranging childcare. Just something to think about
13048,[deleted]
13049,"OP can do an open adoption and still have a relationship with the child, but would have to pick out an adoptive mother that is open to and ok with that."
13050,[deleted]
13051,"One thing to add to this: talk now with your boyfriend about how you will care for the kid if you break up. Too many stable marriages go downhill and either end up fighting over custody, child support etc. or staying together for the kid in a miserable home, and unfortunately as a college couple your odds are probably worse. So while I hope the relationship lasts, there's a whole lot riding on both of your abilities to be mature and and care for a kid together even if you don't want to spend your lives together"
13052,He may also grow up into the next Hitler. What a dumbass comment.
13053,Fuck I'm post college and still waiting for my stimulus check. Like the whole response has been a giant headache.
13054,"How do they consider how much you‚Äôll get? Because I was unemployed and I got $500. Now I make $180 a week only, should I apply for anything? Because I need the money, really."
13055,"*checks number of students,*
*its higher than 10k*
‚ÄúWell fuck you then.‚Äù

Edit: Clemson did it the right way

1k to those on pell grants
1k to those whose parents aren‚Äôt ‚Äúexpected‚Äù to contribute much (it‚Äôs an income deal)
500 to those who take any kind of student aid
0 to everybody else

And you don‚Äôt have to apply it‚Äôs automatic"
13056,"I only got $400 from my school. 

There‚Äôs a list online that shows how much money each college got and the allocated amount per student. What I found interesting was that private colleges, especially for-profit ones, tended to receive significantly more per student. The system is corrupt."
13057,If this is true this would be awesome I'll have enough money to pay rent for the school. thank you
13058,If you graduated last year youre likely fucked. Just like me.
13059,"Our school put out an application for this stimulus money and paid out many students who applied early very, modestly, to say the least."
13060,"You can claim it as a credit on the 2020 taxes so....you'll get it just not right away. 

Now I'm just hoping that they decided to do another 3 checks because I will gladly enjoy that tax return."
13061,contact your financial aid department. they should lead you to an online application or something similar
13062,"Well I mean if a school costs $3500 a semester and a private one costs $30,000 I would assume there would be more given to their students no?"
13063,">A lot of universities were still waiting for guidance from the feds at that point.

Yep-- my school disbursed $2M to students in May, and my kid (who is at another school) got her check the first week of June. Lots of money went out the door since April.

The challenge with advice is that every school is handling it differently.  Some sent money to all students, basically just dividing their federal stimulus equally among the student body. Others have required students to submit receipts for specific expenses. Still others are  treating it like financial aid, distributing larger amounts to students with low EFCs from FAFSA and nothing to those from wealthy families.

You'll have to check with your own school directly to find out how to request your ""share"" of any aid their received."
13064,link?
13065,Nope I go to a private one and they said the max they were giving out was 500
13066,"It took me a while to apply for it and surprisingly got the full amount ($2000). With how late I applied, I didn't expect much."
13067,"Tf? so many people are at the 30000 university with LOANS. they need that money as well, not everyone who goes to a higher tuition school is richer. This is blatantly flawed logic"
13068,"> I'd just like to know where the rest of the money is going.

The CARES Act specifically required 50% of the funds go directly to students as cash payments. The other half can be used for anything else, more or less, that's a COVID expense. $1M is nothing on a university budget...1-2% for a small college, far less for a large one. My school was down about $4M in revenue from room & board refunds for spring, so the half of the CARES money we got to keep likely went to offset those losses no matter how it was listed on the books."
13069,"My school paid it out automatically. I got 354ish I think. It was an odd number. But we didn't have to apply, they just sent out emails saying it was coming to eligible students. Then they told us that the government was being unclear with the eligibility. But they still sent it out very quickly."
13070,You really think college students would pass up on free money if they were aware if it?
13071,I go to a California State school and think. i received like $365 but it depended on how much I actually needed. I wasn‚Äôt living on campus but at home. You could apply and reason why you need more yet it said if you were denied you wouldn‚Äôt get the original amount you were owed. So I wasn‚Äôt willing to gamble that. Don‚Äôt know the legality of that
13072,"Look on the school's website. They are required to post online within 30 days of receiving the funds how much they got, how many students qualify,  how many have received it and their policy on who got what."
13073,I applied and got flat out rejected so screw Purdue for that one
13074,"I disagree. I think all students incur additional expenses due to COVID, which is what the stipend was meant for. It‚Äôs silly to appropriate that money for other need-based aid. It should only be based on needs due to COVID, not needs that are typically accounted for in student aid.

Should be distributed evenly IMO, or use a system that only takes into account COVID expenses."
13075,"Why do you think people are attending the $3500 university vs the $30,000? Probably because they could not afford the $30k university and could benefit greatly from the aid. If you can afford a $30k university you shouldn‚Äôt be crying over a couple hundred dollars. I don‚Äôt think your aid should be based on your tuition costs. 

Note: I don‚Äôt mean to generalize or assume since scholarships could have made an expensive university‚Äôs tuition feasible."
13076,My university sent out an email they got 2.1M from the feds and cut checks for students with just over 1M of it (I got a check for 1k). The other 1M who knows because they didn't and won't say where it went or is going. Not that I'm not grateful for the 1k I'd just like to know where the rest of the money is going.
13077,">Hey, sorry to bother you but where did you apply and is their a deadline? 

All decisions and disbursements are handled by the schools directly, so you'll have to apply through your own school. The deadlines for many passed weeks ago, but some likely still have money as they are moving more slowly. Call your financial aid office for info."
13078,"I was fortunate that my school handled most of it for us. They applied for the grant and dispersed it without any input on my end beyond the regular financial aide stuff I did every semester.

The way they set it up for us was like $35/credit hour, or something like that."
13079,"i think i got like $500-600, i don‚Äôt remember exactly. more would definitely help, especially considering that i‚Äôm essentially furloughed from my on-campus job and my paid summer internship was canceled... i‚Äôm lucky that i was recently able to get a lab job, because i don‚Äôt think my normal on-campus job will be available to me in the fall either but i still have to pay for food and rent.

i‚Äôve had a huge loss of income (at least $6000-7000 total) and, like most of us, am ineligible to receive unemployment or stimulus. and even with this new job i‚Äôm barely gonna swing living paycheck to paycheck..."
13080,"They moved our BIO classes(not meant for online) online last minute with incompetent teachers so most of us dropped and now we aren't eligible bc we aren't ""enrolled""."
13081,"Hey, sorry to bother you but where did you apply and is their a deadline? Thanks!!"
13082,"Going to an expensive, small, mid-low ranked private school generally is a bad idea anyways. It‚Äôs a hallmark of immense privilege, so it makes sense people at those schools would be getting less. Besides that, if you made the choice to go to that school I don‚Äôt think you should be getting more because of it."
13083,Lorrddd I just know I'm gonna be crying in the shower for the first few months. I'm gonna miss my momma
13084,I wish making friends was as easy as it sounds. I'm about to be a senior and I could never seem to get anyone at my university to give half a shit about me.
13085,"Thank you for saying this, I‚Äôm going into my senior year, and I‚Äôve learned doing what YOU want, NOT your parents, and most certainly NOT people on the internet. Keep in mind that whatever you‚Äôre studying you will use at work for at least fourty years, so it‚Äôs important to have some interest in the subject you‚Äôre studying and the research you do. 

Also if you‚Äôre lucky, you will at some point realize grades aren‚Äôt everything. It‚Äôs hard to believe this, especially if you‚Äôre coming to college straight from high school! You‚Äôre life has been about school since age 5. Try and meet some friends who only know you outside of class, that ways there‚Äôs no competition over school things and the atmosphere with them is more relaxed. 

Try to branch out and try some new activities, and see who you are as a person without being around your family all the time. I‚Äôm going to be 22 later this year and I‚Äôm still learning a lot about myself, it‚Äôs okay to like things that you knew nothing about on the first day of college, it‚Äôs okay to have beliefs that differ from your family and your hometown. 

The only person who has to live with you for the rest of your life is you, pleasing someone shouldn‚Äôt be high on your priority list!"
13086,You can always call her! When at school I‚Äôm four hours away from my mom and it‚Äôs hard to see her all the time. I sometimes go 4 or 5 months without seeing her and it‚Äôs hard. Try to think less about how long you don‚Äôt see and how great it‚Äôs going to be when you finally do.
13087,"And if you need to hang around the bar crowd, learn how to pregame! It is 5 times cheaper than bar hopping"
13088,"Text. Text. Text. And email. 

Stay in touch often via text. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never guess what...‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow do you....‚Äù and ‚ÄúTell me about...‚Äù will keep you in touch. 

And from time to time, email her with long narratives about your activities, thoughts, and feelings."
13089,"I am moving to a college from Norway, packing everything I have in a suitcase. The only thing I feel is excitement."
13090,Mood
13091,"also try to make friends. I focused really hard on school work my freshman year and ended up feeling really, really lonely. Your grades matter, but make sure to get out and have fun sometimes. My freshman year was a dark time for me and a diagnosis of depression followed it."
13092,"My only real piece of advice is to GET OUT AND DO THINGS. Leave your comfort zone at home and do shit that scares you. You have the opporunity to be whoever and whatever you want. Don't pass on something because ""oh that doesn't sound like me."" Just try it anyway, you might be surprised. Be like Nike and Just. Do. It."
13093,"College is nothing like high school. Whereas when you entered high school it was sort of similar to middle/elementary school, college is completely different. College is a lot less structured and gives you more flexibility, but that is because they assume that by now you are a sort of functioning human being. If you come in with a mentality expecting a structured guide you by hand environment, you will be very frustrated very fast. Also if you abuse that flexibility due to too much lazyness and procrastination it probably won't end happy either. 


As for socializing, again, you are not in high school, don't act like a stereotypical high school jock to people. Don't bring high school drama to college. Instead, be chill. Alnost everyone likes chill people in college. If there are people who are acting bad to you in college, avoid and/or ignore them. Unless you went to a really small college program, college usually has larger classrooms with more people in classes so it is much easier to avoid people than in high school."
13094,"I think it depends on the school too. I went to uni out of high school and didn't make many friends, and the friends I did make had lots of drama. Dropped out and came back to the local community college and now everyone is my friend! So much more laid back here"
13095,Love everything about this!!
13096,"Lol sounds like ""do all the drugs"" talk to me"
13097,Not even close to Colorado. Campbell University in NC.
13098,I appreciate this. very much
13099,"I am struggling with the idea of leaving home, but this post made me feel a little bit better. Thank you for being encouraging, I appreciate it."
13100,Thank you very much for this. I move in Saturday and I‚Äôm TERRIFIED
13101,"Schedule a regular call or FaceTime with her. Figure out a time that you both can keep and focus on each other, rather than randomly calling at bad times when one of you is distracted with something else, and put it in your calendar. I know that sounds weird and formal, but when you're busy, you need to protect time for your family and relationships because no one else will."
13102,"Don't be afraid to say ""yes"".  Everyone always talks about saying no to too much partying, etc.  The flip side to that is saying ""yes"" sometimes.  If you are an introvert like me, it would be easy to sit in your room and play video games and study.  Especially in the beginning of freshman year, people in the dorms will come by and randomly say ""want to go grab some food?"" or ""want to walk over to wherever?""  Say yes.  Even if you aren't particularly hungry.  Even if you didn't really feel like walking to wherever.  You never know when you will connect with someone and make a life-long friend.  And if not, no harm done.  Those little invites will turn into ""we're doing whatever this weekend, want to go?"".   
 And, if you keep saying no to those little invites early on, sooner or later, the invites will stop coming."
13103,Thank you son much! I will keep these in mind
13104,"I also can't stress enough, it's okay to feel isolated and alone. It's not the best feeling in the world, but so many students, including myself, struggle with this. Don't trust what I see on social media, not everyone is as happy as they make it seem. If you catch yourself being jealous, I would recommend just taking a few days off social media. I took 2 months because seeing other people hang out with their friends and go to parties genuinely made me feel bad about myself. I realized the feeling was stupid because I got upset over some meaningless pictures. If you ever feel this way, seek help. Possibly talk to a close friend or go see a therapist. After 2 years of struggling, I'm so excited to be coming back next week to see a therapist for the first time. Also, try to not go into college with a relationship unless you feel happy that you've done what you wanted or ""explored"" or maybe don't want to explore. I know many students who were sophomores or juniors when they got engaged to their high school sweethearts. One of my cousins met someone in high school and they dated for 8 years. They broke it off for a little while just to see what else is out there and now they're back together and happily married. But I would still personally recommend not coming in with an SO. For me, this ruined my chances of forming close friendships with other freshmen I met. I was so focused on maintaining my long distance relationship, that it ruined me completely. But if you know they're your person, then do what makes you happy. Also, college IS NOT high school. If you're hanging out with a group and you see them doing something you're uncomfortable, or hear them say something rude or negative, you don't have to stay with them. You don't want toxic people around you. College is not meant to be dramatic or full of social groups. It's really where people come together to talk about what they love doing and share it with those they care about. If you don't like the behavior of a person or group, then leave. Also, as OP said, DON'T pile yourself more work from joining a lot of organizations. For something like Dance Marathon or Relay for Life, those are some of the largest organizations on campus and they require A LOT of effort like fundraising and advertising. If you're not into that sort of thing, then I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are willing to put effort in and want to meet a lot of people, those are great places to go. Join organizations that interest you, many times you aren't even able to be a part of too many because of conflicting schedules and all of that. So choose what you like most, maybe something you were similarly involved in, in high school. Anyway, do your best, college is expensive so put in your best effort. You want a career in the future, be ahead of the game and find out requirements beforehand, chances are most people don't even know them or pay attention until they need too. Come to your advising meetings prepared with classes you want to enroll in and any questions you may have."
13105,"Good luck! Enjoy the adventure! It won‚Äôt go exactly as you expect, so be patient with yourself and others."
13106,"To add:
1) Brew your own coffee
2) Take lots of pictures
3) Find your classes before the first day
4) Can't stress the printer stuff enough lol
5) Listen to your body"
13107,"I had the exact same experience, plus my university was slowly crumbling to the ground from the politics and drama. I didn't expect to enjoy attending the local community college so much, and never even imagined how easy it is to make friends here. It helps that I know some people from high school, too. I'm finishing up one last semester here before transferring to a different university closer to home."
13108,Enjoy your time!! Don‚Äôt rush things and do what you love with the people you care about!! I‚Äôm a senior now and I feel like I just moved in as a freshman the other day!! Time really flies in college!!
13109,"I'm just starting out as a TA, but my friends who currently do have repeatedly said that undergrads don't stop by for tutoring. Please come in for office hours, even if you're only sorta sure about the material. You pay us with your tuition and we're here to make sure that you pass and do well. Plus it's way more fun and interesting to tutor than it is to sit and do nothing during assigned office hours."
13110,"Ugh I needed this. It's been a really hard week. I leave in six days and everything just feels wrong right now. I feel like I'm leaving my family in the debris of a disaster that I created by choosing an out of state school, and I feel so guilty. I know there's nothing I can do to fix everything right now, but I'm definitely going to need all these tips to stay focused and cope with the family problems once I get there. Thank you to all the upperclassmen who have been offering advice!"
13111,"my freshman year ended in may actually! I have been doing much better since then, I transferred colleges and started this past summer quarter. I have since put effort into living a balanced life. I still need to work on things but I'm doing ok now."
13112,"Thank you so much for this. I move in tomorrow and am having a ton of anxiety about the whole thing right now, even though my school is literally 15 minutes away from my house. This post made me feel a lot better."
13113,"Yeah. I just wish he was more open about his pancreatic cancer, which I listed. But it‚Äôs not like that would help. I‚Äôm shocked he‚Äôs been fighting silently for so long."
13114,i mean at the end of the day he‚Äôs your teacher and not your friend so i wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be dumping his baggage on you especially something as big as pancreatic cancer which unfortunately is quite deadly
13115,"I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this, that must have been quite a shock to you and your classmates. It‚Äôs okay to be shaken by this!"
13116,Yeah. He just wants to be strong for us. I had him for a couple semesters and he was my advisor so I kinda got attached. He helped get me signed up for the right courses so I can excel in what I want to do (forensics)
13117,I ran off to the library after I was told he has it. So I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since Friday. Tomorrow should be interesting. His older coworkers have his back I‚Äôm sure
13118,"Teaching is like a drug for people who like it. I've gone into the classroom starving, reeeallly needing to pee, or in immense pain from recent surgery, and it all melts away. There's nothing like the flow that comes from a good time with your students. It's been the only thing, actually, that's gotten me through times of depression and suicidal ideation.

I've struggled with disclosing tough things to my students. On the one hand, I want to be honest with them and model what it is to be human. On the other hand, I don't want to burden them with worry, nor do I want to break the illusion of that drug-feeling. I can leave whatever is bothering me outside the classroom and be someone else in it--someone knowledgeable, patient, and fun, someone who wears cool outfits, someone selfless who my students might even look up to. Someone healthy. The best version of myself. 

I can't imagine what it's like having cancer, but I can imagine your professor wouldn't want you to worry too much. Of course, it's good to worry about people we like, and to take time to sit with your feelings. You might thing about what, if anything, would make you feel good to do.

Maybe writing your teacher a card, like others have suggested?"
13119,"At this point just wish him the best! After you‚Äôre done with the course, a nice card thanking him would be fine."

13121,"I had a math professor perfectly fine one day,  but the next day we walked into the lecture hall, the department head was there explaining he passed last night and we have a sub and basically good luck. Messed up my entire semester"
13122,"> The fact they tried to keep going...I am amazed and thinks that‚Äôs quite admirable of him. Writing him a letter thanking him for his hard work would be nice. He must care a lot about teaching if he went through this.

More likely that he's not tenured and can't afford to take time off, and not working would leave him without healthcare to afford the cancer treatments. Woo America."
13123,He sent us all an email about his whole situation. He was just scared to ask fir help and didn‚Äôt come clean about the cancer
13124,I‚Äôm gonna have a friend of mine who‚Äôs also in that class make him a card. She‚Äôs an art major. I have no artistic ability. We‚Äôre gonna have the rest of the class sign it too
13125,When we got there = when I finally got security to the classroom.
13126,"Kinda unrelated, but one of my professors I was close to (I actually dog sat his dogs) died from Covid complications last fall. This fall, we will be back to class in person. It hit me today as I was walking around campus that the last time I was there, he was still alive and I could visit him. The history department will feel a bit more hollow when I return."
13127,you sound like an awesome prof. wish everyone had this much passion
13128,"Me too! I'm actually leaving teaching due to burnout.

It's been the best journey and heartbreaking to leave, but sometimes loving what you do means it's easier to get taken advantage of."
13129,Thank you for the update. I completely understand his reasoning and I wish him and you nothing but the best!
13130,"I've been in school awhile and definitely had professors either get pretty sick that they need a substitute or actually die. I had a realization probably around my sophmore/junior year and thought about how students we get sick pretty often in a semester things happen. And had a realization professors aren't any different. They're still human like us and get sick, but I noticed most don't take off at all during the semester or much at all. Considering how most professors are treated it's a poor system that doesn't promote healthy lives similar to students. Hopefully your professor can rest possibly retire with the time he has left."
13131,So much this. It's hard teaching because a lot of students aren't engaged. Knowing you're making a difference means the world.
13132,He said he‚Äôll probably tell us more tomorrow as well
13133,It‚Äôs not unrelated at all. I have no idea how long my professor has left. I think he‚Äôll be telling us in the morning. I just can‚Äôt imagine the school without him.
13134,"Is it bad I want to hug him? But I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll collapse into his arms and just sob. The man has impacted my life so much. Academically, and I guess you can say impacted me outside of school. I feel like if he only impacted me academically I wouldn‚Äôt care as much. But since I give a shit about him outside of school, this is personal."
13135,Yikes.
13136,Woah
13137,"I 100% agree, especially with your first paragraph. I love love love my students and just being a teacher so much, I feel so lucky that I finally got into my passion. Some never do. Of course I complain but that‚Äôs heavily on like the 2-3 students that f it up but that‚Äôs like any job."
13138,I‚Äôll hug him after class today. The guy needs it
13139,Pancreatic cancer sucks‚Ä¶ took my grandfather before I was even born. Hope everything turns out okay.
13140,"My engineering circuits professor used to have episodes where he would collapse during lecture or even just stop lectures early cause he was too weak. He ended up passing away 2 years later but I am not sure what the cause was. He was one of my favorite teachers, I wish I was able to tell him that before he passed. May he RIP"
13141,"I, just‚Ä¶..wow. I‚Äôm so sorry for him. The odds on pancreatic cancer are‚Ä¶.not great. I hope he‚Äôs getting the best possible care. Hugs for him and for all of his students too!

If he doesn‚Äôt end up teaching next semester, do try to keep in touch with him! It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything big - just a hi email every now and then is huge when you‚Äôre Dealing With Stuff. If he doesn‚Äôt respond, or not right away, keep doing it anyway (it‚Äôs appreciated!); sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know what to say for the receiver too, and sometimes answering notes would just take more energy than he might have. 

Unfortunately this kind of thing happens the other way around, too - I had a student who I saw on a Friday and then she was just *gone.* Accident over Memorial Day weekend, never saw her again. There have also been a couple of more minor collapsed-in-class incidents, too: twice now I think I‚Äôve had kids just pass out (and admittedly I was that kid once when I was an undergrad), somebody else had a seizure, handful of people with panic attacks, etc. Now that I‚Äôm tallying it up it‚Äôs actually been quite a few, geez. 

I got lucky with my own profs, I guess? My primary music faculty were three for three on Dumb Dude Accidents (slipped on ice and dislocated a shoulder, did something suspiciously vague and screwed up a knee, stepped off the podium wrong and ended up with a cane for a couple weeks), but fortunately never any sort of long-term or potentially deadly illness."
13142,this happened to my sister. one day she got an email saying her teacher died in a car accident the night before so class was cancelled for a week. it messed everyone up bc he was in his late 50s too. for the rest of the year the class learned nothing but it was still very dark.
13143,"I was a C+ average student for my first year of college, and an A or A- average my last three years. Here is what I did:

* Looked for classes that fit with how I learn
   * Classes with lots of videos or other guides I can reference
   * Classes with accessible professors who were happy to answer questions and explain things I was struggling with
   * Hybrid classes - I get bored when there is too much in-person class time.
* Took a few years off and waited until I felt clear about what I wanted out of my education (not clear about ""what I wanted to be"", but clear about skills and experiences I wanted).
* Worked very, very hard to reframe ""failure"" to be an opportunity to learn instead of a reflection of who I am or what I am capable of. Not knowing something isn't a moral failure, it just means you don't know it yet. No need to big deal it.
* This is art-specific, but getting criticism and feedback can be very, very hard with art (and any other area where there is not a clear right or wrong answer). However, I built relationships with peers and faculty that I trusted, and I told them explicitly that constructive criticism would help me improve. When it was coming from someone who I knew was invested in my success, the criticism never stung."
13144,"I still have a long way to go, but here are a few things I did that I found really helped.

* Do a little work every day even if you don't feel like it, even if it's just reading a little bit of your textbooks.

* skim lecture notes/textbooks before class to familiarize yourself with the material

* Don't procrastinate. 

I'm really bad at this, but life becomes so much easier if you at least start assignments when they're assigned instead of waiting until the last minute. One thing I did was write down the assignment dates 1-2 days before they were actually due in an attempt to trick myself into turning my homework in early."
13145,"Are we the same person?!? I got a 1.5 last semester with only one B an F and 3 Cs and now I‚Äôm looking at 4 B‚Äôs and a C. 

Proud of you OP"
13146,"Way to go!! I look at thousands and thousands of transcripts every day and whenever I see someone had a rough quarter, or a rough few quarters, and then rebounded, I feel very proud of them, even if its not a student I know. It's so hard to depersonalize yourself from ""failure"" and keep on track, but when you do it, it shows how committed you are. Great job!!"
13147,congrats!!!
13148,"oops, I just realized I wrote it's a small jump. I meant NOT a small jump. now I feel like a dickhead"
13149,That is honestly a feat and I‚Äôm super proud of you! We are not our mental illnesses! You got this!
13150,"Congrats to you too! 2.0 to 2.47 is a small jump. I hope your future semesters go well!

edit: NOT*** a small jump"
13151,"I‚Äôm so proud of you!!! I‚Äôm in a similar situation, horrible GPA under 2.0 bc of depression and other issues. This summer and fall semester I‚Äôm trying to pass all the classes I failed or withdrew from. I graduated high school in 2020 and I haven‚Äôt had a single good semester since then and I‚Äôm very behind on getting my degree. I‚Äôm really hoping to turn things around soon."
13152,[deleted]
13153,dude thats awesome congrats!! i raised mine from a 2.00 to a 2.47 (would‚Äôve been higher but i failed a class rip.) this gives me more motivation for next semester
13154,"I brought my overall from 1.6 sophomore year to 3.0 senior + got into a competitive grad school and job! The point isn‚Äôt just to succeed, but also to grow. Failing teaches you beautiful things! Congratulations!!! ü•≥"
13155,"That is incredibly impressive! Even if you only had the 1.75, the fact the you are pursuing a higher education is impressive, especially in todays world and economy üëµüèª LMAO no but in all seriousness please don‚Äôt ever undercut your achievements! You should absolutely be proud of yourself, congratulations on your success :)"
13156,"Thank you
They sound like very good tips. Will try my best to follow ‚ù§Ô∏è"
13157,3.0 is a very good GPA that you should be proud of. I knew a guy who had all his professors remove him from their classes the last week of his fall freshman semester because he was failing all of them terribly cuz he didn‚Äôt care and was more interested in sports and partying.
13158,That‚Äôs amazing congratulations! Your hard work has paid off and never forget that
13159,can I pm you? I‚Äôm in almost the exact situation (academic warning)
13160,Ive only read the title so far but GOOD FOR YOU!!! You earned that and u *should* be proud of yourself! Hell im proud of you tooüòÖ
13161,You be proud  of  doing that. That's not easy. Hold your head high.
13162,It's actually a 3.4 semester because one of my classes was a 1 credit hour lab and another was a 2 credit hour lab. It's a 3.0 cumulative at this university :)
13163,"thanks, best of luck to you also!"
13164,"LOL you‚Äôre good don‚Äôt worry! misspellings aside it‚Äôs really not the biggest jump, but i got my first college A so i‚Äôm super happy"
13165,üëç ‚Äúshoulder tap‚Äù
13166,Proud of you!!! Good job
13167,"Im so proud of youuuu, u inspired me üòä"
13168,"Unless my math is wrong, that‚Äôs a 3.5 this semester! Whoa, what a stellar rebound!"
13169,Progress is progress. You worked hard and made it.
13170,Congrats!
13171,That‚Äôs so amazing!! Super happy for you!!
13172,That‚Äôs awesome!!! Congrats!! Your hard work paid off!
13173,"Long done with college but one thing that I regretted bringing was an iron. You're never going to iron anything. And if you do need to iron something there's bound to be somebody else who has an iron.

Also not that needs to be said, but I guess it does, never try to iron your clothes while you're wearing them."
13174,If you use command strips for your tapestry it stays up pretty well.
13175,"For decor in bringing a pride flag, fake leaves, string lights, and led strips. I have maybe 2 classes irl and yeah, my dining hall is to go. I am staying in my dorm most of the time, even on weekends, and I'd be so unhappy without any decoration."
13176,"I'll toss in my thoughts, so here are a couple things for guys and gals to keep in mind. Especially if you have a room mate this year. 

* take two laundry bags, one for clothes you have worn in public, the other for clothes you have only worn around your room mate. This way you can keep things separated and you know which clothes need to get sanitized should someone contract covid. 
* to minimize research time in the library (this is for my fellow humanities majors who are doing research) geta scribd subscription and use it when you can. 
* If you normally take a gaming system and TV and you live near campus I would suggest leaving it at home until things smooth out (should be by labor day, I hope). 
* If you don't have one get a gym bag so you can keep workout stuff isolated from the rest of your room (keep all gym only items in it and wash it when you wash your public clothes or as needed) 
* if you aren't taking a daily multi-vitamin, this would be a good semester to do so (every little bit you help your body matters in case you contract it)
* Explicitly for the people with roommates, this is not the semester to bring your hookup/ S.O. to the dorm.
* keep one pair of shoes explicitly for the gym if financially possible (which means it stays in the gym bag except for washing day)
* to my fellow dudes, please for the love of God, REMEMBER TO KEEP THE DEODORANT STOCKED! I know it shouldn't need to be said but after two years of college I am absolutely disgusted with my own sex sometimes. please please remember deodorant."
13177,"On the computer front I wouldn't bring a full size tower. This goes with the limited deskspace. Unless you are a huge gamer a small portable labtop/tablet will help make classroom-> study convenient due to having notes always with you. That doesn't matter much if you are a paper person. I was a paper person as well and one of those folding binders with different tabs helped so much for handouts. 

Also for gamers discipline is a must. I watched friends fail out of semesters due to having full access to their console or gaming rig 24/7. Its not saying you can't find the balance, but if you have little control keep that in mind.

Edit>> spelling"
13178,An iron is a HUGE waste of money as far as living in a dorm goes. But one of those small 15 dollar steamers are pretty great! I use mine all the time.
13179,"Bring something to entertain yourself that you can do in your room this semester, whether that be books, movies, or video games. A lot colleges are likely gonna have campus officers/public safety enforcing social distancing this semester, so they will probably be minimal socializing if any."
13180,"I‚Äôm minimalist by normal people standards, but not minimalist by minimalist standards. Most of the people who subscribe to minimalist communities are probably doing these things already."
13181,I would post this onto r/minimalism too
13182,"I disagree about only bringing one going-out outfit. Of course this semester in particular no one should be going out. But in general, you're going to be going out a lot more than once in a blue moon and you're not gonna want to be wearing the same exact outfit each time."
13183,i stick clothespins up with command strips and then clip the tapestry up with them. much easier in my opinion just dont get the cheap plastic ones that arent strong or it might slip down (also depends on the weight of the tapestry!)
13184,"I hadn‚Äôt even thought of this since I‚Äôm not a gamer myself, but you bring up some really great points! Being mindful of the space and time occupied by your hobbies is super important, especially when the hobby is something that can be addictive, like video games."
13185,My school has a fancy steamer in the career center and they will steam anything you need them too for free
13186,"I think we‚Äôre all concerned about classes moving straight to online. I‚Äôm living at home, but I want to add in a few tips that might help. This semester, it might be useful to keep things in boxes/crates/bags to make packing up quickly easier. Also, DONT bring winter clothing right away. Wait until it gets cold and then switch it out when visiting home or through the mail. I honestly don‚Äôt think most schools will last long enough to start getting cold, but if it does, be prepared to swap out clothing and watch the weather. The one thing I‚Äôd stock up on is foods you can eat if you‚Äôre too nervous to go to the dining hall. Ramen noodles are your best friend. Keep a bunch of that, any other foods you want, and a stock of drinks with you.

If at all possible, use either a kindle or an app to get textbooks on. This will mean less stuff to carry around and you also get to skip the hassle of returning textbooks from home. 

Make sure to bring something along that you can kill time in your dorm with. Parties and outings will be out of the picture for a while. Since you‚Äôll have plenty of free time, pick an activity that‚Äôs easy to keep in your room. If that‚Äôs playing an instrument, drawing, reading, or anything else simple like that, you‚Äôre set. Make sure to take care of yourself and have things to pass the time."
13187,"Yeah, I usually have two outfits for this as well as some casual pieces that can be modified for going out. But this semester, one will certainly suffice."
13188,"To add on to this: for first year comp sci students this also applies to you. I know a lot of cs kids end up thinking that they're going to need their big pc for whatever reason (usually think they'll want the power for school work), and that's not accurate. For your first year, you will be fine with a normal laptop. 

That being said, and keep in mind you may need to transport it home sooner rather than later, I'd bring it if you're on the fence. This semester specifically. In person socializing may be minimal, and you may end up spending a lot of time in your dorm on your computer. 

For anyone used to using a tower at home, and is leaving it at home, I recommend getting an external hard drive and putting copies of any files you think you may want on there.  Any music, photos, movies, old school files -- anything you might have on your tower that you think you may be taking for granted. 

On the note of laptops: I honestly recommend seeing if you can buy a second charger for your laptop. Leave one in your dorm at all times, even when you go home for a reading week etc. I'll be honest and say that this could be a waste for most people, but if you forget a charger at home or lose or break one, its lifesaving. If you don't have a macbook, it can sometimes be difficult to find the proper charger last minute, too -- rushing out to best buy or walmart might not save you if you've lost or broken your only charger."
13189,Ahaha same. I still haven‚Äôt got an iron yet üòÖ I just ended up using my hair straightener to flatten out any visible bumps or creases
13190,"I used command strips. I could see two reasons why they kept falling down:

1. Before applying, your roommate might've not wiped the wall with rubbing alcohol.

2. Her tapestry was heavy. Command strips and hooks are only supposed to hold to a certain weight, so adding one or two more could've done the trick.

I'm surprised you got wall damage from command hooks and strips! I had so many in my dorm and none of them damaged the walls."
13191,"I‚Äôm not sure how your roommate hung her tapestry, but I found a way to keep mine up. I put up four command hooks, then hung binder clips over each one and clipped them to the tapestry. Worked like a charm and never had issues with my stuff falling down. Might be helpful for someone!"
13192,I‚Äôm gonna be a senior but I think this is important to matter what. The only thing I brought with me freshman year in terms of entertainment was my laptop and I was so bored(because let‚Äôs be honest sometimes you just need that alone time in your room) I wound up buying my own PS4 on Black Friday.
13193,"Definitely agree on the whole minimalist approach.

I brought **way** too much stuff with me. My college has its students switch dorms each year, so it was a total nightmare when moving out. Only bring things you really need."
13194,"I‚Äôm not saying they shouldn‚Äôt go to parties because they‚Äôre freshmen, I‚Äôm saying they shouldn‚Äôt go to parties because there‚Äôs a pandemic going on. Sorry, I thought people would pick up on that."
13195,"It depends on who you are with the iron- I personally use mine all the time, but I also wear ironed button-up shirts every day. But if you're only dressing up once a month or less, you can probably make do without."
13196,I got musician friends too that didn't think space through either. Imagine then trying to get their full sized keyboard in their dorm room the first week xD. It makes her happy though even if she has 2 feet between her bed and it. Hobbies are important just require some planning :3
13197,"I agree with everything but honestly I think being wall decor and decorations are completely fine even during this time I had to pack within a whole day when I was kicked from my apartment and I had wall decor and decorations and packed them really quickly, it wasn‚Äôt that much of a hassle"
13198,"As someone who just moved into a shared dorm, I agree with it being better to under pack than overpack. Unless it‚Äôs necessary items, you can always go out and pick up new items like decorations after you move in. 
Oh, also don‚Äôt forget a towel or bedsheets if they don‚Äôt come with your room - happened to me and my roommates the first night!"
13199,"Incoming freshman here. If me not going to parties saves a few lives, I'm not going to parties. We are going straight home if there's going to be covid outbreaks because students can't handle themselves. This is coming from the person who loves parties, and goes out to any social event I can get my hands on."
13200,"I‚Äôm 90% sure she was using command strips. Tapestry fell down like 3 times a week. I suppose command *hooks* might work, but those can cause wall damage (I found that out the hard way!)"
13201,"Really?? It‚Äôs not about parties and the ‚Äúcollege experience.‚Äù It‚Äôs about making sure no one dies. 

Yes going to parties is an important part of college but it‚Äôs not worth it during this time."
13202,"this is such good advice, thank you!! also i hate blowdrying my hair too lmao"
13203,"In this scenario, the first person I contacted was the dean, who advised me to contact  the course's professor."
13204,"probably have to do this after the holiday‚Äôs, is it possible to sue them if nothing good comes out of it? or maybe contact someone who‚Äôs even above dean?"
13205,"this isn't really the professors call. you should be talking with your Dean of Students (or equivalent office on your campus). They are the ones that handle medical absences, death in the family, etc....all those sorts of things that require notes ... that doesn't go through each individual professor, it's all handled by 1 office, who will then contact all your professors and let them know if your absence is excused, which means they have to accomodate you."
13206,"It‚Äôs probably not possible to sue, but feel free to go as far up the chain of command as you can."
13207,"Try to start now. Professors (at least at my college) can issue an ""incomplete"", basically you finished the course except for one assignment. Then you have 2 semesters to make up that assignment. See if this is an option at your school, and ask for it asap. If the professors don't listen, go to the dean. If the dean doesn't listen, go to the student advocate / ombudsman."
13208,"yes, i did that, and i was told to contact the individual professor‚Äôs for the rescheduling of the tests. I think only solution here is probably approaching the deanery again or taking the help of Student‚Äôs association."
13209,"Misread that, sorry.

Write up this issue in an explanation to the chair.  If the chair ignores it, take it to the dean of students.  If it is still ignored, take it to the provost office.

If the provost ignores it, find another college because this one doesn‚Äôt actually give a shit about students."
13210,"Professors shouldnt be like this.. Since you asked why, some have been lied to so often by students that they tend to assume every student is lying to them‚Ä¶sort of a default reaction to things like this.  To be clear, that is not a good way to be, but it may explain why"
13211,Talk to the department chair. The dean won't have time for stuff like this if you haven't gone through everyone below them first.
13212,"Bruh this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the two test types. Neither rapid nor PCR have any significant amount of false positives. The reason PCR is the gold standard is that it has a lot fewer false NEGATIVES than rapid tests do. After a positive rapid test, a PCR test is a waste of time and money."
13213,"Unfortunately some professors are irrational, narcissistic, megalomaniacs. One of my friends was recently hit by a car and got a concussion. Her professor refused to give her an extension on an assignment, and refused to shift the weight to the exam. She got the dean involved, who forced the prof to give her an extension."
13214,"Save all emails, informations dates, - have a diary of the happenings in the order that it happen! - maybe it's not gonna be easy to fight it through, but IT IS NEEDED. If we don't act these terrible people keeping making the world a worse place..."
13215,"Take the university to small claims court.

They'll settle it right quick."
13216,"but i have sent every professor of mine a note from the Doctor, so i don‚Äôt know why would they think I‚Äôm lying"
13217,"doing that would probably mean sabotaging my entire stay in the university, don‚Äôt you think ?"
13218,"What the fuck?  That is just bizarre, I cannot imagine. Lord help me, I hope my students do not describe me this way. I guess there are those professors that aren‚Äôt at Uni to teach, they feel it‚Äôs below them. I am sorry your friend had to fight for something she should have had easily."
13219,"I seriously hope to God it doesn‚Äôt come to this‚Ä¶ somebody‚Ä¶ anybody up the chain of command should have the sensibility to know what your prof did was wrong. But again, as a prof who really can‚Äôt stand it when a student threatens to go above me if they don‚Äôt get what they want (I‚Äôm not talking reasonable stuff here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking about stuff like turning in a homework assignment three weeks past the late deadline), by all means take this to the top of you need to!"
13220,"Have you checked your student handbook for the Uni‚Äôs absence policy? We are required to accept a doctor‚Äôs excuse and schedule make up work/exams. We are allowed to validate, as in call your doctor and confirm the excuse was written and when. Yes, students have changed dates on excuses as well as just creating fake medical excuses. If it is legitimate, our university policy kicks in, no matter what an individual professor has implemented we have to allow make up work.  

If you provided a proper medical excuse, I am surprised a professor can deny you and get away with that. We certainly could not.  

Don‚Äôt let this go, do the steps and push to get the grades you are eligible to earn.  I cannot imagine denying any student with a valid medical excuse."
13221,"Possibly.

But frankly this sounds like an ADA issue. I'm just not clear on how that pans out at the college level with professors and students.

I do know that my school, if you test positive you're supposed to inform campus health and they're supposed to notify the professor. And there's an expectation of reasonable accommodation (but again, not sure how ADA plays out here).

But how this is going with you is just weird. The idea that the professor is demanding a specific test, and then he's refusing accommodations despite confirmation, is just... well weird. I don't know where you're going but I'm wondering if you're in a Red state and the school isn't all that great at handling this stuff.

This professor literally put you and others at risk demanding you take this test, and it's irresponsible on his part. If it was me, I'd file a complaint, and look into an ADA complaint as well. You may want to consult a lawyer about this.

edit; okay, i see you haven't gone back to the dean and all that, do that first. It'll probably be pretty easy to rectify without going all nuclear like I'm talking about."
13222,"I don't exactly know what to do here, but I would definitely want to do something about it if I were in your situation. You can't help that you didn't know a week in advance. I definitely don't agree with the one professor forcing you to take more tests. This is an all around frustrating situation. I hope that it can be resolved because this is not you just laying out and playing hooky. This is something that we literally shut the country down for...  I hope someone here can point you in the right direction. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself in this situation, just as always make sure that you go about it in a respectful way."
13223,"Exactly this and what the poster above said; at our school they set up something called CARES and if you even so much as report a possible exposure they MAKE YOU quarantine for 14 days, even with a negative test, and then THEY notify all professors. I‚Äôm just thorough so after contacting them when I got sick I also emailed all my professors explaining the situation along with my doctor‚Äôs note when I got it. This is asinine and I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you, OP."
13224,"Thanks, it's good to hear a professor agree that this is absurd. I have a lot of experience with bad professors, both first and second hand. I'm not sure if the problem is with my school, stem, engineering, my city, my province, my country, or just university in general. I can only speak from my experiences, so I don't know what it's like for others. That being said, here are some notable examples from my school:

\- The aforementioned car crash issue.

\- A professor told the class to commit suicide if they fail the final. This is after 4+ (I don't remember exactly) students killed themselves that year. The prof was joking, but it's still highly inappropriate. He was also notorious for berating students.

\- When COVID hit and schools went online, one of my professors decided to stop teaching. There were no live or recorded lectures, we just had to read his slides. To make matters worse, his slides had very little information, there were designed with the professor explaining in mind, so I had to teach myself almost entirely using online resources, using his slides just so I would know what to study. I'm pretty sure there was no emergency or anything for the prof, he just made the decision to not teach. He would also berate students for answering his questions incorrectly before covid.

\- One professor received a negative review on rate my professor. In response, during a lecture he went on a 10+ minute tirade complaining about it, and threatening to sue the student who wrote it for defamation. The review, while a little snarky, just said the professor wasn't good at explaining things and takes a really long time to respond to emails. He then started making sudden changes to the syllabus. I believe there was also an issue where in the new syllabus, the assignments + test did not add up to 100 percent (there was like 5 percent of the class grade missing from the syllabus). I think he also made an assignment due earlier than it was before.

These are all the major stories that I recall in my time at University (Just finished my first semester of third year). There were a few more, but I either barely remember them or they were too minor to mention. Most of my professors have been fine, and I've even had some great ones, but for one reason or another there have been quite a few professors that have been extremely rude or inconsiderate for some reason."
13225,"Hello, Thank you so much for replying. 
I think the professor probably thought i made a fake report to get away with the test, I‚Äôll probably email him to check it with the doctor and also try contacting the deanery once again."
13226,Talk to your Dean. The doctor‚Äôs note was sufficient.
13227,"Prof here,

Normally, I try to at least explain a prof‚Äôs rationale or why they do things that irk some students (usually there‚Äôs a method to the madness)‚Ä¶

Not in this case‚Ä¶ fuck that prof! That‚Äôs completely sadistic and asinine. I‚Äôm still operating fully online (I have a strong feeling it might stay that way with Omicron now), but if I was in person, and a student said they had COVID, other than requesting they follow the self-reporting procedure outlined by the college, I‚Äôd wish them well, tell them to focus on their health, and once they‚Äôve recovered (not just a negative test, but a full recovery‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt going to do their best trying to work through residual symptoms), we‚Äôll get them caught up. I think any professor who doesn‚Äôt respond in a similar manner is soulless and deserves to only be allowed to teach anti-maskers/vaxers. 

Seriously‚Ä¶ fuck that prof!

I‚Äôm so sorry that‚Äôs happened to you."
13228,"Your school likely has a COVID policy.

Look at that policy. It will also likely have the contact info of whom you should contact in cases like this.

If you don‚Äôt .


Email the chair of the dept.  Explain this, more briefly and with dates, including that you contacted the professor.  Also contact your treating physiscian for a note that includes dates and when you were required to quarantine from and to.

If that doesn‚Äôt help, there is a Dean of Student services.

I hope you feel better."
13229,"This is the correct answer - talk to the dean again. I'm a professor and we've been seeing this a lot (not what your professors did but health absences).

The likely outcomes either are an incomplete or a health withdrawal from the class. Neither looks bad on a transcript at all, and it's going to come down to how much you missed. If it's an incomplete you will have some time (this depends on your school's policies,, so ignore what everyone else has said here) to finish the assignments. You're probably on the borderline between the two. They will take your preference into account, but there's a lot more variables that go into it so be prepared not to get what you want.

The dean wanted you to talk to your professors because they wanted to see if you could work things out beforehand. You could not, so talk to them again and they'll give you more advice. Make sure to tell them what your professors said. Not your summary, not how you felt, but what they actually said.

Don't take this to court. That's a terrible idea and will not get you what you want.

I'm really sorry this is happening to you. It isn't fair. Best of luck!"
13230,"As soon as he asked for the RT-PCR test you should have went higher up. You brought a Dr. Note and that‚Äôs all there is to it, there is no need for you to go out your way to do ANOTHER TEST when the Dr.Note is sufficient."
13231,"This was my first year teaching. I had a student have a mental breakdown over Zoom because I was their only instructor willing to work with them and make accommodations. 


They had open heart surgery TWICE during the semester.

 I've never been more appalled at university staff."
13232,"What does the professor list in their syllabus regarding Covid-19 protocol? I'd be shocked if your school did not require professors to list their policy in handling these issues.

However, to your advantage, if the professor did not list anything in the syllabus regarding the procedures in Covid-19 absences, you could make a valid case the professor did not offer any clear instructions on how to navigate Covid-19 related absences."
13233,"She somehow passed Spanish year one lmao.

But honestly, I bet this isn't the first time the Professor has heard this."
13234,"Yep, I know, the class knows, the teacher knows. That‚Äôs why it was so weird."
13235,Agreed
13236,"The n word literally comes from Portuguese, which is the same/similar to Spanish.

13238,"Reminds me of high school French class...a student walked in late and the teacher said (and pardon any errors here it's been a while since I took French) ""vous etes en retard"" and the girl lost her shit bc she thought the teacher was calling her the R-word."

13240,"It reminds me of the Chinese Harvard professor who was talking on his phone and then got raked over coals for saying nege (one of the most common words in the language) by a student.

13241,"Because it‚Äôs such a ridiculous story that OP has to share it with someone. OP is right, that girl is acting ridiculous."
13242,"I hate to say ""woke"" but it's insulting how some people will try to ""correct"" a foreign nation's language because it means something offensive in their own language. 

It's basically having nothing to complain about and trying to find something to be angry at. There's also a joke about how this a return to some abstract form of imperialism somewhere in this situation.

I lose a little bit of my soul when someone says ""Filipinx"" to me. Like ???"

13256,You pronounce egg like aygg?
13257,Yea but if it‚Äôs for the sake of learning Spanish and it‚Äôs for a college class people should be mature enough not to think of it that way. College students are adults and shouldn‚Äôt act like babies

13262,So if you were describing a black car you wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable saying caro negro?
13263,"Oh, the rest of us profs are way ahead of this guy. Just make all students turn in Word documents online. Open document, ctrl-all, select 12 point. 3 seconds and you're busted.

Though honestly, I don't even do that. As long as you're within the ballpark on page length and the content is good, who cares about a few lines in one direction or another. It kind of cracks me up that students waste their time with all this. Just do the frikkin assignment!"
13264,How much is it to insure an assignment?  I swear college is getting more expensive every day.
13265,"You shouldn't be. See /u/jreed11's comment in this thread. Additionally, length doesn't really make a paper that's short on account of being under-developed look that much better for any semi-critical/objective reader."
13266,"Yeah, they seem to forget that their professors were once students too, some only ~10 years ago. I was an undergraduate student only 2 years ago. We know the tricks. "

13270,"Don't do this.  It's not as discreet as you think, and any professor worth his salt will be able to see that.  And if you're doing digital submissions like many universities are nowadays, good luck.  Most of my professors require submissions as .docx files now."
13271,"Nope. You can have a Masters, or even just a Bachelors. Most will have their PhD, some will be working towards their PhD.

13273,It‚Äôs a joke meaning that when you get caught don‚Äôt say ‚Äúit was my computer not me‚Äù
13274,"Agreed...

That's why every assignment I set has a word count requirement, not a page count requirement. It's virtually impossible to cheat on a word count requirement.

Source: I lecture at an Australian university."
13275,"kind of him to put that, most teacher would just wright you up for academic dishonesty "
13276,"I disagree.

There *is* an element of dishonesty inherent to the action.  It's one thing to simply ignore an assignment's rubric.  Maybe you're burnt out so you hand in nine pages for a 10-page assignment.  No biggie.  You'll take the 5% cut and still have enough left over to squeeze out a B or B+ -- maybe even an A- if you're real good (or lucky).  It's another entirely to try to *deceive* the professor into thinking that you have satisfied the rubric.

Changing the font size like that is trying to pull wool over the professors' eyes.  So I think it would qualify as academic dishonesty."
13277,[deleted]
13278,Yea trying to stretch it won‚Äôt do jack because it‚Äôs all about word count rather than page count lol. Just gotta find a way to turn a simple statement into something longer. 
13279,"Page count for essays, really? That is so silly. So many ways to cheat the system. You could increase the margin/header/footer size, up the font size, up the character/line spacing, slap in a diagram or two."
13280,"Professor is weird in the US because it's both a job title and an honorific. The title ""Professor"" is something you get very late in your career, as you described, though you can be an Assistant Professor shortly after getting a PhD, and Associate Professor maybe 7-8 years after that.

But, lecturers and instructors are often also called ""Professor"" as an honorific, even though it's not their job title."

13282,"Haha no problem! I don‚Äôt do it on every paper, but on the long ones I procrastinated it really helps!"
13283,Perfect.

That's a completely nonsensical approach."

13287,Terrible advice.
13288,"I can confirm that all essays I have done was with a word count.

Source: Was a student at an Australian university.

I first heard the concept in Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets when Ron needs a few more inches of parchment for his essay so he starts writing in big letters. I always thought it was just an old British thing. Had no idea it was still being done."
13289,"Professors have been publishing papers with various formatting requirements for each journal. Believe me, we notice ALL of your little tweaks right away. Whether we say fuck it or not is another question. Sometimes, I just don't have the energy to call out a student for this sort of silliness, so I just say, ""fuck it."" You are only hurting yourself when you cheat."
13290,"My very first paper in college was for like a freshman year class type of thing and my professor was new and foreign. She called me out on it but I guess she didn't really understand cause she was new so she just put notes about being confused about the size differences.

Now that I think about it, the concept of doing it was when you still had to print out your papers. Submitting it online kinda messes that up"

13295,omg you have just inspired me to try roller skating again. i‚Äôm glad u found smth to pass the time!!!! maybe you can bring your board to campus when it opens up again :)
13296,Try to find a new hobby and stay connected with friends. I find sunlight boosts my mood so take walks if safe.
13297,"I am definitely in the same boat as you are. Especially that politics are front and center right now as well, my house has been nightmarish. What I've done is take a few summer classes to help knock out credits for easy classes over the summer. It helps with keeping active. If you aren't doing that, maybe try dating apps, social apps to meet new people. Or, the best thing that my friends and I do is have Skype calls and play games together like cards against humanity online. I'd recommend that alot since it sounds like you really miss them."

13300,"Just out of curiosity, where are you from? I‚Äôm always interested in how students that study abroad in the US ended up coming here."
13301,"I‚Äôm feeling it too. I moved 180 miles away from the town i grew up in 3 days before i started at uni, so when i go home now i have, quite literally, no friends here. Covid has made things worse, as I‚Äôve been home since march and will stay here until August. I‚Äôve started to go outside more and enjoy nature, and I‚Äôm thinking of inviting a couple of college bros on an early August road trip. But right now, especially after not being able to attend a gathering back in my college‚Äôs town to see people, I‚Äôve been kinda in a rut. Work‚Äôs been helping to distract me, but it can only do so much. Social media and zoom and ft are also not replacements for physical interaction, and there‚Äôs not really a way to meet new people right now, what with the pandemic. Honestly, it may just be a case where i just wait until august to see people again, who knows. But I‚Äôm definitely feeling it too."
13302,You need to learn how to be happy by yourself.
13303,My bf loves d&d too!
13304,"Thank you for this. I lost an amazing internship opportunity, but besides that, I‚Äôve been doing everything ‚Äúright‚Äù ‚Äî working full-time, hanging out with my family, and talking with friends. Nonetheless, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm in a rut. This feeling isn‚Äôt permanent, though, and your comment made me feel a lot better."
13305,Everyone loves d&d!
13306,"Find a hobby or apply to some jobs that are still open. A lot of places are still desperate for help. 

Also try the app houseparty with some of your friends from school"
13307,"I felt like this constantly when I was in college and still do as I'm now living at home after graduation. My life in college was just so great and fun and interesting and my life at home is so boring. I also struggle with anxiety and depression that was much better when I was away at college and also feel like I have to force myself to hang out with my friends from home, especially because a lot of them have now moved away and I don't really get to choose who I hang out with anymore. 

So I relate! I would suggest video calling your college friends as much as possible. Talking to my friends, even if we couldn't actually do things together, was always helpful. Something else I always used to do over the summer too was look up restaurants/activities etc in my college town and plan what things I wanted to do first when I got back that I really missed over the summer."
13308,"Yeah I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. I‚Äôm doing some summer classes, seeing some HS friends occasionally, and workout out almost everyday but my boyfriend of 2.5 years dumped me out of nowhere for reasons that don‚Äôt make sense to me so it‚Äôs been a whole struggle and a half thinking about spending the next 3 months at home. Before he dumped me I was doing better but now it‚Äôs excruciating being so bored and unmotivated"
13309,As a DM and a player it helps with creativity and stress release. World building is alot of fun and playing a character can reveal slot about you or challenge you when made correctly
13310,"If you like dogs and cats, shelters always need extra help!"
13311,"Honestly what I think will help people is just keeping themselves busy. 

Creative outlets like art or music projects are good but I think they can get old.Try starting an online business or Etsy page and make your own jewelry or product. Maybe an instagram theme page. Remote volunteering. I‚Äôm thinking out loud. 

I think the most important part of college is the schedule. There‚Äôs always so much to do. The friends help a lot so I guess actively try to go on video calls with them. But yeah if you give yourself a schedule you won‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre wasting your time/ feel lonely all the time."
13312,"I have moderate to severe anxiety and keeping some kind of routine along with exercising helps.  Wake up around the same time every day (I chose 8-9:00).  Eat around the same time, go for a walk, plan a project every day or try a new recipe.  It is the most basic thing in the world, but the most effective.  Part of mental conditions worsening is your body being thrown into chaos."
13313,"Same here! I go to college in NYC with and had a solid group of people and activities there... and now I‚Äôm back in a town with a population of 2,400 and zero things to do. 
Here‚Äôs my recs for staying sane, especially as someone with anxiety/depression:
1. Sleep schedule! It‚Äôs difficult to follow through if you‚Äôve got it off track, but try to make sure you‚Äôre not staying up too late or sleeping in every day.
2. If you can, try taking a walk or spending time outside each day. Even if it‚Äôs just ten minutes, fresh air is good.
3. Hobbies! Revisit something you used to love doing before college, or pick up something new! I‚Äôm painting more, writing poetry, playing guitar, learning how to cook, and running a music blog with interviews; but not consistently! Just when the moment strikes me.
4. catch up on your reading list and watch list! Doing non-active things and chilling out is good too!
5. Take care of your space and keep things clean to keep your environment positive. I find it much easier to not get distracted and stressed when my room isn‚Äôt a wreck. Also making sure you‚Äôre doing laundry, dishes, showering, all of that helps keep your environment *chef‚Äôs kiss*.
6. Stay connected with others, we‚Äôre social beings that need social interaction to be healthy. Zoom call your friends, snail mail letters to one another, do movie watch parties and games with House Party. If you want a pen pal, I‚Äôd be happy to send a letter :)
Planning dinners, movies, game nights, anything with your family or people you‚Äôre quarantining keeps your social engagement active and gives you something to look forward too.

I hope these helped!"
13314,"depending if school starts early or not i'm planning to book it out of the house by the turn of august haha. i keep telling myself that i'm halfway done tho since ive been home since end of march so that's a good reminder.

and i'm holding out hope that schools start earlier this semester"
13315,"I‚Äôm doing some writing that I‚Äôve been wanting to do for a while, working through some old games, etc. Also, going on hikes for exercise. Sometimes do virtual movie nights and stuff with friends.

Also, going into course overload this summer because even with that I‚Äôm losing my mind a bit."
13316,"I'm from india. The situation is here is like US if not worse. After a 3 month lockdown the country is finally unlocking. I lost my internship but that gave me the opportunity to do something I always wanted to do. Started working out, have good cuts now. Read limitless by jim kwik. Great book. I use prime over netflix so not much to watch but I'm building new things for me slowly and slowly and getting my pieces back together."
13317,I would reccomend gardening as a hobby. Really helped me out with my blues.
13318,"Thanks for this post. I feel this way a lot as an out of state students. I try to invest myself in new hobbies or self improvement I can do alone, but it definitely is a lonely few months. Hopefully you can be back at school in the fall and view this time as temporary. Again, thanks for posting. Made me feel less lonely to know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way."
13319,"This might sound stupid but I just got a job at my local Home Depot where most of my friends and kids from highschool work, its also located in a parking lot with other stores where other friends work so it‚Äôs even better. Also not many people are going into the store so I get to be safe with friends and I get paid!"
13320,Try searching for online internships. It will help boost your resume and is something that is connected to school if you get one pertaining to your major...which it should be anyways.
13321,"Being with my family for this long amount of time is driving me insane. I don‚Äôt mind them in small doses but if college doesn‚Äôt start again, ik my mental health will fall even more"
13322,"I could also be the lack of learning. Find a free course to take somewhere. Brush up on statistics or something (if it's relevant). Keep busy study wise, a little bit, even if it doesn't count towards course credit."
13323,"If they are not able to help, talk to the Title IX coordinator."
13324,"First, I'd take a very deep breath. There are many options for you! And I can assure you, no one is going to force you to stay at an abusive home.

Do you have any friends that live near-by? Would they be willing to let you stay with them, given the circumstances? That could be a very simple answer. Also, at least my college, is allowing students to stay if the circumstances are severe enough. In this case, I think if you explained to your housing department why you couldn't return home, they would be more than welcoming.

No one wants to send someone back where they are not safe, comfortable, or taken care of. People WILL work with you, and are EXTREMELY understanding, for the most part. Take care of yourself, and keep us updated so we can best help you!"
13325,So title IX was passed to support equal opportunity for students for federally funded things such as college and such. Going to a title IX coordinator can help bc if the college doesn‚Äôt allow OP to stay given that she extenuating circumstances then it would be a violation of title IX because they aren‚Äôt allowing her the equal opportunity to continue her studies online or Remotely if that‚Äôs their plan. Does that help?
13326,"Most likely, the college won‚Äôt kick you out of the dorm. If they did, and they forced you to go to some place even MORE dangerous, then they‚Äôd be liable for that, so they‚Äôll likely take a hands-off approach. And yes, contact housing services."
13327,"This is exactly the problem. So many people are excited and like ‚ÄúCLASSES ARE CANCELED WHOOO‚Äù but it‚Äôs a lose-lose. We still have to do work, can‚Äôt stay in the rooms we paid for, and people have to go back to situations like this."
13328,"If you will literally be homeless due to this, I'm sure the college will be able to make an exception for you. Just go and talk to the right people."
13329,I'm confused. Its possible I don't know enough about Title IX but how are they supposed to help in this situation?
13330,That does help typically when I hear people refer to Title IX its implied that there was some kind of sexual misconduct or blatant favoritism based on gender/sex.
13331,"I'm so sorry. If you're in NYS in a SUNY or CUNY, Cuomo has said: ""Dorms will stay open to accommodate students who need housing"". Even if you aren't, maybe your college will follow suit? Sorry, and good luck :("
13332,"Yes that applies to title IX too! Sexual misconduct on campus and gender favoring prohibit the equal opportunity for students to receive an education. Sexual misconduct applies because it makes them uncomfortable, thus unable to preform at the level that they should be Able to or usually do. Favoritism of gender applies because again, opportunities will be presented to one gender that aren‚Äôt made available to the other. 

In fact, Title IX was passed to help women athletic teams in colleges be able to recruit and provide financial assistance (through scholarships) for women, as at the time of its passing, college sports was predominately male and colleges only really addressed male sports teams typically. 

All in all, Title IX basically just says to institutions ‚Äúdon‚Äôt discriminate if you want to keep your federal funding‚Äù :)"
13333,I know that most colleges aren't forcing the dorms to vacate. I would definitely ask housing and res life
13334,They're not refunding room and board?
13335,From what I've been hearing....nope.
13336,"I‚Äôll advise you stay in your dorm if you‚Äôre allowed to stay at the college. This virus is serious. Get a few bags of rice (over 15 lb), beans and ramen noodles. Cans of chicken, spam & lots of tuna for protein. $200 can last you 2 months. Prepare for the worst

By stay in your dorm, I mean self quarantine"
13337,"I assume you go to a SUNY or CUNY. I go to SUNY Stony Brook and although all classes have been moved online, all dorms will remain open for anyone who wants to continue living in their dorm."
13338,"My university claims this, but is forcing me to go back to my home which is 30seconds away from a public school with 2 confirmed cases. They don‚Äôt care about anything except liability, and will literally only help people who cannot return home because of congressional/international/presidential directive"
13339,According to the CDC and WHO that isn't true. What do you know that they don't know?
13340,"I apologize for profile stalking, but I see you've posted in a gay subreddit. Many colleges have emergency funds to help LGBT students in situations where they are homeless due to being kicked out/suffering abuse. Check if your school has that."
13341,"Someone has to cough or sneeze. It isn't considered airborne as it needs more of a carrier. Mucus from cough and sneezing is considered to travel up to 6 feet. Way different than what you said that ""simply breathing the same air as the infected"" was a means of transmission. Stop spreading misinformation."
13342,"My college has also suspended classroom activity but has kept dorms open. Maybe yours just hasn't made a decision on it yet? In the meanwhile, get a job and save up money until you can move somewhere alone."
13343,I‚Äôm quite literally in the same boat as you. PM me if you‚Äôd like to talk
13344,"Go to student services.  Usually the school will have some dorms open (unless they are an epicenter of infection) and you can petition to stay in most cases.

Also call your social worker."
13345,At my university they‚Äôre making everyone leave the dorms but they‚Äôre letting the people who can‚Äôt go home request to stay here through break. Hopefully yours does the same.
13346,"You paid for a year of housing. They have an obligation there since you already paid. Either they need to relocate you or allow you to live there, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some nonsense to jump through though."
13347,"Not completely true. A college campus has a huge amount of people on it all concentrated in a very small space. Even if you are sent back home to near a public school with COVID-19, that public school probably has shut down as well. Shutting down universities is definitely the best way to combat COVID19"
13348,"Discrimination, domestic abuse, sexual violence. OP mentioned abuse. I don't ask for more info if OP not ready to divulge.

13350,"[According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX), Title IX is *only* stuff done on the basis of sex. How does them being uncomfortable have anything to do with it? And from the original post, it sounds like *everyone* is probably being affected equally in terms of treatment by the school. Maybe not everyone is forced to be homeless, but that doesn't mean the school discrimated against people."
13351,"Maybe ask a friend to see if they can take you in for a while? If not, then maybe talk to the school to strike a deal with them? Don‚Äôt lose hope!"
13352,"As others have mentioned, I would go to talk to the people in charge of housing on campus; if they cannot resolve it, keep going up the chain of command to the deans. Most of the institutions that I am aware of are offering the ability to petition to stay in the dorms for specific circumstances. Your college is doing this because they feel it is in the best interests of the students if you explain your situation and let them know that it is worse off for you to return home I'm sure they will allow you to stay. 

In terms of other options, check-in with friends, or even just other students from your institution. Right now there is a group of students and parents who live near my college that is offering to take in students for the time being if they have reasons they cannot go home such as having an internship, are international students who cannot return home right away, or are low income and cannot afford to leave immediately. Check on social media for your institution and see if anyone is offering the same. Even if you can stay in the dorms, this might be a viable option if offered as you will have an easier time having access to a kitchen if your dorms do not have community kitchens.

While it might seem like a total mess, I'm sure there are people at your institution that will listen and help."
13353,"True. College has just been one giant year. I hope time slows down after it, and I'll be able to solidify memories again instead of always going through the motions of everything."
13354,This feeling happens when every day is the same. You recall an entire year as a handful of events only. If 9 months are the same then they might as well be 9 weeks. Try having unique experiences frequently after you're done with this shit.
13355,Understood. Gotta make the best of it while we are still alive!!
13356,"Yeah, they say that by the age of 25 you have lived half of your perceived lifetime."
13357,"I just started college and am an engineering major as well. I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about and i‚Äôm only a semester in, have you enjoyed your time in college?"
13358,"Exactly. When days are similar, they don't stand out looking back and just blend into one big chunk. That's why people say experiencing new stuff and having memorable experiences feels like living a full life, because those events stand out."
13359,"We‚Äôre more busy, more independent and a year means less to us. For a two year old, a year is half their entire life. For us, it‚Äôs much less and continues to decrease as we get older. Personally, I‚Äôd like to revert to a one year old so that my winter break feels less like a blink of an eye where I did nothing but sleep until 1pm everyday"
13360,"So far, academically, I'd say things have been good. But socially, as an engineer major, I can‚Äôt go out that often since I gotta stay up-to-date with all my coursework. And I commute, so I basically watch TV or play Roblox in my free time. You?"
13361,"Bro, same. I saw my graduation year (Spring 2020) so far away back in 2016. Its 2020 and I'm freaking out. I guess that we are so busy that time flies by."
13362,"I‚Äôm a senior and about to start my last semester of college. I remember my freshman year a senior at the time told me that college goes by so fast so enjoy it. 

As cliche as it sounds, it really does. Freshman year I was so carefree running around the halls going to dorm parties and trying to get into house parties, then Sophomore year came and I lived in an apartment and got the sophomore slump, then junior year I studied abroad in an awesome country and explored new places, and now I‚Äôm getting ready to start a career.

But despite how hard it might be to leave in a couple of months, I really do feel prepared for the next step and feel like I got everything I could out of this place. 

So, a little unsolicited advice to all you freshman: Always remember, You‚Äôre not just in college to get a degree, but to make crazy memories, fail and learn, do things that scare you, go on random trips, and make lifelong friends.

Cheers to undergrad."
13363,Not really I have had trouble making friends in college so it‚Äôs been more like a depressing nightmare. I dread college and get panic attacks on the daily especially when I go back. I felt highschool went faster and somehow even though it was also terrible it was better than college so far
13364,Oh wow...
13365,Gives you all the more reason to take a break every once and a while and enjoy life. It's over before you know it.
13366,"That‚Äôs what I thought...

Edit: Ah, I see what Functional_Sus is saying now. They‚Äôre referring to not the actual years of life, but rather how we perceive those years of life (as the human brain thinks logarithmically rather than linearly). Very interesting."
13367,"For me, life has been going at the speed of a Nascar race (without the pit stops) since my sophomore year in high school and as a freshman in college that hasn't changed and it honestly makes me sad. It's going by so quickly"
13368,"I hope time slows down too, this semester felt like a handful of weeks"
13369,"How do I have unique experiences if I have to spend the rest of my life going to work every day? And I can‚Äôt do it now because I‚Äôm constantly swamped with work and barely even have time to pass all of my classes.

Life after high school is depressing."
13370,"Definitely. In the past, each year had a specific vibe to it. I could recall memories easier. But post-2017, everything has just been one giant memory plethora."
13371,">How do I have unique experiences if I have to spend the rest of my life going to work every day? 

Like all the rest of us, you have them on the weekends and during vacations."

So, the same stuff you do everyday won't stand out in your memory in retrospect and will blend together into one big massive chunk"
13374,Makes sense! Yeah I get very nostalgic about family/friend parties as a kid without responsibilities. I always want that feeling back!
13375,Thank you!
13376,Thank you I will remember this.
13377,"I graduated HS in June 2016 and a lot has changed. I started off at CC, which I‚Äôve now graduated from as well and now I‚Äôm in my second year at a university. I got a job that I was consistently promoted and worked more or less 30 hours a week while going to school with 12 hours. Not all of me has changed, but there‚Äôs some key differences I‚Äôve noticed, especially with my confidence. 

Friends from high school have come and gone but I saw a friend the other day and we were talking about how long we‚Äôve known each other and we‚Äôve known each other for nearly a decade. We‚Äôre not super close but it just hit me how once upon a time we were these shy high school freshmen and now she‚Äôs about to graduate from college and I still have another 3 semesters to go.

But yea these past few years have just flown by. Part of me regrets working so much and letting being 19-21 go by so quick in a boring way but I‚Äôm 22 now and I want to make the most of the rest of the time I have in college so I‚Äôm making friends, joining organizations, and am still working hard to have a bright future."
13378,"Guys, start writing diaries, your days will then feel a lot longer and you will be able to look back at what you did, what stressed you and how you evolved as a person. I had this same feeling since I'm in my fifth year of engineering and my first year feels like 3 months ago."
13379,"I think in the US it's 72.

Edit: 78 according to Google"
13380,"Definitely, it‚Äôs surreal."
13381,"This is probably bland advice so forgive me if this comes off as insensitive, but I used to have more issues with panic attacks/anxiety and school and a few things helped me. The first was frequent and consistent exercise (anything which pushes your body to the limit) and the second was talking to someone while simultaneously changing locations. For me a phone call with my mom and walking down the hall or around the block has done so much for panic attacks if I‚Äôm able to catch it soon enough. 

I know everyone experiences anxiety differently and different things help different people (and my panic attacks are generally more mild than what I perceive others to be) but I saw myself in your comment and wanted to share some things which have helped me. I wish you the best of luck!!"
13382,I say that to myself and I‚Äôm doing good in school but I feel like I don‚Äôt actually like anyone at my school. Nobody feels right and like someone I would hang with. I feel out of my element even when I try to socialize more than usual
13383,"You can do it multiple ways, I make questions for myself and try to answer actively. The YouTuber Ali Abdaal does a solid job describing it."
13384,Yeah I‚Äôm confused as well
13385,"Better title:

Quarantine has driven me to talk to myself



Kidding, I do this when reading a textbook too. There's often no way I'd understand it otherwise."

The ones you got wrong you highlight in red and the ones you got right you highlight in green. The highlights are going to change every time you test yourself."
13387,"> instead of 

doesn't have to be one or the other. can do both."
13388,And after answering it to urself you‚Äôre done? You remember the answer to a question you asked yourself from a couple pages ago? (Just tryna grasp the concept and see if I‚Äôm misinterpreting any part of it)
13389,"I do this as well, but sometimes I record myself to listen to later. Note taking has always been too... impersonal, for lack of a better word, for any of the information to stick. 

If I do take notes, I type them out in a stream of consciousness format to keep up with my thoughts as rapidly as they come. Handwriting notes takes too long and is therefore too distracting, plus my handwriting is awful."
13390,If I end up acing my finals with this method im giving a medal
13391,"Yeah I don't take notes, I make songs. After paraphrase reading a page, I try to condense it into four bars, so like, 12 pages worth of material a song. Then I just jam out. Auto A's (but it is time consuming, about the same amount of time as taking notes)"
13392,"Yes! I do this for chem lectures. Instead of just jotting down notes, I speak back to myself the gist of what I learned and how it applies to the rest of the material. It really helps you understand difficult concepts. 100% recommend"
13393,Use the software program Anki to make flashcards that automate active recall
13394,"I out loud explain to myself the topics that are important to the page. I read the page in my head, then converse about the topic out loud. I would read an article on active recall."
13395,"This sounds like a great strategy or at least complement to a learning process! While I always handled the first cut at the material in the traditional note-taking way, I generally maintain my currency over time and explore the depths to which I understand a concept by verbally posing problems to myself and talking my way through the best solution I can.

I don't do this with anything in front of me, so I think it is similar to what you're talking about just at a delayed time and with a little added bonus of having to come up with questions that prod my understanding. I actually find that this has become a comfortable enough exploration, sharpening, and confidence building process that I fall into almost naturally, whenever I have quiet time, be that in the shower or just pacing around allowing my thoughts to run their course. Now that I think about it, I am nearly always standing when I process thoughts in this manner. Get weird with it, personalize it, and love it!"
13396,"I've been taking notes on my biology lectures the whole semester but the last two lectures I have just been making flashcards instead and just going over the PowerPoint to make the cards, best thing"
13397,*laughs in ADHD*
13398,Easier said than done while you have thousands of other assignments and life stuff. Learn to study smarter not harder. No one‚Äôs gonna give you a cookie for doing both if you eventually got the job done
13399,"I‚Äôve seen the video, just trying to get some insight and hear different perspectives thanks though!!"
13400,For people who are confused you are basically pretending to either teach the material to yourself in your own way
13401,I have ADHD too and... what?
13402,"You can either do it like flash cards typing out the answer (The notes app Notion‚Äôs toggle feature works great for this, or you can also use Anki, although the functionality isn‚Äôt great) or just look for the answer in your notes after trying to answer the question in your head.

Great method for conceptual or memorization topics, but not as good for any math or calculations type course. 

https://youtu.be/fDbxPVn02VU

This is a great video describing the method, takes a bit to get used to, but if used properly it‚Äôs a much more efficient method than reading a textbook or re-writing/typing your notes."
13403,"My Notes are either info I didn't manage to process when it was lectured or my thoughts and explanations alongside the sentences. 
But i don't have a better method especially for arts, social Science etc. I can read pages od history book and leave NO trace in my mind.üßê"
13404,You‚Äôd still have to work them out by hand/calculator though. I feel like this is more for abstract notes rather than quantitative notes as our brains aren‚Äôt that equipped to solve complex mathematical equations like a robot/calculator as it is memorizing random definitions lol.
13405,Would it work for classes like gross anatomy or pharmacology where it‚Äôs pretty much pure memorization?
13406,"I mean I can‚Äôt speak for those classes as I‚Äôm only a first year bio student lol, but I assume so. There‚Äôs a lot of different ways you can apply it, but active recall is just putting ‚Äútesting yourself‚Äù in complex terms. Any way you can test yourself is better than skimming over notes and readings trying to convince yourself that you‚Äôre studying. Idk if this would apply to anatomy, but either covering up each part of the heart and trying to correctly determine it, or asking yourself questions for what the function is of each part of the heart without looking at the answer to solve it."
13407,"i think it's even better when you make yourself write down what you learned from memory, but thats just me. writing down helps so much imo."
13408,I‚Äôm so glad I found this post. I‚Äôve been looking for better ways to study. I‚Äôll try this out. Thanks. :)
13409,join us at the dark side over at r/Anki
13410,you have to say it in your own words without looking at your notes. [watch this video](https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0).
13411,"I think it varies with subjects. E.g. I study Stats, and after I finish a 3 page section, I'll stop and try to explain the theme and logic, which is what the section is trying to tell, usually to solve a problem by introducing several  theoroms or methods, and how do they solve it. I usually do this like lecturing and write down the major logic including each step of the proof and how to perceive it intuitively."
13412,"Typing > writing imho

I also use typing for memorization. Literally, like typing out the thing-to-be-learnt multiple times until it sticks. It works!"
13413,"Personally, I prefer multiple,low-stakes assignments rather than a handful of big assignments. Everyone is different, but I think a low-stakes quiz on the material every week is a good thing because it makes sure students are keeping up with the lectures and boosts the grade a little. Also, don't grade on a curve because that just hurts the students that don't cheat"
13414,[deleted]
13415,Dear lord please no group assignments. I‚Äôve taken 4 online courses (willingly) and the only thing I truly hated was group projects. They‚Äôre difficult to work on cooperatively (especially with different time zones) and create much more stress than is necessary.
13416,"75% of people in my in-person classes don‚Äôt participate in in-class discussions in any meaningful way. When they‚Äôre forced to respond to an online discussion, you can‚Äôt expect more than bullshit."
13417,"I have a professor who really seems to know how to do online. He has a groupchat for the class - it makes it easy for us to contact him with questions and to bounce ideas off of classmates. He does a lot to encourage us to talk and share ideas in the group.

One of the big downfalls for students in online classes is forgetting when things are due. The same professor emailed us a link to the schedule on the first day - it's just a google doc with links. Links to the recorded sessions, links to the homework, links to the quizzes, etc. Organized by week, updated regularly. He updates the links at the start of the week and when new recordings are ready, and it helps a lot to have everything in one place - no hunting around on the class webpage for the links. 

The same professor also seems to despise live online lecture. He does it only when discussion is needed. Instead, he makes his own lecture videos, posts them online, and keeps the online session to 15-30 min for updates, clarification, questions, etc. The lecture videos are full of notes and visual aids, emphasizing the important points, and move fast enough to be not boring - he makes them with the expectation that we will pause and rewind and watch the video more than once. Bonus that he uses youtube so we can watch the videos on 2x speed on the second or third rewatch. The software our school uses for online sessions doesn't have a setting that allows you to change the video speed.

Had a professor last semester lecture fully online, monotone, didn't know how to use his software well, etc. It was very hard to focus in his class. He eventually discovered onenote and things were a lot better, but still difficult. He was trying to continue doing things exactly as he had when classes were in person - just notes on a whiteboard. I don't fault him though - it was an unexpected, sudden change for everyone.

Had another professor who took advantage of his software to make things interesting. Changed pen colors frequently, for example. It was a math class so not much you could do to make it fun beyond that. Well, he let us - encouraged us to go a bit off topic in the class chat, and that livened things up a lot - group dynamic was different though since we had all known each other from class before we all got sent online."
13418,Or just sidestep the cheating issue by making exams open note (and probably harder to compensate)
13419,"Question: what about a combination of both? Sometimes I find really good videos and think, ""couldn't have said it better myself."" I post it since that's a better use of my time than recreating the wheel. Other times, I can't find exactly what I want and make my own. How do students feel about that? 

(Math prof here)"
13420,"post everything ‚Äî every module, note, whatever ‚Äî ahead of time and make the entire class function as a learn a module a week class of that sort."
13421,"Slides are super important, even if they're missing a key term here and there to make sure students follow along.

I'd also like to add that showing all assignments up front and keeping things simple is incredibly important. We don't want to keep track of twenty small assignments in different folders unless it's one big task with instructions from one to the next. It's easier to just follow directions than it is to skip around from assignment to assignment.

Also, please use rubrics for almost everything and honor those rubrics. I had a professor who would bury requirements in the single point or no points column when I'm looking at the column that gets me full points. So, please don't do that, but most of us rely on rubrics to give you what you want."
13422,"discussion boards aren‚Äôt the issue. 

the issue is the requirement for two new posts that need to be 4 paragraphs, contain 3 citations, 2 links, no less than 1000 words. plus 3 responses that need to be 3 paragraphs, contain 2 citations and no less than 500 words. each week. in addition to homework‚Äôs."
13423,Group assignments suck because everyone has different priorities and schedules. People will refuse to put in the same level of work at the same time as their members and it can really screw people over.
13424,"I took some online government classes one summer while working full time a few years ago. Everyday for the 4 week class we were required to post a 300 word (min) discussion post and comment on at least 5 other people's posts. Everyday after work I would come home get the dumb modules done and then puke out as much babble onto the discussion post that I could just to get the grade. It was easier to say dumb inflammatory crap than have an honest discussion so everyone in the class would spout out the hardest left or right leaning stuff and parrot whatever jargon was available. And then we would comment on each other's posts by patting each other on the back until we met our quotas. No meaningful discussion at all occurred in that forum and I spent hours writing crap I don't even believe just to get a grade and get out.

Unfortunately attitudes like that are pervasive in college. It hasn't been until recently that I gained the perspective of how childishly I treated college. It's supposed to he a bastion of education and enlightenment but it seems likes every 20 year old in college does everything they can to avoid doing homework and going to class. I never read a single book I was assigned in my classes that I paid to take. I avoided my engineering homework until the last minute everytime. And I never cracked open a textbook if I could get away with looking it up on YouTube or Chegg."
13425,Thank you for asking this. I‚Äôm a prof too and have been wondering the same. This feedback is great
13426,"A lot of these are excellent points.
My take is please no group projects. 
Have both PowerPoint slide and audio of lectures for those who are auditory learners. 

Discussion boards are cool but please don't make us required to reply to other students. When you make us respond you'll just see ""I agree with this statement about blah blah blah that you said!"" In literally every topic.

And for the love of God give us a review or the correct answers after we take a test. How am I suppose to fix my grade in the future when I can't even see what I got wrong? 

Thanks for talking to us and hope you're doing alright!"
13427,"Might be a cool idea to post the video as the main source, then also post a video of yourself going over practice problems related to the class."
13428,Don't: use the textbook to substitute actual lectures
13429,"I'm willingly taking online classes and the discussion board requirements for some of these drive me insane. 

Oh yeah, let me just whip up two essays the day after the week starts after reading 60+ pages of text book, while I have a full time job to pay for this. Oops can't forget the mini essay responses, of which I need to do four that are due the next day. Can't forget the essay that's due on Friday on top of the test and home work."
13430,"Professor PLEASE don‚Äôt give them group projects. They never work for online classes and idk why some teachers make them. No one is ever on time to meet up online so you‚Äôre left wondering if you have to do all the work, and then boom it‚Äôs Saturday night and it‚Äôs due Sunday and your teammates are finally responding. 

Just the absolute worst. Group projects should not be apart of online classes. 

I digress. Now I have to go do my group project that‚Äôs due Sunday üò§"
13431,"Depending on what you teach, an iPad or drawing tablet is such a great replacement to a white board. Following along to a discussion while staring at slides is already difficult enough in person. It just feels like an audiobook when done online. My professor would display the slides and take notes on the sides during the presentation. It worked well imo."
13432,Yes! I hate it when I needed to take a day or two off the next week and am unable to look at any material or complete something in advance because the module is locked down until XX/XX.
13433,"Agree with everything other than the discussion board one. Three out of my four summer classes require discussion boards, and that's honestly the only thing keeping me engaged and willing to watch lectures. How could discussion boards be improved?"
13434,"Solve the issue of forgetting due dates by making assignments due on the same day of the week every week. All the major online programs standardize this across all classes.

Forgetting deadlines is a major barrier to success and one that is easily solvable on the professor's end.

-Online professor"
13435,"I'm currently in graduate school and recently had to take my first couple of online classes. I hated it - pretty much the entire time. But what made it at least somewhat bearable was my professors acknowledging that this was a tough and complicated time to live in. I appreciated them letting students know that this was going to be the new normal but also showing us that it was a learning process for everyone involved. This made the class feel more intimate which actually made me enjoy the lectures much more.

I don't know how large your classes will be nor do I know what your subjects you will be teaching, but I would recommend possibly providing some interactive aspects to your lectures. For instance, using breakout rooms to divide students into small groups (if you're using Zoom) so they can discuss key points you've just discussed."
13436,"People have different home situations. Some students are working 40 hours a week on top of classes, some students have parents who argue, either because of quarintine or not, and they can't be in group calls, and some students are dealing with deaths of family members due to the virus and the fear that their families will die. Right now is all around not a good time for group projects.

I would really agree with you if we were in a different situation. But we aren't, and we have to take that into account."
13437,"For those students, I'd: Have live lectures that are also recorded with non-mandatory attendance, have weekly homework to keep students engaged,   ask for feedback more than usual and take polls on how students want the course delivered, and most importantly-- Be very organized and make content accessible in advance of lectures."
13438,"Yes about discussion boards, I think they are good when people want to use them but requiring every top-level post AND replies to be a certain word count with citations and specific references just kills the discussion because no one wants to read the same fluff over and over"
13439,"I agree with the interactive part, but maybe not the break rooms...at my school at least, most of my friends and I, when we got put into breakout rooms for class, no one would talk. So it was just like really awkward for ten minutes until we went back to the main lecture. 

Another prof I had made these in class questions we could do for a few minutes on our own and then brought us back to review them. I thought that was nice"
13440,Some students have big issues transitioning to different learning modalities. Even something as simple as trying to learn something from a different person in the same style can be much more difficult. Those students will always prefer having just you do the videos because by the time they reach the more difficult parts of the course they're already familiar with your style and how you explain things. Supplementary videos should be just that. They shouldn't ever replace content because you don't feel as though you have anything to add. For some students the fact that it's YOU saying it makes all the difference.
13441,[deleted]
13442,It is so annoying. Especially in summer classes. Like this class is already going to be intense can you at least let me work ahead if I have some spare time üôÑ
13443,"Is this in writing? If so,  print it out and bring it to the department head and calmly explain that you signed up for a class from x time to y time. 

Professors aren't allowed to change a class time like that."
13444,"Talking to your professor and then the department chair is the right answer. There's a chain of command in academic departments that needs to be followed. Skipping to the top will do you no favors. They will ask if you've talked to the professor and department chair, even when you reach the Dean level. Have you talked to your professor so they know the time changes are difficult for you?"
13445,"Yes,I am not allowed to do this either"
13446,Umm yeah no..
13447,"Before you go over their head, talk with the professor and ask why they have this expectation that you can‚Äôt meet based on your other responsibilities. If they refuse to back off this unreasonable request, then go to then department chair."
13448,If your professor is giving you work 30-40 minutes before class is scheduled. Go directly over their head to their boss
13449,Lol call Biden
13450,"There's a schedule for a reason, had the same issue with one of mine who would start 5-10 mins early which wouldn't be a problem  I didn't have a class that ended 15 mins before the next one started. 
So when we had to sign in to get attendance and I came in on time he wouldn't let me sign because he started 10 mins early and I had to go onto the schools website to show him that his class started at X time. 
He gave me the credit and was like ""I start 10 mins early usually so"""
13451,I think it's time to get Jesus involved in this one
13452,"This. Talk to the department head, but also your student union if you have one. If no luck, talk to the next person up, potentially the dean."
13453,"I would also be not allowed to do this. Probably fired for it, honestly. You guys thinking what I‚Äôm thinking? Adjunct having to work at multiple institutions to make anywhere close to a livable wage and has two different classes scheduled simultaneously? I can see that being a possibility."
13454,Skip the Dean.  Go to the school provost/chancellor.  Or directly to the governor of your state.
13455,Definitely second this
13456,"This is good idea. Usually if there is even 1 student that can‚Äôt accommodate the changes, the prof should not have these time changes. In my experience, I had a summer class that was earlier start. Some days the prof asked if anyone was ok to start a bit later in the day for the next class. We only did this if 100% of the students agreed. It only happened handful of times."
13457,"This is a pretty ridiculous expectation. I don‚Äôt ‚Äòstart‚Äô my classes until 3-5 minutes after the hour to let stragglers turn up, in case they are late for whatever reason."
13458,"That's interesting! I have 3- 4 hour classes, and the break times never have to be made up"
13459,"Screw Jesus, get the big man Himself"
13460,This is not ok.
13461,"this is what I hate about online Classes.

Just because it‚Äôs online, doesn‚Äôt mean profs should drastically change things out of the blue."
13462,What‚Äôs the rationale for going over the professor‚Äôs head instead of engaging the prof directly?
13463,"This, except talk to the instructor first."
13464,"A full hour early and it happening regularly isn‚Äôt cool. If it was like 10 minutes, or only happened a handful of times (but tbh an hour is too much even once), then maybe. I can imagine some reasonable explanations for it. But I mean, people have other classes. And if it‚Äôs the earliest time slot of the day, people have *sleep*!

Is the prof also ending the class early, or are they just extending their time to lecture basically? Because that‚Äôs not cool"
13465,God point*
13466,"I agree with the other commenter; it's possible the prof isn't realizing that their ask is unrealistic, but they'll adjust to student needs if students voice them.


Plus, sometimes if you seek outside intervention, they'll want you to try to work things out with the professor first anyway. So then you may end up having to talk with the professor one way or another, and chances are that especially if you have a decent professor, they may be frustrated that you assumed this needed escalated when it could have been solved with a simple email. You only want to escalate if the issue can't be solved with the professor."
13467,"If there are 0 students that can‚Äôt accommodate the changes, the prof shouldn‚Äôt have the time changes. 

Designated class times exist for a reason."
13468,"Professor here,  absolutely not allowed to do this.  I would have to get anonymous and unanimous permission to change a class time.  That's difficult and rare."
13469,"I don't think that's something instructors can do. I'd email the chair of the department or dean. 

You could even word it something like

>Dear [Dean/Chair],

>This semester in [Instructor's] class, we've been asked regularly to come in 30-40 minutes before the listed class time. As a full time student who is also juggling other life duties (work, night classes, etc.) this has been quite a bit to handle, and honestly somewhat unexpected. I was wondering if I should expect other classes in this program to have meeting times outside what is listed in the catalog. And if so, if there was a location with the actual course meeting times. Such a resource would be helpful to plan my schedule ahead of time.

>Thanks for any information,  
>[Name]

Guaranteed your class times will be normal from then on.

Source: I'm an instructor. I know we can't just have students come in early like this every week. It's possible your institution is different, but I'm guessing no. An email to their boss like this will have things normal for you by the end of the week."
13470,"Is the entitlement rationale obvious? My first instinct is to assume the prof may not be aware of how his or her work demands impact the class. In the past, classmates and I would address such an issue directly w the prof which resolved it every single time."
13471,"Protection from retaliation is a big reason.

Professors are human too & there a plenty of humans who are vindictive assholes. I definitely had one professor who I'm 100% sure would be the type to grade a ""complainer's"" work more harshly after bringing up the time thing.

Much safer to just go over their head, since it's likely your name will not be revealed to the professor that way. It's a class wide issue, not a personal once they'd be able to single you out on with context."
13472,"I catch your meaning. There are most certainly assholes out there. 

Nevertheless I wouldn‚Äôt feel right going over the prof‚Äôs head. I‚Äôd feel like I compromised myself. If the prof wants to single me out for being direct then so be it. That‚Äôd be an escalation and definitely warrant getting the dean involved."
13473,Go to the department chair. When you email them attach all of your evidence. This is pretty cut and dry and you should come out on top. If that doesn‚Äôt work then you need to email the dean.
13474,"Appeal this. Lay out a timeline of each event in an email and cc his department chair. Reference any university policies about Covid absences or class policies about absences that may be in the syllabus. Just be totally factual, not threatening or snarky. Ask for reinstatement in the class and KEEP GOING to class."
13475,This is absolutely infuriating
13476,"Honestly it sounds like he has you confused with another student. Otherwise he's just gone insane. Because literally none of what he's saying makes any sense. 

I would try to clarify things with him, and even go so far as to outright say you think he has you confused with someone else. Explain that you only missed 5 days for an excused COVID absence, so you don't see how you could be failing already. Any assignments you didn't complete were purely due to COVID since you weren't there to get the assignments.

If none of that works then I guess go to the department head or dean. At that point you'll have quite the email trail proving everything you said. So don't delete anything. And write any future emails with the thought in mind that the dean or department chair might end up seeing them at some point.

Edit: The only other thing I can think is that maybe he assumed you would only be absent for a day or two and is freaking out now that it's 5 days. I'm not sure. But definitely email him one last time before going to the department head."
13477,"Thanks everyone for your advice, I sent in a couple emails to the directors and dean and I am currently waiting on a reply. I also got legal advice incase they are no help. He is the only instructor teaching the class as well as another I need to take so it's not like I can drop it and pick up with someone else. This will literally screw over my financial aid and I fear he might retaliate in the future course and purposely fail me.. The course is for Diesel Technology and I am the only girl, I hope that's not why I'm getting targeted... I want to fight it but I might have to just move on to another college. He is my Instructor for the next two semesters, I'm fucked."
13478,"Prof here. I want to believe that this professor is probably confused, he's coming off of covid, might be dealing with brain fog, not to mention the stress of missing that many days as a prof (I would be at peak anxiety in his situation).

I'm chiming in just to say - if you experience *any sort* of retaliation, write down absolutely everything and report it to the appropriate people (Student Life, Academic Affairs, Title IX... you should have high up folks in all of these offices that exist just to support your educational experience). This is *especially* true if you think any of the retaliation has to do with you being the only woman in the class.

I've been the only woman in classes, research teams, workshops... it can suck. You're awesome for getting as far as you have, and like I said I hope this is a simple misunderstanding / a prof who is scattered and stressed after being out sick."
13479,"You‚Äôve gotten good advice, just search and find out who to talk to. There‚Äôs a process for it at an college though slightly different everywhere. 

Obviously this emotional and feels personal, but I just tell my self to jump through the necessary hoops, it‚Äôs just paperwork and on paper you have every reason to still attend and receive credit."
13480,contract with Department office. Show your evidence.
13481,"I would maybe speak to this teachers department head. I would also screenshot blackboard with no assignments, your emails with this teacher, and your current grade in the class. Documentation is key here. Explain everything to the department head in as much detail as possible. I wish you luck, this teacher is being extremely unreasonable."
13482,"That's what I was thinking too. I would err on this side as well.  Even though you DO absolutely have a case for appeal, will you have to take this course again with this prof? Will they talk with their colleagues about you? Will the appeal clear in time so that you don't lose financial aid? Etc.  If it does *happen* to be a mistake, this will save you a lot of trouble. 

Be humble, apologize if you can stomach it. Be professional. Ask for additional explanation so you can avoid the same error in future courses.  

If they double down, TOTALLY appeal."
13483,"Definitely go to the Dean of whatever department that Professor is a part of. Show them all of your evidence and run through the timeline with them. They will be the person able to help you the most.

Edit: Or if you cannot set up a meeting with the Dean of the department, check into if you have a student affairs office."
13484,OP has nothing to apologize about
13485,"Ya, this."
13486,"Please update us, I don‚Äôt have anything to add that hasn‚Äôt already be said, I just really hope everything will be fine!"
13487,"Your school might have a policy about medical exemptions, at least for exams, which you could cite in a complaint to the university (see if they can at the very least give you a free retake; also have the emails ready). If that doesn‚Äôt work, I recommend seeking legal advice as you could plausibly pursue damages (the prof‚Äôs actions/poor communication disrupted both your career path and in unfairly sabotaging your grade devalued the return on your tuition payment)"
13488,This happened to me last semester with a course.   I withdrew from the course and am now taking the same course with a different professor
13489,"A classmate of mine had missed a week of class last semester due to covid and was told by the professor that he needed to drop since he couldn‚Äôt take a practical that we had coming up. The professor said it would be too late for him and that he wasn‚Äôt able to set everything back up later on(which was complete bs). I thought he should fight it, but he dropped anyhow. I don‚Äôt get why some professors are handling covid in this way when there was so much understanding at the beginning. They had all that training to help people online, yet they are completely throwing that away. Not to mention, their absence policies make no sense. The professors at my school say you are given 3 days of absences and that‚Äôs it. Then the school comes out and says you need to quarantine for 10 days. Make it make senseü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.If they‚Äôd just put stuff online, there wouldn‚Äôt be such an issue.

Fight this cause this person must be out of it. I know when I had covid way back when it first started, I was so confused and had bad brain fog. I hope that‚Äôs just what this person is going through and doesn‚Äôt have some kind of issue with you."
13490,"there's an office you can go to in order to refute what your professor is doing. mine is the student affairs office, try there?"
13491,Hope you post an update I'm curious to see how this turns out.
13492,"Yes I have them, I even attached the original email in case he forgot. That's when he told me to drop the entire course and leave. I even asked for help on where the homework and lectures were posted to try and make them up. He didn't even bother. Just basically gave me a big fat fuck you."
13493,"This could be illegal if you're in a two party consent state, but also unneeded. OP has everything in email form"
13494,That is not allowed. Please send all evidence you have to the head of the department.
13495,Update ?
13496,"Even just the language of telling a student ""you're too far gone"" is absurd and he should be fired. Nevermind telling you to drop the class and arbitrarily lowering your grade because he feels like it.  People like this should never be teaching even a pre school class."
13497,"Especially since most schools are explicitly telling faculty they \*must\* accommodate students that are sick with COVID.

I don't know a single school that isn't struggling with enrollment right now. The absolutely last thing your school will want is for students to randomly get kicked out of school because their professor isn't being even minimally accommodating for a medical absence."
13498,Still haven't heard back...
13499,Visit him and ask for explanation. Also maybe record the sound with your phone
13500,"Yeah that's bullshit. I wouldn't know who exactly to talk to about this, but I would say just talk to someone. Administer, department head, the freaking dean. Just don't give up, fight and fight well."
13501,review bomb their ratemyprofessor every few weeks
13502,You need to go to the department chair
13503,"I was with one of my friends who was on the cusp of failing chem 112, she had a full mental break down in the middle of the test. She started crying about how hard it was and left the room. She wound up with a 5% on her final and had to retake the class. She almost jumped off the roof of a parking garage."
13504,my friend and i both cried for like an hour after a physics exam not realizing we get curved
13505,A kid in a Calc 2 class at my school once flipped out during a midterm and started screaming ‚ÄúYOU DIDN‚ÄôT TEACH US THIS‚Äù and ‚ÄúTHIS IS WAY TOO HARD‚Äù at the proctor (who wasn‚Äôt even the professor lol) before barreling out the door crying.
13506,"I had this happen in my calc 1 class.

Due was a good friend of mine, still is. But just in the middle of the midterm, got up and said ""you know what, this ain't for me. I'm not intelligent enough to-do this. MyGoddamnFeet and I have been studing for this, which i appreciate. Thanks buddy. But I just dont get it, im going to go paint airplanes for Boeing."" and walked out.

&#x200B;

He's now making 175k a year painting and building airplanes for them, so maybe he was right. He was a good guy, just had some issues, PTSD from service, and was stressed about it."
13507,one of my classmates forgot she had her statistics exam this morning. she was losing her mind
13508,"Not sure what her grade was, but I was taking a test in an Abnormal Psych class that had an interesting occurrence. I believe it was the midterm, and the test was structured as like 20 multiple choice questions, and then 5 short answer questions (The short answer we‚Äôre supposed to be about a page each). I was about done and the woman next to me stands to turn in her exam. Important to note that there were maybe 5 minutes left of class. I see the professor‚Äôs eyes grow wide as he explains that the assignment was to write 1 page on each of the 5 topics, not 5 pages on 1 of the topics. I don‚Äôt know what happened to her."
13509,"While being a TA (in person) these two students were very clearly and obviously cheating alongside another. Professor didn't say anything to them but as soon as one of them walked up to hand in their exams the professor took it, and just failed them on the spot and told them they would be hearing from them ( this wasn't the first time).

Dude totally flipped out and started asking what was going to happen, saying sorry over again and if he could have another chance before being asked to leave. When I walked out of the class to take group A exams to be graded he was sitting on a bench crying."
13510,I did only 2 hours in the rainüëç
13511,Bruh was the teacher not in the room? They could‚Äôve talked to your friend‚Ä¶
13512,"I know a guy that had a 4.0 back in community college and was a very confident person. He was boarder line cocky. We were similar majors and schedules so we had a few classes (three) together. He would always sit near me because he knew I was serious (although I wasn‚Äôt the smartest in the class). We took a philosophy class together for our last class. He was miserable through the whole thing, he couldn‚Äôt grasp something that wasn‚Äôt math or physical. He said he spent 30 hours studying for this specific class. By the end he got a B and felt like a failure. I‚Äôm not even kidding he dropped out of college and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs working at Starbucks right now. The only reason I knew he dropped out is because it was our LAST semester before we got our Associates degree and he wasn‚Äôt on the list. Crazy too because the guy had a 4.0 and wanted to go to Harvard. I‚Äôm guessing he didn‚Äôt think he could get in with 1 B during his college career."
13513,"I'm a new instructor, so maybe I don't have enough experience as a seasoned professor.

But I'm see students literally killing themselves trying to get good grades: a student still trying after having emergency heart surgery twice, a student who had a cardiac event and was trying to work from the hospital, a student who had postpartum depression and just barely gave enough of a hint that there was something seriously wrong for me to catch when she was asking for an extension. In one semester.

It's here easier said than done, but there is not a single assignment or class that is more important than your mental and physical well-being."
13514,Someone in a philosophy final with like 300 people in the room unfortunately had a huge panic attack during the exam and paramedics had to come and take her out of the room
13515,"No teacher was absent, left to use the bathroom and couldn‚Äôt get a proctor for the 5 minutes he was gone."
13516,"Physics is the worst!

the highest score on our final in phys 2 (about 25 students) was a 61. the average was like a 30, and the prof sent out an email saying it was one of the best averages that class had gotten. graded on a curve for sure. 

He was an old school professor. Got hired back in the 61 and worked there until 2020, when he finally retired."
13517,Yeah she received counseling and go to therapy every month. She‚Äôs a lot better than she was.
13518,"Me, actually. It was the first class I had ever failed. I was physically sick for a week leading up to the final exam (I knew I was going to fail as I hadn‚Äôt done the homework). I was pale, clammy, nauseous, etc. I didn‚Äôt even realize it was because of the stress, I just thought I was sick. Anyway, I took the exam, got a 45, and, as soon as I walked out of the building, all of the sickness went away. It was out of my hands at that point. That was the time I learned that failure is often inevitable (especially when you don‚Äôt do much to avoid it) and that it‚Äôs okay. I wish I could say I learned something good from that experience, but all I learned is that I can handle failure and I‚Äôve done it more times. Slowly getting better, though! Passed all my classes last semester:)"
13519,"A curve is when the grade of everyone in the class is changed, usually based on the class average for either a test/assignment or the overall grade for the class at the end of a semester. Usually curves can only positively affect a grade but rarely professors will lower grades, which is typically viewed as unfair."
13520,Tell her to immediately go to student health and fake sick.
13521,Rain remorse is the best kind of remorse. Contemplating under the clouds
13522,Going to sound a bit extreme but I def have contemplated falling off the grid. Failing is hard for me to accept.
13523,"My teacher had a policy where you needed to stay for the entire class on test days. Even if you finished early, you had to stay in class. This was because afterward we passed around the tests and graded your neighbors. So anyway this policy was extremely clear, she said it multiple times, it was in the syllabus, she even said it right before handing out the test. Well this one guy turns in his test and leaves and the second the door closes the teacher rips his test in half in front of everyone.   


An even funnier thing about that is this guy was in a group project and had exchanged phone numbers with the group but was ignoring their texts and blowing them off and had been since the start of the project. So the group texted him to tell him his test got ripped up and he responded for the first time in weeks ""WHAT?!"" This is the only time I was happy to see someone fail."
13524,Maybe he was right? He was dead on lol
13525,"Oh, lord. I really hope the professor gave her extra time."
13526,"A girl who was clearly premed in my Organic Chemistry 2 class failed a midterm, apparently dropping her grade to a C- and she bascially got up and started yelling at our professor that he was out to get her and ruining her chances of getting into medical school. As she packed up her stuff very aggressively she stormed out and yelled ""My dad is going to sue you"" 

we never saw her again."
13527,"I don't really feel bad for him. 

Like the first time getting caught cheating, maybe i can understand that reaction. It's a big deal, but don't cheat.

But if it wasn't their first time getting caught, that's on them. If your going to play with a lit match, don't get pissy when it burns you."
13528,"Not a falling grade, but during a test I saw a girl completely freak out saying things like ""it's too hard."" ""I can't do it.""

 Kinda felt bad that school was causing this poor girl to have a complete breakdown during her test."
13529,"It means that the teacher shifts everyone's grade up if everyone did very badly. Like if everyone in the class got a 50% or lower, then the grade would be curved so that 50% (being the highest) is an A, 40% B, and so on.

To me, it means the teacher is not so bueno"
13530,Had a friend have a full mental breakdown when he made his first C ever.
13531,"I remember him distinctly handing it back to her and saying, see what you get get down about the other 4 topics in the remaining time."
13532,"pretty sad that someone‚Äôs so wrapped up around academics, that he didn‚Äôt think he could get into harvard with one B. hope he‚Äôs doing well."
13533,"For some reason this semester *all* my assignments are due at really odd times like this. I wish I understood why, it‚Äôs difficult to keep track of lol. If you can get it done the day before and just submit early that helps a lot, I know at least my brain is too accustomed to things being due at midnight so I try to simulate that."
13534,[deleted]
13535,"One of my professors has our assignments due ‚Äúbefore dawn the next morning,‚Äù or ‚Äúbefore I wake up and check my computer.‚Äù He‚Äôs a chill dude."
13536,The professor may have set the due time when it is convenient for them to grade. They could also set the time because that is when they are available for students who have last minute questions before submissions. They could also set it that time because 1) most students will wait until the last minute to submit and 2) most other classes will have the same deadline so they are tired of getting work for a different class submitted to them and then having to deal with getting it late etc.
13537,"LMAOOOO, one of my professors has his assignments due at 11:59 AM... like tf"
13538,"As much as I'd like to do this, sometimes it's aost impossible to complete assignments the day before their due, whether it be due to job, other workload or simply just life deciding to flip me off."
13539,"If they have a due date like that, I just make sure I do it by midnight the night before. Saves the hassle and you won‚Äôt be rushed all morning."
13540,looks like my mans forgot to change the AM to PM lol
13541,I like pairing this with the comment that said some teachers set the time to reflect when they like to grade the assignments.
13542,..... tomorrow
13543,I can‚Äôt do that. I work with pressure so have to wait the due date. :(
13544,I have assignments oddly due at 3 and 4 in the morning.
13545,"While she wasn't printing stuff, I really appreciated the one professor who had a Saturday 8 am due date.

She *SAID* her due date was Friday, ""but I'm *usually* not up at 2 am grading, so don't rush just to get it in. If you're a night owl I don't want you at a disadvantage."""
13546,"Had her a while ago, but my psych 101 prof was like this.

""I'm not (usually) up at 2 am grading, why do you need it submitted by then?"""
13547,"Mine too, I always have to triple check bc it will be like 2pm or 7:15 am like WHAT"
13548,I actually like things due in the morning cause it means you can pull an all nighter before its due.
13549,Same. I also set my class times as five minutes before they actually are so that I‚Äôm not late as often
13550,The same teacher then has assignments due at 6 and 11 at night.
13551,"I have a whiteboard up on my wall that spans the entire wall. I write all my weekly assignments on it with their dates and times in large lettering. I'm pretty much forced to look at it. 

Regardless, I still did miss an AM quiz I even wrote on that board. I guess my mind is used to seeing PM. 

So now I write it due as 11:59 PM the day before to trick myself into thinking it's due earlier."
13552,Procrastinators unite
13553,"My labs only meet every second week, one of my courses, the lab work is due the following week at the same time we would have had classes if we were meeting every week like we're supposed to. I just hand it in the day before, it's too risky that I'll lose track of time on the day."
13554,"You have to make your own deadlines. My deadline is always the 11 59 closest to the deadline. So that keeps everything in check and nothing gets crammed on one day. The reality is, its an illusion. They really want it at 11 59 pm the day before, but they set it to 10 30 so that if some students need it, they can stay up late and do it. The key is its there if you need it, not that you have to use it. When you get to college, you need to be able to do this because due dates will be random, like at 3 in the afternoon or other random times. A lot are due at 11 59, but a lot are also do when class starts, so you need to hold yourself accountable. In addition, if they were to make it due at 11 59, you would be losing 10.5 hours because they would not make it due that same day, but the night before. If you can't stick to that schedule, that's on you."
13555,"One of my class grades got fucked because of this, I thought it was due at midnight and it‚Äôs 7PM, what the hell? I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing it earlier but it wasn‚Äôt clear at all."
13556,"Personally if I have any due date that isnt 11:59pm, like I have some assignments due at 8am, I just turn it in the day before so I‚Äôm never confused and never forget to turn it in"
13557,"..... are you in my class, or do I have some long lost twin?"
13558,Yep... my fluids professor does the same thing
13559,this happened to me too but it was due at 3pm. I've got an F+ in the class and if I don't pass it will genuinely throw my whole future plan off track.
13560,Dude literally just had this problem. My bio professor had all his due dates at 11:59pm (like for the entire semester thus far) then this week for some reason he put it as 12:59am so I missed them.
13561,I have one class that‚Äôs 5pm due dates and another that is 11:59pm and this post actually reminded me of that one as I have 1.5 hours left to respond to 2 people. Thank you OP
13562,"This is great advice, especially right now where everything is online for most of us. If we get stuff done ahead of time it saves our ass if the internet goes down or the computer gives us the blue screen of death."
13563,"I had a situation where one of my requirements was not met, turns out I needed a diversity credit, despite taking multiple classes that definitely should've met that requirement, I wasnt told about it til towards the end of Spring 2020. Luckily I was able to take the class in the summer quarter and now have my AA degree from my community college as I head to my University."

13565,"Glad it all worked out for you, and best of luck at university!"
13566,"Definitely don‚Äôt tell your grad department.  If they haven‚Äôt checked by now, they won‚Äôt.  If you tell them, you compel them to look into it."
13567,"I had something slightly similar happen. I turned all my incomplete work in well before the deadline to my prof, find out after a few months, after COVID had already started, that my audit was still showing an incomplete, was told if it wasn‚Äôt changed soon, it would turn into an F. I freak out, email professor. She doesn‚Äôt respond, presumably because of COVID stuff. I manage to find a mobile number of her‚Äôs from Syllabus, I text that, she says that she already submitted it, but will submit it again, but it still hasn‚Äôt been changed even after back and forth with prof, she claims she sent the grade update stuff multiple times but after a few months, it still hasn‚Äôt shown up. Registrar isn‚Äôt answering my emails still. It was a Gen Ed course."
13568,"This! Unless the requirements of your Graduate Programs specifically allow students without UG degrees, it will cause a problem. Eventually the GR program will go through and request final transcripts from all new students to complete their records. Beside wanting to confirm students graduated, they like to compile the information for demographics and advertising the program."
13569,"This happened to me sort of! About 10 years ago, I had registered under the 2008-2009 curriculum. In spring 2011, I was told I couldn‚Äôt graduate because I didn‚Äôt satisfy the curriculum. Turns out that the advisor never turned in the paperwork that year, but did the next academic year, so the curriculum changed. They ended up honoring it after looking at the scanned original that was submitted for the wrong year. It was ridiculous and probably would have been easier to just take the extra semester but I had to stand up for myself."
13570,"Same thing happened to my brother only instead of going to a graduate school, he became a commisioned officer in the Navy. The Navy temporarily halted his orders and stationed him near his old school to take the one course he thought he didn't need in order to get his diploma that once again he was assured he was getting because he had graduated supposedly.

He met his now wife during that time and is now a commander O5 with my three nieces."
13571,Thanks!!
13572,"Did you meet the graduation requirements, or not?"
13573,"My friend had all of her credits in line to graduate in May 2019. She found out in the late fall of 2018 that one of her classes had not counted towards a requirement according to her student catalog. She would have to take a class over the summer to graduate. She decided to study abroad and make the most of it. While abroad, she found out that the school had messed up again and told her that the wrong class would count. She had gotten it in writing but apparently that wasn‚Äôt enough. She had to take an online class in Fall 2019 to finally graduate in September."
13574,Yikes. COVID sure has made navigating these issues all the more complicated! Hope you figure it out! I was able to get ahold of an on-call registrar and they will confer by degree asap. TG for people fixing their mistakes.
13575,"Yeah alot of teachers pushed grades back and had one teacher submit my grades on the day of deadline in spring. He didnt even respond to anyones emails on grades. 

As of now teachers are submitting grades as I turn in assignments for this semester. So if i submit an assignment today, ill get the grade by today."
13576,I work for a university and we will retroactively add students to graduation if it was a university error that kept them from graduating. You might want to push this if it wasn't your fault at all.
13577,"I know advisors have a lot going on, but when they‚Äôre messing with their students‚Äô lives, they should consider stepping up a bit. The course that caused my issue was a rear a research course with my advisor. Eyeroll"
13578,um your grad school might care about this matter. yikes.
13579,"I ‚Äúgraduated,‚Äù and walked before my final grades were released, as many grads do. I knew I had passed all my final classes so I wasn‚Äôt worried. 

Moved out, left for a 3 months summer grad trip. 

Get back home to a message from the admin office saying I will not be receiving my diploma because they never received my final grade for my last neuro lab. 

I basically asked how that was my problem and that I am aware that I passed and finished the course. 

They told me I had to come to campus and locate the professor and tell them to submit my grade by the end of the week or I won‚Äôt get a degree.

Are you fucking kidding me?!?

Thankfully I only lived ~7 hours away, so I drove there, literally searched the campus. Found a grad student lingering in the lab rooms who I didn‚Äôt know. Was able to convince them to somehow locate this professor. Professor wouldn‚Äôt see me, but apparently would submit my grade by the end of the day per grad student. 

They did, thankfully. I received my degree and diploma, but I seriously couldn‚Äôt fucking believe that shit. 

This was at UC Santa Barbara Btw. Fuck that school."
13580,"Yup, take this one to the top. You might have to make threats to get your way. If you talk to enough people you will eventually find someone willing to help."
13581,Contact the provost.
13582,"What in the actual hell? Had they asked me to appear in person for whatever reason, I would have went Full Karen on ‚Äòem. 

Shit, I‚Äôm glad you got that all sorted out. And good to know UCSB‚Äôs integrity hasn‚Äôt changed much. 

PS: hope you celebrated graduation x2!"
13583,"Yep, I filled an old processor in and he took it to the top for me overnight. They will be granting the degree for the semester I would‚Äôve graduated had they not screwed up."
13584,Missed your update. Congrats on graduating!
13585,[deleted]
13586,Yep. Well over the requirements. I have it all worked out though!
13587,"Yes, all taken care of now! Thanks!"
13588,"My transcripts were sent with my initial application, but due to COVID I believe my grad school just assumed my UG uni was slow on conferring? I really can‚Äôt speak for ‚Äòem though."
13589,Done. Hopefully they reply.
13590,"Haha yeah I did for sure! I was just shocked it became my responsibility to make sure my grade was submitted, months after the class was finished. I was very upset, and worried. But it‚Äôs all good now. 

They still call me for donations. üòÇ"
13591,Thanks so much! I guess I should celebrate or something!
13592,Great job.
13593,Fantastic! I started grad school when I was 35. Good luck! And have fun!
13594,That‚Äôs freakin awesome!!
13595,"That's good to hear. Congrats!! When I took my placement exam, I barely passed by .1 points. English composition should be really easy, just use Purdue owl and you'll be fine."
13596,That‚Äôs great! Congratulations! Come join us on r/BacktoCollege
13597,That's great!!! :)
13598,congrats!
13599,Congratulations! Cheers!
13600,congrats and good luck!!
13601,So happy for you! You will do great!!
13602,Congrats!!!
13603,Congratulations Great future ahead of you
13604,Congratulations my friend!! Proud of you!
13605,I'm so glad we have to write peer reviews on our partners in my classes with group projects.
13606,Perfectly said!
13607,"This behavior honestly annoys me so much. I‚Äôd probably send him one more email letting him know that he‚Äôs not going to receive any credit if he doesn‚Äôt pull his weight at all. If he still doesn‚Äôt do anything then forget about him. This is college and you‚Äôre not his mom. Yes it might reflect poorly on the project if some things aren‚Äôt done but you have proof to show your professor that you didn‚Äôt receive help. 

You can only do so much so don‚Äôt kill yourself trying to complete a project all by yourself. Do what you can and let your professor know that you literally didn‚Äôt have any help at all."
13608,Is this instructor having students do group evaluations afterwards? I had a group project that I did everything for and I totally blasted my group. I'm pretty sure they all got at least one letter grade less than me. They deserved to fail though so I don't feel bad.
13609,"Respectfully, my teacher received an email."
13610,This. And keep the receipts to send to your Professor.
13611,Show this exchange to your professor.
13612,That's what one of my friends did when a teammate wasn't contributing anything in the project work
13613,"Do it, yell at them. You have no obligation to be nice to someone who‚Äôs a slacker. Remind them that you hold their grades in your hand."
13614,"I wish this was standard. I had an awful group project this semester for one of my classes and thought that the review would be the saving grace, but my professor told us to review each other in our group and submit the scores after deciding together. Like bro what the point?"
13615,This is why unregulated group projects suck ass. There better be an evaluation.
13616,At that point I was over it because I did 90% of the project and all he had to do was write a summary. He didn‚Äôt want to do it and now I‚Äôm doing it on my own
13617,Sent a sweet little email to my teacher explaining the situation because it wasn‚Äôt fair at all !
13618,This is why I always make the documents and slide shows for group projects. I have the editing history and everything at my disposal.
13619,Sometimes you just have to. Helping out and picking up slack is fine. People just flaking and leaving you to do all of their work is not. Good for you
13620,"take his name out and present the project as your own, make sure to let the professor know either in person or through email that he didn‚Äôt contribute to the project"
13621,"If someone takes being told to do their part as being douchey, they have a problem. If they are walking into college expecting to be coddled, they're in for a big surprise. Being cordial and respectful should obviously be the go-to approach, but there comes a point where there is work that needs to be done and there is no option left but to be direct with the slackers."
13622,I‚Äôve had this happen and let the instructor know there was no participation from other group members and they didn‚Äôt get the grade from project. Just show the messages that‚Äôs what i did
13623,Did the same thing to one of the guys in my eval. Everyone did equal work but one guy was MIA until 12 hours before the due date.
13624,Can't believe people don't grow out of this mindset after the 5th grade lol
13625,Omg the nerve of this guy. What does he want you to take every class with him so he doesn‚Äôt have to work? What a jerk! What really annoys me is we bust our ass off for as and then these c students get the same degree we do. The only thing that‚Äôs different is a gpa but after a few years at work it doesn‚Äôt matter unless grad school. He might even get the same salary as you or even make more over his lifetime.
13626,"In the middle of a group project horror story myself, they remind me why I hate people"
13627,Wish it was going better‚Ä¶ today a girl copy and pasted from a website onto a slide and called it a day and then another person has been MIA so going great!
13628,"Since you have more time than me, finish my degree"
13629,"Yes, but that's their problem. If you're in college and can't sort yourself out, you will have to face the consequences like an adult. Everyone is working to get an education and get the hell out, people aren't looking to do you favours because you're lazy or entitled. Do whatever you want, but don't complain to me when the professor finds out about it, because my grade depends on this."
13630,"Do the graph and completely write him off for the project. Email your professor and take screenshots. 
He deserves a 0, he did nothing."
13631,I'll do it email the night before and show screenshot and photos of the peer not doing anything
13632,"Yes, but other students are not responsible for taking steps to teach them how to be responsible. And this isn't naive, ""oh, I didn't know"" behaviour, this is ""I'm lazy and entitled and I want you to do the work for me to get an easy A"" behaviour. 

Also, sending a text like ""since you have more time than me, why don't you just do it?"" is incredibly entitled and rude, and it's not acceptable anywhere. I'm assuming that someone in college would have completed high school, so they should've already learned that this behaviour just doesn't pass. 

I know you're trying to be understanding and give them the benefit of the doubt, but some people just don't deserve it."
13633,And this is one of the reasons I chose to do a final project by myself when the teacher gave us the option to work solo or in a team. I still remember how the group projects from high school went.
13634,"Email the professor

And also let your group member know that the copy pasted slide will 100% come back as plagiarism

Doesn't hurt to include a breakdown of what slides everyone did, so that way it's shown that you actually did your slide(s) in case your group member doesn't fix their slide"

13646,I did not know letterman jackets were still a thing. I haven't seen one of those since the late 80s

13663,gotta take the pic with a sign now
13664,He'll quickly learn that absolutely not a single person at college thinks high school letterman jackets are cool
13665,"It happened to me twice‚Äîfreshman year. Professor really thought of themselves as a figure of authority. I took it to the dean, and he changed his attitude real quick. I'm not paying to have someone tell me I can't go to the restroom when nature calls. The second situation happened during a zoom lecture. Really buddy? I have you on speaker. I can hear you loud and clear when I'm in the comfort of my bathroom."
13666,Respond ‚Äúimpending menstrual problem‚Äù very loudly regardless of perceived gender
13667,"I‚Äôve had professors where they didn‚Äôt allow you to take a restroom break, some are weird"
13668,"As a professor who has to pee a lot, I would never say something like that to someone or make people feel like they can‚Äôt step out for a minute. The only time I‚Äôd become concerned is if someone was doing it 5-6 times a class, but that‚Äôs only ever happened once, and that‚Äôs when you pull the person aside after class and ask if everything is okay.

The only other time I‚Äôve said something is about ten minutes into the first class, we were going over the syllabus, and a student packed up and started walking out. I joked, ‚ÄúOh, no! Am I that annoying already?‚Äù Turns out, they were in the wrong class. But going to the bathroom? Yeah, no. You do you, boo! Don‚Äôt fall in, and we‚Äôll be here when you get back."
13669,"Ugh, authoritarian profs are the worst, and I say this as a prof myself."
13670,Lol they're gonna tell you you can't pee in your own bathroom?
13671,When I was in HS I would inform the teacher that I had IBS  in front of the whole class that would really shut them up for the year.
13672,"LOL what? These professors man, really think they're high in authority. This person was really gonna tell you that you cannot use your own restroom in YOUR own house. üòÇüòÇ"
13673,Say that you have in fact just defecated in your own pants.
13674,"I would do that, but just straight up say ‚ÄúMy vagina is bleeding.‚Äù or something. 

I‚Äôm have Menorrhagia so I have to change every hour. If I‚Äôm taking Advil, I have to change every two hours. 

I mean if the prof wants me to stain everything I sit on, that‚Äôs fine by me, they just gotta let me know."
13675,"Never had this happened but I did have a professor in undergrad in my sophomore year who I had two classes with that semester who yelled in the middle of class ‚Äúshe has an energy drink‚Äù or ‚Äúshe has a coffee‚Äù and would proceed to tell the whole class how caffeine is bad and if I continue to drink it I will die early. This professor also was known to criticize people‚Äôs appearances ie. Tell them they are fat, skinny, tired, ‚Äúdepressed looking‚Äù, pimples, etc. in class for instance once he said to me that ‚Äúshe has a bunch of pimples on her face she needs to do something about that or the men will chase after her because she is fertile.‚Äù As if acne has anything to do with fertility. Another thing that made me feel very uncomfortable with this professor was how when I went to his office to ask about a paper I wrote  he made the comment ‚Äúyou are a very beautiful woman‚Äù and then closed the door. As a woman I have dealt with sexual harassment my whole life but by far this was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I‚Äôve had. One of my other professors the office over could obviously tell when I walked out of there that I was uncomfortable and invited me in her office. Anytime I would be in his office after that incident I would open the door even if he closed it and my other professor walked past often while I was there which made me feel safer. It stills bothers me to this day that other students and my other professors have to probably face the same harassment if not worse from this man almost every day."
13676,"Oof. What a jackass of a prof. Also let an admin know prof is trying to drop students like that. Most state school profs don‚Äôt actual have that power anymore. We NEED retention to survive. Plus, the movement for professors to start treating students with kindness and respect is underway. And torch the shit out of that hack in the student evals. DM me for tricks you can do in the student evals that will raise eyebrows."
13677,Luckily I never had that. I hope you know to ignore him and piss when you want.
13678,That‚Äôs how you know when a professor thinks they‚Äôre teaching in high school
13679,"Legally, the professor can‚Äôt stop you from leaving class early or temporarily like going to the bathroom. Even if he were to threaten you like saying he will drop you from the class, he can‚Äôt. I personally haven‚Äôt had a professor like that yet, and I feel bad for you."
13680,I had a professor who took away our participation points for the day if we had to use the bathroom or get water during class...
13681,"Yea, it's also one thing if someone just gets up but leaves their stuff vs packs up and leaves altogether. I would totally get a professor being annoyed if students started leaving halfway through class, but stopping students from going to the bathroom is ridiculous."
13682,"I was also a student a UW school. My professor basically had me tell the entire class why I missed the last class, DESPITE ME SENDING HIM AN EMAIL THAT DAY I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A KIDNEY STONE THAT DAY. 

He knew where I was, I think he just wanted to embarras me. 

Some professors just suck."
13683,What?! That‚Äôs so weird. I‚Äôve never had professors question if students walked out for a second...
13684,"My college campus is closed and everything is currently done online via zoom. Last semester i had a professor who held an optional zoom class. It was recorded and could be watched later. I atteneded live in case i had a question. The first class he asked that those of us who attended have our cameras on. Annoying, but i put clothes on anyways and turned it on. I work full-time and am taking classes part-time. When i get home i wwnt to relax and do my school work. So for this particular class i was half laying on my couch jotting down notes from his lecture. 20 minutes in he says me name and tells me to sit up straight during his class. Told me i would better be able to pay attention and take notes that way. I'm 30 years old and I'm paying for this class. If i wanna lay on my couch in my apartment while you talk about the difference between WAN and LAN, I should be able to. So i never attended another zoom class of his after that one."
13685,">participation points

üòê"
13686,"I'm a junior in a mixed grade English class, it's a core class so we have freshman to seniors. My professor won't let students, especially freshmen, go to the bathroom during lecture or it's marked as a partial attendance. After 3 partial attendances it's an absence. He claims that his lectures, which are no more than him ranting about The Odyssey/The Illiad, are too important to miss a minute of.

He adressed us recently about how class went from ~20 people in person and 2 over zoom to about less than 8 people in person and over 14 people on zoom. He has no clue that his strict class policies makes no one want to come to class."
13687,Amen. Just let those students live their gd lives!
13688,"Yikes, that's definitely something to report. Especially if another professor can corroborate."
13689,"You don't even have to share such information with your professor. You can share that you were hospitalized, and offer documentation, but are not required to share your protected health information. What he did violates both FERPA and  HIPAA. I hope you reported him to his department chair and the Dean of Students."
13690,Right? The dude doesn't pay a single bill at my place and wants to talk to me about not taking a dump in my own toilet? Please spare me ü§£
13691,"‚ÄúSorry boss, gotta take a shit.‚Äù That shuts em up 9/10 times."
13692,I read that as potty power play
13693,Professors keeping attendance grades at all is ridiculous.
13694,"I've noticed that shit like this happens most with freshmen classes. These kids are fresh out of high school, are 17/18 years old and a lot of professors don't see them as adults, they see them as children. 

I know that, as a senior, if a professor told me I couldn't go to the bathroom, I'd laugh and walk right out. I know several people who would say ""fuck that"" and walk out."
13695,I kinda feel like I started feeling the effects of post graduation at the end of my 3rd year mostly just because we've all been home and not at university. It all feels like university was just a dream and nothing really happened. Adulting is hard.
13696,Are we really gonna love it? Please tell me this crushing anxiety and stress is worth it once getting into the real world
13697,Honestly my graduation ceremony was boring as hell. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there after it ended lmao
13698,"It can definitely feel anticlimactic, but things start to pick up and get a lot more exciting when you realize that you have so many directions to choose from. You can take time to pursue your more hobby-like passions, you can travel, you can look into job searching and fall into a position that ends up being the perfect fit...the graduation itself is anticlimactic, but it's the signifier that you're free to do basically whatever your resources allow you to do."
13699,"For mine they had us stand in line and go through like cattle. No music, no ceremony, nothing. Get in line, get your degree, go home."
13700,Welcome to adult life!
13701,Not when you're studying in a college with dry campus. You'll get charged even for having a can of beer in your room.
13702,This is a bit condescending...they may have been waist deep in adult life for years
13703,"I didn't attend my graduation. I've never been a fan of ceremony. It seemed boring and pointless to me, and my family lived to far away to realistically go, so I didn't. I borrowed a cap and gown from a friend for pictures to satisfy my mom and that was it. It didn't feel like an accomplishment, but an expectation I was mandated to complete. 

But I suppose that graduation is as much for your family as it is you, or moreso. I can see why people sit and suffer and walk across the stage for someone other than themselves."
13704,Thanks I guess
13705,Lol that‚Äôs lame at least I got bagpipes
13706,"That‚Äôs how I felt with highschool grad. 4 whole years of memories and experiences and it was ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a 3 hour ceremony, the end, move on now‚Äù"
13707,"Well, of course it is. Graduation isn't for *you*! It's for your family and other loved ones.

You walk across a stage so the audience can see you receive your diploma and pose for photos that your parents will buy at exorbitant cost because it's all *they* have to show for your time there. If it weren't for them then you could just get your diploma sent in the mail, which plenty do."
13708,"I'm class of 2020, so I recently experienced what you're going through. It's simultaneously anticlimactic and overwhelming."
13709,That‚Äôs a nice way to put it üôÇ
13710,"Yes, I‚Äôm glad I went for the closure but that‚Äôs pretty much it. It felt final but it wasn‚Äôt fun or anything."
13711,"You got to see your friends again, you got to enjoy a good meal with them afterwards. That's awesome! I know that society and the media paints this unfair portrait of graduation as this insanely hyped, unbelievable event. Maybe in your reality, it's not that extravagant, but at the same time, remember the fact that it did happen and it served as a formal transition into the next part of your life!

""Expectations are the thief of joy"""
13712,And that's why my friend we usually don't have graduation ceremonies in German universities. You go to an office and pick up your degree üòé
13713,Ha
13714,"I don't have money and as an international student, I'd get deported if I worked off-campus."
13715,Fuck that. I really hope i finish my bachelor's this year. Hate bleeding money as i  been doing for the past 3 years getting nothing in return. I don't even feel like i learned anything at all. Guess my major. üòÇ
13716,Yes. Now sink into depression that lasts until death with the realization that you just completed the tutorial and now life begins.
13717,I was happy bc my family was there and very proud of me :) I dropped out for a little bit after my sophomore year and I graduated hs like a month late so I never got to walk at a graduation. But I also had gotten my second covid shot the day before so I felt like utter shit and went back to bed as soon as I got home lol. I think I had the ‚Äúok now what‚Äù moment sometime this past week once I realized it might take me a while to actually land a job and that I have this free time that I‚Äôm not sure what to do with
13718,Thanks? Sorry.
13719,"After I graduated, I went back to my schools homecoming that fall. A friend and I cried in an old mentors office about how much we hated grad school and felt lonely and didn‚Äôt know how to make friends post college. We asked her if it gets better.

She said, and I quote, ‚Äúit gets better but it never gets good.‚Äù

And that is the most true thing I‚Äôve ever heard in my life to date."
13720,[deleted]
13721,"Honestly you‚Äôre paying 40k+ for 4 years of having profs read power points to you and last minute studying for tests. Uni is only really fun when your family is rich enough to let you get a dorm and an allowance. For me personally, I can‚Äôt wait till I gtfo."
13722,I didn't even have a ceremony so...
13723,"Yeah, I also felt a little hollow at my graduation. Well, the one that didn't get cancelled anyway. It does just fly by and then you're like ""wow, this is over""."
13724,Is your major philosophy?
13725,"it is! I wrote to a professor in Florida a few weeks ago about something outside my field (squarely in his discipline... I had his book in hand!) and he got back to me *within the hour*.

I can't guarantee thst everyone will respond so quickly, but this sort of openness and generosity is wild in the 21st century."
13726,"Am professor. If my options are: A) answer enthusiastic email inquiring about my research from a total stranger, or, B) answer email from a student asking a question addressed in the syllabus, I will always procrastinate using A as my excuse before getting to B. Same applies if B is ‚Äúpointless administrative busy work‚Äù or ‚Äúgrading handwritten essay questions.‚Äù"

13728,"If there's ever a paper you want that's behind a paywall, just email the corresponding author and ask if they'll send it to you. I don't get any of the purchase price, you bet I'll send you my paper for free!"
13729,I was writing my senior thesis and I emailed a professor about his work to see if he had any books he recommended. He emailed me back and also attached a soon to be published article he was writing. It was hands down one of the coolest things that happened to me in college and I got to brag about it in class!
13730,"I‚Äôm guessing he didn‚Äôt see it. I always tell my students that once I‚Äôve had them in class that they‚Äôre always my students, regardless of how long ago it was. I help at least one former student a year with something, even if it‚Äôs just pointing them in the right direction for what they need. I think most are similar, although you will find those who don‚Äôt want anything else to do with former students."
13731,"Absolutely! And if you want a copy of a paper, please email us. I'm always happy to send stuff for free or to talk about research. It's great to know someone is interested!"
13732,that's what i do. :)
13733,So true. A few years ago I emailed Gordon Wood after reading one of his books and he emailed me back like it was the most normal thing in the world. Awesome.
13734,Could it have gone to spam? A similar thing happened to me
13735,"I remember my senior year of high school, we had to write a ""large"" research paper of 20 pages. A buddy of mine was frustrated about how this excellent article, at least he could tell from the abstract, was behind a paywall, for get this, $20 just for 24 hour access. Our teacher told him to email whoever wrote the article, he did, and received the entire 70 page article in two hours."
13736,"Self published work isn‚Äôt peer reviewed, the bare minimum of scholarly work. The point of our writing is to advance the collective knowledge of humanity, not to get rich. Is it cool when someone writes an absolute game changing banger? Absolutely. Will it happen for most of us? No and that‚Äôs ok."
13737,"Totally! I emailed a researcher a question about their paper (it was some incredibly specific thing about like...secure cross-core debugging) and they got back to me on the same day talking about some of the hazards of my idea. Super helpful and so appreciated, totally helped me with my own research."
13738,"Not so wild to me for STEM, that's really the only way we can progress"
13739,"Too true. In fact, if you find a paper you need behind a paywall, you can usually email the author and they'll send you a copy of the paper for free. I did that three times while I was in college. All three times, they were absolutely delighted to send me a copy of their paper. I got the impression they were thrilled that someone had read it. LOL"
13740,"I love academics helping out! I honestly used my academic advisor as a therapist for a bit and was treated with nothing but kindness and respect. She is the most amazing women I have ever met and I don‚Äôt think I could ever underestimate her

13744,Why write articles and books that you don't get paid well for? Can't you just self publish and tell them to kick rocks?
13745,"I emailed the head of the Aerospace Technology department saying that I was interested in transferring and a question about it since all the representatives only talked about the pilot program. He responded in 40 minutes.

Edit: not many people go to that school for the Aerospace Technology department, mostly the pilot program and ATC program."

13747,"Yes, using open scholarship models this is actually happening. There are lots of peer reviewed journals that are open license."
13748,"Could you guys form groups and review each other's work before you publish it? Like there's gotta be a way to publish quality work without someone who isn't doing much work taking a huge cut. Also, if there were a financial incentive, I'm sure a much greater number of smart people would consider doing academic work. Usually smart people also want their work to earn them freedom credits."

13762,Good job üëç
13763,"I managed all A‚Äôs for the last 2 years of high school which is fairly manageable.. but college kicked my ass.

Thankfully for my first semester I‚Äôm on the same boat :) studied hard for finals and got all A‚Äôs except for an honors class that I thought I would fail, I got a B!"
13764,Good job!
13765,"Congrats! I ended up getting an A, B-, B+, and C- I ended up getting a B- in chemistry which I thought I was going to fail so I‚Äôm super happy atm"

13768,"I am a math major, and that is extremely honorable.  It is really easy to give up in math and switch your plan of study to avoid calc, but I commend you for you work ethic and perseverance.  I hope you get that A!"
13769,"From someone getting a PhD in math... We all have that course. Everyone of my friends, fellow students, and myself, have that course/topic that we just do not fucking understand.

You are not a moron, you just hit *that* class."
13770,"What's your degree? It's really not *that* bad, I just don't feel like I have enough time to properly understand the material. I think it's considerably easier than Calculus 2 was though. "
13771,"Oh weird, I'm surprised they don't make you take Calc 3. I'm Comp Sci so we only have to do Calc 1 & 2, but I enjoy math so I'm minoring in it. As much as it's difficult, it's way more fun than the rest of the calc series. We get to model some cool things, and it's interesting learning about level curves and gradients. Lots of contour maps!"
13772,Mech engineering
13773,"Congrats!! It's an immeasurable feeling! But it's a Damn good one. I took remedial algebra 3 times. The fourth I passed with an A and subsequently college algebra there after with an A. That was my proudest moment, holds nothing to getting my masters! And why I'm passionate about working with remedial students in college now. "
13774,"Math is just a language like many things, most people say they hate or that they suck at math because they never spent enough time to really see results of their hard work. But if you stick it out the higher up you get the easier it gets because it‚Äôs really similar to a triangle with algebra and geometric concepts at the base, trigonometry and precalculus in the middle and calculus and more abstract/theoretical concepts at the top"
13775,Definitely needed to hear this. Thanks man.
13776,"Even though I'm a freaking *hospitality* major, my school makes us take Calculus. I am registered for it this Fall and I'm scared shitless. I have absolutely no and I mean NO wiggle room with the rest of my classes up to graduation, so if I have to take it again I'll either need to pay to do it somewhere over the summer or do a whole entire extra semester (which I know I cannot afford).

I hate hate hate math and I am the worst at it. For example, I would've had a 36 on my ACT had it not been for my terrible math score... I got a 31 overall. So you can do the *math* and figure out how badly I had to fuck up that section even though I took the ACT 4 times.

;-;"
13777,Like I said it‚Äôs not a completely necessary course because it get covered in other courses
13778,But I‚Äôve been doing differential equations to get prepared for that class and I enjoy that a lot more than just straight calculus
13779,"If you don't already know about Professor Leonard, look on YouTube for his lectures. They are fantastic. He goes slow, explains clearly, doesn't skip steps. I couldn't have passed Calc 2 and 3 without him. Wish I had known about him for Calc 1, too. "
13780,"Thats definitely weird but I guess it makes some sense since you do go over Calc 3 in Physics 2, Statics, and Mechanics. "
13781,"Good for you man! That was one of the hardest classes I took in college, and the difficulty ultimately made me rethink my major. Way to go!"
13782,"Congrats! I'm retaking Calc 1 right now because I failed it the first time around. Got an 83% (A) on my first midterm as opposed to the 45% i got on it last semester, so things are looking up. Not excited to have to take calc 2 though"
13783,This is why I‚Äôm a web designer and not a software engineer now lol
13784,"I'm hitting it in Calc 1, and I think I might just be dumb. I keep getting tripped up on all the lower level math I've forgotten, like trig functions, logarithms, basic algebra, etc"
13785,It's not so bad really. Content is easier than calc 2 imo.
13786,"How do I approach the pyramid if I had to take algebra/geometry twice, never took trig or precalc, and have to jump into college calc? 

I think I need to get a tutor ://"
13787,"I‚Äôd say try anything and everything you can. I try going on YouTube a lot and that works for me,  but if books are better for you then go that route, tutoring helps too but no one is perfect and I‚Äôve found that some tutors will unknowingly give you bad information or info that‚Äôs not 100% accurate and that can hurt you on a test, not saying all tutors are that way but they‚Äôre human like the rest of us and what works for them won‚Äôt necessarily work for you.

I like professor Dave explains because he breaks things down easy and professor leonard because he is very very well versed on advanced math and his videos are just recordings of his classes at the university."
13788,"If I get a C I‚Äôll be so happy because the calculus I‚Äôm taking right now is hard as shit. Not to mention going to tutoring and these guys make it seem so simple and say things like, it‚Äôs really way, all you have to do is follow the formula and what not."
13789,An 83% is an A at your school? I‚Äôm jealous
13790,Great work! Congrats
13791,"Failed it with an F my first time, second time passed with a B+"
13792,Retook calculus. Looks like I‚Äôll be retaking thermodynamics. Not the end of the world 
13793,Senior ME here. I‚Äôm shocked you aren‚Äôt required to take Calc 3. By ‚Äúcovered‚Äù do you mean briefly looked over in class as part of other units or taught standalone as a separate unit? They‚Äôre kinda doing you a disservice by not having you take it.
13794,Yea im not sure how you'd derive gauss law properly or voltage integral without proper integration techniques 
13795,You are a winner in my book for sticking with it and not giving up ... kudos to you!
13796,"Honestly, congratulations dude!! Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself because sometimes it could be just a shitty professor who doesn‚Äôt know how to teach the material right. Had this occur in my Finance class where the professor was awful at teaching and many students failed the exams and contacted the Dean. Sometimes, it‚Äôs really not your fault :)"
13797,I dropped out of college in 2009 because in large part of math. Im back now after leaving the military and in calculus. Fuck math. 
13798,No I think they‚Äôre still acting like college students. The average person from my experience only really matures once they hit senior year. Obviously some mature earlier and some later but yeah people generally stop acting like children at around 21. Some never stop.
13799,"I think it helps once you get into major specified courses. Then you meet people with similar goals and interests, who actually want to do well in class. 

General Ed classes are full of a wide array of students with all different kinds of motivations and goals. A lot of them are kids who are forced to go to college after high school in order to live with their parents or because of some other outside pressure, so they don‚Äôt give a f*ck and act out because they don‚Äôt really want to be there."
13800,"I‚Äôm a 27yo undergrad surrounded by younger folks, and there was a rumor in my class that I was sleeping with the TA. It made me uncomfortable, totally burned my bridges with the TA, and stressed me to the point where I didn‚Äôt want to be at school anymore. 

I thought I left this drama behind almost a decade ago"
13801,Listen to High School Never Ends by Bowling for Soup
13802,"From a grad student and TA's perspective, this year has been pretty bad undergrad-wise.

A huge thing has been that freshmen this year have been out of school (online) for nearly 2 years now.

At least in the classes I am teaching, the result is that most are not just relatively unprepared, but also lacking a lot of social skills. In general, acting like the last year they had in-person, which was their junior year in high school.

FWIW, I teach an intro level course, but in a fairly advanced topic. A lot of the students this year have none of the requisite knowledge that is critical to understanding the course material, to the point that our department is going to add rather significant prerequisite courses to it this coming year (intro to comp sci and physics will be required)."
13803,"Sorry that happened to you. Being older can already be ostracizing enough as it is without the drama.

At this point I‚Äôm keeping my head down and hoping I don‚Äôt have to deal with stuff like this when I‚Äôm in graduate school."
13804,High School Never Ends by Bowling for Soup enters
13805,"What's funny to me is that my high school *never* had any cliques whatsoever, and here they're endemic. I can't get involved with any group of people without passing some nonverbal test or being ""approved"" by them, its just cliquey bullshit which is super annoying. I miss being able to just hang out with people whom you shared nothing in common with besides going to school together."
13806,"Yup, I'm a senior-age junior (gap year), and I've now transferred so due to my school's policy, I live and interact primarily with freshmen and sophomores. This is exactly what I was going to add. The whole ""drama never stops"" is true, but especially now, you've got lots of socially underdeveloped kids in college now -- literally three quarters of the school haven't had a full year of in person college."
13807,"I go to a D2 school so its pretty small. The majority of people, including myself, have all gone to highschool in the same town or surrounding towns and now all go to the same university. So all the same gossip and rumors from highschool carry on into college. But the longer ive been in college the less ive heard rumors. Most of it is in greek life and some is from people who attend the same classes as you in the same building. But yeah i can relate."
13808,"In my experience, undergrad is the new middle school, and grad school is the new high school.

Not sure when people plan on growing up nowadays, but early 20‚Äôs apparently isn‚Äôt it.

13809,Also my first thought lol
13810,"I believe that's a human thing. It even happens in the highest level of politics, and among the most educated people in the world.   


Sure other people have higher or lower quantities and tolerances for it, but realistically you'll see it everywhere."

13814,"Oooo I‚Äôm gonna rant. I‚Äôm a college senior & I‚Äôm in an evening class once a week. I don‚Äôt need the class but I need the credits to graduate. Those types of classes like the one I‚Äôm taking are largely taken by those who are not in the major, they need credits, etc. and are not seniors most of the time. 

I think my class is filled with freshmen ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I was always mature for my age & even when I was a high schooler, high schoolers annoyed me lol. They sit behind me and constantly whisper & giggle during lecture. When the professor asks questions, their answers literally remind me of a 16 year old. (The class is The Psychology of Intimate Relationships btw). They think they‚Äôre being cute and silly but really they‚Äôre being annoying as hell. Anyone can crack a joke or say something off the wall once in a while but these girls are excessive & it definitely reminds me of when I was in high school. They don‚Äôt always make jokes or anything, it‚Äôs just their mentality is not on par with the class. What annoys me the most is their interruptive behavior while the professor is trying to lecture."
13815,"üé∂High school never ends, here we go againüé∂"
13816,I just learned this after I graduated high school two years ago. Everyone I knew in my county still talks about high school shit and holds on to the past
13817,"My rude awakening was my first day attending my university over zoom. I just transferred from CC which is essentially a glorified high school. I was expecting my peers at university to be a cut above the ones at my CC, but I was very wrong. The chat was spammed with ""sus"", ""amongus"", ""prof is sus"" etc. I realized that you just can't escape these people, maybe grad school haha"
13818,"My school had a semi-anonymous messageboard app (first names only), which actually had survived for like 7 years incident-free until about 2020. Then for like 6 months one girl kept treating it like her personal blog and started bullying people disagreeing with her, it was straight up insanity. After enough shit-talk and a petition signed by 50 people the school blocked the app. It still hasn't returned but they said they're going to bring it back ""soon"" when they finally figure out how to fix the bullying problem (probably a moderation team or something)

Prior to the whole ""mean girl"" drama it was literally just meetup organizations and homework help, lol. It was genuinely so wholesome."
13819,I'm an American who's lived abroad and while nobody nowhere is perfect... Americans in particular seem to have maturity issues and difficulty grasping the concept that other people exist outside one's self.

13823,"> The average person from my experience only really matures once they hit senior year. 

Yeah I've noticed this as well. I've had a much easier time interacting with seniors than people from my own year."
13824,"idk, as an aerospace major, I take a lot of ME classes, and a lot of the MEs, since they‚Äôre still a huge class, still act like high schoolers. The AEs, since there‚Äôs only a handful of us, act mature enough. I think it‚Äôs a function of how many students are in a particular class/major

I‚Äôve definitely interviewed at companies that have the cliquey vibe like high school, so I think it does definitely progress into the professional space. Some people never mature, even after college"
13825,"People found out about something dumb I did and spread that shit everywhere and that‚Äôs all I known for now. Plus, trusting the wrong person caused me to have my story twisted all types of ways. I‚Äôm 26 btw, the guy I trusted was 30 and the girl who twisted my life just turned 21."

13831,"I can relate. Can I give you some pointers? Delete a majority of your social media. Get a planner and plan out your days. I have to take 4 classes to maintain my FASFA, 12 credits. I.e, Monday/Wednesday is Research Methods/Criminology and Tuesday/Thursday is Law and Ethics/Gangs, Fridays are to do extra research for any projects coming up/commenting to my peers for discussion posts.... It's a lot but my planner really keeps me on track. 

I'm 2 weeks ahead of myself than I normally would be. I'm a per diem worker as well (sometimes I work every weekend, sometimes 1 time a month or nothing at all) I have to work 5 days this month (there's been numerous call outs) and I have to get myself ahead of school because I know this can happen. I'm also a mom to a toddler. No one said it was easy but you can manage your time as best as you can. Try it out. Good luck, if your school has on site counseling, I also recommend it. 

Maybe do fully online schooling if you can. Thomas Edison University (based in Trenton, NJ) has a great platform and it works at your own pace. You can apply and jump in at any time. Each term is 12 weeks. You don't have to be a NJ resident. It's a great school in my opinion. Check it out :)"
13832,"For me it‚Äôs the group projects that suck. No one ever wants to work on projects during the weekend or after like 3 PM, which makes it almost impossible if you work."
13833,College is a full time job in itself
13834,"To be fair college isn't designed to be completed while working full time. 

Though I do agree that college should cost significantly less. In a perfect world it would be free."
13835,I don‚Äôt think taking a full time job and being a full time student is a good idea if you want to have an comfortable go at college

I work M_F 4pm to 1am and have school 2 days a week 10am-215pm.

I have little to no free time. Taking 12 credits. 

So far have straight As. I also have a wife, mortgage and 5 year old daughter.

13840,Make the children work on the side too
13841,"I wish my dad didn't. I flopped hard and flunked out of 2 schools before getting a better head on my shoulders... but then by that time I had to work full time, so trying to do school full time and working full time culminated in another dismissal. Sigh.

The story ends well because I did finally get my bachelors with decent grades, and then have been able to successfully work and do graduate school with near perfect grades. It just took me a long time to mature, as well as some other things but yeah."
13842,"Agreed it's not comfortable, ever! In fact not comfortable is putting it mildly at best. It's downright hard. Problem is some people don't have a choice at this point. For example, I literally can not get a better paying job without a degree, literally ANY degree. But I HAVE to work full time to live. 

Is it a good idea? No. Is it the only choice some people have? Yea. Should we give major props to OP and other like him?? HELL YEA!!

You keep it up as best you can OP!! It's hard now, damned hard, but don't you give it up if you can help it!!!"
13843,"Yeah, you‚Äôre not alone. Let‚Äôs keep pushing, it‚Äôs definitely worth it."
13844,The amount of group projects this semester is making me literally want to pull my hair out.
13845,"Yep. I had a very similar experience. 5 days of work a week(40hrs) plus 4-5 classes(12.5hrs at 5 classes). It was hell on earth.

All I can say is put your head down and get through it. The last thing you want is having done all this work to not get the reward at the end. Good luck"
13846,There should be a subreddit for people that work full time and go to college. I give major Kudos to anyone that can manage both!
13847,"I appreciate the advice! I did fully online the last two quarters and it was wonderful. This quarter I didn't get a choice of fully online for the classes I had to take, as they only offered one completely online and the other two are hybrid. With my fields of study, I'm really struggling to find online classes at my school since a lot of the classes are hands-on and require in-person instruction. Next quarter I will see about going fully online again if I can, but I don't have a lot of options, as my school isn't the most online friendly, unfortunately."
13848,I salute you and your crazy schedule. I hope you get through it! Congrats on the straight A's!
13849,"My dad always talks about how when he was in school (back in the 70's) he was able to work a part time job that paid for his entire tuition and books for the semester. It's just ridiculous how much the prices have ballooned, I laugh when he says this and say, ""yeah? Part time job MAY cover the price of books today.""

It's why I'm so annoyed by all these older folks I saw on LinkedIn forums throwing  fits over the potential student loan forgiveness. I'm truly neutral on that stance, I understand both sides, but what I hate seeing is older folks who graduate 90's and earlier talking about how they were able to do it, and it's like.. Not even the same situation anymore. It's so annoying. Sorry for the tangent lol."
13850,"Facts like people are so privileged, im not hating but I swear life would be sooo easy if I didn't have to work in college or hell if i only had to work like 10-15 hours a week just for side money. A lot of my income goes to bills I just can't wait to graduate lol."
13851,getting them ready early is the Key
13852,It‚Äôs almost like college education isn‚Äôt designed to be something a full time worker does as a side gig.0
13853,"No, it seems OP needs to keep it for financial aid purposes."
13854,"Exactly how I feel right now. I am currently a full time student, a senior at that, and I also work full time, and doing intership. My scheduled goes as follows;; M-school11-5, T- internship9am-5pm, Wed-Sat Work -8am-6pm, Sun- internship 9-5 . I‚Äôm tired. This is a lot. I have no days off‚Ä¶"
13855,"I don't, I don't think I've have done well after high school"
13856,"Yeah idk what that dude meant, if anything going right after high school can be worse. That was my experience, parents couldn‚Äôt afford to pay anything for my school but their income factored into my fafsa so I had to take out a bunch of private loans and still am not 100% sure I‚Äôm happy with the degree I pursued. A fiend of mine same age and graduation year waited a couple years down the line and pays nearly nothing bc fafsa was based on her income alone (which was not a lot)"
13857,"Yeah I was wayyy too immature and too lazy for a full-time college workload.  My first attempt, ended up getting a useless degree.  Then went back to college for a BA in CS and got way better GPA than I did my first degree... now I am looking for a tech job lol"
13858,"Agree. 
I like online classes cause comfort of home blah blah and exams are easier. 
But offline is so so important, my university hasn't opened up here in India really hope it does next semester"
13859,why would this get downvoted? do people really prefer online school?
13860,I prefer online because I work full-time. Online gives me the flexibility I need
13861,"I‚Äôm introverted and absolutely love being alone. But I also know it‚Äôs important to force myself to go out once in a while. So, I really hope classes stay in-person.."
13862,"There are so many programs and degrees where online instruction is not sufficient. Last year, I knew someone getting a nursing degree and was doing clinicals online... just wtf. I can imagine if I were ever hospitalized, I'd hate to be watched over by someone that was trained online.

And besides the lower quality education, cheating is so much easier in online classes. There are going to be job positions everywhere filled by people ill equiped to do them."
13863,"Same. I just can‚Äôt learn while online, or at least, I don‚Äôt retain the information for long. I actually think online is more stressful."
13864,"I save commute time, time parking, and time wasted from getting there early in case there's any hiccups. Everything is also online. Less likely to miss something if everything has to be posted online. Being able to go back in lectures is also a god send. The only plus of being in person is being able to work with other people and make friends. This is less relevant to me as I'm in a master's program where I feel like it's mostly self study."
13865,"If youre living at home due to remote classes, maybe find stuff to do there? Join a class (art, dance, yoga, etc), go to the gym, get a part time job in retail or fast food (tend to have more college aged employees). If youre on campus while classes are remote you could do the same, but lots more clubs to join and such.

Also keep in mind, a lot of clubs still ran while universities were completely remote, so you can definitely join some clubs to meet people online.

Theres always ways to meet people, and even if not to meet people its really important to my mental health I‚Äôve learned to get out and keep busy."
13866,It sounds like your class is asynchronous
13867,"Every Sunday, my assignments get released for the week. I have all week to do them and since my schedule at work fluctuates, it gives me the flexibility to get it all done. I'm not sure what you're trying to say"
13868,You guys should become friends and include me too
13869,90000% would rather wear a mask than go online jfc
13870,"I did sign up for online classes. 4/5 of my classes were listed as online when I signed up for them. Now, only 1/5 remains online. The rest have been switched to in person and I hate it. It's not as simple as simply signing up for online classes."
13871,"I agree with this! A lot of professional jobs are now going remote full time (and more and more jobs are going this route every day). What are you going to do when your job after college goes remote? Find a hobby, volunteer somewhere, go to the gym, find a club. There's so much to do outside of college/your job. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. :)"
13872,Why is it that students have such an issue with masks. I‚Äôve seen students say they‚Äôre taking a semester off because of mask mandates. Clearly you never gave a fuck about your education to begin with.
13873,"Nobody wants to go remote but nobody wants to wear a mask either, so our options are pretty shit. That being said, even when things weren‚Äôt remote learning, everyone still struggled to make friends. You should definitely find some clubs to join or even look on online forums for group chats of people just looking for friends. (That‚Äôs how I met my current college friend group). It‚Äôs a lot easier when you just force yourself out there."
13874,"THIS.

And I'm so tired of every response to posts like this being ""Well I enjoy it"" like good for you nobody asked."
13875,"I like online because I work fulltime and online classes give me flexibility. I don't cheat and often times I'm doing homework at midnight. 

Ignorant Comment"
13876,TIL there's a word for it.
13877,Same. I hate my household and going to school clears my mind from family problems.
13878,"The commute time to school is saved. In undergrad commute time was ~40-60 minutes to & from school for me.

When things went online I had that extra time back to sleep in a bit more, finish some studying, or eat breakfast. 

*Note: I worked full-time night shift. Right after work I only had 1-2hrs before heading to Campus (off holiday) & during the holidays I had less than 1 hour to head to campus.*"
13879,"I prefer online because of flexible hours and because I can take classes at my own pace. I‚Äôm not at school to make friends (as douchey as that sounds) so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing anything by going online.

That being said, I feel awful for people who are being made to go online against their will."
13880,"""Just be happy!"""
13881,"I can vouch to online school, I work full time, school full time, & dad full time (lol). Online helps me fit what school needs from me when I have the time to do it. I‚Äôm sure for others it may be difficult. No one is alike."
13882,"I feel this man. I'm in my senior year and haven't made any social growth since junior year and it fucking sucks. I'd suggest joining a club, it's all you really can do at this point. Fucking sucks. 

And the people begging for online? Anecdotally most of those just enjoy how easy and 0 attendence online classes generally are. I learn nothing online. It's ridiculous. see about hybrid classes too. Some profs are down for that some aren't, not sure how that works at ur school."
13883,"1. No need to be rude, I‚Äôm just shedding some light on other perspectives because you claimed that it was all the same, which it isn‚Äôt for everyone. 

2. The college I went to for undergrad the majority of the student population commutes. The main ones didn‚Äôt were some of the Freshman & the Students who came to the US to study from other countries. *However, the University didn‚Äôt have much housing for on Campus.*"
13884,"When my EMT class when online, we had lectures on webex and then weekly small skills groups. It wasn't awful"
13885,"Some people have really strict parents and practically cannot do anything but study, eat and breath and depended on college to do normal stuff like that."
13886,"That‚Äôs incredibly shitty of the university to do to everyone who signed up for those classes, but especially for immunocompromised students."
13887,"not necessarily. If classes are still synchronous it doesn‚Äôt change anything, just changing where you‚Äôre spending your time"

13891,Bruh. You can go negative on a debit card.
13892,"As someone who was in a similar predicament, the thing I hated the most about college freshmen and sophomore year was how much support everyone else got from their parents. If you‚Äôre in college never take your parents help for granted, never take their visits for granted, if they buy you clothes, snacks etc. never take it for granted."
13893,$407.

13901,This is the way.

13906,"19 freshman, $1700 with no job yet."
13907,Lab tech / phlebotomist. Base pay is only $15.50 but picking up shifts and working overtime can easily double or triple that. I think a lot of hospitals do this thing where there are added bonuses for every shift you pick up. CNA/PCTs get big bonuses per shift and lab gets extra $10/20/hr on top of overtime for any open shifts or if they're understaffed. One day over the summer I worked a double at $42/hr. Got my expenses all paid in 1 day. If you're cool with that kind of work it's not easy but the money is stupid

13913,i had about 4k saved from my summer job but had to dump it into my student account so i can register for next semester. i‚Äôll save more when im more secure with school costs

13934,HOW DO I TALK TO MY ROOMATE LIKE A NORMAL FUCKING PERSON
13935,"We do discussion about college life and the college experience.  There's a lot of talk about academic programs (majors, minors, etc.), careers, living situations, dealing with faculty/staff/administration, discipline, extracurriculars, transferring, etc.  You can browse our front page to see a variety of topics.

We have the FAFSA megathread because one of our mods is a professional financial aid expert, and she answers everything that gets posted there.  We have the making friends and dropping courses megathreads because of the sheer volume of posts we get on those topics.  

We don't do admissions because there's a sub purely for that.  

And finally, we don't do venting or ranting here.  We get sooooooo many posts from people talking about how they're depressed or anxious or mad or can't believe or can't even or are just ready to give up.  Someone created a sub purely for that.  Those posts often aren't off-topic for r/college, but damn they just bring the place down if we let them fester."

14005,"Dude, I'm really struggling with my homework. I've looked at notes, the textbook, worked examples, everything and I'm still not sure what to do or what I'm doing wrong. Then with another homework, I'm waiting for the code to finish running (will take a while) but at least I got most of the other questions. Then for the other homework assignment, I'm so scared to start it. So basically, I'm procrastinating my inevitable mental breakdown."
14006,"I‚Äôd rather not write my paper right now, thank you."
14007,WHO ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU WATCHING ME!
14008,"Thanks for this! I really like to be engaged and genuinely enjoy all of my classes and learning in general. I guess I just worry that it puts other people off, though I shouldn‚Äôt care what they think. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm ‚Äúintimidating,‚Äù so I don‚Äôt want to seem like a scary bitch. Hopefully people open up more as the semester goes on."
14009,"I'm a part of this OP. I never raise my hand because I don't want my professor to ask any tricky follow up questions even if I know the answer. For example, Why do you think that or How does that correlate to this?

I just don't see the need to answer out loud as long as I know the answer in my head. You shine in front of the class, yet your test scores will truly reflect what you know."
14010,"Believe me, the majority of your classmates are grateful you're the one answering the professor's questions. I've been in classes where no one was that person and there were crickets at every question. You're doing the Lord's work."
14011,"This happens everywhere. People just don't want to speak in front of everyone most times.

If anything they're probably thankful you answer."
14012,Im a little different in that I prefer just listening to the professor the whole time. I pay money to hear a professor who knows a bunch about the topic rather than listen to some overzealous students who wanna make a bunch of comments or ask questions they already know the answer to
14013,"What makes the required courses (I also teach Gen Eds) even worse is the number of kids who come in *certain* they know the course is useless, so they don't engage with it, and of course when you don't engage with the course it does in fact become useless to you so they get to confirm their beliefs."
14014,"If they wanted to say something, they would. You do you."
14015,"I will always ask the difficult follow up question.

*Because that's what education is.* You need to spend years getting hit with the difficult follow up so you can learn to anticipate them and figure out an answer. Every semester I get a pile of essays that never engage with the follow up questions. I don't know if the students just can't anticipate them (but many seem obvious), or if they just can't figure out how to respond.

You should be inviting those situations while you're in a low-stakes environment so you can be prepared when stuff actually matters."
14016,Small dopamine rush from getting the answer right in front of 100 people vs cortisol bombshell if you answer stupidly in front of 100 people.
14017,It's really hard to let go of the mentality of looking like a know it all. But you sound like you enjoy what you're learning and don't let the silence make you nervous! You got this.
14018,"Some people just don‚Äôt like to talk. Like I do all the readings and the work and listen to the lecture, but I just don‚Äôt like talking in class. 

But then there‚Äôs lots of kids who don‚Äôt talk because they just don‚Äôt give a shit and didn‚Äôt read and don‚Äôt want to be in that class. Mainly in gen eds."
14019,"I get what you mean, but at the same time, i don't see the incentive here. If you ask a question i know the answer to, then I won't raise my hand, since I know the answer. If I don't know the answer and guess and am wrong, I gained nothing from talking. The right answer teaches me something. Learning how to be better at guessing is good and all, but from my 4 years of being an intern at a insurance company from high school to college there hasn't been a time where falsely guessing has helped me."
14020,"Tbh I never really answer questions from profs because I just dont care too. I pay to sit and learn. And I sit and learn pretty well. The engagement annoys me, typically I'm too tired to even want to answer. I just enjoy hearing the lectures then solidifying what I learned at home on homework or when studying. If I'm stuck I'll go to office hours. 

It's not that I dont care for learning, I just learn silently. I pay for this guy who has a phd in engineering to instruct me. I want to listen to him. Not waste time that he could use talking to let myself talk. Plus the faster he gets through information, faster I can then ask questions of what I dont understand later on."
14021,Just don‚Äôt be the person that tells some long ass rambling story every time you raise you‚Äôre hand and you‚Äôre fine.
14022,[deleted]
14023,"Preeeeach. 

But for real, to the students out there go on and dip your toes into the pool. I've certainly seen my fair share of students who are smarter than I am. But that doesn't mean there isn't something you have left to learn if you just own up and say to yourself ""I'm paying out the \*\*\* for this class, I am going to make it worth it."" Go on, get your money's worth out of it. Full ride? Doesn't matter you could be doing something else and making a dime. Parents paying? Doesn't matter you're gonna hear about it during the holidays anyway. Make. it. worth. it. 

OP (is that the term we use here for the original poster? asking for myself here) isn't one of those, the too cool for school types, and it shows because no matter what they made an attempt to be a better person, to further themselves, to grow, and to try."
14024,"In a perfect world, sure. But in reality, peoples perception of you is important. That shouldn't stop OP from asking questions, but saying you shouldn't care about what others think of you is just wrong IMO."
14025,"I have several reasons why I almost never answer lecturers:
- I go really red all the time for no reason and it embarrasses me so much! Even when I'm wearing makeup and know that no one would actually be able to see the redness, the feeling of my face turning into flames is enough to stop me from speaking.
- I'm slow! A lot of the time when questions are asked, I'll think of the answer a minute or two later. I just simply cannot think of answers on the stop.
- I don't learn much AT All during the lectures. I learn through practice questions and studying at home. So if a lecture is repeated (and I've done work at home in-between) then I'll be able to answer the question just fine.
- Most times in lectures, I'm processing a lot of information because I'm paying full attention to the lecturer. I'm also taking as many notes as possible. Usually you'll see me deep in thought and/or scribbling notes and feel like I simply don't have time to reply to questions being asked.
- Sometimes I'm bored shitless in class or think the lecturer sucks so I won't interact in any way. I just want to get the class over with!

Don't be afraid to look like a ""know - it - all"". Engaging with the lecturer is one of the most effecient ways of learning things. And remember, the only thing that truly matters is your grade at the end of each semester. I guarantee your lecturers absolutely love you for interacting and will think you're going to get high marks in their class. You're completely on the right track, don't stop answering those questions! The other students are probably relieved you're answering them so they don't have to haha"
14026,"Yup. As long as you're not obnoxious, they aren't thinking you're being a smug know-it-all as much as they are thankful that you're keeping the lecture going at a solid tempo. I hate those awkward silences where prof asks a question and only crickets respond.

At least, that's how I reassure myself when I'm usually the one always talking."
14027,"If it's a lecture class, that is what's on the menu. If it's a lab you can expect me to participate. It depends on the situation. If I'm in a LECTURE tho I will sit and learn because that's how i best learn. 

Dont tell me how I learn and what I'm required to do. Most my profs preface with ""I dont care if you participate or not, it's your money, it's your choice"". So I am going to do just that because that's how I learn best."
14028,"Regardless of who is paying for education, it is such spoiled behavior to *not* make it worth it. So many people, both within and outside of the U.S, would do anything for a shot at having a degree and bettering themselves. Knowledge is power and not something worth wasting. Even if the course isn‚Äôt relevant to your degree, it‚Äôs all experience and tidbits of info that could help you out in unexpected situations. I took Crisis Intervention as an elective and it prepared me for speaking with an old friend who turned out to be addicted to heroin."
14029,"That makes sense, but the vast majority of my professors just keep asking the students until someone gets it right, then they elaborate on the right answer, not why other people got it wrong. As a junior, how these discussions have usually gone for me was ""'is it answer x?' 'No. Anyone else?' 'Is it answer y?' 'Not quite' 'is it answer z?' 'Correct.'"" And then they just talk about the answer, which they could've done without wasting our time asking students."
14030,"Some people, like me, learn best with textbooks and video in the comfort of their own room. Sincerely, I attend lectures just because professors have a huge Ego and need to feel indispensable."
14031,"Its different, contextually. I've found people don't mind speaking in front of tutor groups and when they're doing work but don't want to speak out in lectures. 

They feel less inclined to go against their shyness in lectures I suppose. When there's 200 people I guess it's easy to fall into a crowd and hope someone else answers too."
14032,"I'm extremely shy and I don't like to speak in public, other than that my light social anxiety prevents me to have quick one-on-one conversations: if I ask a question to the professor my mind go totally blank while he is speaking and I have a choice: make a fool of myself in front of the entire class or... asking Google for answers."
14033,"Yeah, this is basically the answer to OPs original question. Some people are introverts. I get that it‚Äôs great practice to push yourself to answer questions in class for both your learnings sake and to become at communicating your thoughts but it‚Äôs also difficult for introverts to do this.

OP is basically overlooking the fact that not everyone is him."
14034,"Well good thing theres people like OP who like to answer questions. I don't, and I will continue to not."
14035,"That philosophy works well for people who are extroverts, but you need to remember that about half of people are introverts. Also, many people fear public speaking, so those extra questions just discouraged most of the class from answering any more of their questions from that professor."
14036,All professors have huge egos? I smell a fallacy. Also seems like a huge waste of tuition money if you‚Äôd rather learn solely from textbooks.
14037,"Because I don't like the pressure of having some unknown question thrown at me in a class of a lot of people I don't know. You don't even get time to think, it's 5-10 seconds and that's it, because you're not just gonna sit for 30 seconds to think of what you read before the lecture, and how it all makes sense.

That's pretty much it. I definitely appreciate the guys answering to keep the show going though, because I can't do it."
14038,At some point people have start putting *a lot* more effort to make and keep friends and it sounds like you're approaching that point.
14039,"Social media always portrays teen years as drinking and partying, but you forget each person is different with different interests. I‚Äôm 18 and I‚Äôve never drank nor smoked (drinking is due to religion, and I just hate smoking). I don‚Äôt go to parties either nor have I ever been on a date (or had a real crush!) and I‚Äôm perfectly happy like that. Instead, I spend time doing what makes me happy and what interests me, like reading books and graphic design. 

So don‚Äôt feel like your teen days went to waste just because you didn‚Äôt do what social media told you to do."
14040,"I'm turning 21 in a few months and I've never partied, never had a relationship, never smoked, etc. and I have never put much thought into that. My crowning achievement thus far in life is having several amazing internships under my belt and a good income from those internships. I've also done well in university so far. Not that there is anything wrong with enjoying yourself and having fun in college, but for me, building a successful career has always been my top goal and I've never regretted any of it."
14041,"Wait teens are supposed to attend parties, smoke and get in to relationships? And If we didn't do so we have wasted our teen years? What criteria is this?"
14042,"For the moment, yes. Though I worry about my future sometimes. If your still in college, maybe you could join a club or two and meet new friends there."
14043,"Understand people are busy and not everyone communicates the same. For example, Some of my friends will never text but will respond to a hang out invite. I have some friends I see every three months since we live in different cities, you might have to get use not seeing them often. Also friendship is a two way street, if you‚Äôre putting in all the effort to keep in touch and they‚Äôre not, maybe consider not putting in as much effort. Not saying to ditch the friend but don‚Äôt tire yourself out"
14044,are you happy?
14045,"Because social media and tv shows are supposed to portray it this way.. Same like the analogy beautiful bodies of women which is most of the time fake and same like the analogy of the exagreatted porn which is also fake.. They only show the positive side of it
You don't spend your entire 20 years partying its just a few hours in those 20 years anyway.. And not necessarily experience it these are all fake portrays..
And teen relationships...god damn please 99% of them fail and it end up so badly its not even worth it.."
14046,"It ain‚Äôt like the movies
Movies have just given it a foul taste 

Just live life 
And that‚Äôs it"
14047,"Yeah, I'm trying to be a ""non-traditional student,"" meaning I'm old, and all I have to say is I regret a lot of the ""experimenting"" I did when I was younger. You don't have to just make the same mistakes everyone else did and everyone's telling you are a bad idea. Some high school kids in my neighborhood got off the bus and they were all CARRYING their coats. It was like 8¬∫ out. I wanted to make fun of them. I don't really remember what my point is here, but young people are dumb. I have no hope for future generations. The mineral wealth of the planet is going to run out in like 200 years. Get off my lawn."
14048,"I‚Äôm 26 now and in grad school, which is where people really start to move in different directions and spend more time apart - I‚Äôd recommend ‚Äúdownsizing‚Äù your friends. It just isn‚Äôt really possible to keep up with 10 or 20 people when you‚Äôre working all day and have hobbies or sports or alone time too. Having only a handful of close friends is common as you get older, and if you try too hard to hold onto more than that, you‚Äôre going to get burned out and be a shitty friend to them all.

Also remember that adult friendships are a bit different precisely because you don‚Äôt spend as much time together. And that‚Äôs okay. Don‚Äôt panic or try to force yourself to hang out with your friends every single day, or even every week or every month."
14049,"I feel you, but unlike in movies, we got no plot to moves us forward in life, we got to do it ourselved, and we are too young to understand that at the time, the fact you see it now means you've grown up and ready to explore life."
14050,"Why not do it now? You are still in your 20s, so even by societal standards you are ""allowed"" to make stupid mistakes. Just be responsible enough to know if the pleasure or satisfaction of doing something is worth the potential consequences that come with it."
14051,"A few months away from that point myself, any advice?"
14052,"100% agree. You define your happiness and the time you spend doing something. For someone not partying, drinking and smoking is a sign of success tbh. You will have plenty of time for dating, social events, parties and etc. In terms of friendships however, you have to put yourself out there and be more proactive"
14053,Some people‚Äôs best years were in hs. Just be thankful you‚Äôre not going to be *that guy*. Get on Groupon & do something exciting. You‚Äôll feel better. Life has just begun!
14054,You have your entire life ahead of you.
14055,"i‚Äôm 18 and kind of regret not doing a lot in my teen high school years. never attended homecoming or athletic events besides the ones i was a part of. i‚Äôm starting to get more involved and be more social but i literallt only have a couple months of school left so i‚Äôm just like ??? is this worth it. i‚Äôm generally an introverted person but i think i‚Äôd regret my decision either way, whether i was a partier or more of a home-life kinda person. it‚Äôs okay to be yourself :] if you prefer life without parties and drinking then i‚Äôd say have no regrets? idk. just my take"
14056,"When you are early 20s it's best to just put your head down and work. Learn about finance and not do things like have a kid, unless you really planned for it."
14057,"The last part is key.     
      
You can be friends with someone and only see them every few years. I have friends I see monthly, yearly, and every few years. They're no worse friends than they were when we saw eachother daily. We get together and it's like we haven't skipped a beat. But then we go our separate ways because life does that to people."
14058,High school Is worth forgetting
14059,"You can‚Äôt think like that.

I had a kid at 19, wasted my early 20s on a women who inevitably left us for another family.

It wasn‚Äôt until I was 25 that I met my now fianc√©, graduated at 27, am now 28 and getting my MBA, and am developing a friend group.

You can‚Äôt think about the past too much. You‚Äôre only 20üòÇ"
14060,"Sort of true. I‚Äôve never done the above due to religion as well. However, I did miss out on prom and other stuff because of the pandemic. That makes me feel lonely."
14061,"Im also 21 years old. Im a pharmacy technician and I make almost 20 an hour (differential included) and I have an associates degree. I will be starting pharmacy school this fall. 

Growing up my parents were always strict so I never had the privilege to hang out with friends or do most normal stuff teens do. I never had sleepovers, wasn't allowed to date, never been to parties. Once in a while they will even say stay away from friends and that my only focus is school. My life was always go to school and go home. Right now its go to work and go home, and even all my classes are asynchronous so its really work and home. There are times where they got upset when I wanted to buy something from the store and they say ""oh you just want to leave the house"".

Even basic shit like extracurriculars or a sport it was a problem because ""I just wanted to socialize"". I remember this one day where I wanted to attend a memorial for someone in my high school after we graduated because he committed suicide. When I asked my mom if I could attend she said no and accused me of going there just to socialize. 

I feel like sometimes I may never have the oppurtunity to have a fully functioning social life. Im not a teenager anymore and im pursuing a career in pharmacy so that's really time consuming. When I graduate then I may get married and have kids and it just won't be the same."
14062,"Yes, I‚Äôm on the deans list at a very good school in my area. Currently writing this from my desk at an internship for one of the largest transit companies in the U.S."
14063,The amount of people doing this is way smaller than you think.
14064,"Not everyone is lucky to have freedom to explore personal interests or career paths in their teen years, especially when you‚Äôve been promoted to watching your younger sibling in their preteens."
14065,"Well you didn't waste your teen life, you INVESTED it... It's gonna pay off soon :)"
14066,As someone who went to prom and homecoming and athletic events: you didn‚Äôt really miss out on anything. They were all boring. I had more fun leaving early and playing games with my friends.

14074,Does it save so you can purchase them later when you can afford it?
14075,"Unfortunately not. You can receive verified certification in the course which can help you in the long run. Gotta pay $99 before the course/its specified date which is going to be before the course

EDIT: the courses that aren‚Äôt EDX can still give you free ‚Äúcertification of completion‚Äù if money is an issue. Found this out recently from a Reddit user and checked for myself

EDIT: According to someone who has taken the CS50 courses, you can receive either EDX certificate (verified certificate which cost money), or the free certification (proof of certification)"
14076,"Actually, you get a certificate from Harvard for free, the certificate from edX is the one that costs $99 and you can pay anytime you want, before , during or after you finish the course.

14080,"Some CS50 courses like Intro to CS, Web Programming, Game Development and Mobile Development available every year, they put an expiration date because they have to, but then they put the same (or updated) materials right after the expiration date.

I enrolled in CS50 Intro to CS in 2018 and completed it in 2019 and I didn't have to do all the psets because my progress from 2018 was carried to 2019, now there's a 2020 updated version of the course, I also enrolled in CS50 Web Programming in 2019.

The course existed before I enrolled in and will continue to exist, the same goes for CS50 Web Programming."

So question about this edX thing since this is my first time learning about it. So do I absolutely have to pay for that $99 verified certificate, or is there some other form of verification?

14097,Just edited my comment. Sorry about that.
14098,"I think after finishing the finals or just assignments and finishing a semester just takes a lot from you ya know? Enjoy the break, get back that lost sleep from late nights and sure if you are taking a bit longer to do common tasks that's fine you had a stressful situation with the finals and it's gonna take some time to recover it. I had my last assignments due today at like 5pm and after I sent them I just collapsed and now it's like 3am and I only woke up about an hour ago. So I think we're all gonna feel burned out for a bit but a bit of time off to do things you enjoy should help reignite the flame for wanting to try our best for college. Just know for different people it can take longer, got a friend that got burned out but bounced back in like 3 days but I know for sure I'll probably only bounce back a day or so before the next semester starts. So don't beat yourself up over it, it will come back."
14099,"I just handed in my final project and a redone project(confusing instructions, professor thought I handed in wrong file and I redid a semesters worth of work in 3 days)

Fingers crossed I passed this and one other class. One class is 6 credits one is 3. I want at least Bs, but I'm fine with a C at this point.

I feel burned out because leaving campus and going all remote after Thanksgiving really screwed me. I'm also disappointed that I couldn't keep up with everything and my grades weren't as good as they could have been. I'm scared cause it's done and there is nothing I can do until I go back in a month.

&#x200B;

One thing I stopped doing was playing video games so I wouldn't get distracted during the last two weeks but now that I'm done I am going to focus on animal crossing and Zelda. Video games relax me."
14100,"Tbh I think COVID has a lot to do with it. I am a senior and I was taking pretty easy classes but this semester sucked. It is all of the worse parts of college and none of the best.

 We also didn't have breaks so no one went home because of COVID but that made it even more brutal. It normally isn't like this so hopefully next year by the fall life will be somewhat back to normal."
14101,"Yes. I was burnt out even before exams week was over. I turned in what I consider a low quality paper because I just was so done. I don't feel like I put forth my best effort. I could have done so much better. Either way, I am glad to have a couple of weeks off."
14102,"Yeah. It's just stressful because I have things that I want to do over the break and I don't have energy for it. Even though I'm good academically, school has always been a source of stress for me and I repeatedly feel like 100% of myself goes into school and other obligations and I have nothing left for myself."
14103,"I can relate to y'all so much! Yesterday was my last final and I'm just waiting on my classes now... But after watching some SNL, Arc Digest, and random pamper videos on YouTube, I'm feeling a bit better. But this quarter (I'm on a quarter system) taking 19 units online w/ labs really took something out of me! I'm def trying to rest and I want to come back harder (in academics) next quarter esp since I'll have less units, but still find ways to preserve my happiness, sanity, and mental health :)"
14104,i feel like i had all the work and none of the fun of a semester
14105,Thank you :) I wish you the same friend and hope the holidays bring you joy.
14106,Yes. I finished 2 weeks ago and I‚Äôm supposed to be working and it‚Äôs so hard and now all my work has been put off for the weekend and I have to do it somehow.
14107,"This happens to me right after a semester (or anything I put a lot of continuous effort into, really) because my mind is still in ‚Äúwork‚Äù mode, but there‚Äôs no more to do, and nothing else can satisfy my need to work so it‚Äôs just frustrating. It‚Äôs like when you run a race: after you cross the finish line, yeah you‚Äôre done, but you‚Äôre still gonna jog a little to slow down and be out of breath a little after that. You‚Äôre just out of breath rn, but you‚Äôll catch it soon! :)"
14108,"Yep, I feel exactly. I was never like this in high school, but I finished my first term of college last week and I'm still so extremely drained and just irritated at everything. I hope you're able to find something you like and just chill before you go back to school, though!"
14109,I finished last week and i still feel anxious. Havent slept well either
14110,"Yesss, for sure. I'm so happy to finally be on break but I feel a little dead inside and depleted right now. Like I don't feel like doing anything productive."
14111,I feel anxiety and dread because I did horrible in my classes. It's only been one semester but I already feel like quitting and dropping out.
14112,I know that feeling too well. I hope you recover. üíóüåà
14113,"I‚Äôm burnt out, but sadly I can‚Äôt do much because my job schedules the hell out of me."
14114,"Same... Still got 1 paper left still.  But been so burnt out, I can't focus. I need to sleep like 3 months and break is exactly 1 for me...

üí§üí§üí§"
14115,"Mood I slept 9 hours today and I normally don‚Äôt go passed 7. This has by far been the worst semester ever. Next one I have four online classes so I‚Äôm excited for that.
I hope everything is well with you. I‚Äôve been journaling, listening to podcasts, endulging in food, taking baths, reading"
14116,"Same I just finished the semester two weeks ago and I still haven‚Äôt recovered. Grades weren‚Äôt bad, but it could‚Äôve been better. This break I told myself I was going to study for the MCAT just to get a head start before I register for an exam date. But I‚Äôm just so unmotivated to do anything. I mostly just stay in my bed, watch Netflix and sleep all day. Hopefully I gain that sense of strength and determination to study, but for now, I just need to relax."
14117,"I finished on Thursday and I‚Äôve barely had the energy to vacuum, all of my emotions feel depleted as well. I‚Äôm a senior (history major) and I haven‚Äôt felt this burnt out since my first ever college finals week in 2017"
14118,"It's scary how much this describes me. I've been off nearly a month (we finished at thanksgiving) and I'm still exhausted. I worry that I won't be able to make it through the spring. I put 200% of myself into school every semester, but this last one took a toll for multiple reasons. I did great, but it's worrisome for my sanity's sake."
14119,what kind of course is 6 credits? i max have a 4 credit one.
14120,I‚Äôm the type that has gotten sick nearly every single time I‚Äôve finished finals in college. I think my body just realizes that it doesn‚Äôt need to power through anymore because my tests are over. Makes the breaks kinda miserable sometimes but you just have to let your body heal.
14121,"Mood, worst part is that my semester is essentially unending. Just passed a class for a certification for work. Now gotta get nationally certified, then get more credentials. That way, I can get decent job with not horrible pay so i can get throufh college."
14122,Definitely. It doesn‚Äôt help that I had strep throat during the last week of classes. Such a 2020 thing to happen.
14123,"Yeah. Except I have 4 deadlines in January so it's all steam ahead unfortunately.

Mind numbingly burnt out right now."
14124,I had burnout *during* the semester!
14125,Lol I was burnout halfway through the semester :(
14126,"Rest and breaks are important to stay on top of during the semesters to prevent the burnt out feeling afterwards.

I hardly ever gave myself a break this past year to the point that I did school while feeling burnt out. 

This is my life now...."
14127,"I just slept for 15 hours and am still exhausted, so no, you‚Äôre not alone."
14128,">on top of that music majors breathing and practically spitting on each other in small rooms all the time and you‚Äôve got a recipe for disaster.

This, for real. I‚Äôve pretty much dropped all my music courses because My family is at risk with asthma and diabetes and the spread is literally unavoidable. I just don‚Äôt understand how universities are still trying to operate. They announced stuff 6 months ago with the view that things would be getting better by now, but they‚Äôre only getting worse."
14129,"> In the bars, restaurants, and retail establishments that have resumed service as part of most states‚Äô reopening plans, the majority of employees are 34 or younger. But rather than taking responsibility for reopening high-risk environments prematurely, officials have again shifted the blame to the young people who keep those industries running.

These are my sentiments. Our leadership has failed us. It‚Äôs time they take responsibility for their actions and inactions instead of placing the blame on us."
14130,"this is admittedly one thing that i've liked about how my college has handled reopening: it's been acknowledged that there will be some risks involved and that some individuals will get sick, but administration has focused more on developing a protocol of what to do when students get sick rather than pretending that threatening students with punishment if they go to parties or socialize in large groups will do anything to stop the problem. because a lot of this socialization takes place in private rooms or off campus, there's simply not a good way to stop it from happening or follow through with said punishments.

i also agree with the author that universities need to be clearer with what their students are allowed to do in addition to what they're not allowed to do. but honestly, i don't know that most colleges have any idea what to do in this situation. while smaller universities or universities in areas where COVID is mostly under control have a decent shot at reopening safely, it's still difficult to say what the big state schools here in the south are going to do, and the lack of transparency makes me think a lot of them aren't going to reopen, at least not fully. but we'll see, i guess."
14131,[deleted]
14132,Fair on their part. Imagine how many salty parents are going to allow their kids to go back then sue the school when the kid gets sick. I don‚Äôt blame the schools for protecting their endowments.
14133,"From the sparse information I‚Äôve heard about the music department, they‚Äôre looking into things like plexiglass shields and personal tents for us. That‚Äôs a step in the right direction, but I still don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre planning to do about the more awkward or bigger instruments like flute, tuba, trombone, etc. A clarinet could feasibly work with a shield or personal tent, but trombone? No way. 

I play the flute and there are these things someone invented called ‚Äúwind defenders‚Äù that basically block the air that blows across the mouthpiece. Apparently the flute is one of the most dangerous instruments right now because 90% of the air doesn‚Äôt go in the mouthpiece, but across and out, as if you‚Äôre spitting into the room. These shields block that and are apparently really effective.

I think it‚Äôs possible to come up with similarly creative ways to guard against infection like this, but it‚Äôs an issue of time and whether schools are willing to invest in these things, and let‚Äôs face it, a lot of schools aren‚Äôt going to think it‚Äôs worth it.

I think the arts might have the hardest time coming back from this. I believe it‚Äôll happen, because I‚Äôm optimistic, but for right now it looks pretty grim."
14134,"I live in the south, and I notice the majority of people who refuse to follow guidelines are middle aged white people. Young people usually wear a mask and distance... there is, however, still young people that just don‚Äôt care. Luckily we just got a state and city mask mandate.. sadly, we have stores that have signs that basically say they don‚Äôt give a fuck if you wear a mask. The store I work in requires you to wear one or we will not serve you, it‚Äôs a little satisfying seeing some old white dude get pissed off bc he can‚Äôt take his mask off and breath all over people and shit"
14135,Yeah the only problem is they are forcing us to go back to in person classes
14136,"Realistically, what could be done to monitor or control students who are off-campus or in private spaces? Legal precedent is that schools' in loco parentis doesn't apply off campus, iirc."
14137,"You make an excellent point. The school‚Äôs response, the personal responsibility thing, is basically the only thing they can do outside of campus boundaries. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not a very comforting answer to the rest of us as it only takes one person breaking the rules for things to go downhill. It‚Äôs a no-win scenario for everyone."
14138,"It's been my experience lately that in public places like the grocery store, work, classroom, etc., where young people feel a sense of prestige for wearing masks, we will wear them. Its the real-world equivalent of getting ""likes"" i.e. ""look at me being socially responsible by wearing a mask"". However, I get the impression that in more private or intimate settings surrounded by friends and peer-level groups (dorm rooms, bars, peer functions) where we are more inclined to socialize and interact with others in our 'tribe', we don't feel the sense of urgency to wear a mask. The sentiment here is ""So what if I get the 'rona? I'm with my peeps!"""
14139,My college is going through with 8- and 9-person suites lol
14140,I don't think that's feasible or fair. Colleges should do what they can to deliver education to students in a safe manner. Students should be able to stay on track.
14141,"What's funny is my college is the opposite. I was supposed to be in a double and it got cancelled and I got automatically put into a single. 

I've seen some colleges shove 4 people in less space than some of the doubles my school cancelled!"
14142,"I just graduated this year from a small college in NJ. In our state, the virus infection and death rates are currently very low but mostly stagnant. The college says the only things students are allowed to do on campus is go to class, stay in their dorm room, and pick up dining hall food for curbside pickup. 

My best guess is that colleges trying to enforce social distancing will use the campus public safety to do it, and the ‚Äúpunishments‚Äù will likely be something along these lines:

1. Being kicked off campus for 14 days and you have to be tested upon your return for a ‚Äúfirst offense‚Äù. Students will have to do schoolwork remotely during that time.

2. Getting suspended from college for the rest of the semester and losing all credits for the classes your taking during that time.

3. Third penalty will be expulsion with no refunds for tuition or housing.

I‚Äôm guessing that commuter students will also be kicked off campus after their classes are over to minimize the amount of people on campus at one time."
14143,"That‚Äôs the case with most people groups regardless of age. I was at the vet the other day and saw the employees around each other without masks on, but pulled them up when around customers. Also, so many elderly people (at least in my area) don‚Äôt wear masks. It‚Äôs not all our fault for the spread when even the at risk people aren‚Äôt wearing masks."
14144,"Where I live (not USA) has been a disaster when it comes to wearing masks. I've worn it since the beginning and we've had a mandate requiring everyone to wear them but it is the businesses that are making it 10x worse. No one is enforcing it, and when you do ask people to distance themselves from you because they are not wearing a mask, you get yelled at while the employees just stand there, doing absolutely nothing. 

There is only one store that does have a clear policy of no mask, no service but even they have told me that they suffer a lot of abuse by patrons who think they are above the law."
14145,"Fucking hell, why don't they just go online? That is the only way to 100% prevent this. It is not perfect but you can still do a lesson and practice online. It's called ""adapting"" and is supposed to be what our species is best at, but I think we have become way too spoiled in a sense. People can't handle this blip in our entitlements."
14146,"Blaming students or not, the behavior of the 25-ish crowd has been sad though this whole thing.  I don't even want to hear ""we're trying the best we can, BuT wE nEeD sOcIaL iNtErAcTiOnS!!!"""
14147,"Yeah. I'm just as pissed because I hate the refusal of states to take a strong stance on a public health matter, believe me, I just don't know what can be done."
14148,"Mine only has online options for some classes, so potentially if there‚Äôs a class someone needs to graduate, it may only be available in person"
14149,Because that is what most students say they want.
14150,It‚Äôs an American tradition! Ignoring social and group problems by placing the blame on individuals.

14152,"There‚Äôs already been issues at my school with Greek life throwing parties late last semester and even in the summer, with corona outbreaks running rampant in those social circles as a result. The university doesn‚Äôt seem to be considering how these will happen again, it‚Äôs inevitable, but with a hybrid model, the cases are going to be much higher since it will impact many outside Greek life this time. Not having the semester online is irresponsible."
14153,"I mean it's really hard. I'm suffering from Depression and anxiety and I've never had to deal with those things before. I'm just really lonely. And to add to that, my college still hasn't announced which of my classes will be online, so I can't quit my job or start packing, and housing is due on the 7th. I don't blame people who want to go back to college, I do desperately want to, and I may have to depending on what my classes decide, as it's to late to defer. That said I d rather stay home and take them online."
14154,"a ton of northeast schools are doing this, UNH is doing it too."
14155,"The only ""option"" for our school, is to find another school. Or take a year off."
14156,"My school has essentially cleared a dorm to be used as quarantine housing should we need it. Mask are required in class, and recommended outside on campus. They havent really told us what we can and cannot do, but told us to be responsible."
14157,"I couldnt agree more. I laughed at my college when they sent an email about how they plan to stifle the spread of COVID this semester, and it really boiled down to just ‚Äúwell we hope everyone is personally responsible‚Äù. Lots of ‚Äústrongly recommended facemask‚Äù and ‚Äústrongly encouraged‚Äù hygenical practices."
14158,"Yep, everyone seems to have found their group immediately and I'm out here with almost no friends"
14159,Yes. Spending most of your time studying and doing classwork makes it hard to get out and socialize and making new friends can be difficult.
14160,"Yup, I‚Äôm in college and I‚Äôm lonely af lol."
14161,This is kinda my experience. I know of alot of people and alot of people know of me but we are no more than acquaintances who after whatever encounter brought us together just nod to eachother in passing.
14162,"I often used the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough time to socialize, I‚Äôm too busy‚Äù excuse for my first 2 years of college. I really regret it looking back at it now. You always have time. You could spend 40 hours a week every week in the library and you‚Äôd still have time.

It‚Äôs more of a you have to take the initiative to put yourself out there situation. My first 2.5 years of college I was extremely introverted, however, I hated how my future would look if the behavior continued. So I put myself out there and pushed myself to start doing more and more. Just got to say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù (literally say it aloud) sometimes and do it. Everyone has the time, not everyone is taking accountability to put in the effort to be social."
14163,It seemed like my ENTIRE university did some secret bonding session over the summer and didn't invite me. Seriously since day one it was like everyone knew everyone else (talking about mostly freshmen here). I've made a couple acquaintances but not really friends. If you aren't a Jesus freak or an athlete it's rough where I am.
14164,"If anyone in this thread needs someone to talk to my dm's are open

Feeling lonely is a common thing in college because it feels like its not really your home, and because people truly are focused on their lives and coursework it makes it seem really disconnected unless you are really really close with multiple people which can be hard! 
All i can say is try to put more effort into talking to people who are where you frequent, and keep putting yourself out there!"
14165,Oh god this hit deep
14166,"i have a bf (by luck of meeting him in high school) and we both go to the same college but other than that i haven‚Äôt made a single friend at college, and i can‚Äôt believe i hardly remember what it‚Äôs like to have a girl my age to talk to and hang out with at school. it sucks being lonely"
14167,"Yes. I‚Äôm literally always studying. Because of my coursework, I hardly get to see my friends since most of them are outside of the college. I‚Äôm usually in the library alone."
14168,"Ooh, I feel that one a little too hard"
14169,This
14170,"Don‚Äôt let it drag you down too much guys. I know it sucks and it‚Äôs perfectly normal to feel alone in college. Try to make time to do the things you genuinely enjoy and remember, it‚Äôs only four years. Life changes fast believe it or not. Don‚Äôt give up and know that all you‚Äôre doing is going to pay off in more ways than the degree. I wish you all the best."
14171,So how do those who socialize study?
14172,I feel it too man hang in there
14173,GOD I feel this in my soul. Last year I was best friends with my roommate and she and I were always doing stuff together or I‚Äôd be spending weekends with my boyfriend. I still spend weekends with him but I see her so much less often because we both moved off campus to different apartments. My new roommate and I get along and everything but we‚Äôre just such different people. I really wish I had more friends like my best friend but I really don‚Äôt know how to make friends. I joined clubs and I‚Äôm making acquaintances but not really making meaningful friendships. I usually end up spending my free time alone in my room because I just don‚Äôt know what else to do
14174,Deep truth
14175,"First semester in college is pretty much over, and I haven't made a single friend. I have nice classmates, but no one to hang out with. My roommate is popular so people always knock on the door looking for her. It kinda makes me feel extremely lonely. 

And I know this isnt a big deal, but i haven't gone to a single party yet..... I wanna get fucked up too üòî"
14176,I'm pretty much in the same situation. It's nice to know I'm not alone.
14177,"^^^^ This!!!!!! I was basically alone in high school. Three months not really speaking to anyone. Even at home. When I‚Äôd speak my voice would be quite and hoarse. 

I didn‚Äôt put in the time and effort to socialize. I allowed myself to be along. While it was definitely hard to find people (smallish town and high school) I knew that I couldn‚Äôt give myself the same excuse in college. 

Let me tell you. The pain and fear of meeting new people or going to that club you‚Äôre not sure you‚Äôll like is worth it in the end."
14178,"I didn‚Äôt have many friends in my first year of college. I had two close friends, but at the end of freshman year, they started to hang out with this guy because they both liked him (one more low key than the other). Eventually, one of them started dating him. I felt lonely then. They went to hang out just the three of them and I spent most of that time in my dorm room. 
Flash forward to senior year now. My friend is still dating that guy, but now I have a boyfriend. I try to include/invite friends to things so that my friends who are single do not feel alone like I did freshman year."
14179,My farts keep me company.
14180,"You make plans with friends and be efficient with the time you allot yourself to study. Sometimes you have to say no to going out, but other times hanging out will just be studying for different classes near each other. It all balances out. 

Before anyone judges, I‚Äôm taking 4 full credit classes, an honors seminar, I work in a lab, and I have a part time job. My classes aren‚Äôt so easy for me that I don‚Äôt have to study, but I make sure to stay on top of work so that I don‚Äôt need to cram over 10 hours in one day. 

You can do it. It‚Äôs a lesson that‚Äôs taken my 3+ years to learn"
14181,"1) Grades 

2) Social Life

3) Sleep

you can keep 2"
14182,"I had a similar mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a hick or an athlete so it‚Äôs impossible for me‚Äù in high school. Honestly the moment you quit letting yourself believe that and just say fuck it. It gets easier. 

This is coming from someone who went without friends for a long while. Almost by choice but I believe I didn‚Äôt have one. Learn from my mistakes man. Don‚Äôt put yourself through that"
14183,"Main key to keeping strong friends: effort. Same spot as you just last year (except I‚Äôm a guy), had people I could talk to but no one I could call a good friend.

Effort could be as simple as sending a heartfelt message every once in a while, or going and grabbing lunch with them occasionally. Prove that you‚Äôre willing to put the effort into a relationship and often times it will be reciprocated.

Effort = interest :)

Also tip to making new friends from someone who is making all his friends in the final half of college. Just start going out of your comfort zone. There‚Äôs only 2 things that will happen by introducing yourself to someone new:

1) You never see them again.

2) You stay in touch and possibly become good acquaintances.

It‚Äôs like a math equation, meet more and more people and more people will fall into slot 2."
14184,I have no friends. I haven't had any for a long time. You get used to it after a while. But I also have depression now so maybe that's not so good.
14185,i‚Äôm convinced i went to the wrong school lmao
14186,They can‚Äôt always cut cancer out of you.
14187,"I‚Äôm in my first year and my supposed best friend is acting like a different person. I have a lot of people around me but I don‚Äôt think they care about me sincerely. I just wish I had someone that I could count on to be there for me and not forget my existence when convenient. I would prefer having a few really close friends to having a bunch of ‚Äògood day‚Äô friends but that‚Äôs all I have right now.

Yes, I do feel lonely."
14188,"Good schools will also offer funding programs where the school will pay you a stipend if you want to do an unpaid internship somewhere.

Unfortunately, banning unpaid internships may lead to companies just shutting down their internship programs completely because often times interns are negative value. Having unpaid internships subsidized by schools or by government programs could be a good middle ground."
14189,"Our institution won‚Äôt give internship course credit unless the internship is a paying one. That should be a requirement for any internship course to avoid employers exploiting students for free labor. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this, OP!"
14190,"Also, some programs will kick you out if you're caught working on the weekends. It's one of the main reasons I decided to change my major. Completely unrealistic for life."
14191,"Many universities in the US require the student to pay for a 4-credit class called ""Internship"" where the university has arranged for you to work for a local employer.  

The employer doesn't pay you, but expects you to do about 20 hours of work per week.  

One college credit costs about $1,000, so the student is paying the university $4,000 for the opportunity of doing 20 hours of work without pay.  

The employers who agree to accept these students tend to get worn out from the high turnover of people each semester.  
They were probably excited and energetic to work with young people the first couple of years, but the quality of the experiences tend to continue to degrade farther than is healthy for any party involved in the arrangement.  

Summer Internships on the other hand are totally different.  

Employers offering summer internships are actively recruiting for good talent. They WANT good people, and they know they have to compete with other employers who also want them.  

This drives compensation to competitive levels."
14192,"That‚Äôs what my university does. Had an unpaid internship at a nonprofit over the summer, and I got subsidized housing and a stipend through my school"
14193,"I feel ya, I‚Äôve always hated those ‚Äúinternship‚Äù centric majors that require you to do one. One of the first things we were told as business majors ‚Äútime is money, any company that doesn‚Äôt want to pay you for the work you bring to the table doesn‚Äôt respect you nor your time. Your bringing them your expertise regardless of how little you may have‚Ä¶ just like everyone else. They‚Äôre getting paid you should be too.‚Äù"
14194,"Thank you for being a teacher üíõ I hope you get an excellent job as soon as possible. I got to do TWO semesters - one for ""pre"" student teaching, another full time. $8k out of my pocket. 

For those who don't know - Student teaching is ""clinical"" hours you must have to get certified, similar to medical degrees. So student teachers are not only NOT getting paid, but they are paying to do it for state-mandated credit. At least medical fields get the high starting salary to justify it."
14195,I hope you don't discover athletics.
14196,It's a requirement for all education majors.
14197,"Yep. Currently paying tuition to work a 34 hr work week. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm enjoying it and really learning a lot. But it‚Äôs very exhausting to work that on top of my actual paid job that I use to get gas to drive to my unpaid job. Plus still studying, doing homework, and taking a test every week."
14198,ya mine is required too
14199,"Not, OP, but i wish to write thank you for sharing your insight on the matter.
 Low quakiry
To be clear , it seems you are talking of internships for course fesit as being, but what should we make of corporate sutle internships."
14200,"""being used for free labor""

Actually, what qualifies as an unpaid internship is quite the opposite under DoL regulation. Usually you have to meet criteria such as the intern displacing the staff, rather than complementing them, the work being relevant to the student's area of study, and the organization not using them for a role they would have otherwise hired a paid person for. There are 4 or 5 other factors beyond those three and a regulator has discretion (it doesn't have to meet all factors but it must generally follow the patterns).

It's generally extremely hard to make money off of interns. They are usually a net loss regardless of pay. Organizations make up that loss by hiring from their intern pool: it's cheaper to have trained them as interns than salaried workers. If a company has unpaid interns and doesn't meet the DoL requirements then they run the risk of ending up like Conde Nast (huge fines and backpay for years of interns).

I'd say nearly all unpaid positions are offered by non-profits. And to play devil's advocate, many of those organizations just won't have interns at all if pay is required because of thin budgets. *Very* few non-profits have plush operating budgets. So I think the question needs to be whether cracking down on a bad practice is worth a lot of students in certain fields really not being able to get internships anymore."
14201,"Sounds good in theory. 

These internships are months long! I just finished my student teaching (unpaid). 

But the landlord doesn‚Äôt care. Gas/electric don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm an unpaid intern. Food costs money. I have to pay for transportation. 

It‚Äôs just exhausting and an unrealistic expectation to ask of adults."
14202,"Yes that‚Äôs the worst part!! (Just finished mine)

Not only am I unpaid. But I ALSO PAY TUITION for a whole semester"
14203,"Yes, we have an entire semester of student teaching as a requirement for graduation. In addition to other classroom observation requirements."
14204,"If you are referring to **mandatory** internships for graduation, absolutely. Or at minimum you shouldn't be paying for them and you should have expenses covered or maybe a stipend, especially given how much money they suck out of us to begin with. 

However if you are referring to the **optional** unpaid ones like maybe in the summer or something on the side during the semester that are often used to simply build your resume or network, then no I 100% disagree with you. If someone wants to volunteer their time, let them. Take those away and at least 60% of the seniors in my major at my uni would have to come up with completely new plans as they have lined up jobs, research or lab positions, etc. from unpaid internships they did over the years. And if you take away internships that just reimbursed expenses for like gas, that goes up to 80% of them. They have their place, so long as they are not mandatory."
14205,"I'm in a mandatory 1000 hour internship for my masters of social work.   I will be paid for the last 500 hours.  Chump change.  
It's not free.  I paid to do it."
14206,"So much of higher education is specifically made to keep low income individuals out of it. Mandatory unpaid internships are the most obligatory. How can you justify telling students they're required to work 30-40 hrs FOR FREE when you're already charging them an arm & a leg for tuition. 

Not to mention countless other factors, for example I do a lot of extracurriculars which are extremely valuable for what I want to transfer for but if I wasn't lucky enough to have parents willing to support me there's no feasible way I'd be able to do all that and survive. 

It's just blatant favoritism for students who come from families that can afford them working a full-time job literally for free. Usually those programs don't even offer much in the way of experience."
14207,It‚Äôs a medical lab science program and they‚Äôre pretty much all like that. Several months of lecture and then 3-6 months of clinical rotations.
14208,"If it don‚Äôt apply let it fly. I wouldn‚Äôt consider engineering a ‚Äúinternship centric major‚Äù mostly because by contrast to majors like teaching, social work, and a variety of others they‚Äôre forced to do internships as a part of their curriculum. FORCED. And expected to PAY for said internship not be paid. many majors let you CHOOSE if you want your internship to count for credit. Others not so much."
14209,"Lmao. Before I left SLP school, I would have had to pay for the honor of doing two externships plus an internship."
14210,It sucks even more if you are from a low income background and need to take on a job for living expenses and other stuff
14211,"Lmao my thoughts are the exact same as a nursing student. 12 hours/week with nurses who absolutely hate us. 30 hours/week for free is ridiculous though, even min wage would be desirable. What major is this?"
14212,yes i am required to participate for my class. 12 credit hours for 35 hours a week
14213,you said CO-op so I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre not from the US? There‚Äôs a difference between making and breaking your career vs You can‚Äôt graduate in other majors unless you PAY for a NON paid internship. And for said same majors you have to graduate and then PAY to sit for a licensing exam. Not in the slightest bit the same as what your talking about lol love the business jabs though.
14214,Most are paid in Natural Resources. Everyone want to major towards weird shit like accounting or physics so there is an overabundance of manipulatable rich kids for those
14215,"They should make mandatory unpaid internships work like nursing clinicals and the like, where faculty is there teaching them as the perform various tasks."
14216,"A scholarship that pays for tuition, room and board? Hardly ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù but now less of a conversation now that student athletes are starting to get marketing/branding rights. So really in the near future, students athletes can 1) get a free education and 2) get paid on top of that."
14217,My university expects 40 hours per week. It‚Äôs so unfeasible for so many
14218,Yaaaas. And closing those 16 tabs in Firefox
14219,Feels good 
14220,Ahh yes. The satisfaction. 
14221,It's Statics! I hate that course!!

"
14223,Not chrome? You heathen.
14224,I always feel like I'm deleting the info from my brain as well. Even though the info was never really in my brain. 
14225,Yeah I was going to say this looks like statics or material science 
14226,So you take pictures of each page of notes to organize them?
14227,Just wait for mechanics of materials 
14228,"Not OP, but that's what I do. My photos library is 70% pictures of notes. Saves a lot of time having all my class material in a single place on my computer."
14229,"Guessing notes you'll never use again, the joys of a college education"
14230,He could at least use an app to get better photos.. these would bother me so much.
14231,Only 16?  Wow that's impressively tame.
14232,"I too, am confused."
14233,All of my pictures are of the syllabus'. I can't keep track of them for jack diddly squat. 
14234,"HAHA , In my case it's also throwing out about 2 pounds of notes or 5 inches of stacked paper"
14235,There's an app called evernote that makes organizing pictures of notes easy 
14236,"I‚Äôm pretty sure I still have boxes of my class notes from all four years of college somewhere. Ya know, just in case an interviewer asks me about some random fact from a western culture class from five years ago.

At some point I really should digitalize them and add them to my google drive. I already keep all my old papers there anyway."
14237,"Oh god that's statics I'm guessing, I just finished that class. I landed an A but man was that a tough friggen class. I'm glad it's over. "
14238,Are you ready for dynamics? I just finished statics and things were difficult enough when they weren't moving. I imagine this semester is only going to be more difficult now that things are moving.
14239,"Most last minute info is super important (test tips, announcements, and other info you don‚Äôt get to know otherwise). Totally worth to stay until the last minute unless necessary imo."
14240,"In my experience if a professor goes over time it‚Äôs usually to give an important bit of information, so I usually stick around... unless I absolutely have somewhere to be. Also, in my experience, most professors won‚Äôt give a shit if you leave when class is supposed to be over."
14241,"I‚Äôm a prof, and I‚Äôm definitely guilty of trying to tell my students every little intricate detail of how to do well on the assignments, while leaving out little important details that would help. But, when I see it‚Äôs time and people are starting to leave. I release those little details in a flurry. So, yeah, we don‚Äôt mean to, but sometimes that last second info is really important."
14242,"I have one professor who ALWAYS goes over time. And not by 2-3 minutes, but by 10-15 minutes, and the very end of that is when he tells us our homework. It's bullshit"
14243,A professor who usually does not go over time must have important information to share if they run long.
14244,Oh that would not go over well. He's the head of the department and someone you don't wanna mess with. He'll hold a grudge for the rest of your college experience and call you out way more in class
14245,it is but it's also rude to go over. i had classes back to back soooooo keeping me from attending my scheduled class is not good
14246,Someone should remind him that class is ending 5-10 mins before so he can wrap up.
14247,"He does need to respect y'all's time though. Regardless of his status. And as a teacher, he needs to do so to properly teach. If everyone has to leave for their next class without knowing their assignments, they're gonna fail. He can't prioritize his class over other's either. If he does, you'd need to talk to someone above him."
14248,"I highly respect your profession. I‚Äôve never understood, however, why professors omit (intentionally or negligently) crucial information for succeeding on assignments. It seems to reward students that take an interest in the professor rather than the subject material. That‚Äôs not an absolute rule, but I‚Äôve anecdotally witnessed my peers receive higher grades for seeking info outside of the classroom (e.g. going to office hours, etc.). Do you agree (at least partially)?"
14249,"If you‚Äôre concerned, put a sign off in the chat. ‚ÄúSorry, I have to leave, my next class is starting‚Äù"
14250,In my experience it‚Äôs never more important than anything else. Some professors just don‚Äôt care
14251,Usually that is the case but then there's the professors who make it a habit of ending class later then scheduled.. Very upsetting when you have work or something right after then end up being late to that also...
14252,I used to have a professor keep us an hour late!! In retrospect it was a freshman class so none of us could‚Äôve known much better but I should‚Äôve complained to somebody or asked for help. I would cry afterwards or during from exhaustion.
14253,"I would guess that your peers who are attending office hours and such are not, in fact, getting higher scores because they ""showed an interest"" in your professor. Instead, I think it's likely they were going to office hours because they were very invested in thoroughly understanding the subject matter and that their higher level of investment and interest in the class was likely reflected in the quality of their assignments. Just my two cents as someone who attends office hours for the classes that really interest me!"
14254,"They need to respect your time as well. When you are in the corporate world, meetings need to stay on schedule out of respect for everyone."
14255,"Prof here. If I run over time, you have every right to log. However, if I leave 5 minutes at the end of class for wrap-up, reminders, and questions, and I'm still speaking and you choose to log, well, thats just rude AF."
14256,Dean of students probably. You could ask one of your other professors though. They might know who's over the department heads and may be able to help you through the situation and how to properly escalate.
14257,What magical world do you work in?
14258,And some think it‚Äôs ok to turn up twenty minutes late and add the time at the end.
14259,The prof who teaches in the classroom before me always goes over time. I have to set up a ton of tech to teach a class where half the students are online and half and in person. It is SO RUDE and I‚Äôm over it
14260,It's college man. If you gotta do something/go somewhere then just leave. I doubt they'd care that much if at all.
14261,"Holy shit. I'm a sophomore so I know better, but at the same time, we need to know our homework"
14262,"Hmm...I can‚Äôt vouch for other instructors. I teach composition, and my assignments are heavily detailed and provide more freedom over the course of the semester, but every assignment comes with the assignment sheet itself, a ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù of common problems for each topic, and a sample essay. Basically, when I was a student as a millennial, the most frustrating thing for me was that professors had exact requirements but wrote none of them down. There was a list of hundreds of mistakes you could make in their heads, but the assignment was ‚Äúwrite an essay about a thing‚Äù written in chalk on the board. So, my class is approached in the opposite way. There‚Äôs tons of info on each assignment so you can do as well or as poorly as you want. My students this semester have said that, on the days we have lessons, they would prefer if I prioritized assignment lectures over content lectures, so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done."
14263,"I 100% agree. Thing is, no one has another class immediately after his so he thinks it's okay. I also don't know who's higher up than him. I don't wanna go to the president of the university, but my professor is the head of my department"
14264,Let's the professor know why you have to go (and that you aren't just leaving for no reason) and why they need to stay on time
14265,"I‚Äôd report it but it‚Äôs intimidating and easier said than done. I only get a fifteen minute break between classes so I couldn‚Äôt afford that missed time and I think it‚Äôs horrible that your professor is taking time when students should be socializing, eating, relaxing to continue talking."
14266,"I‚Äôd try to get around that by asking him 5 minutes before class ends what the homework is.

Maybe ‚ÄúProfessor I‚Äôm sorry to interrupt but I have a question, what‚Äôs our homework?‚Äù

And if they ask why, tell them you have work maybe? Lol

Alternatively, like another user posted below, you could put it in the chat. Basically my point is if you stress that you must be somewhere else and that staying late is not an option, you‚Äôd probably be okay."
14267,"If you can, keep records of the things he does. Note on paper when classes start and end each day. Note the comments he's made towards students and who. Note what assignments he assigns after class ends and at what time he informs you of them. Get all that as evidence incase you bring it to someone higher up. And find another student who can back you up and verify your evidence if not a few people."
14268,"What about if an instructor has had to go to a hybrid model where he meets each half of the class one time a week, giving them the same info, but relying on them to watch the other online lesson video, but they don‚Äôt watch the lessons? I have frequently gone over 5 and 7 minutes this semester, but only because I‚Äôm trying to force all the content into half the time. But they also don‚Äôt have to come and entirely second day of the week (originally, they thought they‚Äôd be coming twice a week, now only once, but they still won‚Äôt watch the extra online content I‚Äôve hand made)."
14269,This advice is so much better than ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúgo to class‚Äù
14270,"Don‚Äôt worry I have been in that position before also. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys peace and quite and I committed an hour to school everyday. Back in high school I barely talked to anyone and my freshman year of college I was the same way. I would literally go to my classes and not talk to anyone. Funny story: I didn‚Äôt like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy. Now I know you will be asking how did I get to this point. Well I was told by someone close to me at the sophomore year that to be successful you must be able to communicate and network with people. So at the start of my sophomore year I started my attempt to network. I started small like sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class. I would ask them how there weekend was and how there other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we talk every week even though he is 10 states away. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some. 

And clubs definitely help. I joined my first club in my masters degree and I wish I done it sooner. I met about 8 guys that I hung out with all the time."
14271,You are welcome and good luck!
14272,I'm having problems networking in classes. Do you have suggestions? How did you do it?
14273,[deleted]
14274,I 100% agree. The knowledge is important but the connections are even more importanter.
14275,"Ok but get this: Social anxiety.  


I mean these are amazing tips but no way will I be able to talk to 20 people per class.  
I'm already glad I found one friend in a class of 20 people haha.  
But great tips!"
14276,I thought I would try and offer some advice that was a little bit different.
14277,I studied electrical engineering.
14278,"So I can‚Äôt comment too much on the 9-5 job yet because I haven‚Äôt started my job yet. I start in about a month but that was by choice. I wanted to take the summer off to do a learn some other non career related skills. I also took this time to find a job that I was not stuck in a cubical and I would enjoy doing. This is where the networking came in. I contacted my friends and asked them what there job was like and if there was any open positions they could recommend me for. Since I stayed and got my masters, my friends from undergrad had been working a year so they were really helpful. My advice would be do as much as possible to give you leverage when looking for a job. I did study abroad, had outstanding recommendations, had a masters degree, and had a high gpa where I could look for a job I liked and they would want to hire me. I have felt down and lost before when college started but when my classes started I figured out what I liked to do and ran with it. I hope this helps."
14279,Oh I got it and I fight it all the time. It took me 2 years to get to that point and I did see a lot of the same people in my classes so that helped. Once I gained the confidence it became easier for me to talk to more people.
14280,I would say it is much easier to make friends in college because there are a bunch of people that moved away from home and all of their friends. Kept your head high because with that open mind you will learn so much about your self. You are welcome and good luck with your studies!
14281,"Great tips! As a recent grad myself, I would add‚Äîget involved with extracurriculars! There are so many different student groups on campus, you‚Äôre bound to find one that serves your interests. It‚Äôs such a great way to meet people and make new friends. I went in with a ‚Äútoo cool‚Äù attitude and thought being in clubs was lame. Jokes on me because the people who were more involved on campus ended up with tight knit friend groups, networking opportunities, and lots of meaningful experiences."
14282,"I‚Äôm in my senior year and I have a few tips that have helped me to maintain a 4.0 with as little stress as possible.

Once you have the syllabi from all of your classes make an excel folder. In this folder you will put each day of class on the left and then you‚Äôll list the class names on the top row. Fill in all of the important things like assignment due dates, tests, and projects due. Make sure you look at this at least once every few days so nothing creeps up on you.

I always schedule my classes Monday through Thursday which gives me a 3 day weekend. I use my Friday‚Äôs to an advantage as I use this day to do all of my homework for the upcoming week. This means I don‚Äôt have to worry about doing homework the night before class. All I have to worry about during the week is studying or reading etc.

A way that I‚Äôve been able to maintain my grades is by keeping up with my grades. I calculate my own class grades with my assignments and tests. This helps me to focus as a semester goes on. If I see I have such a high average that I only need a 80 on the final to get an A then I study less on this class and if I see I need a 95+ then I study much harder for this class."
14283,What did you study?
14284,I don‚Äôt think the 20 per class is necessary. I spoke to about 3 people in my classes and that was fine. You don‚Äôt need to be BFFs with everyone to make connections
14285,Thank you! I am starting college on Monday. This really helped!
14286,"Clubs are the best answer to this!! Plus, it sounds like this is your first time in college. Don't feel like you're failing at making friends; it's still August. My university hasn't even started undergrad classes yet. It's super early."
14287,You don't see too many engineers or doctors without a college degree.
14288,"Hey man! You‚Äôre truly an inspiration...
I‚Äôm an international student going to move in tomorrow... I‚Äôm pretty nervous about adapting to the academics style. Definitely scared of writing essays.... Any tips?
Thanks for your time!"
14289,"Yes, I really dislike when people say to be yourself. Like what even happened to self-improvement?"
14290,I hated writing essays because I was terrible at them. I found grammar leaf to be of some help but the best help is practice. I got good at writing technical papers because I wrote so many of them. I still struggle with reading a book and analyzing what the 300 year old author meant. Good luck!
14291,Sounds like you regret what you did in college
14292,"21 y/o male here. Transfer student starting at state college from CC. Networking proving to be hard partially because everyone already has their clique established. Partially because everyone is intimidated by me and i dont know why. I look them in the eyes and they look down. Maybe because im older or because im 6'4"" or my resting bitch face idk. If I have the opportunity to smile Im much more approachable but I cant just smile all the time while walking alone lmao."
14293,"If you feel comfortable, ask that friend to have your back in class and make sure you're included. I would (and have) definitely talk to your professors about your anxiety. For me, my classes are small enough that social anxiety doesn't kick in, but I let my professors know that I may get antsy and have to step out of the room for a few minutes and why that is. The professor should take care to not call on you if your hand isn't raised and make sure you feel included in the class. If you have official accommodations, they'll have to follow them."
14294,Focus on the things that really interest you. This is the place where you can be true to yourself. Be friendly in class on the first day. Everyone is nervous that is really important to remember.
14295,Don‚Äôt worry I have been in that position before also. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys peace and quite and I committed an hour to school everyday. Back in high school I barely talked to anyone and my freshman year of college I was the same way. I would literally go to my classes and not talk to anyone. Funny story: I didn‚Äôt like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck.

14296,"Same here, also starting Monday. Lovely tips, you see like a great dude."

14298,SOMEONE GUILD THIS MANS
14299,I mean at this point it seems like your roommate should be kicked out of your room ü´§
14300,"I don‚Äôt know how you are doing like financially, but if having a car is the only thing stopping you from moving, you can rent a uhaul pickup truck for a little over $20. Might be worth it"
14301,"Fuck your roommate. Can you rent a uhaul for a day and get some friends to help you move? Uhaul are semi affordable and depending on what you have you should be able to get everything out within the day. I would deff escalate this to someone higher up, this level of immaturity a aggressiveness has no place in a college setting."
14302,"Report it to your RA again. If she said something as servere as that she can get kicked out. It‚Äôs at a point where it‚Äôs no longer a roomate conflict that can get resolved.

Your safety is at risk ."
14303,Right? Like why does OP have to uproot their life just because their roommate is acting up
14304,absolutely.. and the RA can help file the report so action can be taken sooner to get you into a different room
14305,"I don‚Äôt have my license which could get in the way, but I do have a friend that drives so I‚Äôll see if they can help"
14306,"She doesn‚Äôt have to record it, just of make a complaint.  If she gets locked out ever again, call campus security.  They will make a record of it.  Also talk to your advisor.  They know the school better than you.  They can help."
14307,Have you tried asking her why the FUCK she gives a damn about what you do and where you spend your time?
14308,Yeah I have. It‚Äôs bc she‚Äôs jealous I‚Äôm spending time with my friends and not her even tho she‚Äôs on discord 24/7. She‚Äôs an attention whore to the highest degree
14309,"i work in ResLife and I know you said you‚Äôre in the process of talking with the HD, but when you do.. I would definitely mention that you feel unsafe in your room. That‚Äôs usually the fastest route to having a room change, as opposed to them just viewing it as a roommate conflict. 

what she did was wrong and put you in an uncomfortable and dangerous situation. don‚Äôt be scared to lay it all out there when you meet with HD tomorrow. 

I hope you get a resolution soon"
14310,I might. I‚Äôm trying to stay in my building or nearby but I‚Äôm on a waitlist so I‚Äôm seeing how that goes
14311,"Don't ruin your hearing just to piss her off. Annoying your roommate back is temporary, but tinnitus is forever."
14312,It‚Äôs to the point where I just BLAST music into my AirPods every time I‚Äôm in the room so I can‚Äôt hear her. It pisses her off SO BAD which is what makes it so satisfying
14313,"So your resident director should either get you moving help or force your roommate to move.  Tell them your roommate is emotionally abusive and creating a hostile living situation.  Document- keep dated notes in a journal of your issues.  Most colleges have maintenance vehicles or student transportation vans,  see if they can help with that out Uber costs."
14314,"If res life is involved, they might be able to have the stuff moved.  I moved across campus in my junior year, because a friend had a roommate move out of her suite.  It was between semesters, so I just had to box up my stuff and res life took care of moving it."
14315,Start ignoring her even harder.
14316,[removed]
14317,"Bruh is the lack of car to move stuff the only thing stopping you from moving out? I would eagerly walk 10 miles with two full suitcases if it meant moving out from conditions like this. Just do it, it‚Äôs few hours of physical suffering that will save you from much worse mental suffering"
14318,"Also definitely make a title IX complaint, and make sure housing knows you‚Äôre doing that. Saying she wants you to get assaulted is definitely crossing a line"
14319,Or a truck from Home Depot. They‚Äôre cheaper and hourly.
14320,This might sound weird but I remember my little sister having issues with her roommate and nothing was being done. My dad called and threatened the college and they immediately removed her from there and gave her her own room. I am pretty sure he threatened to sue and it wasn't as bad as what is going on with you.
14321,I‚Äôve already attempted to have a calm conversation with her and it ended with her calling me the f slur (I‚Äôm a bisexual woman) and screeching at me. I‚Äôm also terrified of confrontation and this whole experience just made it so much worse
14322,"It would take me at least 2 days to move all my shit out and I‚Äôm genuinely scared of what she would do to me if I had to keep coming back to move out. The bitch never leaves our room except for classes which we have at the same time (bc she wants to monitor me like a psycho). There are also only 2 openings for room switching here: one in the same building I‚Äôm in now with a 5 week waiting list, and the other with a 10 week waiting list that‚Äôs across campus. I‚Äôm on the waiting list but I‚Äôm most likely not gonna get them"
14323,"that's pretty serious. You should file a bullying complaint against her, I'm sure she can get suspended or at the very least get removed from the dorm for behaving this way"
14324,"i mean she seems pretty unwell, i wouldn‚Äôt be so bold to say she won‚Äôt harm OP. you don‚Äôt know her."
14325,"Honestly I‚Äôm at that point. Im on a waiting list to change my room in my building but I can‚Äôt until the end of March at the latest

Edit: *earliest. I can‚Äôt until the end of March at the EARLIEST"
14326,Would your RA be willing to drive you? Or one of their friends? You could probably pay someone with a truck in town to just transport your stuff across campus. My university has a kind of marketplace we can post for things like that
14327,"I agree with those who suggested going to the title ix office because that seems appropriate. Her saying she hopes you get assaulted is unacceptable, and I think it provides further evidence that her behavior is malicious rather than a difference in living habits. Contacting the dean of students office might be something to look into too. 

When you have that conversation with your housing director, I would focus on how unsafe her comments made you feel and how much of a safety risk it is for her to purposely lock you out like that. The rate of sexual assaults on college campuses is much higher than it should be, and your housing director should be aware of that already so it's not something to joke about. 

Also, mentally, I would frame these conversations as a ""what are you going to do to help me feel safe at this university"" kind of discussion, rather than a ""please help me with my roommate"". At this point, you're not asking for help, you're there to listen to what *they* plan to do to take action to address an untenable situation with someone who is displaying problematic behavior. Ideally, they should make *her* move, which is something you can bring up. Either way, this has escalated far beyond the point of personality clashes and the administration needs to step in here."
14328,"Honestly I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs LIKELY, but it definitely could happen. I‚Äôm stronger than her for sure, but I can definitely see it getting physical"
14329,I love the dichotomy in the top two comments
14330,"thought I was on r/rstats and was about to reee. I'm a big fan of R but the language is a little niche, and programming in general isn't for everyone."
14331,[The duality of man](https://imgur.com/MEhodhd)
14332,I hate the dichotomy in the top two comments
14333,Cause I suck at statistics lol
14334,This is so wholesome :)
14335,"I hated stats in school, LOVE it at work. Academia has a crazy disconnect from real world applications of statistics"
14336,oh i thought you just preferred normal R which confused me because i thought they were pretty much the same other than studio having a more friendly interface
14337,"IKR!
He wanted to drive the point of how correlation is not the same as causation and this is what he used."
14338,why?
14339,Perfectly balanced
14340,"I'm just terrible at stats, which is bad because half my job is gonna be stats so I'm trying to learn more over the summer."
14341,As all things should be
14342,"oh my, this is great"
14343,So do you need any more proof that R is clearly superior to MATLAB after this one?
14344,"My stats professor was pretty rough too. I got a B in that class but only because he bumped us a letter grade for volunteering at a food bank.

I like stats but its gonna take me a while to figure out what the hell to do and what everything means."
14345,"I mean start with the stats sub. I got a C in my first advanced stats class (partly bit off too much as a freshman, partly partied too much, partly an awful professor). I said fuck it to stats until I had an internship building a log regression model for real data and loved it."
14346,Just took my first class with R recently
14347,"I nearly failed stats not because I didn't understand the coursework or do well on homework, quizzes, or tests, but only because the professor didn't like my writing style on written exams. Some professors are ridiculous man... Cool he/she bumped your grade for volunteering though."
14348,"I never really met anyone who I became acquainted with by their introductions in class. I always just talk to the nearest person next to me, or just be social overall."
14349,bruh every professor be like ‚Äútell me a random fun fact about yourself‚Äù
14350,"You cannot be successful in my class or the vast majority of jobs related to it without participating and building relationships.  However, I try to have prompts that make it easier... like, 

Please introduce yourself and share your favorite ice cream... then I have data to share about historical or regional ice cream preferences.

or

Say your first name or preferred name and tell us about your favorite teacher.  Then I share data about which age group (primary or secondary) has the bigger impact.

or 

Share your name, and the level of education your grandparents had (each one).  Date showing the norm vs college students.

or Introduce yourself and share your favorite sexual experience... just kidding, I only say that to wake up the back row."
14351,"Once my Broadcasting professed had a giant table of starbursts and told us after we took some that you tell 1 fun fact per starbursts

I had 6

Needless to say I was punished for my greed"
14352,"Me thinking: ""speaking with people you idiot"""
14353,"...üò¨ brb, gotta go update the PowerPoint for my first class..."
14354,"if you have a class with less than 25 people, keep the icebreaker."
14355,They‚Äôre trying to remember your name and start to get to know you within the context of the class. These kinds of ice breakers seems silly but they‚Äôre really helpful for that.
14356,"Yeah, that‚Äôs how I made all my friends over the years in classes when I was a student. 

For my classes, I have them introduce themselves just to the people they sit right next to.  I teach mostly freshmen and it‚Äôs a community college, so they won‚Äôt meet anyone in dorms. Gives them a chance to know 2-3 other students but without the formal introductions."
14357,[deleted]
14358,Maybe I‚Äôm the oddball here but I never made friends nor have I seen others make friends with people they met in class.
14359,"Building relationships and introducing yourself to the class are different things to me. Maybe i‚Äôm just a complete oddball, but i‚Äôve never once built a relationship through class introductions. That typically happens by speaking to the person 1 on 1 or with people in smaller groups. In fact, I forget 80% of their names right after they say it when everyone‚Äôs introducing themselves because there are so many people I start focusing on the next one and end up forgetting the last one. Then by the end I cannot remember any of them."
14360,Seriously. What the fuck do they expect you to say to that?
14361,"I prefer it with a super short prompt like favorite movie or dream vacation place. The ones that ask for an open-ended ""fun fact"" can die in a fire. That's just mean."
14362,You guys are wayyyyyy too socially averse. I guess that‚Äôs a side affect of probing Reddit.
14363,I will and I will use strategies that I know are beneficial because I am a professional. Because you don't like something doesn't mean is is useless.
14364,"Man during my orientation they did the same shit to me. I didn't know what was going on, I just grabbed a handful cuz free candy. I grabbed 21 pieces üò≠ most drawn out introduction of myself I've ever had to give I was searching through every reach of my mind for more ""fun facts"""
14365,"I suffer from manageable depression, drink heavily and maintain a cheery disposition as the world üó∫ falls apart üòõ"
14366,"Hmm sounds familiar was it Dr Yoder, she‚Äôs my psych proffesor and had my class doing the same thing lol"
14367,Well you are a computer science and stats major so I think that explains it a bit lol.
14368,"But I teach teachers to teach classes of students.  Building relationships is an essential skill and correlates significantly with improved student learning outcomes. 

Relationships are built on more than names. One of the best ways to recall a name is to associate it with something that is significant.  Often you might not recall the name, but you can recall something else.  Learning to make a connection with a name utilizes cognitive functioning in the brain.  

So Mark becomes Mark the guy who likes any ice cream with peanut butter.

Jane becomes Jane whose grandma graduated from Harvard.

Pete become Pete the guy who does furry... nevermind.

Often, at the beginning, the related item is what is recalled. That is because your brain wants to relate to the shared thing. You see the hottie from class at a party but can't remember her name, but decide to roll the dice... ""Hey you are the girl who is into Tillamook ice cream, I have been to the factory where they make it, it's awesome.""  Even if you don't recall the name you still make a connection becauae you relate.  Probably one reason why relationship building is important to being a successful teacher- you feel connected."
14369,"I get that introductions can be difficult for some people, but it can be important, especially in smaller class environments, to know the other people. It's good morale building and can help build bridges with other people if it comes to it.

If you're antisocial and dont like talking much in terms of intros, I still think it's important. Try having a short couple sentences to introduce yourself, it will work just fine."
14370,[removed]
14371,Oh that makes a lot of sense now. I also did find it useful in remembering my classmates as well. Like hey look that's Daniel who likes to eat fish or something
14372,Also a lot of people on here are CS or Engineering majors. That sort of interest for some reason does corelate with introversion
14373,I teach a 100 level class - it helps me connect the class to their lives. It tells me what level of participation the class may be willing to work with. It also gives me an excuse to give everyone 10 easy points in a class of 1000 points.
14374,It definitely happens!
14375,"I get ya man, but you can't be an educator without overcoming those social anxieties.  There are certainly some fields that are much better suited.  Keep up the good work."
14376,"Having a class of more than ten people introduce themselves does not help. I had a professor be like ok everyone Imma give you ten minutes to just talk to the people sitting next to you. That was cool. Don't remember if that helped either, but it's much more likely to I feel"
14377,[deleted]
14378,"You could, no harm in mentioning it. However, your professor may just have a dark sense of humor. My professor had multiple files labeled ""blackmail materials"" that were on his desktop whenever he shared his screen"
14379,"It's very unlikely to be anything but yeah you can go ahead and tell someone. 

Probably just a context issue. Maybe someone is joking about their kids or something. But it never hurts to be cautious."
14380,No one is selling kids through Gmail
14381,Or use gmail‚Ä¶
14382,That‚Äôs just what someone selling kids through Gmail would say.
14383,"Yeah you might be right, it could as innocuous as a dumb joke.  But considering that is an honest explanation, I‚Äôd feel wrong going as far as reporting him.  I really don‚Äôt know what the most reasonable action to take is"
14384,"It's like hiring a hitman to murder his wife and the first email he gets is ""killer for hire""."
14385,"OP: reports professor

Professors email: Children for Sales Advertisements"
14386,"Given that that's the Gmail icon, my guess is it's an email from one of those social activism websites like [Change.org](https://Change.org) or Avaaz who send out emails with shocking subject lines to try to get people on their mailing list to sign petitions/donate to whatever cause."
14387,"Yeah I could see it.  More than likely it‚Äôs something along those lines (a joke that is).  In this case it‚Äôs definitely not intentional though (otherwise he would have been more explicit - also I noticed he turned red part way through, assumably upon realizing the tab was left open)"
14388,"Even if you report it, it seems to be a private email account so your prof. has no obligation to let anyone check their emails. I also don‚Äôt think that actual child trafficking happens via Gmail and with explicit subject header. It is clearly some joke - either inappropriately for class or it had nothing to do with you."
14389,"Nothing bad should happen to him in that case. If it's a university email they might even just check it without telling him. You aren't accusing him of anything with this type of report, it's a more general ""you might want to take a closer look at this"" type thing. The university will peek at it and move on after validating nothing is wrong."
14390,"Im no child trafficker but if I were I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be sending gmails titled ‚Äúchildren for sale‚Äù, and I definitely wouldnt have the tap open while sharing my screen. 

I would be more afraid, if it were on an incognito tab."
14391,Not unless you've seen the entire and know the context of it.
14392,"Since you can't see what the full title of that page is reporting it will most likely resolve in nothing happening. However, I would still report it to the Dean of the department as something that concerned you. 

Most profs use university computers which can be searched by the institution."
14393,"YOU GUYS,  this is not a child trafficker. Nobody even remotely close to the orbit of a child trafficker would be that stupid. To literally spell out their crime in the *subject of an email*.  The fact that ANY of you are taking this seriously,  even by ""just being safe"", is beyond cringe. This is so obviously ~~not~~ real **that it's going to make the news that a bunch of Redditors thought it was real**"
14394,Oh piss off
14395,It‚Äôs not a university email (gmail rather than outlook).  Okay I think you‚Äôre right though.  Who at the university should I best contact?
14396,"I mean you could report it but also what idiot titles their email with a blatant crime on Gmail of all places.

Most likely this has to do with a specific doll brand. It's escaping my mind right now but I know some collectors call them children, weird, but doll collecting is a weird hobby."
14397,"Honestly when it comes to children's safety it tends to be best to err on the side of caution. If OP's prof has a good reason for that email, he/she will be able to explain it. It will be uncomfortable and awkward on the part of the prof, but so what? A bit of awkwardness is significantly less bad than child trafficking."
14398,Exactly
14399,"Johnny has 5 children and crushing debt. The average black market cost for children is significantly higher than his current total debt, but his debt is growing at a linear rate for the next 5 years. At what intervals should Johnny sell his children to offset his ever growing debt until the period it is finished growing?"
14400,"Yeah, this is the thing though. I have that kind of dark humor and if I was a prof, I would be cautious about it.

Not just because what the students may have gone through but also because you can easily be reported and it can escalate, which can ruin your reputation as a prof.

I think, if you want to express that kind of dark humor (why not, it's damn hilarious), then having something more innocent is your best way, like a tab that says ""how to eat some good as.."" where it cuts off because it's too long and then reveal to the students and say ""oh, that tab, yeah, I just wanted to know how to eat some good asparagus, you guys got any advice"".

So, it's most likely he is joking but honestly, I wouldn't have the courage to joke about selling children."
14401,Conduct offices or dean. U can do an anonymous report and request that they just say ‚Äúa student‚Äù or ‚Äústudents‚Äù noticed what was on the screen!
14402,"Yeah I feel like it's too obvious? Like no one would browse that on school wifi, and they would definitely have code names for things instead of ""children for sale"""
14403,"I disagree. No need to bring humiliation and possible repercussions to this professors job. It wasn't mentioned in class so there was no intentional harm. We all make mistakes, no need to shine a light on this one."
14404,"Yeah I thought that too, I‚Äôd imagine actual child trafficking probably only happens on the dark web, and surely not on a professor‚Äôs work laptop.  Right?  With that in mind, would you consider this appropriate to report?"
14405,There is no harm in mentioning that you think your professor is a human trafficker?
14406,"Lmao, exactly. Sounds like a joke. My family does this all the time (send each other vids of our kids doing crazy things with captions like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm placing them in shipping boxes as we speak‚Äù or ‚Äú$2 a child, today only‚Äù lmao). 

I highly, highly doubt a genuine child trafficker would be not only stupid enough to send such/receive such an email, but idiotic enough to show the email to an entire class on zoom."
14407,This could unironically be true as professors do conduct research with children.
14408,I think he thought he was being vulnerable and maybe creating a connection with the audience through that? Idk but I can totally understand how things seem one way in your head and actually play out completely different in real life lol. It's strange and funny but I hope he doesn't beat himself up *(or off)* over it too much
14409,Nah this dude is SUPER religious so I think he honestly just felt convicted to share that with us lol
14410,He‚Äôs actually extremely hot lol. Like a 9/10 I‚Äôd say
14411,"> It‚Äôs strange and funny but I hope he doesn‚Äôt beat himself up (or off) over it too much

His group‚Äôs company was Facebook. Not sure why but he managed to somehow link Facebook to social media in general being bad for his porn addiction. It was just very out of place and weird.
14416,the other 1/10 is his charisma ratings

14433,But is it okay? At least one out of every 3 porn videos includes sexual violence towards women according to a study done in 2021. This has effects on violence in real life

14435,"Oh then it makes total sense 

Back when I was a Christian, my youth group leader confiscated everyone's phone and looked through their browser history.

I got caught watching pornhub and was forced to confess. It was really embarrassing but this is EXTREMELY common in a Christian community."

14498,I‚Äôm a whole 6‚Äô4 man covered in tattoos with two sleeves in college right now with a hammock of probably 20 Pok√©mon plushies above my bed. It‚Äôs definitely not weird for you to have things you like in your dorm but I understand the hesitation. Do what makes you comfortable and if they judge you that‚Äôs really on them!
14499,It's not weird at all. You won't be judged for liking or having stuffed animals in your dorm.
14500,"Gonna be honest, to some people it would be pretty weird, yeah.

For others, they'll think it's endearing, cool/cute, or part of your ""aesthetic""... Or they won't care. 

Hope for the latter, but be realistic and prepare for the former.

Depending on your school's crowd, you may end up with a roommate who is one or the other, and whether you care or not is up to you. 

I suggest that you work on not caring, but if you do still care, I recommend you bring at most... 5, pr at least 3 of your favorites. I don't recommend bringing too many anyway since dorms can be small, and if you're sharing the space things might feel a bit cluttered, even with the hammock. Good luck

Source: Am an autistic girl who walks with her stuffed animals everywhere for comfort, even in my school bag. In public I've gotten a lot of weird looks, but my roommate just assumed that I was into the soft girl aesthetic (or whatever you call it) lol"

14523,What‚Äôs weird is caring about whether some random girl online happens to like stuffed animals
14524,"This should be the top answer. My friends and I were 100% the assholes who would have made fun of anyone with 10 stuffed animals in a hammock in their room.

But we were just that‚Ä¶ assholes. I do not look back on the person I was in college fondly. I was an insufferable asshole for most of college. I grew up somewhere mid-junior year when I met my now husband who was like, ‚Äúwhy are you such an asshole to people?‚Äù and really helped me change.

So just know that yeah, some people will be rude as hell about it. But fuck those people. They‚Äôre just assholes.

And hopefully some day they grow out of it."

14526,no bitches?
14527,I have no idea what it is but I love this word
14528,"Even in poly sci or humanities, professors shouldn't be overly political. Fields about the discussion of politics need to be as open minded as possible."
14529,"Sounds good. People can have different political opinions.  It annoys me when a professor expresses them no matter if they are conservative or liberal.  Mask safety and barriers are not political matters.  No excuse for that.

Edit: I didn't proofread my first post.  Some grammatical errors that I have now corrected. Sorry!"
14530,I had a biology TA who gave a presentation during our last lab of the semester when we had nothing to do that was basically ‚ÄúWhy you should be a Democrat‚Äù
14531,"As a poli sci major, we could care less about politics in the classroom"
14532,I‚Äôm an atheist and my professor made all the atheists raise our hands and then asked us to explain evolution because he thought it was a myth. In an anthropology course.
14533,"A good political science professor  and student who major in it , sees views from both sides of the spectrum and see why candidates, NGOs, IGOS are like that.  They have to be curious why and try to be as a non bias as possible!"
14534,Hold up this anthropology professor thought evolution was a myth?! That is.....scary. It's not required to believe in evolution to be in anthropology but I would think it'd make things a lot harder.
14535,"This is what it‚Äôs like being a conservative in college as well. It goes both ways. I‚Äôve had friends lose points on essays because the topic did not match what the professor wanted. Keep politics out of college classrooms.
Edit: wording"
14536,">the USA has done more for the environment than any other country 

How can any professional in the environment field say that with a straight face."
14537,"Exactly. If you‚Äôre taking upper div poli sci courses, you really should be getting exposed to stuff beyond normative ‚Äúhow it should be‚Äù readings. I know the social sciences get a bad rap, but there is some really great quantitative research out there in the field."
14538,100% agree. He sounds like a dick who‚Äôs probably up Trumps Orange asshole.
14539,"As much as I know this happens, I (TA) had a super conservative student who had to write about socialism vs capitalism. 

The way the assignment was structured by the lead prof was that the kids would pick a topic (cats vs dogs), turn in a thesis statement about their opinion - 1-2 sentences. 
Then we were told to make them flip their opinion and write an essay from the opposite point of view. So the two most opposite wing political students in my class picked socialism vs capitalism and both were pretty upset that they had to write about an opinion they didn‚Äôt believe, but the student that was assigned capitalism over socialism (wanted soc/cap) used good sources & I could tell they genuinely *tried to be believably persuasive. The student who was assigned socialism over capitalism (wanted cap/soc) used Alex Jones and Breitbart as sources even after we covered unreliable sources and said ‚Äúso I guess if you‚Äôre a Nazi, socialism is better than capitalism.‚Äù 

Like I am **certain that there are leftist professors that people have to bend their opinions to appease. However, I take those critiques with a big grain of salt, because I *know people (on both sides) like to play the victim when they get a bad grade for just not doing the work correctly."
14540,"That was one reason why I disliked sociology. It was their opinion that mattered, not mine. I was doing educational sociology and my final project was on how boys are having lower test scores than girls: is it because girls are inherently better at studying, because they have to work twice as hard or is it because they are given more help than boys? I had resources from the library to back it up, stories from my life, etc. and tried to be as non biased as possible. 

The entire Q&A after was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a female misogynist!‚Äù more or less from the professor and a few students. I just found the topic kind of interesting to discuss, I didn‚Äôt do it to say ‚Äúgirls are icky and I‚Äôm a girl so I‚Äôm icky!"
14541,"Almost all conservative students have lied about their viewpoints on essays/projects to get a fair grade. I‚Äôve had to do it in 2 courses, and I‚Äôm a STEM student where essays are extremely rare. It must be hell for students with a writing-heavy major."
14542,Depends on the major and location of the school I guess. I was a business major in the south and you would think literally any regulations are Communist propaganda meant to destroy the small ethical man simply trying to expand his fortune. I don't think we can ever eliminate it but it would be nice if we could keep it to a bare minimum.
14543,"Yes, and I attend a public college. He also asked me to explain why I didn‚Äôt believe in miracles."
14544,[deleted]
14545,He's the only one that teaches this class unfortunately...
14546,"Aight man, I really was just mad about the anti-mask stuff. The other rhetoric pissed me off but I live in a conservative state so I'm exposed to it every day. And the title of my post said ""overly political professors,"" nof ""conservative professors,"" so I'm referring to the professors on both sides. In this specific example, prof happened to be conservative. It's not that deep."
14547,refusing to use a plexiglass divider endangers people. that‚Äôs far beyond political
14548,"Ngl he sounds like a dick. I understand that professors have political opinions, and as long as it doesn't detract from the class (eg: professor spends every lecture ripping into politics rather than course material), I'm fine with it.

Also through my experience people like this don't really make it far.

That being said, he does teach soil science, which tends to be pretty closely tied to agronomy, and that is pretty conservative."
14549,Showing that climate change is real is science. Talking what we do about climate change is when politics enters the conversation.
14550,Interesting that the professor in question is conservative given the heavy predominance of leftists in college faculty.
14551,Saying climate change isn‚Äôt real is exactly the same as saying COVID-19 isn‚Äôt real
14552,I mean the *raging leftists* probably aren't putting student's health in danger by not following safety precautions. Most leftists believe in wearing masks and distancing. I live in the most red state in the US so I'm living it. Have your opinions all you want but leave my health out of it.
14553,Can you drop and take the same class with a different professor?
14554,"I've had both Calc-Based Physics and General Chemistry professors that have spent significant portions of class time ranting about how evil white people are and flagellating themselves for their whiteness. I would have hoped that kind of behavior had stayed in my humanities classes, but I guess not."
14555,"Yeah... except that in this instance the ""belief"" is that of going against policies meant to protect students from a deadly virus."
14556,"A common misconception is that political science is the study of politics. It's not. Political scientists study political phenomena, not political events. The distinction is minute but incredibly important.

For example, a political scientist might ask, ""What does the US's pattern of military intervention say about it's foreign policy doctrine"" but not necessarily ""Should the US intervene in Iraq?"". One question can be researched and answered with facts. The other is a matter of opinion and firmly in the realm of politics.

Furthermore, every political science professor I've had for the last two years has openly described themselves as apolitical. Sure, they'll make a joke about the current president every now and then, but rarely do they express their overt political views on a specific issue or identify with a party.

Just thought I'd put that out there :P"
14557,"I had a chemistry teacher rant about Trump winning the elections for 15 mins,  until a girl raised her hand and asked how this was going to help us study for the mid term and the teacher changed topics real qucik"
14558,"If a college doesnt do this even if its legal, there idiots, there is a huge possibility to sue there."
14559,I was at a military camp at a national guard base. The top bunks were about 7 feet off the ground with no rails. All you hear is a fucking earthquake rattle the whole barracks at 1 in the morning. I was basically asleep when it happened so I didn‚Äôt pay much attention. We had watches all night (people who walk around for security in the barracks and make sure people are sleeping). Some kid that‚Äôs like 6 2 and weighs 250 pounds fell from his rack. The watch promptly investigated what happened and asked him if he was ok and he responded ‚Äúyeah‚Äù then proceeded to just sleep on the floor for the rest of the night.
14560,they make us pay $200 for a rail
14561,That‚Äôs fucked

14566,"My bed isn‚Äôt lofted (and I don‚Äôt live in a dorm) but I do have a high up bed frame and a thick mattress. I somehow managed to roll of the bed one day and get a huge bruise. I don‚Äôt even remember doing this but my boyfriend does, and makes fun of me to this day üòÇ"
14567,"I cannot agree with this more. My first grand mal was when I was 17 last year and recently had another one a month ago, despite being fine for the last year thinking I wouldn‚Äôt have one ever again."
14568,"Sounds like capitalism...

Refuse, and ask for their documentation on buying the bed, and rails. This feels like a scam. Also, reach out to college newspaper and city to generate some peer pressure on it. Safety concerns on campus shouldn't have a price tag.

interim, use a $2 pool noodle in your mattress sheets.

Edit: Further shopping, found it hard to even buy a bed without a rail, multiple options around $200 for a basic setup and rail. Rails and Guards by themselves are from about $30 to a really nice wooden style for around $150 with light googling.

Also noticed this article of interest. [11 Alive News: Accident inspires new rules over college bed rails](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/freak-accident-inspires-new-rules-over-college-bed-rails/85-463024437)"
14569,"I fell out of a lofted bed three times while asleep. 

The first time I landed on my face no injuries with the mattress on top. My room mate walked in and woke me up.

Second time, sleep me got better. I landed on the mattress, woke up, went back to sleep.

Third time I didn‚Äôt take the mattress with me when I fell out and so I nearly dislocated my shoulder. I instantly woke up. After that we installed a rail, like OP I highly recommend."
14570,"When I was in basic at great lakes in 2005, the top bunks had rails. Kinda surprised they didn't on a national guard base, but also not surprised that the place to have bunks without rails is a national guard base."
14571,"Couldn‚Äôt agree more!! This happened to my brother a few years ago, landed on his head (he was okay thankfully) and immediately requested a rail right after. Sleeping that high with no barrier would give me anxiety tbh. Glad you‚Äôre okay!"
14572,Lol I have woken up on the floor next to my ( regular height ) bed multiple times and have no recollection of falling out.
14573,"That‚Äôs interesting, maybe because the navy was tired of paying disability for the recruits who fall of their racks and injure themselves like OP did"
14574,How did you take the mattress with you?
14575,So glad you‚Äôre okay OP! I‚Äôm German but did a semester in the US and got a single room with a regular non-lofted bed just because even with railings these lofted dorm beds scare me shitless. Why are these still a thing and why haven‚Äôt more people died falling off them? They seem so dangerous to me and as far as I know the US is the only country that has these.
14576,mines lofted that high too & i had to move my mattress on the floor underneath bc it was terrifying. they don‚Äôt put rails on them at my college lol
14577,"I broke my collarbone falling off a normally raised bed, you never know"
14578,"Freshman year my roommate fell off his 6ft lofted bed while hammered, was too embarrassed to get help and stumbled into our dorm hall bleeding and passed out, Someone found him 2 hours later and called EMS apparently he had nearly bled out, but I slept though it so I‚Äôm not sure."
14579,Spend long enough in the military and you can sleep through anything I swear. I slept through bombings pretty regularly.
14580,"I‚Äôm really not sure how it happened because I was completely asleep the first two times. 

It was the crappy twin mattresses that are in every dorm. I also tend to roll in my sleep. I‚Äôm pretty sure I rolled over violently enough that the mattress flipped with me."
14581,I actually managed to climb back into bed in my sleep somehow lol
14582,"probably pushed off the wall with their feet, sliding the mattress as they went"
14583,"Oh that‚Äôs a big fear of mine. I got to my dorm first day and 1) no railing, which is suppose to come standard for all lifts, and 2) it was built wrong, which made it half a foot higher than usual."
14584,"Me and my father took a train across the US and I got the top bunk. When I was sleeping, the train was rocking back and forth til I rocked almost off the bunk. I literally woke up right when I was about to fall and caught the edge of the bed to hold myself up. Moral? Use the seat belt they have in the bed for when you sleep.  But I like living on the edge. Literally haha

Glad your okay OP"
14585,I‚Äôve already lofted my bed with the railing on the wrong side (toward the wall). Oof. At least I‚Äôd be down to die
14586,I may have done this at some point lol. I don't have a roommate or anything (I live with my parents) so this could have easily happened at some point.
14587,"My freshman year I had a metal railing on my loft. It got kind of bent out because it was metal and a shitty mattress. One day I was laying in it on my back and rolled over and my leg hit it and knocked it off. And I went with it. The sequence of landing:
 1. Metal railing
2. My head on the metal railing
3. The rest of me
I'm pretty sure I gave myself a concussion, but I still went to work at 6 and left at 1:30."
14588,Yup. Mentally and physically tired. Even if I start the day productively I tend to get tired after a few hours.
14589,I always thought it was so sad that all I wanted to do as a young 22 year old was sleep. Like the worst thing I could do was sleep. Why am I not allowed to just sleep. I used to have to take mini 10 minute naps just to have the energy to get off the couch and brush my teeth. I used to fall asleep on my work.
14590,Yes. Doing classes from home has somewhat been a drag for me. My brain is wired to lounge and relax whenever I‚Äôm home.
14591,Try vitamin d supplements for a few weeks
14592,Yeah I got depression and this is one of the most well known symptoms. It's not normal to be tired all day.
14593,"It‚Äôs ok, don‚Äôt be sad. Maybe you are just not doing something that you are passionate about. Like me."
14594,"Yes I feel the same way lol. Sometimes I feel like the more I sleep, the more tired I am :("
14595,"men should get their iron levels checked too, I was feeling the same as most people in this thread and taking iron supplements (after my doctor told me so of course) helped massively"
14596,"Same. While I was in the dorms my brain was set to ‚Äúwe‚Äôre at school, we need to work!‚Äù and I did just fine. But now I‚Äôm at my parents house, and I‚Äôm only ever here when school has let out, so my brain just thinks we‚Äôre on vacation and we should sleep in every day."
14597,"Yes, I think in college our sleep schedules are so irregular with classes at different times and late nights as opposed to the same schedule in high school, so our bodies can‚Äôt adjust as well. Working out definitely helps me keep my sleeping on track. I also take vitamin D"
14598,The fact that depression symptoms seem to be the norm screams a huge fucking problem with this way of life.
14599,This is a number one sign of burnout and mental fatigue.
14600,dont blame yourself. its the result of a poorly designed system.
14601,"Few tips that have helped me-

Diet plays a large role- if you eat sugar and fat laden foods you'll feel lethargic. Happened to me as well! Try eating whole foods and sticking to a good meal schedule. 

Sleep before 12 am and wake up by 8. I know easier said than done but made a huge difference for me.

And remember to try and incorporate some exercise along with a walk in the sun (with god music!) 

I  do cold showers as well because they make me feel really awake but I realize thats not for everyone!"
14602,"Yes, I'm one of those people who is very stimulated by environment, so when I'm just at home all the time I feel ....I guess unstimulated. 

I'm the kind who used to go to coffee shops or the library to work on an assignment just for a refreshing change of scenery. I'm lucky enough that my home is a pretty quiet place and I have a dedicated office for schoolwork. But it's still hard for me to always be productive in the same spot."
14603,"agreed, especially if you‚Äôre lacking iron-rich foods like leafy greens in your diet (it can be hard to eat well when school gets stressful, I know). Consider magnesium supplements too, they made a notable difference in my energy level and mood."
14604,most definitely
14605,"oh yeah, I am always tired, I could easily sleep 12+ hours every day if I could, I am tired no matter how much I sleep"
14606,thank you for the reminder to take my vitamins!
14607,I broke my cycle by getting at least two good nights rest. I‚Äôm talking about at least 8 hours of sleep for both nights. Sleep is powerful and I wish more people can get it!
14608,"Thank you for this. Literally I slept 9 hours one night and then got up the next day and napped twice. I'm mentally exhausted sure but I thought I should have at least been able to make it awake through the day. 

It gets tiresome..being tired all the time."
14609,"promise you, it‚Äôs not normal. People aren‚Äôt supposed to feel like that. It might be normal for you in the context of your life, and yes its very common, but not how its supposed to be. Chronic fatigue is your body telling you that something is up. I obviously can‚Äôt tell you what that is but I hope you‚Äôre hanging in there."
14610,Been feeling this the past week or so. I think it's been catching up with a lot of us. Finals are coming up for me and I just feel so so tired. I need a little bit of motivation for those. I've been going to the gym and that has really helped with clearing my head.
14611,"I used to have the same problem until I figured out that it was because I drank coffee as late as 8/9 pm. If you drink coffee late in the day, that may be your issue. Try not drinking coffee or getting any form of caffeine after around 3 pm and see if that helps."
14612,"Yes, I went to the doctor because I was tired all time and wouldn‚Äôt have enough energy even after sleeping 10 hours, so I got my blood tested to see if it could be hypothyroidism (runs in the fam) but it was just that I have a vitamin D deficiency. That‚Äôs what staying inside every single day for 3 months does to you!"
14613,"I don't know, seems normal to me. I've been exhausted pretty much every day since high school, and it doesn't really feel like something out of the norm if that makes sense. Everything else is normal so idk."
14614,"I wouldn't say tired, but always unmotivated. I turned in a very important research project without having a mentor look over it. It would have been maybe 20 minutes of just switching to their suggested edits, but I wanted it to be done so much I turned it in without them.

I haven't watched video lectures in two weeks now even though I just literally have to sit there and listen. It's been bad."
14615,Yes
14616,"Start exercising everyday. 15 minutes of rigorous exercise and eating healthy should fix that problem.

It could be your body is inefficient and lazy on the inside right now."
14617,"I've absolutely never felt this way before, I'm a first year comp sci student so it's been super stressful especially all virtual"
14618,Because people will pay it.
14619,"Thanks for reminding me to return my rental to Amazon.

In all honesty, if I got stuck with a $750 fee, I would seek a lawyer. I imagine Amazon would drop it instead going to court.

Edit: Just checked mine.  I paid $41 to rent.  It lists the buying price at $47.  When I check all used sources, the lowest is $58.  I guess I got lucky."
14620,"I actually got interested about this so I looked at a past askreddit thread about most expensive textbooks and it seems like the highest some paid was around $200-$300. I get what you‚Äôre saying though and textbook prices are bullshit.

But at $700 I expect students to loudly confront professors in class, sign a petition about price gouging,  and maybe even protest. If it‚Äôs a required course then some shifty shit is going on and I think students would take action. Even $350 would be too much"
14621,"Exactly.  If the materials cost exceeds the cost per credit hour, something is wrong.  I would also drop and consider the transient student route and take the course at another college."
14622,"If you miss the rental deadline, you extend the rental period first. If you lost the book and still cannot return it at the end of the extended rental period, you contact Amazon and they'll work something out with you. 

Just because the online website says one $ number, doesn't mean you'll pay that. 

Amazon knows the population they're dealing with, and I've found them to be pretty fair. Like they sent me a reminder to return my textbook or extend the rental every week starting 6 weeks before it was due üëç"
14623,[removed]
14624,It is but people pay it for required courses. So companies keep doing it.
14625,You can easily just extend the deadline. For my book it was around 10 bucks for the option. If someone bought the whole book without reading the other options then they probably have no idea how to manage their money
14626,"As someone who rents books off amazon, I will be paying more attention to this in the future. I just sent back my rental for this past semester, ain‚Äôt finna charge me an arm and a leg lmao."
14627,"Even then, at that point if it's a required course, odds are the book is in the schools library. You can go in there and just take pictures of the sections you need that week and print them out if you want a physical copy."
14628,[removed]
14629,"This. I'm fairly new to Reddit and my post here wouldn't go up at first because of low karma, but I went begging to the mods (thank you, mods) because I think people need to be aware of this. Can you imagine actually getting charged like this? It would happen automatically. Would Amazon do anything about it afterward if you complained?  I don't know."
14630,"The last amazon rental textbook I got (and will ever get) arrived with some minor water damage on the spine.  No big deal, I emailed customer service and noted the book arrived damaged, but I was fine with it.  I just didn't want to be charged for damage I didn't do when I returned it.  It didn't get damaged in shipping, either, the packaging wasn't damaged.  They shipped it out that way.  It should have been noted in the description to begin with.

Used the book, sent it back in the same condition, in the same packaging.  Got my return receipt notice, went on with my life.  2 months later, during a routine email cleanup, I finally delete the email from the first rep noting my report and promising to make a note in the account of the damage upon arrival and his assurances I would not be charged.

A total of three months after my return, I get a nasty gram from Amazon.  Guess what, they're claiming I water damaged the book and they're charging me around $80 for it and sending me my damaged copy.  I immediately call customer service and explain the whole story.  She, after putting me on hold and verifying what I said was true, tells me my card will not be charged and they will not send me the book.  She couldn't believe that they tried this after 3 MONTHS of the book being in their possession.  From her tone I think it was more the later than the former that saved me.  I'm not even 100% sure the note the first rep promised was there.  

The next day they charge my card and a few days later the book arrives.

Jesus wept.  Back we go to customer service (twice), who refund me the charge and tell me to keep the book.  I held onto it for about a year then finally donated it to Goodwill.  At that point any faith I wouldn't hear about the daggone thing was gone.

I've been an Amazon customer since 2000 and have spent a LOT of money there.  Hundreds of thousands, probably.  If this is the way they treated me, I shudder to think what would have happened had I been a new customer or had I just shrugged and ignored the damage (assuming it was noted already).

Now I buy them outright or rent via BN or another site.

Aside from going elsewhere, the lesson is to a) don't trust them, b) report all damage upon receipt, and c) keep all emails forever (I guess).  No way would I touch this rental with a 10 foot pole."
14631,"It's Amazon Warehouse. Do they say anywhere when you place the order that they'll plunder you if you're late or lose the book? Nope. I put another one in my cart just to see. Here's the screen shot- [https://imgur.com/a/kdh4QfI](https://imgur.com/a/kdh4QfI) So, where's the part about the $756...?

&#x200B;

Here's a link to the book: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1429283521/ref=dp\_olp\_rentals?ie=UTF8&f\_rental=true](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1429283521/ref=dp_olp_rentals?ie=UTF8&f_rental=true)"
14632,"Except many textbooks come with some sort of code you need for the class. Code wont work if it's been used by the original owner of the book and you probably dont need the book itself, just the code for the online stuff. This happens too often."
14633,how do you do it?
14634,"The problem is they are just reprinting the same information a different way for most courses and then charging a premium because its ""new"" publishing for textbooks is such bullshit"
14635,/s ?
14636,"The funny thing is there are 111 used copies beginning at $7.24. We rented instead of buying because class has already started and Amazon Prime was the only way to get it in time. God forbid if that book wasn't returned on time. The only way to see the $756 is by going BACK into the Rental tab and checking on the status. I did that, but who's normally going to do that?"
14637,"Looking at you, Pearson."
14638,"You‚Äôre confusing privatization with municipalization.

You‚Äôre (demonstrably) wrongly ascribing the benefits of public services to private services. You should read up on democratic socialism‚Äîyou‚Äôd like it if you understood it."
14639,"You are wrong. That option is always there if someone decides they want to keep the book and purchase instead of extending the deadline. The price is probably set by an algorithm or 3rd party if it's not by Amazon. In this case, Amazon really wants you to return the book otherwise the fee would be more reasonable.  If you miss your rental return period, Amazon will EXTEND your return and charge you accordingly, not hit you with a 700$ charge."
14640,"Text book prices are a direct result of free market capitalism. Monopolization if information, cronyism between schools and publishers, etc. 

This is hilarious I definitely thought you were kidding. I don‚Äôt even remotely understand your point."
14641,Hundreds of thousands?
14642,At that point it‚Äôs time to cross your fingers and hope it‚Äôs on library genesis
14643,you're a real one
14644,"I had a textbook last semester that was $600 with the code. Absolutely brought it to the professor and said it was prohibitively expensive. He had no idea because he also adjuncts at a CC (that was selling it for I think $400. 3 for the book 1 for the code) and he personally renegotiated so that we got the same price as his other school.

If it's too much, don't just suck it up. Talk to someone! If your professor isn't or can't be helpful, ask them to direct you to someone who can."
14645,"Ha, no. Wasn't in the rental terms! At least the ones before you buy the book. The ""buyout price"" is listed at $192.00 but  I guess missing the deadline means a free-for-all. I have no idea how they come up with an almost $800 charge for that."
14646,üëç
14647,Then convert those images to pdf and use a big ereader :)
14648,Thanks!! Haha
14649,ive got microbio too but im kinda bad at it. u go girl!!
14650,"fucking congrats my dude, that takes some serious dedication!!"
14651,Amazing work!
14652,Oh my goodness congratulations!!!
14653,It's beer time üç∫üçª
14654,Some schools count lab as a separate class.
14655,All science courses too. Let's fucking go!
14656,So awesome! Kickass job!
14657,"Make sure to reward yourself with something nice, you did well!"
14658,Ty!!
14659,üçª
14660,Congratss üéâüéä. Are you also a Floridian?
14661,And it's all hard STEM classes! Proud of you!
14662,dude that‚Äôs great!! i‚Äôm praying for the same here hopefully lol
14663,It's just a figure of speech
14664,This is life fuel
14665,Wait why is the physics lab counted separately?
14666,Well done smartie
14667,"Awesome! Nice job! I also had a miracle, one of my professors made my final exam open notes and open book, it's also going to be online and open for all day Thursday!"
14668,holy shit dude lets goooo
14669,Wow! Great Job. Wish i could say the same
14670,"Congratulations!  I‚Äôm really happy for you!

Have a nice day!"
14671,"Well, that should definitely brighten the holidays.  Congrats and well done.  Premed?"
14672,üíØüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüíØ
14673,Impressive!!!!!
14674,Congratulations!!!! That‚Äôs awesome
14675,"Awesome stuff, great work!"
14676,Congrats!!:)
14677,Nice job!
14678,"Honestly I don't know anything different than online. I started school in Summer 2020, I have blended classes but that's only maybe once a week and we basically just reiterate stuff that we already learned at home. It'll be interesting to see how all the current freshmen adjust once classes start moving more and more back to in person. Honestly, I'll probably stick to what I'm doing now which is just being self reliant."
14679,"For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve had plenty of in-person classes with no structure whatsoever lol."
14680,"I do. I like that I can more easily attend classes, and it‚Äôs easier to do schoolwork around my full time job."
14681,"For me it goes both ways.

I‚Äôm very independent and learn best with examples and by doing the homework so lectures feel pointless to me  in most cases (engineering) so if a class is built around individual work and just conceptual problem solving then I much prefer online*

*the last week of classes and finals week were super stressful and it would have been nice to at least have access to campus at that time (I live 70 miles away) 

However many classes involve group work, projects, and labs, and online versions of those are trash, especially if I‚Äôve never actually been to campus and haven‚Äôt met anyone. Classes like these should be in person. This semester I have 2 group projects, a group lab, and group discussions (Discord makes this a bit easier to stay In Contact ), and it‚Äôs much more stressful."
14682,"It's so much harder to motivate myself to listen to disorganized class recordings, or to attend completely disorganized online classes than to just go to class and deal with the disorganized class. 

Online, organization matters so much more, in lecture style, since you've only got a tiny screen available, and LMS organization, since all of the handouts and assignments and quizzes and tests are uploaded to the website, it can easily take a student an extra half hour to do an assignment if they have to search around the LMS for the various necessary resources. 

I have a lab class where, to complete the lab, you have to access three or 4 different folders on the LMS just to find the materials needed for the lab. There's a lab theory video, a lab method video, a lab manual, a data file, a powerpoint for each of the videos, and a file that explains what you need to do to complete the lab (literally just ""watch video A, download X, open file Z, etc."" And instead of just sticking ALL the files needed in a folder called ""lab 3"", the professor sprinkles them out in different folders and sub folders all around the LMS."
14683,"Not for me.. I've been struggling in online classes A LOT. Procrastinating becomes a habit, neglecting assignments is now a norm. I didn't take the classes with seriousness like before. I'm sophomore, and since 1st year in college I had a sedentary lifestyle, you can imagine how worst it has been for me since Covid hit. I'm socially retarded, and didn't care less about studying with friends or interact with them. But in-person classes students were -at least in my case- more *curious* about the lessons, and asking really interesting questions, but now all of them seem off and only let professor explain.
+
I've encountered professors who don't use a board, or a drawing tablet/laptop to explain math and physics. Merely reading the chapter and solve the questions phonetically with the help of the greatest learning tool to this day **mouse pointer**."
14684,"For me it‚Äôs easier, more convenient and less stressful. I hope universities offer more classes online in the future, I would like to take 1-2 online classes each semester. I also hope they record lectures."
14685,"Same here, I keep hearing my peers complaining about online classes and how they're missing out on their college experience but honestly, I can't relate."
14686,"For STEM classes, no. For most other things, yes."
14687,"Just because you can't relate to the complaints doesn't mean you should invalidate someone's struggles. I'm glad OP likes online classes and I know there are others who feel the same, but for me, this absolutely sucked. I'm a film production major and in person, hands on classes and film sets are so important to my study. I'm a senior and I couldn't produce a thesis film like I planned because the COVID restrictions weren't worth the anxiety. 

I've never been a partier, but COVID ruined my senior year in more ways than that. I'll never get to have a 21st birthday party with my friends, have a drink at the campus bar, go to Disneyland with my sorority. I lost my dream internship when we the pandemic hit, and I'll never get that time back. I understand how tragic the pandemic is and I'm privileged to be in the position I'm in, but it still sucks. 

Online classes are inarguably a very different style of learning for people of any major. Some people, like OP, can thrive in an online learning environment. Some people can't adequately learn through a screen. Both are valid, the difference is we didn't get a choice in the matter."
14688,"No, but it's cool that you do! I'm glad that through all of this pandemic crap, some people can still enjoy themselves and get an education."
14689,No not for stem classes I am dying
14690,"Nope, this is the worst and it‚Äôs half assed education that we are being ripped off for. I don‚Äôt feel like the value of the education is the same and many graduates are going be behind in their fields cause of the crappy education that they have received during the whole pandemic"
14691,Not typically. One if the professors I wouldn't hesitate to take his online class is 50-60 years old. Some of my younger professors couldn't figure out Zoom if their life depended on it.
14692,">Just gotta remind yourself how important the class is to your success         
      
This can't be stated enough. Keep the end goal in mind, sure it sucks sometimes, and gets stressful, but you put in a few years of hard work and dedication and you'll be at the doorstep of the life you dream of."
14693,Interesting. Most of my classes don‚Äôt involve group work like that. I definitely agree that sometimes professors who are inexperienced with virtual education just try to throw everything that they‚Äôve been doing before in an online class and it doesn‚Äôt work
14694,If there‚Äôs one thing I do agree with is that the tuition price should definitely be reduced if you‚Äôre taking online classes without given any other choice. I see wym about the quality of education
14695,"No, I hate it. I do well grade wise, but I feel I've retained very little and also there seems to be a lot more busy work in online classes. So, while I don't go to class physically I spend far more time trying to maintain my grades.      
      
This semester my college offered some in person and while it's 1 day versus the typical 2 days a week, I'm enjoying it infinitely more. I've missed the interactions with classmates, and professors. It feels effortless to pick up on concepts in comparison to online exclusive."
14696,"yes! with the past year being work from home and not out much socially, I actually prefer online classes right now. I actually initially held off on college due to it being online but when it was clear Covid would not be going away soon I decided to enroll and just try it out. I absolutely love it! I‚Äôm also an extremely optimistic person though so I understand many others are struggling, but my passion and determination towards my degree doesn‚Äôt let online bother me. 

I feel more comfortable in class, if I don‚Äôt have time for a shower I don‚Äôt feel weird, can grab a snack if I want, home all day with my kitties, I can just fart whenever lmao, turn off my camera to go to the bathroom, etc. 

I am still very much looking forward to in-person classes though, it‚Äôll be nice to have more social interaction with my professors and students, utilize on campus resources, etc. but right now, I am enjoying online while it lasts and continuing to look at the bright side of everything."
