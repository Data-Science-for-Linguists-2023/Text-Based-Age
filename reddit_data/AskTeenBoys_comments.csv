U callin yer selfs ***D O G S*** eh?"
2,"A shit ton of censorship. And I don't mean ""dem libtards takin muh free spheech"" kind of censorship. Basically if you disagree with a commenter, and reply stating a counter, your comments will be removed. Or even factual fucking errors are counted as ""invalidating"".

Extreme example:

""2+3 is 7 and you just got to accept that""

""It's actually 5 but i get what you're saying""

""Your comment was removed for Invalidation."
3,"Wasn't aware of the drama between /r/askmen and /r/AskWomen, and yet hearing about it now is completely unsurprising."

22,"I'm a man regularly on r/askwomen. Have never felt that. They actually tend to borrow a lot of questions from r/askmen, then credit them."
23,Don't know if there is drama between them but ask women removes comments if you disagree with them
24,"this is exactly what these two subs were made for, to combat that :)"
25,Alright then i ll finnish you right here
26,"Up, I would have conversations with the OP commenter, perfectly fucking respectable, no one was getting hurt, and the conversation had flow and made sense.

&#x200B;

1 hour later I would get a mod message and find both OP and my comments removed for ""derailing""

Like fuck off mods, don't interfere unless someone's getting hurt."

35,"Are you f#cking kidding me? This stupid meme yet again? What is it with all these poorly memeified reply attempts at jokes? Are you posting these comments simply for karma?

I swear, sometimes it seems like people are trying to squeeze the karma from the balls of life. Those great round creators of all that lives; the fatherly mounds of existence. But that is abuse. The spheres of humanity should not be subjected to these horrors.

Like the song of the Sirens, the sweetest sound known to man, tempts the weak and fragile to its source; then, as the tentacles of Medusa grip your heart, the quest for internet points pulls you into a hole that you cannot escape until your dying breath releases you from the chains of life. The greatest sin of man, temptation, is fulfilled, only to open the box of Pandora, releasing the endless horrors of an infinite temptation that can never be satisfied. The call of the Sirens continues, despite its source being unreachable anymore. Life is wasted in the futile attempt to reach the unknown God that holds satisfaction; the journey itself becomes the source of grief and misery.

If you had the slightest of respect for life, you would quit your attempts to dig for karma like you're an owner of a diamond mining company in the forgotten, dreary depths of Africa. As the power of the sun --- a harbinger of life and death --- drains the workers of the strength within their weary bones, your comment burns through the depths of our souls and tacks on a hopelessness that is irreparable.

The power of the word can push a man into bliss or into despair. To hold that power is to hold a shining light into the very soul of a man. To behold this power is to comprehend that man is fragile. To see the use of a comment to hunt for karma, like a hunter trails after his prey, his very life-force, is to see the degradation of mankind.

To this end, you leave me no choice but to deprive you of your life-force, not for the benefit of myself, but for the benefit of yourself. Thusly, you may learn to appreciate the power of the word, and to use it wisely. Use it to benefit mankind, not to bring it down.

Edit: Wait a second. When I went to change my flair, it showed I had a different one selected. I think a mod changed my flair."
164,"I agree. Wasn’t really into hugs when I was 13, didn’t get into hugs until a girl started regularly hugging me when I was 15, I found it awkward as fuck at first but I grew into it."

182,Mine is equal to 0.13 hamsters
183,Joined reddit
184,"If 1 hamster =5"", I am 1.6 hamsters.

This is a bad idea as it takes more blood based on the girth of a penis too, so this isn't **true** hamster value"
185,You cross posting bastard. At least you have credit so take my updoot
186,F
187,How bored are you OP?
188,Nice cock comrade
189,Nice cock bro
190,So then I would only need half hamster lol

195,12? Pathetic. Mine has an entire ecosystem worth of blood in it
196,Thanks homedog
197,Bröthër
198,That’s impressive
199,"That's true, but you can calculate volume by length and girth here: [https://calcsd.netlify.app/full](https://calcsd.netlify.app/full)

The average penis is 4.42 fl oz erect, 1.75oz flaccid. The extra weight is all blood, so minus 4.42 by 1.75 is 2.67oz, or 5 tablespoons, which makes me question OPs idea that it only takes two tablespoons. Unless I'm wrong on this?"
200,Fucking repost
201,Mines equal to 1.30 hamsters. Not to flex or anythin  😤
202,Grab a hampster and test it out

211,Death grips gang rise up
212,"Eh my older sister told me once “Your music only pleases you so who cares what others think”

And I’m the guy in school who can relate to literally anyone’s music taste because I love listening to like 20+ genres. I was ashamed in the past now I don’t really care and just listen to whatever"
213,At my school literally EVERYONE listens to either rap or classic rock so I can't really win when I listen to heavy metal...but everybody loves Queen so there's that...
214,"I love death grips, but I'm talking more like screamo rap shit, I don't know what to call honestly"
215,What if they think I'm happy? Can't have that happening
216,"It’s because your music represents you as a person. So you feel very vulnerable when you show someone your music, because you’re effectively showcasing a very private and emotional part of you, which if they don’t like, then it’s not just them rejecting your music - it’s rejecting you as a person too. Or at least that’s what it feels like."
217,"Same. Ive nevet had anyone have the same music taste as me. I remember I told my friend once that I like Set if off, and put on one of their songs. They just looked at me and told me ""ThaTS nOT ReAl RoCK"" it was so awkward, cause all I could really say was ""uhm..okay..? Sorry"""
218,"So like city morgue?
Also Canada songs by daughters is some of the hardest metal I've heard"
219,"This is it, thank you so much. I read this and it just clicked"
220,"No, more mainstream stuff, it's really nothing special tbh, will check it out though"
221,"Yeah, they always fucking shoot me down about anything I do that has to do with the Internet or computers because apparently I can't do anything with it. They never try to encourage me to program anything or play anything.

EDIT: Sorry for this sounding edgy or something, just had to get something off my chest. Today's been a bad day."
222,Is it stuff like scarlxrd or old/angry xxxtentacion songs? I love that stuff too but it doesn't fit me either
223,This is the realest shit I've read all day
224,Old x>? X
225,i feel that
226,*cries in death and black metal*
227,That's the worst
228,"Mostly $uicideboy$, scarlxrd, ghostemane, and that type of stuff. Not exactly something to be proud of but I like it"
229,"Nope, metalhead and proud."
230,"atleast people listen to classic rock, here it's only rap and pop"
231,"What you listen to, like what artists ?"
232,"Well they’re just flat out wrong. A few decades back, sure the jobs were limited but in today’s world.. I can’t say anything besides to pursue that course man"
233,Personally I love both old and new X songs but if I had to choose I would probs go for old aswell
234,Sounds like you got a pretty cool sister
235,"Yeah, almost noone knows about my favorite bands because they arent that mainstream. It sucks cause I really miss being able to connect with people through music"
236,"Ok, I like city morgue, ive heard of em before, just haven't got around to listening to them because I'm a lazy pos"
237,Yeah she’s awesome. We both are music heads and she’s influenced my music taste a lot
238,"Yeah, I love scarlxrd. He slaps"
239,i listen to bubblegum pop/kpop so yeah i feel that. when people ask what i listen to i just say that “i’m not picky” and “listen to whatever comes on shuffle”
240,"Well, some people at least"
241,At least in these Subreddits

263,Don’t say that haha
264,"Thanks dude, you too"
265,Yeah the way we treat each other is greaaaaaaaat
266,People on the internet are generally nicer in many cases (unless there is a picture of them involved) as you don't see the person you are talking to causing the brain to not be able to make preconceptions about the conversation partner. :)

336,"Im not like extremely attracted to thighs but nice thighs are always a plus (not the ones that are fucking overweight and obeese and then they call themselves ""thiCC"", that's just fucking ugly) but I think in general it's pretty hard for guys to explain to girls why they are attracted to something that they are attracted to, same goes the other way around, I have no idea wtf are you girls attraced to on guys like seriously"
337,[deleted]
338,Depends on the guy of course. But if your thighs are big because you're muscular then i'm down. If they're big because you're heavy then I wouldn't be down.
339,Me and my friend always talk about how great thighs are so without a doubt

360,"I think the mods have banned those questions and the users, but they just keep creating another accounts"
361,Probably because in the hot teacher questions most teen boys said they would be fine with it
362,"It's the internet and a sub for teens, go figure lol"
363,Unfortunately some people would actually do it if she was hot. Smh.
364,"They seem to lurk on all subs relating to teens, looking for victims. 

I don't like how long a lot of the questions stay up, the 14 year old and 22 year old woman one should have been removed as soon as possible."
365,Mhm. Futhermore we talk about this stuff behind the scenes and how to deal with it.
366,and you're also okay with 23 year old women trying to smash?
367,We try to moderate the best we can :(
368,"there was even a mod asking ""Is pedophilia ok if shes a hot female"" or some bs question like that"
369,Because it is.
370,Yeah true. I feel like it took too long for that post before to be taken down but I understand the mods aren’t active all the time.
371,Because it’s fucked up and they’re allowing a pedophile to use them. It’s obviously the pedophile that’s more at fault though. The victim is not to blame.
372,yes please use the report button. It catches our eye faster since it puts the posts in modqueue
373,why do half of you give them proper responses instead of ignoring them and reporting them?
374,"We try to moderate the best we can :(

A lot happens behind the scenes."
375,"that post was just to see what everyone would say, there’s nothing really wrong with a hypothetical like that, it’s what the sub is for"
376,[deleted]
377,"Get more mods, and setup automod correctly."
378,Not with underage victims
379,...saying that like it's a bad thing
380,"Are you really comparing the age gap between an 18 and 20 year old to a 14 and 22 year old? That’s such a dumb point.

Also I’m sorry for any confusion but I’m not blaming the minor here. It’s wrong for the adult to be doing that to the minor. What I meant was the the whole scenario is wrong and messed up because of what the adult is doing."
381,"Consent is key. Let's say you're almost 18 and your partner is 20. In less than a year the relationship becomes legal but until then it's illegal. What really changes in a year inside of the younger person? The legality of the relationship even hinges itself on one day. The day before the 18th birthday: illegal the day of: legal. Its such a fine line and obviously the laws are put in place to protect people from predatory behavior but in certain cases it doesn't make sense for the supposed ""victim"" be be labeled as such. Also if the behavior is so wrong why is the minor getting blamed for letting themself be used? That's just backwards."
382,"Regardless of consent though, it's still illegal for a 20 year old to have a sexual relationship with a 17 year old (even more so if it's a teacher-student relationship). Yeah the laws are lines are blurry and are different from culture to culture, but if the law says 18 then it's common sense to just stick by it. The victim shaming isn't cool at all though."
383,[deleted]
384,That's because you really can't do much other than banning users>
385,"I'm not the head mod, unfortunately im not in charge of such decisions."
386,Please suggest that to our head mod!
387,It was also a update post. I was shocked at all the answers on my original post and I wanted to word the question differently  to see if the same people reacted differently now that pedophilia was involved unfortunately the ones that said they wanted it also didn't care that it was pedophilia.
388,You can’t moderate dms people get so dont worry
389,"just, no."

401,"329 upvotes at the time of me writing this comment, 3 hours or so after this post went up. Sadly, I don't have any suggestions for it right now. The only thing I can say is that I don't think restricting memes to be relevant to what's been going on in this sub is a good idea because there's not a lot of material there to make memes with. Other than that, I got nothing. I'll make another comment if I think of something though."
402,"Here is my idea on what we should do:

We should have everyone submit memes that relate to teenage life or the subreddit in some sort of way into pinned threads. There will be ten pinned threads, one for each year of the 2010’s. The submitted meme must be posted into the correct pinned thread/year that it was relevant, and the winner of each pinned thread will be allowed to submit their meme as an actual post onto the subreddit."

457,wait but how am i ugly nd not ugly

459,F

466,I would give award but im a broke teen so heres a appreciation award for ahh... shiting....
467,always. probably has to do with being viewed from a non-parallel angle if that makes any sense
468,"yeah, the actual reason is that phones distort the picture."
469,Can’t relate I only look at myself as ugly... I have some rare days when I see myself in a mirror or on my phone and think I’m actually a bit pretty but that’s rare.
470,You’re right. We need flairs for measurements.
471,Yeah I like to admire my beautiful self then realise I'm ugly but it's always fun while it last i like to do stupid stuff like finger gins and stuff at my self it's best if no ones home so i can stay as long as I want doing whatever in the mirror
472,IM A GURL BUT YES OH MY GOD YWS NO MATTER WHAT ALL PHOTOS TAKEN OF ME ARE HORRRRRIIIBLEEE
473,C'mon man. Thats probably not true..
474,I look in the mirror and think I’m ugly so the camera is just insult to injury
475,"When will my  reflection show, who I am inside....."
476,It also has a lot to do with the focal length of the camera and most selfie cameras are very wide angle making your face look pretty weird
477,"Hmmm, ah! ***get a flair***"
478,How do I get a flair?
479,Every time.
480,"I subbed to this subbed after the whole 22 year old thing

they explain it all"

486,Oh ok
487,"No, these subs are different, while there are some deep talk over at teenagers I sincerely don't want it to become completely filled with deep talk like this sub, I feel that teenagers should stay as it is - a shit hole for memes made by awkward teens :)

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk"
488,"YES. That's exactly why I left that shithole sub, it just became a toxic wasteland of shitposting and just people being absolute chodesmokers."
489,I tried calling out a pedo in atg but got banned smh
490,big agree. r/teenagers is a shitehole where no real discussion can be had. the mods on there are cunts too
491,/r/teenagers has become a mix of /r/memes and /r/copypasta
492,"I honestly hate r/teenagers, 2/3 of the memes are crossposted between r/dankmemes and r/teenagers to and from, and it's full of repetitive crush jokes. I mean never in my life have I seen a group of 14-19 year olds act so immature whether ironically or unironically, most of the posts are something funny to lowkey karmafarm (I put my dick in *insert object*) or some other weird shit. 

And not that I'm discriminating but I'd like the sub to be more than filled with social rejects answering and asking questions because they have little relationship maturity when they do answer, and the rest of the time they're just saying ""same"" ""I'm lonely"" ""Haha kill me"" ""fortnite bad""

Like it's to the point where this attitude is no longer a joke but invasive in every aspect of the sub."
493,"I have seen that ""based"" used a lot many times in past few weeks and I have no ideas what it means?"
494,"Idek, I dont visit atg anymore, also it was one of this bot messages"
495,Bro honestly after r/teenagers changed their rules or some shit it just was never the same. Idk if I'm getting older or what but god damn that sub sucks now. I like this and r/askteengirls better.

498,Ohok my bad
499,"There was a nsfw question asked there by someone who had made a new account and kept repeatedly asking the same nsfw question (dont remember what it was) I made a top comment (so that people could see the op was dodgy) saying that it was obvious the OP was not a teen, and then I got a message saying I was temporarily banned for knowingly breaking rule 5"

Someone asked me out once, and I was very unsure. She kept saying “are you rejecting me?” Finally, I wrote this note to her with very small handwriting, and she came up to me and said, “I can’t read this. What are your saying?” I said, “yes.” What I meant was, “yes, I’m rejecting you.” What she thought I said was, “yes, I like you too.” She went three months thinking we were dating in what must have been the most uneventful relationship ever.

Basically, get them to ask if you’re rejecting them, and then you have a get out of jail free card. Works 1/1 times."
517,Yeah. Last year at summer camp some kids were telling me the girl I had a crush on liked me and I told them “how cute” because I thought they were joking. They weren’t.
518,"When that dare trend was a thing I got asked out maybe five times total and each time I hit them with the ""I'm very flattered but I'm not looking for a relationship ship right now."" So if they were serious I wouldn't hurt their feelings and if they were joking it kinda hurt their feelings."

614,I'm just tall enough where if I'm on the right side of the stairs I can generally angle my head to go right over anyone's shoulder
615,6’5
616,I know rightt Its also awkward ahahahah
617,yeah I do similar. I just look away for the same reason
618,"That’s so brain dead honestly, like it’s literally right in front of you."
619,"And he be like ""what's this girl doing lmao?"""
620,Thanks. Tbh I don't mind if girls check me out (they don't though bcs I'm pretty average) so I assume it's the same the otherway round
621,on the opposite of this: i have definitely walked extra sexy up stairs when a hot guy was behind me
622,6' 4
623,yes yes yes!!
624,actually he dated me so i guess it worked
625,r/notopbutok
626,Ahahahah
627,Congrats :=)
628,never really thought about it nah
629,Just because you're ok with being checked out doesn't mean everyone else is too
630,I think a lot of guys can't tell when a girl is even wearing makeup
631,Light makeup is probably unnoticeable to most guys.But if your makeup is noticeable most guys prefer no make up
632,I agree with that
633,"i respect that! sometimes i like the iced up birthday cake look, tho."
634,I prefer nice dicks
635,I can’t tell when girls in my class are and arnt unless it’s raining and I it’s smearing then I’ll notice but I don’t know when they wear it tbh
636,"Guys don't realize that when they think someone isn't wearing makeup, they probably are. Just not an excessive amount."
637,sweet answer :) i appreciate this since i’m either on clown mode or have on no makeup at all.
638,i appreciate this answer
639,"I can confirm that, as a guy, I have no idea whether you’re wearing makeup or not."
640,Yes we prefer if it’s somebody we are going out with not to wear makeup as we don’t mind but if they want to wear it they can as we don’t control them hope that helpe
641,idk dude that’s kinda gay
642,Unless of course it's like a layer of icing
643,Me too
644,Facts.
645,"I mean that‘s totally fine. Frankly just because someone wears a lot of makeup from time to time most guys won‘t be turned off for ever, even if they don’t like it that much."
646,"Not if he’s wearing socks, homie"
647,"I feel like a lot of guys say this. Heck even I do. But I’m pretty sure when they think of no make up, they are imagining girls who are good at doing light make up. And when they think of girls who do wear makeup, they think of the girls who put wayyyy to much. 

Like I don’t think guys care about those super long lashes or nails. Ngl they are kind of a negative for me but that’s just my personal opinion. And again, maybe that’s only because I only notice when girls go all out with the super long nails and super long fake lashes.

That being said, wear what your comfortable with"
648,"It’s when girls wear to much that you can notice, if a girl isn’t wearing very much they don’t tend to look much different they just might bring out there best features a little more but I love my girlfriend's looks no matter what."
649,don't worry we got you...
650,truth
651,exactly
652,Yup
653,"When my gf began FaceTiming me without makeup on and happy to show her face and just sit on FaceTime to me, it felt really good that she felt comfortable enough around me to do that - not sure if that actually answers your question though"
654,"As long as there's not too much make up, to the point that I don't know what's real and what's not, I'm fine"
655,"It’s nice to be with a girl who always looks good, makeup or otherwise. It feels better to be with a girl who always looks good rather than a girl who needs to take 30 minutes in front of a mirror to look presentable."
656,"Being glammed up really hits us dudes with a ""WOW"" that blows us away when it's not every day. When it's every single day of the year is when we start asking questions like ""what's she compensating for?""

 Being bare faced is good too, especially if you have nice skin. It also really lets us take in your natural beauty which imo is the best. 

There's been a couple times when I see a pretty girl with no makeup everyday and when she gets all glammed up my jaw drops. It actually make me feel they were more attractive on general. 

Like aboogie witdahoodie once said, ""my b*tch look better in person, but she's still picture perfect"""
657,"I like seeing the raw of other people but if makeup gives girls a confidence boost then I'd say I'd rather see them feeling confident and comfortable than me seeing them without their eyebrows filled or whatever it is girls do. 

In short, you do you, girl"
658,I can agree with you on some level. But when they be making those eyebrows as big as their forehead. We can tell
659,"I don't even know my best friends' eye colors, why would I pay attention to whether yall're wearing makeup?"
660,"That and whenever there’s a really attractive girl that you think is out of your league, it’s almost like you feel like she’s just too good for you and deserves to be with someone better. Or at least that’s how I feel"
661,Would you ask out some 10/10 movie actor level hot guy with no fear?
662,Either A: they think they’re out of their league            Or B: they are nervous to ask out a girl in fear of rejection and embarrassment
663,"What I think happens is we go through the same mindset you do. Some people have no clue what league they're in but most of us see ourselves lower than other people, even girls. But the intimidating part might be the competition. High league girls are usually chased by high league guys, and they almost have a definite chance in my mind and always seem to become a high league girl's bf before I can even try to talk to her. But I have now realized there's no such thing as ""league's"". My dad has taught me that the low hanging fruits always have a bad seed, but if you climb to the top of the tree it's much more rewarding. Basically if you try hard enough you can be with anyone."
664,hell no
665,Well that sounds like more of an individual case than a generalization. Not all girls are like that
666,Is it too much to ask for both
667,"Cause attractive girls give mean rejections

Well atleast the handful of expiriences i had"
668,"Yeah, was in a similar situation, but actually I started dating her, and we were in a relationship for about a month, but we broke up(we both messed up), and I figured out that these “elite” girls are just a waste of time as they switch boyfriends every few weeks."
669,And then when she gets with someone that looks in the same league as you you kick yourself for days
670,Not if one of you two is the big gey
671,Attractive girls already have attractive guys going after them so if they're not dating an attractive guy yet... why would she date an unattractive guy. That's the mindset.
672,Hmm
673,"Depends, if it's Danny devito fucking yes. Any other celebrity nah.- some 15 year old boy"
674,"I had an epiphany the other day. I remember wanted to ask out a girl but considered her out of my league. I’m an above average dude I think, but to me, all girls appear out of my league. It wasn’t till recently when I took a step back and realized she was in my league"
675,Attractive girls intimidate me because they’d probably see someone like me as a joke.
676,I guess B almost always comes with A
677,why are girls scared of asking out guys period?
678,"can confirm, am big gay."
679,"Thanks, greasy nazi!"
680,Happy cake day
681,we live in a society
682,I’m in this reply and I don’t like it
683,*~~^((i know))~~*
684,"all the guys who like me (at least the ones who say anything) are rly gross and weird and all the guys i like are hot and do sports and i feel like i never get approached by anyone i would consider dating. maybe i should just give up on them coming to me and go ask out guys. i’m not rly nervous about asking people out, i just like it when they come to me first"
685,Yep. I'd rather be alone than embarrass myself by getting rejected. Probably why I don't have a gf now.
686,Thankyou u/greasy_nazi
687,"I personally am not, lots of guys are really really afraid of rejection, once I realized that the worst thing that can happen is they say no and we move on I stopped being afraid asking out hot girls, lots of guys cant get through that hoop because they dont have a thing that boosts their confidence."
688,pretty much
689,"it's just that once you see a girl and you lable her as more  beautiful than you , you just don't bother with trying to make an effort cuz she won't settle for less than she can get or smth like that"
690,"So even if you didn't necessarily like the girl yet, you would try dating her to see if it develops into something more serious if you guys got along?"
691,"If we would have at least 1 common hobby, then yeah tbh"
692,[deleted]
693,"Yeah, as long as shes within age range. A little bit of affection can go a long way.

Edit: typo"
694,"This needs to be higher up. Let's be honest, Reddit isnt exactly full of the most social people so opinions here are pretty different to the general irl demographics"
695,"> a somewhat attractive girl

If that's the case you usually only have to exist and try not to be an asshole, nobody likes assholes, no matter how good they look."
696,"Alright makes sense, thanks :)"
697,"Okay thanks, good to know! I will keep this in mind next time I like a guy who I have things in common with lol"
698,"Yeah, I definitely know that not everyone would agree with this. Tbh it was more out of curiosity than anything, I don't like anyone atm so I'm not gonna be using this advice anytime soon, thanks though :D"
699,"Okay that's fair enough lol, so it's easy to catch a guy's attention if you're pretty?"
700,"Yeah age is definitely important, especially when you're younger lmao but good to know, thanks for the response"
701,"Yes, it is. We always try not to stare to much. *(sorry if this sounded creepy)*"
702,"I'm gay so no.

But for most probably"
703,[deleted]
704,"Nah, I get you, I'm the same way when I see guys in public I think are attractive lol"
705,If it walks our kind will fuck it.
706,Oh okay good I thought you were asking with the intention of asking someone out XD
707,"Yeah I can definitely see why someone would think that, I could've been a lot clearer about that in the post lol

But no I would never ask a Reddit sub full of teenagers for actual life advice haha"
708,If I knew her well enough...why not
709,Lmao fav response so far
710,That's the first time I hear that from a girl. Haha.
711,"Trust me, we also find guys attractive and also don't wanna get caught staring either, haha. I especially am awkward as fuck so eye contact with strangers is like death for me lmao I will avoid it all costs even if it means staring at the floor like a robot"
712,"im definitely the same way. i’m willing to give people a chance, and see how they are."
713,"yes it's that easy, even if they reject you, you'll make their day/week/month/lifetime"
714,Some people are into that but my answer is no. If I did my gf would leave me with 28 stab wounds.
715,"I can back this up. This girl asked to go out with me and  I only saw her as a friend but I said fuck it and told her yes. We talked for a few months and we ended it, but it didn't end poorly. Would definitely be fine with something similar (somebody else, of course) happening again."
716,You'd fuck a dog?
717,Askdhdgdh yes that's probably a good point lmao
718,Lmao you’re wiser than most then
719,That would’ve been true for me for like an year ago but I’m not looking for a relationship rn. Also they won’t go out if u directly ask them but if u give small hints for some time and then ask they’ll probably say yes. Also depends on wether the guy is like a really popular jocky dude or not.
720,I would be really fucking happy
721,Yeah I’d be weirded out because I don’t make friends with people in higher years than me.
722,"I have a thing for girls like a year or two above me so I would be flattered I guess. I’m not sure if that’s common though, I see a lot of people liking younger girls"
723,Older girls > Younger girls
724,"wait, is making friends a thing? i thought it was just rumours."
725,What the hell happened here
726,[removed]
727,Same
728,yea especially since they don't come to my school.
729,I wouldn’t
730,[removed]
731,I'm you but a year older. It doesn't get better.
732,Same
733,yep :(
734,I’d be shocked at first but that’d be cool.
735,I would love to know
736,"Not at all, would be great actually :)  I don't think guys would ever do the same (tell a girl a grade above them, they like her) or that's just me.."
737,Haha all guys school?
738,"6 soilders went down today, and now a moment of silence"
739,">10

yeah thats a bit weird bro"
740,Same
741,No not at all i started school a year earlier than anyone else at my school and even then I hung out with 8th graders when I was in 7th.
742,agree
743,Why though? The 16 year old is more mature (mentally) which just shows that she is more into you rather than the 13 year old just hitting puberty and not knowing what she wants.
744,[removed]
745,Same
746,I know that already from younger me.
747,Older girls < same age girls

750,"He just passed his 16th birthday and we got sushi and cookie cake bc that’s his favorite stuff but he said that he just went home and spent all night and morning crying, I just feel like i’m locked behind a wall  and i just watch him make comments like this and i just can’t do anything about it"
751,Good to know. Thanks!
752,you should read r/swresources and ask this on r/suicidewatch
753,Awh dude I'm real sorry. Just try and be there for him. I went through a real rough patch at Christmas cause I blamed myself for my (old) crush and his girlfriend breaking up. I felt really bad but honestly friends can help you a lot. Try and be there for him and tell him to be strong and how much he is worth which is a lot. No-one should go through what some of us do but I hope he will be okay 😊
754,"Sometimes ONE person showing they care makes a difference. Let him know that he matters to you, even if you aren’t super close. Offer to talk and listen to him and let him know you won’t judge and he can trust in you to tell you things without everyone else knowing. If you think it’s really bad you may also want to tell a school counselor if you feel you can’t help."
755,bad bot this is good post
756,Alright thanks
757,I know it may be hard but you need to let him know you are there and you need to talk to him. Recently one of my best friends alluded to doing it and went missing for a day. He may have felt like a dick when he came back (unneeded) but he saw all the messages in the group chat of us all freaking out and released as much as we act like dicks we care about him
758,"Don’t just let him know you care, SHOW IT. This sounds really really serious, and despite you not being super close, that means nothing when his life might be on the line. You need to tell a trusted adult. A teacher, your parents, his parents. He may not like it at the moment, but wouldn’t you rather him be alive and mad rather then dead? Don’t hesitate to reach out. Like everyone else said, just be there for him, but don’t pressure him to say anything he might feel uncomfortable with. You want to try and treat him like he’s any other buddy( but obviously be a little sensitive to his situation). Remember to also take care of yourself! I wish you the best of luck, and I wish him all the best. You’re a good person!"
759,No worries 😊
760,"Ask your parents. Adult intervention becomes a requirement if you want to save his life, keep is under wraps but MAKE sure he gets help and right now immediately ask you parents for help. This is serious, don’t brush it off and take action immediately. Stay with him."
761,You such a nice wholesome person.
762,You should make an effort to get in touch with his parents. They are around him the most and will be able to get him help.
763,"Thanks dick, not helpful"
764,hey if it gets really bad you can put him on suicide watch to make sure he stays safe but yeah just let him know he’s loved
765,"im so sorry man, i think about doing stuff too sometimes and  the things that get me thinking that i should not are my friends and family. just be there for him"
766,Aw thanks so much. I'm sure you are way more wholesome though.😊
767,"No, stop it. I can't take all this wholesomeness. 😊"
768,Aw wow you're really sweet! I'm glad most.people on Reddit are like this! Hope you can help your friend and if you ever want any advice then I'm always free to drop a PM to! Wish you all the best! 🥰🥰
769,"Oh no I think you mixed up people, but I know you mean good intentions :)"
770,You have to tell someone. He is worth something to someone obviously.
771,"Ask him to run some errands or to help you with some stuff. This might serve to make him feel more useful and he’ll feel needed more. It’s a long shot, but this could help him feel like he has a purpose in life again. All the best."
772,Thanks a lot for the advice :)
773,holy fuck I read the 'He just passed' part and thought he'd actually gone and done it shit did that scare me
774,Oh I'm so sorry! I didn't read the edits until just now! I'm glad that you two are becoming friends! Wish you both the best my wholesome and lovely Redditor friend! 🌻🌻
775,Don’t bring it up unless y’all are alone. Talk to them often about him much you care for him. Be there for him. You should talk to them about it at a time where y’all don’t have anywhere to be afterwards and he can leave if he wants. Don’t loose a friend
776,"Talk with them, if you're in the building and they start to act on it you can restrain them and not be charged thanks to Good Samaritan laws in the US. That's a last last last resort.

When it comes to what to say, there really isn't a best option. From the one time I had to, you should be a shoulder for them and try and give them something to live for. But the caveat is that the only way I was able to save the person was a threat that I'd tell their friends what was going on because I was failing. The bit of advice I gave was given to me after.

I wish you good luck and I hope you can get your friend the treatment they need and deserve."
777,If he’s a big gamer and literally wiped his computer that’s an awful sign. Definitely ask for help from suicide related subreddits.
778,Show him any kindness possible. He is planning on giving away his stuff and that is some serious stuff. I would advise his parents (if they aren’t abusive) and try your best to show him that at least someone will accept his company. Invite him over to hang out and talk. If you do manage to help him he will be forever grateful. Also guys cherish every compliment they get.
779,"Go to his house and be with him, contact his parents, call the police"
780,"Same, best friends in school, never hung out after school, been friends for 4 months and only ever talked about it. Like ""yeahhh we should go shopping sometime!"" Yeah it wont happen"
781,They're probably too scared to ask you to hangout
782,Pretty much sums up my relationship with every student in my year
783,Gas or charcoal?
784,"same cuz i only hang out with like, 2 of my friends and they're both grills"
785,"Do people really hang out after school? Like, I'd walk home with someone but who has the energy to actually go home and do stuff?"
786,Dried kelp
787,"You just ask them. Like ""are you free on saturday night?"" If they say no, try two times asking them again and then give up."
788,I got a friends that comes over almost every day after a school lmao
789,That sounds... exhausting. I love my friends but dammit I need my quiet time
790,yuuup :/
791,Yeah. But we play video games and stuff so it alright
792,Yeah I have a few people like that. But my parents don’t let me hang out with my proper friends outside of school so technically everyone is a friend like that to me.
793,"Yeah my parents do that a lot too, but my friends don't understand the extent of it. I always have to debate for like an hour or more on average if I wanna go out and even then I have to hear snarky comments about it for weeks. At this point I have no will to even try going out lol."

801,"Not a boy but I yes. I mean, not a lot of friends but I have one. We've been friends for 9 years and we haven't seen each other outside school in like a year."
802,"Yep. Especially now since I’m in uni, I’m friends with people from all of the classes I take but only hangout with like two outside of school."

806,"I've went out with school friends one or two times, but mostly when i hang somewhere its with my friend who goes to a different school."

812,"Thanks man, makes me feel a little better. Have you got a story?"
813,"Oh god mate, Im sorry for you but that was kinda stupid, but you prolly knew that haha




Well mine is that she made me a compliment about how I laugh and I said ,,Im sorry but I have nothing to make you feel flattered"" that was 3 days ago haha"
814,"i can't answer because no girls talk to me anyway and when I try to talk they either say something really mean or walk away :(

816,"A girl approached me when I was walking home and clearly liked me but I was running extremely late from my pokemon go hunting so I kept speed walking while trying to hold a convo. It didnt work too well:/

Unrelated but yesterday I was just sitting there and it hit me that there were some girls I totally think liked me but I was just too fucking stupid to realize it. One example is really bad.

Edit:

Maybe I exaggerated a little bit but at my math table it was me, another guy, and 2 girls who were good friends. The two girls were talking to me a lot and looking back I think it was partially flirting. Me being the insecure kid I was back then, I thought they were just making fun of me for some reason 🤦‍♂️

Anyway the icing on the cake was when we found out we have a similar birthday and she fucking says ""I heard people with close birthdays get along really well together"" which instead of thinking she might be talking about us being together, my dumbass just thought ""sounds like some horoscope bs to me"""
817,"She said ""you're kinda cute"" and then I got scared and muttered ""thanks"" so quietly that I could barely hear myself"

“Idk bro I’m pretty tired, what would we even do?”

830,"The class was on an ice skating trip and this one girl didn't know how to and was doing that awkward shambles around the ring. I offered to help her and for a while I taught her the basics of how to skate. Near the end of the trip we stop in the middle, she has her arms on my shoulder, looking me in the eyes thanking me. She leans in and for some reason my dumbass decides to spin us around at break neck speed and spin her away. She screams extremely loud and me and the boys start laughing and name her banshee, I actually liked her so I dont know why I didn't take that obvious opportunity because now I have been locked in...*the zone*."

832,"I asked for a girl I had been chatting with for a bit at a dance for her social media. (Snapchat or insta, I forget which). She said she didn’t have any social media because her parents wouldn’t let her have a smart phone, but then she promptly handed me her flip phone. In retrospect it was super obvious she wanted me to ask for the number but I was just kinda like “oh, wow, cool phone, here you go” and handed it back, then walked away.

She was a pretty attractive redhead too and her friends later told me she was into me, but alas, we’re out of touch now."
833,"At a school dance this past fall, kinda awkward but one of my friends manages to pull me into the dance floor. Hottest girl in the school (who I was kinda crushing on at the time) comes up to me dancing (no exactly sexually but kinda pulling me towards her) and shouting my name over the music. 

What does my dumbass do? I say ""hey"" and tell my friend that she should have fun without me and walk off the dance floor. 

Looking back on it, I still kinda kick myself for it."

843,"Yeah, I thought they got temporarily blinded everytime I adjust my balls"
844,spittin big fax about balls my guy
845,I think they can and have already. But if my balls itch other people’s eyes aint gonna change what I do. Priority number one - balls
846,I feel you
847,Well you see we do try without getting noticed. Buttt some doods hands are big so it seems very suspicious to adjust it slowly. Edit big hands applies to myself so its hard...
848,My fish gotta swim bro
849,^i ^can ^smell ^you
850,guy spittin fax about my big balls
851,"you took the words right out of my mouth, good sir"

853,She’s too busy staring at guys crotches lol
854,No but i wouldnt find it weird
855,What. Do you notice us doing that? I thought I was being discrete every time.
856,"r/shittysuperpowers

Temporarily blind women while adjusting your scrotum"
857,Both cirlce shapes and the opposite sex wants them
858,We're too busy with a significant ball problem to worry about people looking
859,full homo
860,I always wondered how guys with big hands do it without getting noticed. Especially when having big hands is to big number of woman very attractive so they would probably pay attention to what your hands are doing.
861,More like r/godtiersuperpowers
862,you think girls want balls?
863,We kinda assume that someone might notice but we try not to make it obvious
864,Guy spittin on my big balls
865,Only one time. It was a total paradigm shift.
866,I read this in a certain voice that can only be described as how this font sounds
867,BALLLS ARE ALWAYS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE!!

873,"I heard that ""Your mother cooks without salt."" is a Turkish insult, cause things don't taste good if you cool them without salt."
874,You picked the right option. Just imagine how much fun it is to yell German words in a videogame.
875,My friends call me a nazi because I chose German for my optional subjects.
876,u/Wxze insult me
877,"""I constantly overestimate your intelligence"". 

Said by my teacher. 

Another one was ""Gay Charles"", as in Ray Charles. 
Cuz I was wearing my sunnies and pretending to play piano lol."
878,Its fun to yell german words in real life.

883,That's brutal
884,"(both directed at me) hemaphrodite rapunzel, and you look like if insomnia was a person"
885,Lets say that a certain ammount of alcohol happened and certain german marching songs of a certain event in the last century were being sang very loudly. My friends were singing Sieg Heil Victoria and we got in a lot of trouble and the staff didnt like us after that.
886,“So this is why people talk about you”
887,"""Bread can go moldy, what can you?"""
888,"One time my friend said ""I bet you don't wash your hands after you masturbate"", never been so insulted before"

890,I saw “condom defect” on reddit once
891,You are bad at this
892,"""Your birth certificate was an apology letter from the condom factory"""
893,That sounds like something you’d hear out of a sitcom
894,"You're lucky that you didn't get a fine for that, or did you?"
895,What happened?
896,Мочи перхоти
897,Not bad just mentally devastating. “You deserve to have every Oreo you ever eat break off and drop into the milk.” It took me some time to recover from that one.
898,It really fucks them up too
899,I think I'm going to use that from now on.
900,bro hes sexy
901,Idk no homo or anything but Tom Holland is cute rather than sexy.
902,but ive called other guys cute or hot before and he never seemed to care
903,That’s odd then. Maybe it made him feel insecure but I really don’t know.
904,"no, especially with celebrities. if you ranted about how sexy his best friend is for half an hour then I would understand but this seems pretty weird to me"
905,He just hates Tom Holland.
906,"I'm a pretty jealous guy, and i wouldn't really mind it, i'd just feel a little bad for not being the one considered hot by my gf (but i'm ugly as fuck so it wouldn't matter anyways lol)"
907,"As long as you’re ok with him saying the same about other girls, then sure."
908,yeah ill just talk to him about it I guess
909,THIS
910,Yeah I’m starting to think this right here is the problem
911,yeah I guess
912,Tom is shredded af maybe he isnt confident in his body 🤷‍♂️
913,he is gorgeous
914,Well a lot of girls fo off if their BF said that a Female Celebrity is cute/hot altough i do not understand this behavior why wouldn't it also exist in Boys? It's just plain jelousy.
915,he is
916,"this is the point. I'd usually say nah, that's fine. But, taking my own relationship into account, my luv would absolutely die if I said someone else was hot, so I feel like I can also be sad if she says something like that. We're both comfortable with this behavior, and it doesn't ruin anything for us. I believe it even helps us lessen our insecurities, which are *many*. So, OP should work it out with him."
917,Or maybe he is also attracted to Tom Holland and wants to hide it
918,"Meh as long if you’re bf/gf is allowed to call other people of the opposite gender hot, then you should be to. Just because you think someone is attractive doesn’t mean you want to leave your relationship. However, if one person in the relationship doesn’t like it then their wishes should be respected. No real harm in not calling someone hot."
919,i thought you were a guy and that this was a shitpost smh
920,"No love for my boy, Tobey ):"
921,glad we all agree
922,"Yeah look at that emoji right there, no wonder."
923,"if i say this believe it, i am gay."
924,hi gay I'm dad
925,This
926,yep
927,absolutely
928,"Maybe focus on your boyfriend instead of Tom Holland’s abs, then he knows you actually appreciate him"
929,"Let me give you a reality check on jealousy. When it exists in a relationship like that the jealous person would then not trust you to do anything with any other guys. It then leads to him getting angry for you even speaking to a guy. I was in a jealous relationship and she always got angry at me for speaking a word to another girl, even if I was introducing myself. So all in all, jealousy shouldn't exist in a relationship."
930,Our second date. But I love the poem dawg
931,Depends on what you’re doing. If you’re watching a movie just sit close to one another and cuddle.
932,Thanks
933,"sadly never been in your position, good luck comrade Godspeed"
934,Me driving to the gas station to grab a condom lol
935,I think we’re doing homework but I may see if she’ll put in a movie if we finish early and her dad isn’t coming home
936,Not a lot of cuddle time when doing homework.
937,"Nope, but we also have like 4 hours of time to do a half hour assignment"
938,What’s the other 10%?
939,"Sounds like movie night to me 😉    
Just sit close and you’ll eventually just naturally lean on one another. 

Worst case scenario you can do the yawn thing where you fake yawn and then put your arm around her. It’s cute if you make a big deal out of it and make it seem like a joke."
940,I second this
941,"I have a sorrow

Yeah im in real trouble

The second date‘s tomorrow 

How the fuck do I cuddle"
942,*respect +1*
943,"Howpfully u see this in time if it helps

Basically just get close to eachother and if ur sitting down just have ur arm around her from behind and pull her close to you and I guess just do whatever feels natural at that point. My girlfriend just likes leaning on me while my arm is around her and my other hand is holding her hand or playing with her hair.
If you're both doing homework then cuddling isn't ideal but I'd there is a movie then just have ur arm around her and let ur lean on u tbh. It's not that difficult once ur there but yeah. Good luck man it's really comfy and has a very safe feeling for some reason"
944,I third this
945,Try r/askteengirls
946,This made me smile. Definitely gonna add it to my reservoir of cute little humor.
947,"Yes, comrade Godspeed, good luck"
948,"Just have one in your jacket's left breast pocket just in case. No one ever checks that pocket so if it doesn't happen, you won't look like an idiot for having too high expectations."
949,I turd dis
950,"they shake hands and walk away, business as usual"
951,you just keep getting a little bit closer and closer when yall are together and she might get the message
952,"It’s a little late but still had to post this:

I just came back home

The date wasn’t great

Never learned how to cuddle

But now it’s too late"
953,"Alright I know this is a weird question, but are you significantly bigger/taller than her? If you are then I would suggest to be the big spoon, unless she prefers that, also when you cuddle you not just go straight into it, you start close but not too close, and eventually you both start loving closer together and then it just happens."
954,Flashbacks to u/alt-no-more
955,I poop this
956,"Nah the Indian dude at the BP would sell condoms to 6th graders, I’ve seen it first hand (they bought them as a joke)"

965,yes

967,"What if I don't wanna?

Jk jk I'll have a look"
968,"They're not about light mode, it's just cause the picture is text on a stark white background"
969,Yes ma'am
970,"Good that you're making stickied faq's, tired of seeing the same posts over and over."
971,Sorry kate. Those faq are hard to answer for me
972,Sorry for asking if this is obvious but what if you don’t know the answer do you still put something?
973,Why the hell are the first 3 comments I read on this post moaning about light mode?
974,"*is gay*

now isn’t that just unfortunate"
975,Well my point is they’re all presumably using dark mode and complaining because the image is lighter due to them using dark mode all the time. You know what I meant.

I follow another account called not throwaway lmao."
984,Gay FAQs are coming soon
985,no
986,Fair enough then. These comments huts annoy me because it’s a dumb circlejerk imo. I don’t care if you use dark mode.
987,wouldnt that completely destroy the point of the sub? (not disagreeing)
988,"Because they might have a valid answer to the question, or just have something fun they might want to say. The current rules work well for both subs so I see no need to change them."
989,I know I'm being a little persistent but why would the opposite gender comment on the opposite subs at all? I would've thought they would just spectate and look at responses and stuff.
990,There's a [Boys Only] flair where it would be the same as in ATG. And in ATG you can flair it [Everyone] so it's the same as here
991,"There was a huge problem with guys answering questions meant for girls, so they put that rule in."
992,"Kind of backwards, I find"
993,"I agree with you, but thats just the mods decision"
994,"No, if you think so just flair it boys only"
995,"ah ok, gotcha"
996,shouldn't the rule have been put anyway?
997,Because of the amount of dudes commenting on ATG was a huge issue.
998,this is the worst saying i've ever heard and i have no idea why people still use it
999,"Because the male mods on ATG (if there even are any) aren’t very active, but the main mod here is Kate, who is a bit strict on some rules, removes posts that are there in genuine need, but not posts that break more rules, and well, judging by the name is a chic and a bit partial to chics"
1000,Do you enjoy perpetual mediocrity? Because that’s how you get perpetual mediocrity.
1001,If it was a problem they'd be downvoted a lot. Clearly it isn't bothering people
1002,Because all of my posts that have been removed were by Kate for really ridiculous reasons that other posts also had but she left. Big double standard
1003,"To me, this subs fine how it is. If it aint broke don’t fix it"
1004,"Because Reddit is populated mostly by dudes even if they had regular vote weight we’d still probably outnumber them. I go on a sub about what girls think about something, I don’t want a dude as the top comment especially when a lot of the times it’s some dumb shit and not an actual answer.  Even with girls commenting here we outnumber them by far so I don’t care"
1005,There’s a vote few weeks ago about banning girls and it didn’t pass.
1006,"Omg a girl comment, where are the mods? /s"
1007,"If it aint broke, dont fix it"
1008,"The problem was that they weren't being downvoted, if they were then they wouldn't have drowned out the other comments"
1009,And a lot of times OP ask everyone a question and just forget to flair it as [everyone]

1019,"So the night before, I got like 15 minutes of sleep. So the entire day I was a giggly, seemingly drunken mess. I went to my English class, and my english teacher made us get into groups. Then we had the assignment to draw what a character from ""Of Mice and Men"" represented. My group got Crooks, which in case you didnt know, represents discrimination because everyone hates him because hes black. So I was in a group with one of my friends and no one else, and in a situation like that, bad ideas seem like great ideas. We drew a white person saying to a black person ""you're not invited to my birthday party"" because we were giggly shits and didnt think about what we were saying. It was our turn to present, I stand up, paper in hand, and I say, loudly and proudly, ""I drew racism"". Half of the class was laughing their ass off, and the other half looked like they wanted to kill me. At a certain point, a girl sitting next to me says ""you know racism isnt a joke, right"". At that point I get really flustered and I sit down. I decide to actually LOOK at the people around me, and everyone just looks either like they're pissed or like they feel bad for me. My partner is actually crying. Immediately after that class ended I went to go talk to my black friend.

Tldr: I drew racism

EDIT: to everyone saying that they over reacted: you need to realize that I didnt just say ""I drew racism"", there was a good half a presentation that I didnt describe. Also, there are things that you can say online that you cant say in your english class. Like, you cant say that you want to kill yourself to your employer, they may not realize that it's just a joke. This isnt that exact scenario, but it's similar."
1020,Our basketball coach asked one of the girls basketball players for nudes on snap
1021,That sounds like a way to make your reputation rise if someone did this they’d get mad respect
1022,"For one, don't date a middle schooler when you're in 11th grade, and (same guy, different girl) don't sexually abuse your girlfriend and then brag about how she probably won't press charges."

1024,Omg story?
1025,"A girl sexually harassed several other girls at my school, faked being transgender, faked having Tourette’s, was hyper sexual, faked their own death, and a bunch of other."
1026,"Attempted suicide. She had shitty friends who let it leak and then other people were shitty about it and spread the information as well. 

I'm not sure exactly how this affected her relationships. However, it's not a good thing to have people gossiping like that behind your back so it didn't help her reputation."
1027,Honestly i dont get their reaction
1028,How the fuck do You get caught by a teacher? Did he like look under the stalls in the student bathrooms?
1029,"this 12th grader was abusive to his gf and sexually abused her (she was in 10th grade i think)

as you can assume, the school had everything but a positive opinion about him when that was revealed"

1032,"Some guy in my school snuck in the girls bathroom, stole a bra, and then jerked off in it.

Then he threatened to kill himself on his snap story. For some reason he wasn’t expelled."
1033,"The guy was married and had kids too

Idk how he thought he would get away with it"
1034,Oh my god
1035,"This reminds me of an argument I had with a german teacher. She segmented our class into girls and boys and let each group analyse a different poem. The boy‘s poem had 4 verses more than the girl‘s poem and we were 3 fewer than the girls.
I started an argument with the teacher that it‘s sexist and she shouldn‘t make groups based on gender, it would basically have been the same as making groups based on skin color. The whole class got tired of it and wanted me to just let it go but I didn‘t, I refused to do the task that way. In the end I stood up, crumpled the paper and threw it in the direction of the bin without looking while walking out. I went to the secretary and asked how I could deal with the teacher and didn‘t show up until the next lesson. When I came back for the next lesson the boys looked at me like I was a savage and said „by the way, you hit“. I didn‘t get what they meant at first but was quite pleased when they explained I had hit the bin. Teacher never mentioned it again to me nor gave me any bad marks or annotation in the class book. Humble bragging always get downvoted but I think I left a lovely impression"
1036,Who the fuck takes off their pants for a wank?
1037,"Yeah they took that way too seriously, wtf. Idk, if you live in a area with a lot of racial discrimination I could kind of understand them? Still a bit far to assume you were racist from just that"

1041,"The math department at my school is cursed. 

Two years ago a math teacher ran from a scene of a hit and run she committed. Her car had multiple empty pill bottles spilling out, and she was drunk when the police caught up. She resisted arrest and tried and flashed the cops. Luckily no one was hurt except her dignity.

This year another math teacher wound up getting escorted out of the school by the police in the middle of the day because he was caught flirting intensely with former members of the girls’ soccer team he coached. They had just graduated but it’s speculated that it had gone on for a while."
1042,Two kids were fucking in a bathroom or under stairs (I never saw the actual video so I'm not sure completely). They got expelled and you can get in trouble for mentioning them now

1044,"Lmao this reminds me of something in the last year of highschool.

I had two friends who were pretty close and whenever we brought that up, they would say ""we're like siblings"" and we'd leave it.

One day they were caught making out .

You know this wouldn't have been bad if it was just making out, the fact that this went full Alabama is what made it weird. It was the end of school for all of us but their image has been spoiled and whenever me and the boys recollect school memories we'll say like

""Yo, you remember that Alabama couple?"""
1045,"They call them freshies at your school💀

And WHY. Why didn’t he *at least, at bare fucking minimum* go to the restroom?"
1046,"A girl this year told everyone that she was pregnant and that she didn’t know what to do with it. She also said she had sex with 4 dudes( it was consented but she said she got paid so is that prostitution and the were over 20). SHE WAS IN 8TH GRADE. Turns out she wasn’t pregnant and just wanted attention. The whole school knew about it.

One of my friends said the she had sex with her friends friend who didn’t go to our school."

1049,Oh yea most definitely
1050,"Make sure you know what you’re getting into before you go in. Not to be a Debbie downer, but some people are just creeps, and others you may just not click with. In your journey for a boyfriend, I’d say to first look for a good friend that you could realistically get closer with. Nothing worse than those 3 week - 2 month relationships that leave nothing by bruised egos, hurt feelings, and regret. So make sure you’re smart about what you go about doing."
1051,"Literally just talk to him he'll fall in love lol

but seriously that's kinda it. Become his friend first, let fate dictate the rest"

1055,oh its especially worse with other men
1056,Oh yeah sounds like me exactly
1057,You've gotta ask him out of he doesn't 'cos most guys want the girl to make the first move and are too scared to do so themselves
1058,7/10
1059,Are you cute?
1060,"This, I know many guys (myself included) that don't often get compliments. If you genuinely compliment a guy he might not show it immediately but most will remember it for a long long time. Heck I still have notes from in class when we genuinely had to compliment whoever we wanted and it never fails to make me feel appreciated."
1061,I’m in this photo and I don’t like it
1062,"Yeah this one is pretty important. Don't get into a relationship just because you want to be in one because that can just lead to some really bad short relationships that end bitterly. Sometimes it works out, but don't do it just bc everybody else is in a relationship or people pressure/tease you about being single."
1063,"I'll never have a girlfriend myself, too ugly and awkward for that.

All that friend bond stuff should be done within 2 weeks to avoid the friend zone"
1070,"LPT: most guys are so starved for attention even a compliment will get you in their radar, good luck op"
1071,Yeah definitely do that
1072,"i was complimented on my hair when i was 12 by my crush, never changed the style since"
1073,"NPC energy, and same"
1074,"I would say *definitely* compliment him. Guys remember compliments for literally years so that will go a long way. Also us dudes are fucking idiots when it comes to getting hints so be as *obvious* as possible. Don't be creepy but definitely show your interested and even a little more than that. Don't be afraid to make moves on the guy, cause chances are if you wait a for a guy to do something, especially at this age, it's not gonna happen lol."
1075,hijacking top comment to say: A compliment genuinely goes a long way. Something as simple as an “You look cute” or something really means a lot
1076,This is way too relatable
1077,"Yeah, this is the right answer. We've all done it but we would never admit to it. Its really weird that someone told OP."

1087,Would you be as creeped out if a girl told you she masturbates to you? (serious question)
1088,[deleted]
1089,This OP but honestly creep much?
1090,Yeah that's basically what I do but with the guys.
1091,wait so you guys do it?
1092,"Yeah, most guys jerk off to the girls we like but for example I have only done it once so it's not like we do it everyday"
1093,"That’s weird thats he admitted it to you, but yea we do sometimes jerk off to our female friends."
1094,"Yeah, it's weird. That's why we say not our proudest moment. I've pretty much stopped but I'd be lying if I said I've never done it."
1095,[deleted]
1096,And that's the way the cookie crumbles.
1097,"They’re our friends, doesn’t mean our standards on what we find attractive doesn’t apply to them"
1098,a nut is a nut
1099,Yeah same
1100,"HOLD ON. Girls, masterbate???? WHAT THE FUCK?



Im kidding, they just dont talk about it much"
1101,"Yes, but you’re supposed to keep that shit to yourself, especially not tell the person you jacked off to that you did"
1102,you speak for the people
1103,"If you're a casual, that is"
1104,Inspiration? Lmao
1105,"OP asked if they do it to girls they know not just their crush

Theres quite a few guys who jerk it even if they arent their crush"
1106,"Girl here, but what’s bad about fapping to ur crush? It’s not like ur objectifying them just by sexualizing them"
1107,"The same shit happens to me, I wake up thinking wtf"
1108,You’re definitely not the only one. The human brain dreams about reproduction and power. Aka sex fantasies. This is completely normal.
1109,Yeah I do too
1110,"Im sitting here reading about how people can dream about fucking someone, and thinking to myself ""Those lucky cunts"""
1111,Mega oof
1112,If you can't get the puss IRL your brain got you covered
1113,Yeah ur just like uhhhhb
1114,Good to know it's not just me
1115,"I've had it happen twice, one actually was in my house and I was really freaked out. The other way at a fucking spa, it makes no sense whatsoever."
1116,Giga oof
1117,My wet dreams usually are about me masturbating :(
1118,Was raped by my mom once in a dream. Later virgins
1119,Same here fam squad
1120,"I got tired of the dreams happening and they were about the same person so I took action and got to know them, turned out she’s a freak, in a very not good way"
1121,Ginormous oof
1122,Terra oof
1123,Extra Virgin
1124,It's awkward when you look at the person right? Ur just like 0-0
1125,"Yeah it’s the worst, finally a place with people I understand"
1126,Oo F
1127,I got that irl at all times
1128,That's some The Giver type shit
1129,It happens to me too. It happens less so when I have a person I have a crush on or am dating someone for obvious reasons.
1130,Yeah
1131,r/suicidebywords
1132,The one time I’ve had sex in a dream my dick was invisible. I felt it but I didn’t see a bit of it
1133,F
1134,"Sleep virgin, did actually weirdly marry in my sleep fucken weird"
1135,"I always get cockblocked by the SAME FRIEND

I would be on the bed with someone and he’d just APPEAR. 

That’s why he’s not my friend anymore."
1136,O F
1137,Hey! I am all three of those things! Pretty acurate so i dont mind
1138,hahahah imagine not having secks lmaoooooo
1139,"I hate it also when gay is used as an insult and it's just like, ""okay, and?"" (I don't actually say that because im closeted bi but my point still stands lmao)"
1140,Lmao makes sense
1141,"It's the same reason why ""gay"" is an insult. It stems from ignorance and insecurity, the stimulus of losing your virginity in today's day and age is dumb"
1142,I guess that’s why “gay” is used as an insult but that’s way worse
1143,"Same I'm just like ""yea wanna fuck?"""
1144,"Hey dude that was his life together!

_that will teach him_"
1145,I am a virgin and you are fuckin virgin bro wtf lmfaooo
1146,Nah it’s the people that are insecure about themselves. Actually that describes incels pretty well
1147,because they smol pp an try to cover insecurity
1148,"Idk man, you seem pretty gay to me."
1149,That's pretty gay
1150,Fr thoo
1151,Thanks babe
1152,Virgin
1153,But... But... I am gay ;)
1154,Omg yes.
1155,people often feel insecure about it so it's a good insult
1156,u 👏🏻 hav 👏🏻 no 👏🏻 seks 👏🏻
1157,But what they don't know is I'm a half fag
1158,At my school people just say faggot as their go-to insult
1159,Im not sure if this dumbass ( me ) gets what u mean
1160,"Get gf 

wait for gf to get h word

????

Profit"
1161,"I use it from the virgin vs chad meme, it isn't supposed to be literal if it was I would have no room to talk."
1162,"You have no idea how any of this works, do you?"
1163,only a true virgin calls another a virgin
1164,Now I'm gonna kms. :(
1165,Virgin
1166,">it's a power move to lose your virginity at 12/13/14

that sentence is evident of your immaturity towards interpersonal relationships, proving that you're not anywhere close to having sex, nor are you even ready for the responsibility."

1169,"This may be a bit of an overstatement, jeans are very hard to rip through. Maybe just through shorts and sweatpants but I don’t think you could rip through jeans."
1170,"For me, yes, since I laugh at them too. I like anyone with my sense of humor"
1171,Fuck I need new jeans
1172,[deleted]
1173,It depends on the laugh. OP what does your laugh sound like?
1174,"Hell yeah, to both. I like people I can laugh with"
1175,Yeah! It's always great when a girl is not offended by those jokes. It's even better when the girl makes the joke.
1176,Time for some jorts
1177,All im gonna say is that dark humour is the best humour.
1178,Fuck I need a new pair of shorts and a towel to clean up with
1179,"I had this friend who is otherwise quiet, but she made a few inappropriate jokes. I had a crush on her, (I'm not sure if it's related), but we don't really talk anymore. But in general, I say yes."
1180,Use your old shorts bröther
1181,Agreed
1182,It ripped through them all
1183,Multiple layers
1184,New jeans time
1185,Ya I had all of my pairs of shorts on
1186,"im pretty sure they looked at you for laughing is because you joined in on their conversation 

sure its rare for a girl to laugh at an inappropriate joke but its more common that they looked at you because you were someone who overheard them

whenever im having a funny convo nd all my friends are laughing , it would be pretty weird for someone to just laugh along regardless of context"
1187,Hopefully OP doesn't laugh this time
1188,I laugh at dark humor so why would I won’t like it when someone else does? Maybe these boys just don’t like dark humor
1189,Yeah
1190,We're gonna need alot of new jeans here
1191,"Seems they were surprised you understand the joke or maybe that u found it funny, anyways, congrats to you, nothing wrong with that haha"
1192,Honestly they were probably more surprised than anything
1193,"i really like it

just shows that you aren't a sensitive B\*tch and take some jokes... Also it's harder to insult you when i make one 

&#x200B;

also they are the funniest so drop one inappropriate joke from time to time :D"
1194,There's no better explanation. Who knows? Maybe they came on the spot.
1195,unless if it was loud where nearby people could hear nd laugh but if it was within their convo nd low then thats why
1196,"Idk man I think most shorts and sweat pants are too loose to rip through, I think khakis would be the perfect pant in this scenario."
1197,"During class the other day I wanted to glance over at a girl, but as soon as I did, our eyes met for like 0.0001 of a second. At first I was like *Oh shit, she knew I was going to stare at her before I even did it. Shit, I fucked up. I'm done for. They might as well lock me up.* Anyway, it took me a moment to add 2 + 2 together and realise that she must have already been looking at me (or at least in my general direction). And then I was like *Damn, is this what girls feel like when they catch me looking at them?*"
1198,"I feel that. Problem is, she’s 10 grades below me"
1199,"I feel that. Problem is, she’s two grades below me."
1200,"Smile and wave boys


Smile and wave"
1201,"Hell yeah. I have this one girl in 4th period that 180’s herself just to stare at me and gets panicked when I look at her and I think she flushed a little. It’s so fucking cute and it actually makes me look in the mirror and be like “yo, the fuck does she see in this piece of shit face”."
1202,"i dunno if its a blank stare or not, but a cute girl in my first period looks at me for a solid thirty minutes after she finishes all her work. her eyes seem to always be following my eyes and movements but i sit beside a window. and stuff is always moving where i live. but everytime i leave she has a small smirk or a bad face that is clearly trying to hide a smile. but signs are weird from girls so i never take them in a way like that."
1203,Hol up
1204,ill stare at you 😳
1205,If a girl stares at me it's whit a look of disgust
1206,r/FBIOpenTheFuckUp
1207,pretty much
1208,I dunno sounds kinda gay too me
1209,Girls don’t stare at me so I wouldn’t know
1210,r/holup
1211,Who would have known it was life advice all along...
1212,"Not sure if she was loolong at me or past me, but the fact that I like her made it so it didn't matter. I like it."
1213,[deleted]
1214,"No, I'd much rather a guy did"
1215,Awww thanks
1216,Maybe a lil bit
1217,Bro I would pay to have a cute girl look me in the eyes for a solid 30 minutes
1218,That's not a problem ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1219,"I wouldn’t say stare. But when they say hello to me in the hallway, have a nice conversation, or wave to me. It makes me feel really happy!"
1220,Now this is an avengers level threat
1221,👁👁
1222,"what the fuck is ""downbad""

I was about to ask what a ""fuck down stare"" is too"
1223,"downbad = you are down and in a bad situation when it comes to girls

it was written “stare you the fuck down” meaning staring at you pretty hard"
1224,Two grades isn't much
1225,I got harassed by my friends for dating a girl one grade below me bruh. Also i currently have a gf
1226,#👁️‍🗨️👁️‍🗨️
1227,"not necessarily, sometimes a mundane activity is made 200% better when you're doing it with someone you like"
1228,Bonus points because your SO feels proud of whooping you.
1229,"Asked this same question on this sub 2 months ago, went through with it, and now I’ve been dating the best girl ever so hell yeah bowling is great go for it :)"
1230,"Well, like if they happen to strongly dislike bowling it really wouldn't a good time for them. But if they are neutral, then it's a good ice breaker where silence can be filled up, and you can talk casually and eat food. And if they happen to enjoy bowling, big bonus. I admit it is much better than movies because you can actually talk and be silly in a bowling thing."
1231,Exactly
1232,Sounds like fun.
1233,Yea I’m going to ask her out today and I feel like I’m second guessing everything
1234,Yea that’s what I was kind of thinking but I guess I’m second guessing everything since I’m asking her out today
1235,"Bowling’s great, but worse case scenario they hate it and just sit down while you try to keep things alive. Maybe ask how they’d feel about going bowling just so you know"
1236,Hey Niko! Let’s go bowling!
1237,hell yeah
1238,Good luck dude! Make sure to update!
1239,This man playing the 900IQ game right here
1240,"Good luck gamer, lmk how it goes"
1241,Yeah why not
1242,I feel like I'm the only one who ever said yes lol I just felt kinda bad he kept asking.
1243,Vadim blyat!
1244,"Good point, will do"
1245,Nah. Go get that bread
1246,Good idea but the problem is that you are stuck with the person for 1.5 hours. So if you don't get along as well as you thought you can't just go
1247,Yeah!!
1248,I'd say billiard is a better idea
1249,"Anything where yall can just attention to the date-activity but not have to always be focused.  Allowing you to talk when have something to say and allowing to shut up when you don't as to not be awkward. 
Movie dates aren't too good as a first date because lack of conversation.

Relax have fun"
1250,Personally I love bowling
1251,"""Hey Niko, let's go bowling"""
1252,"We’re almost alike personality wise, we kinda have interest in some of the same things."
1253,"Yeah, what you said"
1254,Opa!
1255,"Niko, its me Roman! Let's go bowling!"
1256,"If I were good at it yes but I'm not so I don't think it'd be as fun. My first date was a trip to the movies. We had a cocktail each, popcorn, a drink for me, ice cream for her and a bottle of wine for the two of us. I paid for everything and it was awesome"
1257,"Maybe I’m in the minority but I’d actually prefer to be called “cute” rather than “hot.” I don’t know exactly why, it just suits me better"
1258,I second this
1259,"Yeah, cute is sorta a midpoint, like ""ehh, he's okay I guess.""

Here is my chart:

Bob is...
    10-Stunning|
     9-DILF|
     8-Handsome / Hot|
     7-Attractive|
     6-Good-looking|
     5-Cute|
     4-Alright|

     2-|
     1-Basically a goblin|

1260,Honestly it's nice but most guys can't tell if it's in a demeaning way like some think it's an insult to their masculinity.
1261,I third this
1262,"Depends on the kind of guy. If it's a tough guy (i.e. a jock, or just a generally beefy guy) and they *act* like a tough guy, chances are they may not like it. If it's a bit more of a timid guy, there's a good chance they'll like it"
1263,Make that two of us
1264,I fourth this
1265,"Honestly, as a girl I feel like saying a guy is cute means that he’s attractive inside & out. Like I’d date him"

1292,"Could try this, but they'd just say I can do that downstairs in the living room."
1293,This situation is THAT bad. If yiur dad says the you have nothing you hide story then you fit in that subreddit just as much as any other teens including me. I also had this story like you...
1294,"« I have some private things to do on it/I need some privacy »

But tbh I would just say « its not your choice »"
1295,Say that you can’t focus there. That you need silence or something like that
1296,"Computer work because they're connected through a ""local area network""    

#local    

that means the computer machine must be stationed near you to fully function"
1297,"That is an arguement I should definitely remember, especially since its basically in the living room and I usually have two sisters talking, watching movies there or playing the piano."
1298,"that shit sucks then. if you don't mind, can i ask you ehat your story is then?"
1299,My dad ripped my bedroom door out because I don't need privacy cause I don't have anything to hide. Checks my PC over my shoulder etc. Not really fun tbh
1300,">« I have some private things to do on it/I need some privacy »

My dad doesn't understand the concept of privacy tbh. He read through my sister's boyfriend's WhatsApp messages when he was on my sister's laptop that was logged in on my sister's boyfriend's gmail account

(Yeah thats a mouthful but basically what he does isn't cool and I don't think he respects privacy at all)

>But tbh I would just say « its not your choice »

Tbh I should do that but I'm scared they'll just take it away or something. They could take away my eathernet cable for example, and since my computer doesn't connect to wifi (didn't buy that part when buying) I wouldn't be able to connect to the internet."
1301,"buy a laptop. i bought a 70$ 2010 macbook and i use it daily, i dont even use my computer that much anymore unless i want to edit some videos or do 3d work"
1302,"I built a computer for like 400 bucks, and I don't want to let my parents win like that. And they would probably be against me buying a laptop because I already have a computer."
1303,"mine just gave up after a while, and let me have it; it was not a year after I bought (and sold) my laptop because I was not allowed to move it from my desk in the living room


try being loud and/or obnoxious, if they annoy you, you annoy them


start using speakers more than headphones and blast some annoying music or watching yt


just say you'll sell it if they don't let you have privacy as it's just not worth it having it otherwise


Idk, my parents have never been that uptight about keeping an eye on my internet use and all that jazzo so I can't really give any realistic advice"
1304,With that logic I could move my pc since I bought every part of it. Might as well do that then
1305,"Then I'd be disrespectful.

My sister once looked on my dad's phone when she saw a notification, and he didn't like that. We both then said ""hey that's what it feels like, do you understand that its not appreciated."" 

He replied that he understood that, but when we replied with ""could you not do it to us/our phones then"" he said no."
1306,Distraction free space like your room.  With the door closed.  wink wink  nudge nudge
1307,"Its stationed downstairs in a part of the living room, and I just have to sit there if I want to work..."
1308,"Tell them, you sometimes do homework on it, and the piano especially, makes it hard to focus. Assure them that they can just go to your room if they suspect you might be doing something they think you shouldnt. Most of the time, they will just be too lazx to actually go"
1309,He’s been disrespecting you too by not giving some privacy
1310,It's my computer. I bought all the parts and helped my sister's boyfriend build it. They already have their own computers for work and whatnot.
1311,Walk in on your father in his private time
1312,Same
1313,"I know what you mean but that isn't the reason why I want it in my room.

Its annoying if your father stands behind you and reads your discord messages or listens to you talking with friends online."
1314,That's really insane
1315,"I'm already trying to be a bit passive aggressive whenever someone says that I have to be silent while I can't move my pc buy they can, so that's a start I guess"

1324,"lol it is a very American thing. We drive to a huge car park, and watch a movie on a huge screen while listening to the audio on a certain radiofrequency.   
It's awesome cause you can bring whatever you want to eat ( pizzas, buckets of chicken, etc) and you can chill out in camping chairs or on the roof of your car.

1379,A man of culture i see
1380,"Is aglet the shoelace thing? If so, learnt it from TheOdd1sout"
1381,Just one who enjoys a good game now and again. And pays attention as well.
1382,Cultured*
1383,hell yes
1384,I learned it from someone telling me they learned it from phineas and ferb? That count?
1385,Same here.
1386,Yeah it's the plastic tip on the end of shoelaces to protect them from unraveling and stuff.
1387,You excited for the new update? last one ;(
1388,This actually makes me feel better about being ol- i mean cultured

Now imagine using a rhetorical situation that isn’t being pushed by anyone except absolute extremes because no normal person, feminist or not, is claiming that they want abortion banned if that meant the life of the mother.

I’m not vicious, and I know how people can be. I keep my distance.
Edit: for all the idiots who keep yelling at me to stop, usually it’s once someone else starts a chain of them. I figured out a long time ago that self-pity jokes don’t work. For anyone who hasn’t, I suggest you do the same."

1491,"That is a fucking stupid statement, some people have a hard time with their social life, and use self depricating jokes for the attention they strive for. Just give them pity or ignore it, don't be a dick about it"
1492,Mostly true but I have to disagree when it comes to girls. Of course in my experience it’s usually guys make “jokes” about our personalities and girls generally make “jokes” about looks. Obviously this varies but my point is a lot of girls can have low self esteem too. It’s just from different sources
1493,"Yeah, I only do that when it's actually serious, and not what everyone else is saying it"
1494,Do you have a girlfriend?
1495,Fair point. I think I’m the only irl in class who uses it

1497,When guys touch tips we can communicate telepathically
1498,The tip is sensitive
1499,Balls keep a steady temperature to make sure the semen is fertile. Your balls will come closer to your body when it’s cold out and when it’s hot they’ll distance themselves.
1500,You can move your penis side ways and around by shaking your hips violently
1501,We can flex a certain muscle and make our dick jump
1502,aka the helicopter
1503,As someone who has to swim in a speedo this is too true.
1504,Your balls stick.
1505,I dont know if this is common knowledge or not but the balls are in the same sack
1506,"They come in all shapes and sizes. Don't judge at a first glance. They also happen to stand at the ready during the worst times (in a tight swimsuit, during a presentation, sometimes when we trynna hug someone). More often than not, a dude is self conscious about his size and thinks he is on that smaller side. But if they constantly brag and talk about it, they have a micropenis. Just saying."

1514,"To add to the flexing dick, if a guy flexes his dick his asshole clenches. And yes I know I just made every dude clench his asshole."
1515,Same but the speedo like blocks all boners from happening for me when I’m wearing it
1516,"In your teenage years it is normal to have pimples on your balls and lower part of the shaft.

Edit: but you shouldn't pop them because that will cause it to get infected and I don't think I need so say why we don't want an infection down there."

\[Edit: why is this blowing up anyone could have typed this\]"
1518,wow I'm just trying to visualize that... does it not hurt if you swing too hard?
1519,You just made every male clench their asshole. I salute you
1520,"Our balls stick to our thighs.

Oh yeah, the sensation when our dick is touched (not kicked, mind you) feels nice"
1521,"No 3. We still want to fuck most girls, so if we have a boner, we most likely want to fuck you, but that may not be the reason for the boner"
1522,Kind of. There’s a membrane down the middle which separates the two chambers where each one is held.
1523,"No your dick is a stick, your balls are balld"
1524,We have a penises.
1525,"We're not always horny, sometimes we get boners for no reason"

1527,"I think I’ve gotten about two compliments in my life aside from my parents, one was when I was about 7 a hairdresser complimented my hair (I had really golden blonde hair when I was younger) and the second was about a year ago, my dental hygienist said my eyes are really nice, and yeah compliments feel great, as you can tell if if a guy gets a compliment he remembers for a very long time."
1528,"That made me smile, thank you!

Its the thought that counts"
1529,A compliment from a girl? Interesting;
1530,"I cant compliment you on your physical appearance because I dont know what you look like, however your memes are pretty funny and they made me laugh :>"
1531,i’ve never been complimented by a girl (except for my teacher who said they liked my shirt) but it would be amazing.
1532,A girl said I had nice hair once in 9th grade and I’ve kept the same haircut every since so yeah not often but it makes your year

1538,Hmmmm your cat is super cute and your cursed image made me smile! I hope you get more compliments in the future.
1539,"I have read something somewhere about this, so I decided to compliment my brother whenever he gets a new haircut, or buys new clothes that look good on him. In general, anytime he does something that I can give him a genuine compliment on. He’s 17 and his confidence isn’t at its highest right now and I think my doing a little bit of support might help."
1540,I do about a year and a half ago a girl said that my shirt looked really cute on me.
1541,Yes it’s true that guys never ever get compliments ever. I’ll tell you how I feel if it ever happens.
1542,"I'm not your brother, but thank you."
1543,Thanks lmao; if I knew you in irl I would give you one
1544,If I get one it about makes my year

1549,"aww thanks, this past half a year has been extremely rough mentally for me from a good friend pretty much fucking me over. i’ve got good hopes for the future though, thank you for the support."

1554,"I got a compliment a while ago, but it came in the form of my crush telling me ""you are an amazing person and will probably find an amazing girl, but not me""."
1555,"Yeah, it's true. Cant remember the last time I was complimented lol. And for your second question, that would be a permanent confidence boost ngl."

As for leading up to the moment I just went for my first after she tried to then stopped herself, so I did it. Really depends on the situation, but definitely give them plenty of time to back out incase they arnt ready or maybe don't think of you like that.

Now making out, that's a whole other ballgame that I know nothing about"

1577,"Hey, girl here! Don't know if there's been any here so far lol. I know this is r/AskTeenBoys but honestly i love trolling around this subreddit looking for these kinds of questions, i love giving advice.

(Im kind of assuming youre male here, correct me if im wrong) Anyways, the main thing is going slow. It gives her time to back off if she's uncomfortable, and its the best way to avoid any awkward jostling by moving in too fast. And if you do bump her or get a little awkward, just keep the mood light. Toss some line like ""Geez, im just Mr. Smooth aren't i?"" and chuckle. Plus, it's adorable when you guys get nervous.

And also, if its the right moment, it's entirely okay to seize an awkward spot and ask to kiss her. Respect is soooo attractive. If either one of you tells a joke and it falls a little flat (gets just a chuckle), its perfectly fine to just go for it and admit youre nervous. ""Sorry, im just a little nervous. Can I/Is it okay if i kiss you?""

If you dont wanna go that route, just make eye contact, look at her lips and back at her, and lean in. It's better to be holding her waist or touching her face rather than just standing there. Once you land, just hold for like 3-4 seconds and pull away slowly. Plus if you're excited that you finally kissed her, you're fine to be smiling afterwards. The first time my boyfriend kissed me he asked if he could and when he pulled away he was grinning like an idiot. Proceeded to have a full-on 10 second celebration where he smiled and pretty much yelled ""YES! I *finally* got the courage to kiss you!! That was awesome."" It was adorable, and honestly I've never been more in love.

I hope this was helpful! Sorry it's long :) im so very opinionated lol. If she says yes to being your girlfriend (which im sure she will) the most important thing moving forward with your relationship is communication. Talking is awkward sometimes, yeah, but those conversations where you ask if you're monogamous, okay with public affection and holding hands, etc., are SO important and make so many situations easier. Setting those boundaries makes for a helathier relationship, and most problems can be talked out. Good luck!!"
1578,"Wen ur doing it close ur eyes, otherwise u look a bit strange"
1579,"Also, when kissing her, try to somehow find your own style of kissing, it’ll take a while but it works and you won’t regret that kiss ever"
1580,"Ahhh, that’s the kiss we’re talking about. Well pm me if you want that technique"
1581,"While kissing just keep staring into her eyes, no blinking, just stare"
1582,*whale noises intensifies*
1583,She's the pussy here
1584,"Oh top of this remain calm when kissing, try to keep a level head and try not to panick, trust me I know from experience"
1585,If she closes her eyes force them open with your hands to make sure she makes eye contact
1586,i wouldnt think it’s a pussy move. that’s just cute lol
1587,"Hey, I suggest you ask the mods for a special flair in this case or something. It may be confusing to see you with “13M”, and may cause some trouble."
1588,"Yea, I wonder what type of flair I should ask for...

1589,“Technically 13”? “Honorary 13M”? Both work.

Welcome!"
1591,Granted via loophole
1592,perhaps even more sense...

Maybe you could get a custom one though, that’s pretty cool xD"
1594,"How did you survive reddit for 13 years?





Also are you 13 years old irl? Because if you're not then change ur flair before u get banned"
1595,"13M. It’s not him, it’s his account"

1601,Congratulations. I hope you enjoy the next 7 years here
1602,It was! And it had active users submitting content. It used to have a different theme though so it looked a little different than it does today. I think you can still turn on the legacy theme in your settings somewhere.
1603,And you have roughly 4000 karma... What kind of a lurker are you?
1604,"Believe it or not, before Reddit there weren't any great social news websites. There was digg and Slashdot and that was it, the rest was trash. And since Reddit nothing has surpassed it."
1605,haha yea I guess I just never got suckered in to the idea of internet points. Is there any benefit to having them? I'm not really a Reddit expert.
1606,I guess that counts. Welcome to the sub

1611,Wow. 13 years is insane. What were you doing back in 07?
1612,"Yeah ive seen the legacy theme before didnt know it was from 2007 tho, thought more like 2014"

1625,"It’s not about him playing fortnite, it’s about him never leaving the room or never sleeping"
1626,As someone who lived in an attac you just cant do that and not get caught
1627,I would have loved to live in an attic cuz you ca  easily smoke or drink without your parents knowing.
1628,Ok dude what fucking 3yo needs their own room. Tell them that because your the oldest you get your own room and when you move out in 5-7 years your sister gets her own room and that’s that. No fucking 13yo should be sharing when the other room is occupied by someone who’s barely potty trained. How old is you brother? 10? He can share with the 2yo till he’s at least 13. She doesn’t need her own room really till she’s 8/9.
1629,Yes
1630,Simply explain that a 2yo with an entire room is madness. The kid won't learn anything and will just grow up with a messed up mentality about personal space and whatnot. I was surprised when I read that it was for a 2 ~ 3yo especially since a kid is very unstable at that age and can't manage a room.
1631,"Maybe they don't want to share a room with her anymore either? It can be very hard sharing a room with your kids when you want to get time alone or tango some. 


If this is part of the reason they are moving her there is not much if anything you can do."

1634,"What I would do is explain to them that he doesn't leave his room stays up super late and that all of those things could affect your grades, sleep, and social life."
1635,and what's so interesting about smoking and drinking?
1636,"I don't know how to convince your parents,but if you and your brother end up in the same room,maybe use some wood walls to separate both of you"
1637,"Yeah but he may want some ""alone"" tango time too so sharing a room with his brother while he's a teenager is never healthy"
1638,What kind of 2yo do you interact with? Like dammit I met 5yos that can barely take care of 1 square meter of space without destroying all known forms of matter
1639,That's not how it works...
1640,"You're still smoking, that still kills you. The fact that it's weed just has an extra side effect of fucking up your head before it's fully developed."
1641,[removed]
1642,"If you're fine with a smol sometimes annoying brat (around that age), this would be a solution.

Obviously many would not like it from feelings like hur girls need more privacy than boys or that seperating girls from boys is always the best solution (I kinda don't think it is. Own rooms for everyone, sure, but if that's not possible, combine the kids who harmonize best, not by gender)

EDIT: I realize I'm forgetting puberty here, but I think it's still better to be in a room with someone who doesn't know about it than one who does. Awkward moments aren't as awkward with a 3 year old as with someone in puberty too, at least you can assume ignorance."
1643,Dude if his brother is a bro he’ll clear out when he’s tryna tango
1644,Getting fucked to avoid the existentialism that consumes the teenage years
1645,Yay
1646,"Dude, this is hilarious. I have the same exact dilema. When we were painting our rooms, I was supposed to get my own room, and my younger sister and younger brother were supposed to share a room. I was glad because my brother only plays Fortnite and mocks me. My sister decided to back out, and she got her own room. It was hella annoying and still is because all my brother ever does is play fortnite."
1647,Guess we found our antidote to sexual assault from girls right here. Be so dumb (or at least pretend to be) that she gets so discouraged
1648,"In middle school their was this girl obsess with what kind of underwear guys were wearing. Like she would do surveys ""for science class"". Where she needed to know if you worn boxers or briefs. It was found she had a long list of guys names in the school. What type of underwear they wear, brand, etc. So creepy. She had a crush on me or something so like anytime I was sagging a bit or stretch. And my underwear was visible. She'd made a comment on it. Never anything physical. But it was still creepy af."
1649,"That's it boys, rape is canceled."
1650,"Two years ago, this girl made a list of all the boys in her class. She would write the good and bad things about them. She even wrote down if she thought he had a big dick or not..."
1651,"I was walking through the halls in 8th grade when some random who I had never met yelled ""nice ass!"" She obviously wanted me to be flustered or embarrassed, so I turned to her and with the straightest face possible said ""thank you"" while looking her dead in the eyes"
1652,There used to be a girl at my school who was very handsy with everyone. She allegedly shoved her hands down some dude's pants while in class (that's what I had heard) and she got suspended I believe. This happened years ago so the story might have been altered by people overtime
1653,"P7 (11yrs old) I sat next to this girl who would purposely drop stuff on my lap: rubbers, sharpeners, pencils etc. She would also bend all the way over to pick something and whenever sex ed mentioned the word penis she would look straight at me. She did the same kind of things to one of my friends aswell."
1654,"one time i had a friend over during 5th grade and my brother walked into the room to talk to us and she really just went over and sat on his lap. he would have been in 10th grade. i guess not “pervy” but just so inappropriate. him and I both looked at each other like, “the fuck?”"
1655,That honestly sounds like she had some problems at home
1656,I was using was sitting on a bench and some girls made fun of me to impress the guy they liked or whatever not the first time this has happened and not the last. It was the same guy too. Well anyway I insulted them calling them retards for thinking he's actually going to date them for this. That hurt their feeling so they went to the school office and said I flashed them and this was in 7th I didn't even know what flashing is. So my principal kept asking me and them I kept my story straight while they changed details every single time they told it and that principal hated me so they fucked up so many times to let the principal believe me.
1657,"I’m pretty sure she did, I went round to her house one time like a year ago for a party and there was cigarette buts and shit everywhere, the whole place stunk of smoke."
1658,fuck
1659,"(13M) I was walking down the halls at school, and this one completely random person walked up and fucking SLAMMED her hand into a locker right in front of me, and went in for a kiss. I noped the fuck out so fast"
1660,Yeah I should have probably phrased it better
1661,"That's a progamer move, wp :D"
1662,"Wait, rubbers as in erasers?"
1663,"Jack had a small one, right? >!/s!<"
1664,"I was at the deans House(i can't remember why-probably my poor attendance) and as i was bending slightly to sign myself into the deans house, a girl in my year ran up and smacked my ass, hard. I was like ""what the fuck"" and she said something about how my ass looked like it wanted to be smacked. Then I saw her boyfriend giggling while looking around the corner so I'm guessing that she was dared or something. I've haven't seen her since and didnt talk to a teacher because our school is kinda shitty at handling anything because they don't want to be in the news again for being sexiest/racist/homophobic/being a dystopian nightmare. 

LET US IN THE CLASS ROOMS AT BREAK, PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK"
1665,"I had a friend who told me this story about a girl who straight up tried to shove her hand down his pants under a table, while they were doing a lab in their science class (they were lab partners). Women can be creeps too, fellas."
1666,I would have gotten in huge trouble suspended at best but when they got caught lying they didn't even get a punishment for it then everyone even my family when I told them the story responded that I shouldn't have been mean to them and that I acted weird while being questioned like I'm a 11 year old getting falsely accused of sexual assault how else am I supposed to act.
1667,imagine saying this and wondering why people don't take boys seriously when they are sexually harassed
1668,"In my middle school there was a girl who always wanted to talk about porn. She wanted to know what type you watch, how many times etc. She also told stories of her watching porn, how she was caught and it was creepy af. She was the hottest girl in school for many and they told her everything she wanted to know."
1669,(11yrs old)
1670,I'm kind of confused. Did you get in trouble or did they?
1671,similar to what a (possibly) gay kid did to a guy in 7th. Got indefinite suspension
1672,This girl followed me to football training in high heels caked in makeup and after it she asked me out which I rejected for the 4th time. She got to 8 before I snapped and told her to fuck off. She done loads more creepy shit but now she hates me becuz of it
1673,"I’ve met boys who do that, I’ve never understood that it’s really weird."
1674,#~~~*(possibly)*~~~
1675,"a person who sexually assaults others isn't going to ""become discouraged"" just because the other person doesn't realize what's going on. In fact they will simply take advantage of it even more."
1676,"That's my house too, but I'm not trying to hump everybody"
1677,"Idk why, girls swearing(in a not trashy or sailor way) is hot to me"
1678,"Hell yeah, just don’t swear like a drunken sailor and we’re good"
1679,"agree, it’s like a “fuck you I don’t care what you think I should be” and I dig it"
1680,"Sure, I think it would make me more comfortable than anything. Most guys don't do that kind of humor around girls because it can make them seem weird, so I think it would give everyone some ease."
1681,But can they still be cute tho?
1682,"Yes, it'd help me feel more connected because me and my boys make ""boyish"" jokes all the time."
1683,Yes
1684,HONESTLY
1685,Yes yes
1686,[deleted]
1687,Yes yes yes
1688,"Yes

I mean this is 2019 if someone shouldn’t have to be super feminine to be attractive"
1689,Yes yes yes yes
1690,"To quote idubbbz, “hell ya”"
1691,"All about preference, but that’s good for you buddy o boy, when you find your one I hope she swears up the fckn moon and back :)"
1692,Oml I feel so accepted because I can relate to boys and boyish things so much that whenever I talk to a guy I’m literally one of the bros.. idk if that’s good or bad
1693,Yes yes yes yes yes
1694,Yes yes yes yes yes yes
1695,Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
1696,"16F)This a big question for me. I love memes, reddit, 50/50, eat a lot, a lot of swearing, dirty minded and I think boys see me as weird"
1697,Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
1698,"Exactly. Something that I look for is a good sense of humor, even with dirty jokes. I still like to tell jokes around girls, just not really inappropriate ones like I will with the boys. But if she starts telling jokes like that o will as well."
1699,Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
1700,"Trust me they don't think you're weird. If that's what you get from them it's probably them feeling like you're being fake with those things, it might come off as forced. Not trying to be a dick, just something I've come across many times."
1701,"Of course. It adds to the cuteness factor 

Edit: autocorrect"
1702,Yeah.
1703,dude same
1704,"Makes it more relatable I guess. less of the ""proper"" bullshit girls are traditionally expected to do and more chill I guess"
1705,"I'd say maybe the question has the ""wrong focus""

I'd argue that if it's a genuine part of you (and not some facade) then you should be confident or accepting of it as such. Therefore, anyone who doesn't find it attractive wouldn't waste your time or interest, and it would attract guys (or girls, whatever you're into). I know I *definitely* find it attractive and hot when a girl is open to express herself with colorful language and avant-garde jokes."
1706,For me a girl doing boyish jokes is very attractive
1707,I see more pro drinking stuff here than anti
1708,you do realise that 99% of the time when people drink its for the sake of getting drunk
1709,"No. I mean, I don't think it is but there's many others like you. Also ""drugs"" is very vague. Crack and weed are both drugs but aren't the least bit similar."
1710,I think it’s okay if it’s not copious amounts or done for the sake of getting drunk
1711,I completely agree. I get downvoted every time I say it though. Glad to see there’s someone who thinks like me :)
1712,Drug Abuse and Alcohol abuse is a common problem among teens tho.
1713,"Yes, I realize that"
1714,Drinking is alright as long as you don’t get super drunk every few days (I don’t drink though) and I agree with the drugs part
1715,"I'm against drinking as it kills hella brain cells and is proven to damage development and is unhealthy for ur organs, but I toke often and have experimented w psyches cuz I want to experience everything I can before I die after my short time on this earth"
1716,"|Alcohol kills hella braincells|

|I've experimented with psyches|

BRUH."
1717,It’s Reddit tbh. Some people will just get butthurt if you disagree with them. It shows their maturity when they downvote simple opinions.
1718,"As long as you're getting your shit done and you're not fucking yourself up, what's the issue?"
1719,"It's a problem when you overdo it. Absolutely nothing wrong with a drink or joint every now and again. Now if you're smoking or getting drunk everyday, I can see that, but not all of us are like that."
1720,Yeah I know it is. But deciding to so drugs isn’t the best solution. I understand if you’re in a lot of pain mentally and you want to “numb the pain” using drugs and alcohol but I really disagree with using drugs to numb the pain and not just alcohol. I was more talking about people who do these things for fun but then overdo it and end up being at risk of causing damage.
1721,only if you smoke too much but so does alcohol \*face palm\*
1722,dude im a massive weed advocate but it also kills brain cells and damages brain developement especially for teens. so youve majorly contradicted yourself there
1723,I mean having fun at parties isn’t dumb why live life if you’re not gonna have fun. However doing more hardcore drugs or doing drugs non socially is dumb
1724,You can say the same thing about everyone who's downvoting pro-drug opinions.
1725,same with weed my g
1726,drinking and doing some drugs every now and then is completely fine imo. especially depending on the drug. you sheltered niggaz think all drugs are like heroin smh
1727,"I'm gonna have to disagree with you. Alcohol is much worse, seeing as it's one of two drugs that can kill you soley from the withdrawal, and even disregarding withdrawal, it's is deadly. On top of that it kills brain cells, destroys ur liver, and statistically in the vast majority of adult alcohol abusers binge drank more than three times as teens. There are drugs much safer than alc to use as a teen"
1728,Alchochol does so too..
1729,You're not the only one. I completely agree. Although I think the drinking age should be dropped to like 20 or 19.
1730,"Sounds like someone hasn't been drunk. There's nothing wrong with getting drunk once a while or doing some drugs once or twice, provided you aren't a druggy or an alcoholic."
1731,I don't see the appeal at any age tbh
1732,"I would say 18, like Canada or Germany."
1733,yeah im noticing those downvotes lmao
1734,"Honestly it's quite fun. Unless you take large doses, it basically doesn't do anything to you"
1735,Im from a family that sufferes a lot from addiction. One of my aunts hs gotten completely fucked with alcohol (rehab and shit) and my moms been fucked on heroine before and ive seen her ex be fucked up on weed. (Both of them are completely sober now). Now im just completely scared to do all of it cause ive seen first hands the effects it has on people
1736,"drinking and drugs are a vice. Everyone has vices. Managing them and controlling them are good lessons for people our age. I have more self control than I did a year ago with drinking and gambling online because I see the consequences. 

Not dumb - just something that is a hard lesson."
1737,">it feels like you have a flexed muscle but it isnt under your control

probably due to not have any bones in it. ironic huh"
1738,"like the other guy said, a muscle that I can't control.

the way I find to make it go away is simply thinking of gay things. or even sad things.

edit:

actchualy, I can control it. though I have to flex another muscle..."
1739,"Oh man, that must fucking suck, getting one in public I mean."
1740,[deleted]
1741,Gay things make it stay for longer for me.
1742,"It's kinda neat, you can move it up and down by tightening your anus. You can get it to go away, though it won't be instant. And depending on the pants you have it can feel very restricting."
1743,"Well... how do I explain this? Ok, I've got it! The following is a description of the roller coaster that is the Human Erection.

Your pp gets hard, feels good if it's touched, hurts if left alone for too long (Blue balls), climaxes if touched enough, then you have to pee for some reason, and after that long process your pp then proceeds to get soft again.

 More likely than not, you're gonna have to wait that shit out. If you try to get it to go away it'll just stay hard. As for how it feels, as someone else said in the comments it's sort of like a flexed muscle that stays flexed until either A, it goes away on its own, or B, you jack off."
1744,"hey you replied to my comment on r/asklatinamerica too! good to see a fellow brazilian teen here

also, that's a sick name dude, more people need to learn about those heroes"
1745,"Really? Oh dear, that’d be awkward if someone noticed, I can’t even imagine having such an issue. Props to you all."
1746,"If I recall correctly, another feller said that you could experience pain because of the restriction, is this true?"
1747,That doesn't make it better either.
1748,think of straight things then?
1749,"Yes, it can be painful which is why I never wear jeans. The penis is always lying pointed towards the floor, so when it is errect it tries to point upwards, and by scraping against the walls of your pants it can be painful. It's also like trying to make a tent in your pants."
1750,Even when nobody notice it it's awkward
1751,It just feels like damn I got an extra leg. Yeah it goes away
1752,this is a very strange coincidence
1753,"ha. Bisexual isn’t real. Your just confused 

/s I’m bi too lol"
1754,That sounds unpleasant.
1755,Bisexual?
1756,"You've already gotten some very accurate descriptions of the feeling, but I can still give some tips to make it go away. The first thing you can do is exercise, especially someting that involves cardio. Second is to stop breathing (doesn't always work) and third, is to imagine another dude masturbating (if you're straight)."
1757,You’ve ruined erections for me.
1758,I love how this question has  way more answers than other questions usually get because it can be answered by literally any dude lol
1759,That is mostly true. But I doubt you’d be able to notice that as opposed to an erection. I also assume handling it is far easier than handling an erection.
1760,Maybe...
1761,Thank you very much!
1762,"southeast, land of cheese bread"
1763,Bi-bros!
1764,Yes. And girls would probably think that it's gross which is annoying when you can't control it
1765,only a bit up and down and it comes at the price of a clenched asshole
1766,so what part of hell are u from? I'm from the northeast
1767,"bruh, all the fucking time, I got the hottest damn girl in the school and im a fucking nerd. all I do is soccer and am tall, she could get so much better but we love each other and are the best of friends"
1768,*bro pat*
1769,"This is far too relatable except apart from being the coolest girl in school, she's also a nerd."
1770,all the time
1771,"Same here, fellow 16M, same here..."
1772,aww this is so cute makes me wish i had a bf :)
1773,🏅
1774,"nerd gang, and ya when I asked her out I was 13M and we r still together and back then she was hot but not best in the school, and then at 15 she was just like time to be hotter than a damn model time and here we r, me being the luckiest guy in the world"
1775,"When I was with my ex, yes"

1796,"I'm bi and everyone who knows me knows that lol. Not much of a coming out if I already have, good try tho"
1797,"Yea. Mine sat next to me a few times. (Homeschool co op class so we’re more... free to do whatever the fuck we want). One time we basically just turned the chairs around and used each other as a foot rest. It lasted for about 10 seconds until we realized it didn’t quite work, and before we got weird looks from the teacher wondering what we were trying to accomplish. Also this one time at youth group none of our other friends were there (lazy people who weren’t brave enough for Michigan winter. Plebs.) so when I went to say goodbye (I left a bit early) she said “wait no. You’re leaving? But I have no one else here... pls don’t” with a bit of a laugh. Ahh good times."
1798,Ikr? So annoying
1799,"yea but not when next to a girl (they don't come to my school so I don't have that), I get that whenever I'm doing presentations or just talking to people."
1800,Pathetic human bodies smhing my head
1801,"Oh god it doesn’t even have to be a crush my friend.

I keep seeing this really cute girl maybe 19-20 on my bus on the way home and today she sat next to me and it was like I was gonna die. Tbh tho I’ve never seen anyone more good looking in my life, even if I don’t have a crush on her because I don’t know her"
1802,Damn y’all cute😭
1803,My dick gets so hard that it pokes a hole in my pants
1804,"I wish I had that feeling because as of now, I can't find anyone who I like cause there's no one that could interest me or make my heart stop when I see someone. Sorry for rambling I talk about this stuff too much"
1805,"Lmao quite the opposite for me today, I got rejected by my crush, in the worst way possible, she literally yelled leave me alone, all self esteem I've been building up since summer, all going down the drain, I'll be fine tho & good luck getting with your crush :)"
1806,Joseph: NAAAAIIIIIIIIISU

My heart stopped the entirety of me mumbling ""deoxyribonucleic acid"", then my heart beat like a machine gun and my hands were shaking for like 30 minutes afterward."
1814,Awww this is so cute
1815,homie if she rejected you like that then you dodged a giant bullet there she showed you her true personality
1816,"One time I was watching a movie with a girl I really liked  (there were a bunch of other mutual friends there so it wasn’t a date), and I was talking her up the entire time and at one point we made eye contact and man I just really wanted to kiss her and my heart did feel like it stopped. Didn’t kiss her though and messed up my chances with her now so that’s cool"
1817,"Yeah, someone I sort of like just randomly started talking to me during gym today and then got really excited and gave me a big high five some time later...... its not the exact same thing but it was definitely weird"
1818,Yeah. She has this smile that the flashes at me all the time and it just drives me craaaazy. I just need to work up the courage to make a move now.
1819,Thanks
1820,"Yeah, when my sister first told me my (now girlfriend) crush liked me back it shook my world. Thanks sis!"
1821,yeah but she rejected me hard so i dont have crushes anymore
1822,"No i've never felt that way as for some reason i only had crushes on tv characters as a kid, and now its because i'm not really close to any girls"
1823,"yeah dude, that's a dumb question, everybody gets that. funny thing is it usually goes away from 18-36 months, so have fun with that comrade. Also that's not to say you won't still like them after that time, you're brain will just get used to the feeling (I think)"
1824,"exactly, no good person says that shit to someone just for asking them out"
1825,Bruh
1826,"Your right, it was more a shock thing than anything else,the moment we started talking I was calm again and surprisingly good at talking

She is my first real crush since I stopped being fat and started lifting weights and feeling like I actually have a  shot and having good confidence now seems to have came In clutch today"
1827,"I think it would be cute, but I’d be too afraid that it would be a joke/dare"
1828,Yeah I think it would feel awesome
1829,"Absolutely. Also, most of the guys might not confess but we all have atleast a little room for r/RoleReversal thing.         

I'm in a long distance relationship and my gf sent me a letter once, it wasn't something big, 5-6 lines but I have kept it in my bag for months and I'll probably keep it with me forever."

1836,"its like this

hugs > sex

affection > meaningless crush 

her taking care of u >>>>>>>

just stuff that girls would most likely want more than u but not the case"
1837,That actually happened to me in 6th grade. I felt horrible after finding out it was just a joke.
1838,5th
1839,Yes
1840,I don’t see why it’d hurt
1841,Depends on if it means something and who it's from.
1842,Tbh a little bit of role reversal sounds really good to me. The idea of putting my head on a girls shoulder sounds really cool to me and other things that might potentially seem less masculine.
1843,Good for you.
1844,Learn to write in enchantment table if your looking for someone with culture
1845,Yes. Makes us feel warm.
1846,Pretty sure sex isn’t preferred by a certain gender haha. That’s a pretty mutual thing.
1847,7th
1848,I would love it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

1851,ah I see a fellow minecraft veteran here
1852,"It's not role reversal to leave each other notes at all. It's just a romantic thing that girls are slightly more likely to enjoy, but pretty much anyone would appreciate it."

1854,Not gonna lie I get creeped out when people give me notes since it's super wierd especially if I barely know them
1855,It would certainly brighten up my day

1872,I gotta start hitting the squat rack
1873,"i gotta slap ur ass

haha jk

unless ?"
1874,"look at it this way

you’re not ugly, you’re just not your type"
1875,This is exactly the though process for me! I’ll take a pic and like it so I’ll set it as my profile and then a few hours later I’ll hate it.
1876,because my grandma thinks ur all handsome :D
1877,Yikes
1878,your grandma thinks u/Urist-McWarrior is handsome?
1879,"My friends dont think im cute, but I think Im handsome as fucc."

I'm Bi and I'd clap ur cheeks"

1900,That’s easier said than done. Especially when like me you have gotten to the point where you crave a female so fucking much that you will make up scenarios and things in your head about you living happily with the girl of your dreams and you instantly use these thoughts as a comfort to feel better but when you realize it will never happen you become depressed and you continue to fantasize about a girl that you will never even be in the same room as because as far as she’s concerned you don’t exist and you’re stuck in this never ending cycle and it becomes so entrenched that you actually start to believe the lie once you’ve told it to yourself enough and it completely controls your mind and thoughts and you can’t think of anything else.
1901,EXIST HARDER
1902,I WANNA BE A CLONE
1903,"If it constantly clouds your thought I suggest that you abstain from watching any kinda porn/hentai and start doing some mindfulness meditation if you can. By observing your thoughts and watching them come and go you learn to stop shifting your attention towards the scenarios that you think so much about. If this doesn't help you could try to find out the source of this train of thought that leaves you feeling so negatively. Maybe you are yearning for the validation of others, feel lonely, prefer to always stay in your comfort zone or perhaps just need a little self care and love. By doing any of this I believe that shifting your attention away from girls is the main answer to your problem while also finding the root cause of this and replacing it with self love and good habits over the bad habits you start to see a change. Hope that might help in any way"
1904,I expected nothing less from you
1905,do you know this guy irl or something
1906,What this man said.
1907,"kinda sorta but it's also not your fault in a like ""okay you're guilty this is your fault"", it's just circumstance"

1918,"Didn’t know that happened, and of course I feel bad for him"
1919,if i had any coins i’d give you an award haha
1920,not just that but knowing that half the country you love and you’re trying your hardest to make better absolutely despising you no matter what and saying that it should’ve been you that died only makes it worse
1921,Hate Trump all you want but I don't see how you can consider yourself that much better if you say crap like that. I don't feel that bad for him but I find it very distasteful to say shit like that when someone died.
1922,"didn't know this happened but yeah,no matter how bad a person would be i would feel bad if one of their relatives died"
1923,Not gonna work this time.
1924,When AskTeenBoys shows more humanity in one post than r/politics does in its entire existence.
1925,"Feel bad is too much. A stranger died, I don't care. Didn't even know he existed but making fun of Trump because of this is really stupid."
1926,"i honestly don’t think he loves his country, but losing a loved one- especially your brother- is one of the worst things that can happen to you. he deserves time to mourn without being bullied."
1927,"That “pandering” could be said the same for any candidate. Every candidate at the end of the day will mostly pander to their audience(try getting joe biden to do a rally in texas for evidence). But, at the end of the day, running for president means you are taking office in an attempt to better the country, according to your point of view. Whether or not you think he’s doing that doesn’t matter, it’s all perspective. The point was that he loves the country and is doing this to better it according to his point of view, and half the country hates him. I’m not saying whether he’s right or wrong. I’m simply giving his perspective."
1928,"this, right here is the proper reaction to the situation. none of the political nonsense, just sympathy and empathy."

He’s going to be emotional for the next few weeks. Let the man grieve. He doesn’t deserve to be raked through the coals for a death he didn’t cause and that personally affects him. He may be a bad person, but he’s still a person. Treat him as such."
1932,Kind of weird times we live in where we all have to clarify our hate for the guy before showing any sympathy for him.
1933,"The poor handling of the pandemic should not exclusively be blamed on trump, pretty much every governor across the country screwed it over just as much"
1934,He never discourage wearing a mask the cdc said don’t wear a mask at the start of the pandemic. Also President Trump tried to ban chinese citizens from entering the country in the beginning but got called racist. Fauci isnt the head doctor the surgeon general is. Trump said “call your own shots” which means you decide how you are going to protect yourself. Trumps doing the best he can. Trump hasn’t politicised the pandemic everyone has. The number of deaths from coronavirus I believe is false.
1935,Maybe this will prove something about our generation

1944,No one deserves to have their family members die.

1971,Why the fuck did your mom ask you that out loud?
1972,"Literally the majority of boys on here are saying that this never or rarely happens to them. For this to have happened to this guy so many times there has to be a variable.

- Bragging about how many people are in their dms. Like no Rachel snap streaks doesnt mean he/she likes you. 
- Pretending to be dangerous by saying stuff like ""You don't know what I am capable of"". Was that a moment for you? Did you get your rocks off by saying that?
- Not stopping/having no boundaries. Please, do not touch my hair or playfully kick me after I said stop. 

I love girls, but these specific things really annoy the crap outta me. Especially if it was a girl I had a thing for. Like damn Becky, I had hope for you."

Trust me, you're better off not having a crush."
2028,For me its unlucky. Sometimes I feel like I love my future girlfriend but I cant say that I love her and compliment her because I dont know her. It would be awesome even if I could be only good friends with my crush. I would love to have a crush
2029,"The way I have it in my head is that there are girls I think are hot but I don’t like, and I guess I’m just waiting for the girl I like for more than just her looks, that’s a crush to me"

do you think any girls are attractive ?"

2049,"Yea fair point tbh, like alot of people say they notice personality or something like that first. But that's quite impossible since you see someone before you even talk to them or get to know what they're like."
2050,">No matter how nice a girl is, if you don't find her attractive you probably won't want her.

Its the opposite. Physical Appearances capture attention, but personality is the deal breaker."
2051,"Well she couldn't resist me, I couldn't resist her."
2052,"It pisses me off cuz I’m fully aware i look like subhuman garbage, but my friends tell me that I’ll find a girl eventually and that I’m a really cool person every time i get rejected by a girl"
2053,"Yea, appearance isn't everything, nothing is everything, but it does matter"
2054,"Meh. I'm ace. As long as you aren't grotesque to the point I'm wondering if you're even human or 300 pounds, I don't really care. A sense of humor is 100% the thing that gets me."
2055,What if someone is blind?
2056,They be lying
2057,"Hmmm that’s a bit controversial.
I it’s definitely a factor don’t get me wrong but in most cases I don’t think I can break the whole relationship. If I find the most beautiful girl ever but she’s duel as a rock that’s terrible. But if I find a girl with the best personality ever and she’s alright looking I’d date her 100% of the time.  But again that could vary from guy to guy honestly"
2058,Agreed
2059,Kind energy only 👑
2060,"For me, appearance is what gets my foot in the door, personality takes over from that point. 

Anyone saying that appearance doesn’t matter is probably desperate or lying."
2061,"Oh

But the thing is. I literally don’t care. I don’t care how you look. 
I don’t know how to explain it, the people I’ve had crushes on are the people who vibe with me, the lads that play rainbow six siege with me. The lads that listen to the same music as me.

I don’t care how you look.

But as I’ve been told before by reddit I’m fucking weird for not liking people based on physical appearance."
2062,"> but what they're trying to say is that in the long run when you share interests and tastes with someone, looks are the least of your worries.

I disagree with this too. If I’m not sexually attracted to someone but we share same interests, we will be friends instead of being romantically involved. Both physical and mental attraction are important, and I can’t imagine being in a relationship with a person that I’m only attracted to in one way."
2063,Yeah
2064,can confirm

if i get downvoted, and i still agree with what i said, it stays up. if i look back and see either that i misworded it or maybe mistyped something, i’ll provide an edit note. but if i go back and think “ah yeah that was kinda dumb” or “i see how i should have just kept that to myself”, then i’ll delete it."

It takes commitment, time and effort to get off to incest fishnet stockings vore porn. When you cum it feels like a real achievement, something to be proud of, but if you just cum to what everyone else is already doing then there's nothing to be proud of. You've done the bare minimum.

Perhaps not r/all but let me explain it please. If we get a lot of upvoted posts it will be more likely to be seen by users who have joined the subreddit and just uses it sorting by ""hot"" or through their home page. This will catch attention of our several thousands not-so-active users. Catching their attention will result in more people getting involved, more people getting involved will result in sub getting more interesting questions. This all will result in reaching out to newer people who may like to join the subreddit. All in all, an opportunity for a decent growth of this subreddit."

Now I feel like a loser w no friends cuz everyone leaves when u have nothing to give them. What people value in high school is valued by no one else.

2527,"One night I dreamed of having a quad accident and even heard my voice in it, and what I was saying.
2-4yrs later it happened to me EXACTLY the same even the things that I said. 
Similar things have happened before and after that but none of them are significant enough for me to remember. All I know is that I recall seeing the exact picture somewhere before and that's it ."
2528,"No, I always remember my dreams, but they fade away in a few days"
2529,Sometimes yeah
2530,lol yeah
2531,My hypothesis is that since the dream doesn’t actually happen it never gets stored on your long term memory. First thing I do after waking up is try to recall all that happened in the dream so it’s stored in my memory correctly
2532,I have got into the habit of writing about every dream I have on a text document. it fulfills nothing but i think it will be interesting to look back on later
2533,"Yeah this happens a lot. For example, I'll see a banana and then I remember I ate a banana in that dream. And sometimes I can remember it randomly without seeing the banana. 

Many people confuse this with a deja vu but that has nothing to do with dreams. If you suddenly feel like you've been in this exact situation before, it's most likely a deja vu. It's basically a glitch in your brain. It happens to (almost) everyone, it doesn't mean you're a wizard."

2536,Isnt that for lucid dreaming or something?
2537,"Deja vu feels similar to that, but it’s still pretty distinct"

2549,we do like you guys even if we don't exactly show it. you are some really attractive creatures :)
2550,i think the natural state of a teenage male is much hornier than most females. But there are some very horny females out there as well.
2551,damn I wonder who's just like that

2553,"Can confirm this. Even though we would be the same age unless youre mature for a guy its just not worth the embarrassment. All my girlfriends are crazy for guys but they are always older, cause they are more mature.

Laughing at dick jokes and asking a pissed off girl if shes ""oN hER pErIoD?"" Just isnt attractive AT ALL."
2554,"It all just depends on how mature the guys are. I think females mature faster than males? (Correct me if I’m wrong)
Sadly 90% of the guys in our grade constantly make poop and anti women jokes so it’s unlikely that I or my friends catch feelings for one of them. We do have a group of guy friends though and they’re equally as mature as us, so we often end up talking about them a lot.

Which is also why we girls end up paying more attention to older guys due to maturity levels"

2560,My best friend is a girl and she pretty much was as passionate about relationships as I am. I think she found a lot of the boys around immature and annoying but that's more to do with the people we know I guess

2562,who tf asks if a girl is on her period
2563,I think kingofthenerds got his point across

2565,"I agree, even statistically, twice as many men use tinder as women, men are more likely to be dumped in a straight relationship.

We have to always initiate, pay for meals, proposals, and ask out.

We have to do so much more work to get a girlfriend, when girls are constantly being hit on, both online and irl.

I would honestly blame it on social/cultural standards, and I think it originates from the fact that men are horny as fuck. We produce millions of sperm a day, and our body’s have evolved to try and use that,

I honestly can’t wait for the day we get over the counter meds for hornyness/lust, because it can occupy my mind for long periods of time"
2566,"maybe,we might not know how much they love us and say they don't as much as we do and they would feel bad,it's an option too,you can never be sure about it and it also depends on the person"
2567,True. Just being a bit more mature than other boys really helped me getting female friends.
2568,"this is very true. even if we just see a cute guy walking down the street, we’ll be talking about it for a while lmao"
2569,There is also less of a social taboo around gay women than gay men.
2570,">girls are constantly being hit on


Let me introduce myself, a girl that has never been hit on in her entire life of 16 years. Online or in real life. 

>We have to always initiate, pay for meals, proposals, and ask out


I also hate gender roles and stereotypes. Actually there's hardly anything that I hate as much. but keep in mind that every relationship is different, as well as every person. Different people have different experiences. There are girls that struggle to get a relationship and there are guys that are constantly being hit on. And guys don't _always_ have to do all of this."
2571,wholesome :)
2572,Yeah girls just dont like guys the same way guys like girls

2575,"Nah dude, all the girls I know are massively horny. I am part of a pretty sex positive friend group so that might have something to do with it. But all the girls (and femmes) in the group talk about wanting dick pretty often."
2576,"Girls are kind of socially conditioned to not come off as “desperate” which has something to do with it, and plus obviously there’s just the general social dynamic between guys and girls and they’re probably always gonna feel more uncomfortable around groups of guys than vice versa.

2694,That’s the most annoying shit
2695,Yeah I think so but that's probably the reason they're doing it
2696,Ikr Emma Watson is such an amazing women’s rights activist!
2697,A lot of people would say you have internalized racism for that. Not that I am. Just pointing it out.
2698,"Yeah it's pretty dumb, the point of a national anthem is rooted in the *country,* not a specific racial group. We have a reason why the Star Spangled Banner is our national anthem. We shouldn't just change it for this."
2699,Yea I know there’s a lot of people that would disagree but if they where to say I have internalized racism for that I’d just tell them how stupid they sound.
2700,It’s not a real thing but a bunch of idiots like the NFL want it to be a thing
2701,It doesn’t make sense to have a black national anthem. Having our own separate anthem isn’t gonna do anything but divide people even more.
2702,"I have literally never heard of this, is it a thing all over the country?"
2703,You might like this channel Aba and Preach. I feel like their views reflect your own somewhat.
2704,"What? The NFL are a bunch of rich white racists, why would they want that?"
2705,Yes I agree
2706,"This is the first I’ve heard of it but it sounds like a step in the wrong direction. We’re trying to diminish division, not encourage it. I get how some would find it empowering, separating themselves from the country that makes them powerless. But the thing is, we’re trying to fight the long fight here. I think people have lost sight of the fact that the long-term goal is unity. Not to be seen as white americans and black americans, or latino ameeicans, or asian americans or whatever arbitrary lines you want to draw between color, but just americans. How ironic and backwards that people want to move in the direction of “separate but equal”"
2707,"Yea the country is already fucked up as is so why add fuel to the fire and not work to fix these problems? A black national anthem won’t do anything to fix the problems that we go through, and I don’t see it illustrating any points that aren’t already being voiced. The national anthem is the nation as a whole and yea even tho we built most of this shit there still is other minorities and ethnic groups that make up the US."
2708,Lol yea I’ve been watching them recently. I do agree with a lot of the point on their videos. My views/opinions are all over the place tbh lol. A lot of people don’t expect them from me.
2709,I mean it’d be the same way if there was a white national anthem. It serves no purpose the national anthem is supposed to represent the nation as a whole. Making separate ones for individual racial groups makes having one pointless.
2710,"As a poc who loves history, almost EVERYTHING in the past is going to seem racist by today's standards, you can't just go around cancelling everything in our past"
2711,Pro sports players get paid a large amount of money then expect their opinions to matter to everyone then when their funding stops because of their opinions then they act all sorry about it.
2712,Yes thays like india having another anthem for muslims.
2713,"Yeah, it's pretty dumb"
2714,"This is America. The only time I recall another anthem being played in in the NBA when Canada  (Raptors) play, Sometimes  boxing matches and the Olympics...a BIG NO to this bs."
2715,Exactly but that’s all I feel like it’d really be... a nice gesture. Like you said what’s next what’s gonna be the thing that creates a real change and brings us together as humans.
2716,"i mean i get why y'all think it's dumb because it's a ""racial anthem"" but i don't think that's their true intentions of it. that's how it is if you take it at face value or take it without the symbolism. i think in reality it's supposed to represent that our national anthem stands for a country that has systemic racism ingrained in it since the national anthem was first created. the point is to yell out and say ""black lives matter"" because it doesn't seem like they do at times.

in my opinion, i don't think there should be a black national anthem, but i also don't think there should be a regular national anthem either. to me, this black national anthem just seems like it's a protest for clout kinda thing. like what is the NFL doing to actively fight against racism? playing a ""black national anthem"" is only an act of ""protesting"" but it isn't accomplishing anything."
2717,"Yeah, you're separating an already divided nation even further, this is also one of the arguments used for reverse racism (look up the term it's more complicated than it sounds) as long as you try and do these minority only things people will never move on from racism."
2718,"Yea I think we just disagree on this. I just don’t see a black national anthem doing anything when the main goal is unity so we can one day get to a place where race doesn’t matter. So I just see this as to much and too extreme, and don’t see it making a real difference other than causing more problems. NFL fans are the same fans who got mad when people started to kneel during the anthem. So just imagine how mad they’d get about a black anthem completely replacing the original. At the same time idk what will make a difference so it could work but who knows."
2719,"Hol up I live in the US and I have no clue what you’re talking about, WHAT"
2720,"I think so, they wanted to play it at NFL games"
2721,To segregate national anthems
2722,"Sorry I didn’t include this in the post because I didn’t know at the time, but the anthem seems to be used mostly by organizations trying to virtue signal (notably the NFL) and a couple out of control riots. 

I think I made people think it was more common than it actually is, which is definitely my bad"
2723,Well for one I don’t stay with white people I just form my own opinions and don’t follow people like a sheep. Some people are dumb so they could say that if they want but I know it’s not true.
2724,"I don't see it as a problem, at least now the NFL is admitting that there is a race problem in America.  I mean it's not like its official, people calling it the black national anthem is kinda dumb but who cares, like I think its the same way that amazing grace is for Christians. because if you read the actual national anthem it very much was intended to be for white people. In my own personal opinion, the real national anthem needs a second verse that acknowledges us, replacing the original other verses while still keeping the verse we usually sing but I doubt that it'll ever happen, so no I don't have a problem with it, as long as the NFL actually makes an effort to fight racism"
2725,"so you're telling me that blacks have their own anthem in america? And only black people sing it? 

^(idk about you but that sounds like segregation by race)"
2726,why do you feel like it’s “dumb” ?
2727,Fuck Chinese government and free Hong Kong🇭🇰🇭🇰🇭🇰
2728,"Sweden, they still have [Gui Minhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gui_Minhai) behind bars. Fuck China"

Fuck the CCP and the PLA.

Here's something, let's all boycott Chinese goods and services. TikTok, CamScanner and whatever apps we may have of Chinese origin.

2738,"Wouldn't it be a tough job to fuck the entire Chinese government?? I mean, there are like more then 200 of them

2743,"All Swedish cities have cut their ties with their sister cities in China and we have the most negative opinion of China in the EU. Several parties in the Parliament want to forcibly remove their ambassador in Sweden because he is a aggresive cunt that threatens our media and tries to influence it and threatens one of our ministers. Chinese tourists are also looked down because of how they behave in Sweden and its a running joke that the only time you're allowed to be racist is against Chinse people. The Swedish Prime minister have even hit back at China after their ambassador tried to threaten us into not giving a free speech price to Gui Minhai.

Sweden is also actively working for all of EU to take some action against China."
2744,The UN probably wouldn’t even be able to do much anyway
2745,India and USA are allies.
2746,that could work too
2747,Not next to the cops that's for sure
2748,"Yeah, China's a present day Soviet Union. It's powerful, has the second largest economy, and also has nukes."
2749,"Hong Kong is pretty much dead now, there have been countless of arrests today on the streets. But we can only keep fighting against the CCP and hopefully the new Hong Kong will reborn anytime soon in the future. Also yeah it’s sad to see there isn’t much international news covering this :(

ps. I’m a Hongkonger as well and I hope I won’t be arrested after commenting this lol."
2750,"Say what you like about Bojo, but I really respect how he’s handling China. He’s one of the few world leaders actually standing up to them, and is offering a route to British citizenship to 3 million Hongkongers."
2751,"Deal was ""we give you the entirety of Hong Kong (even though the treaty that was expiring only required a part of Hong Kong be returned) and in exchange you dont touch it's autonomous government too much for 50 years. ""

She didn’t realize that she didn’t want the relationship until right when she told me, and initially she thought she genuinely wanted to be with me, but noticed it was too much for her and that’s when she saw her own, unintentional agenda and told me.

So if I’m walking home and see a group of teens from my area, and they have like ballys & jackets on, then ima be like “fuck that” and take off my school tie

But if it’s just like a group of friends walking down the road I’ll never feel scared"
2849,Same even though I live in a village lol
2850,"Heh yes, i feel inadequate like i dont fit in with them"
2851,Ikr! Villages or literally in the middle of nowhere are so much more scarier than big cities although you're much more likely to get assaulted in cities.

2854,When did you see me lol
2855,It’s mainly full of old people. I go to school in the big town which is about 3 miles away. It’s just the fact that most of the people I come across look at me because I don’t look familiar and don’t go to the local school.

2859,5'7 gang rise up. I mean...I'm almost 5'7 so shh
2860,I’m from a village which is about 5 miles away from a fairly big town (huddersfield). I’m just weary of people who look quite dodgy. Especially when there are about 15 of them all walking together wearing tracksuits. Maybe I’m just too paranoid idk.

Was literally walking home from taking my learners permit test (passed!) and I was happy minding my business and some middle school kids started yelling at me.

One also fell face first before the encounter into the snow I couldn’t help but laugh. Think they heard me so ... maybe there was a reason they started yelling at me hahaha"
2865,"I have been to Huddersfield, can very much relate, almost got mugged there."
2866,"That'll just get you stabbed mate, not a good idea"
2867,Probably a british city/town. The people that stab each other are usually in gangs though and the knifes are used as an alternative to guns.

They just do it to try to mess with you but like, bro, i know everybody here. I live in a place where teens think they are gangsters because they smoke cigarettes. They just wanna act tough so i dont worry if i see other teens."

actually I'm pretty sure what makes those days ""good"" is the fact that they had sex back in those days"

2875,"Yes, all the time. Whenever I see another teenager in public, my face feels red-hot, and I try to avoid eye contact. This is becoming increasingly rampant whenever I go out now, because for some reason, most of the employees at grocery stores are fucking teenagers.

2878,"So the first time ex and I had sex, we used a condom. However, I was super paranoid that I got her pregnant for some reason even though the condom never broke. I told her about it and we agreed that we'd go get an abortion if that is the case.

I started looking up relevant policies about teen abortions and found the closest place we could go to. It turns out that you do not need parental consent and it'll be confidential where I live.

I told her about my findings and she agreed that abortion would be the best option if she were to get pregnant.

After like the most anxious 2/3 weeks of my life, she told me she got her period. I look in the chest box where I hid the box of pregnancy test I bought for a whopping 20 bucks and was just like 🙂

Moral of the story: it is a lot less embarrass to get condoms than to get pregnancy test and likely a lot of embarrassing if you were to go to an abortion clinic."
2879,great choice
2880,She broke into the sperm bank it’s the only explanation
2881,"thats what I'd do or at least hope I'd do, good answer"
2882,Ima girl that’s actually horrible. I hate thinking about this. I’m not gonna do stuff til I’m like 18 or 19 when I’m out of my house cause my parents are religious and I go to all girls school but I also would rather kill myself than get an abortion so ig have it and then raise it? Maybe I’ll fall in love with the kid and keep raising them or If I cannot take care of it then give it up for adoption ig.
2883,Don't worry Penis muncher. I don't think you'll be getting any girls pregnant anytime soon.
2884,Thats one sketchy sperm bank taking jizz from a 15 year old
2885,why is this thread getting downvoted lol
2886,Dude same thing happened to me a couple months ago. Logic tells you that she's not prego but you still get scared

2892,"You do what you’ve got to do, and in that situation I’d hope id act accordingly"
2893,Ah yes pussy is pussy
2894,"First of all, always use protection. As simple as that. 

Now, if I did indeed get a girl pregnant then I would first ask what **she** wants to do, it's her body. Both going through childbirth and having an abortion are no small feat for the majority of girls, understandably so. Then I would voice my opinion, whether I agree or not, but acknowledge that it is her choice. If she chose to abort I would support her through that, and if she chose to go through with the pregnancy then I would take responsibility there too. 

In my opinion, that's just called being a decent person."
2895,"It does check out, he would want to munch his penis out of frustration if he get's a girl pregnant"
2896,"Flee the fucking country lol

Nah but like I have no plan for that since I don’t plan on fucking anyone anytime soon"
2897,"Repeat after me, 

#*no* 🥰"
2898,"yeah really you wouldn't know what you'd do unless it actually happened, i wouldn't want it aborted but i then i wouldn't push her into having it either, it really depends on the situation"

I think many of us see Kate as a friend or at least someone nice and familiar to see on Reddit and I'm hoping she'll be able to come back soon.

Other than that it's good to see that subreddit is still in good hands and I trust you guys to keep this subreddit in the same quality it was before Kate's sudden absence."
2908,Thanks 🧡
2909,Why doesn’t she have an alt? And a VPN if needed? Or discord? Or insta? Or snap? Or anything haha
2910,We honestly don't know :(
2911,"I hope no one does that, it's ban worthy 

Avoiding bans can get you site wide banned"

2913,Thanks for the support🧡
2914,No :(
2915,"That's a shame, would've been a lot easier if she did have one of those. Gotta have backups so we can prevent situations like these happening again."
2916,Thank you!
2917,plot twist: Kate got banned for commenting on a boys only post
2918,Are you sure she was banned or is there a possibility she deleted her account? If she hasn’t made an alt account yet that might be why.
2919,We verified that. We deleted an alt to see what it shows. It isn't deleted.
2920,"I appreciate the endorsement, but honestly Games has much more experience than me.  Also, we mostly run things by committee anyway. Before pretty much anything happens we are all consulted.

Lastly, nothing is final. We are still hoping everything is ok with Kate and she eventually comes back."
2921,Yep.
2922,"Just a silly question.. why you don't have any other contact on her, if she is frien with you?  I mean.. at least discord"
2923,All hail our new head mod!
2924,"What sick mind would do that? (I mean act like someone else, even though it's pretty obvious)"
2925,"She doesn't use discord or insta and we never thought we could face such a situation. Which was our mistake, I know.          

Even we don't understand why she hasn't made any alts. It has been almost 3 days now."
2926,"You should pin a post on both subreddits asking her to contact you guys on discord or instagram, maybe she will see it."
2927,"Wait, in that case.. You really had no other ways of contact other than Reddit?

It kind of makes my conspiracy theorist mind jump lol. Maybe her account was hacked and used to do nefarious things? Or she isn't who you think she is!111

The last one is semi kidding, but maybe a hack happened"
2928,No I meant making a discord/insta account. Reddit bans won't affect that. And I think she can still browse Reddit if she's logged out.

Trust me we keep asking why she hasn't."

2937,"I always thought that girls hated shy guys, I feel much better about myself now, thanks"
2938,"Ehh but the problem with that is youd fall for the wrong reason and therefore the realtionshipd likely not make it. (If its serious, that is)"
2939,"No, not at all! Of course it depends, but I personally think it's really cute, and everything feels more genuine if that makes sense"
2940,👍

^(also, my reply wasn't that serious lol)"
2942,"I removed her post earlier and suggested she rephrase it. She said something to the effect of, ""this good mods?"" So I was responding.

2947,Not at all. Keep liking us.
2948,"A lot of girls, including myself, think shy guys are cute. Like OP said, it isn't to romanticize social anxiety. We just think that the way they get flustered when we talk to them is pretty cute, if that makes sense."

2955,"ohhhh, that makes sense lol

and ayyyyy thank youuuuu dude!"
2956,Aw thats sweet
2957,I relate to that :o
2958,Same here except it’s like 50/50 I can be shy at first but friendly when I trust someone enough
2959,"Lolol u answered with jojo, now I am in love"
2960,Yayy
2961,This.
2962,Yasss
2963,"No, I don’t think so. I think most guys, and girls, would be flattered if you called them cute for how they reacted to certain things or how their personality was. There’s nothing wrong with it"
2964,"why is that lucky?

edit: nevermind"
2965,I think it’s cute when ppl r shy bc I am very not shy. The only problem is that if I dated one I wouldn’t be able to take them anywhere bc I wouldn’t want them to be uncomfortable
2966,"Yea, i dont have anything against cocky guys but flirting with yall can sometimes feel like a game or script, and isnt really my thing.
But some girls love that too! So everyone is good haha"
2967,Shit I’m taller the all the guys at school even the ones two grades above me :/ guess I’ll never find a date
2968,"No no, don't worry, there are a lot of guys who likes tall girls."
2969,Yeah your username fits
2970,"Shorter than me mostly, I don’t care too much"
2971,"I do prefer shorter girls, but if she has a really good personality and shes funny, i would probably like her even if shes tall."
2972,"I just prefer girls who are shorter than me. Since I am 6’3, I find myself being attracted to a lot of girls who are 5’10-6’1. I guess I am attracted to tall girls but they are still shorter in my perspective."
2973,I personally like girls shorter than me
2974,"I’d say it depends on your age. If you’re still around 13/14 then many of the guys may have growth spurts and outgrow you in a few years. It happened to me. I’ve always been average height but 4 years ago quite a few girls in my year were taller than me, every girl has stopped growing now so I’ve caught up to all of them and only 2 girls in my year are the same height as me but none are taller. Even if you still end up being quite tall then learn to appreciate it, some guys love tall women!"
2975,Well I sure hope so
2976,"I don’t really care, tbh."
2977,"Taller girls are so much better for kissing, so I’m not bending my ass over and breaking my back

This is coming from a 6ft guy"
2978,good
2979,6'3 at 16 what the actual fuck I'm 16 and I'm 5'6
2980,I’m 13 and 5”6 apparently all the boys at my school are either fucking midgets or all the tall ones just avoid me with a passion because ive never met o guys at my school who’s been taller then me (that I know of)
2981,I see you everywhere
2982,Dang they're midgets
2983,"I prefer tall girls. Then again, I’m 6’2”. So anyone under 5’7” looks a kid to me"
2984,"Until a certain point, then she starts getting further and you get closer to jail"
2985,"To add to that, I’m 5’ 7” and i find it that I’ll take any girl any size lmao. I like tall and short girls, but tall girls don’t usually go for guys my height."
2986,"On average, most guys like shorter girls, but it really depends on the guys. A lot don’t actually care"
2987,"i personally don’t mind height whatsoever too much, and i know a few others that are the same. i wouldn’t worry :)"
2988,I think my opinion fits with a lot of guys. Height doesn’t matter as much but we definitely like it better if the girl is at least shorter than us. Not necessarily short but not as tall as the guy
2989,"I personally like taller girls
edit: I prefer taller but not taller than me"
2990,How old and how tall are you?
2991,"Give it a couple years, and they'll all shoot pass you. I've always been tall. I was probably around 5'10"" or 5'11"" at 13, but now, I'm 6'5"". Guys tend to have their grow spurts after girls."
2992,Exactly!!
2993,I have a crush on a tall girl that’s only about 2 inches shorter than me and I’m 6’
2994,Facts. This is me as well
2995,I second that
2996,"Username would check out, but I’m sure that’s not the case"
2997,How is it good?
2998,">friends

Not really

>or a girlfriend 

Or a boyfriend too, all the time. I like solitude, but I want someone to hug sometimes :("
2999,no
3000,"Yeah, I’ll be fine, went on one of those Zipper sort of rides so I feel much better"
3001,"Well you’re a piece of shit, good to know"
3002,[deleted]
3003,"Take it easy on him folks, he was probably just making a joke. No need to hate on him so much."
3004,Uhhh... you ok?
3005,"Dude same, I just want a hug. I feel like teen boys are touch starved a lot"
3006,Understandable
3007,Same
3008,Good for you buddy
3009,It seems to me like he's saying he will put in effort with her
3010,common theme for reddit
3011,*sends digital hug*
3012,Sad but true
3013,Bitch you only have seven thousand
3014,"You ok, dude?"
3015,"This typw of comment really highlights how a lot of people think getting a gf will entirely change their life i.e. they'll start going out to have fun and stuff, when tbh, it doesn't entirely change your life, you need to put in some effort first."
3016,"Everything, ever"
3017,>yeh too true  i was just over at my gf house after not seeing her for like 2 days i couldnt keep my hands off her
3018,"I used to, now I love doing everything with my girlfriend. I always had friends but doing things with my girlfriend is really something special. Even the tiny experiences feel like so much more it's amazing. I definitely am out of the house more."
3019,"I had that same impression, but while socializing a bit more with girls, having better male friends, you'll find you can easily get hugs and stuff. Teen boys expect hugs to just come floating our way. Also parents can always give moral support"
3020,Same
3021,"Pfft, that sounds adorable 

Yeah, guess it was just what I needed, yk? 

Also those are so fun wtffff"
3022,"Congratulations man you clearly have the ability to know alot about someone's life by a single sentence, real superpower bro"
3023,"not really, i don’t want a relationship at this point in my life so it doesn’t bother me"
3024,Same
3025,">went on one of those Zipper sort of rides so I feel much better

i've gone on one of those and i was screaming my head off the whole time and having an emotional existential \*im gonna die\* breakdown so props to you for feeling good afterwards"
3026,"I’m not sure about you, but my guy friends literally never give hugs. The only folks I ever get hugs from are the few girls I’m friends with, and other heavyweight wrestlers after a match."
3027,Then too bad for them
3028,"yeah, i have weird taste compared to everyone else so I just play the favorite artist of whoever I’m around"
3029,Yeah. My mom asked me to play some of my music since she liked it (I was playing Lou Reed in my room and she walked in). I just play Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground since I'm not going to play anything somewhat experimental and no slowcore or sad music so my parents don't worry about me.
3030,"Make a playlist for it. I feel this 100%, I’m super into music and a lot of what I listen to is pretty out there. Just make a playlist full of everything that you enjoy, but also isn’t different enough to weird everyone out.  
  
I actually have multiple playlists for this. They’re always 20 songs long and I never use the same artists twice. They’re fun to make lol, I love making playlists. I made for every map in Halo 3 really just to challenge myself"
3031,"Uh

Okay then"
3032,If they don’t like your music then who cares? unless they ask you to change it just enjoy it if they asked you
3033,"There's a difference between valuing other people's opinions and letting other people's opinions dictate you. Seems like you're leaning towards the latter, you might wanna reflect on that a bit because it's not healthy in the long run."
3034,"I have a small subset of my music library dedicated to music that’s just out there enough to be interesting, but not out there enough to be weird (mostly green day). If I’m in my car though? I’m throwing on some Glenn Miller, classical marches, and mid 2000s country"
3035,"Me too lol. I only play one song, and I choose the song that I think the other person would like the most.

Idk if anybody else does this too, but if the other person looks slightly uninterested halfway through I change it right away lmao"
3036,"I mean maybe contrary ti everyone else, I care a lot about what other people think of me, and that goes for everything about me, from my music taste to how my left pinky is larger than my right pinky"
3037,Good shit good shit
3038,The other day I was handed the aux cord against my will and I played nothing the entire hour long drive because I was too anxious to show my music to everyone else
3039,"Yep. I'll usually preface it with a warning though, like ""do you like metal?"" so I'm not entirely to blame"
3040,I value other people’s opinions
3041,"""do you like metal?"" 
  
""Yeah, I love bands like Guns 'n' Roses""
  
""[ok, cool](https://youtu.be/1RP9blxxVB8)"""
3042,Well I am
3043,Why do you care what other people think of you
3044,One time I was listening to music with my earphones on but to my surprise the music was playing out loud. I had to face the embarrassment of the driver handing me the aux cord and insisting i plug it in... I didn't.
3045,nah fuck them I ain't insecure
3046,"Better than this 

""Hey Sonny boy wanna play some of your music you like"" 

""Yeah sure""

\* The Origin of My Depression starts playing *"
3047,"I value my friends opinions a lot. Probably too much, but like I can’t really control that. 

Idk it’s not like I can just be like “nope I don’t care what people think of me anymore” because I care what people think of me a lot"
3048,exactly what I was getting at
3049,"Here's my tip. Play the heaviest shit you're in the mood for, full of blast beats, gutturals and all the other stuff that gets called ""just noise"" then play something more chill and everyone will be relieved that the metal is over and just jam out to some more chill songs"
3050,"Me usually: I have many favourite songs and many different tastes that appeal to many different people.



Somebody: Ok hers the aux cord, chose something 



Me: I have never heard a single song in my entire life"
3051,"Yes. I listen to a bunch of non-mainstream stuff (country, metal, alt). I know very few people who listen to any of those."
3052,"Nah, I just blast Foo Fighters till they take it off me."
3053,What I mostly listen to is j-pop / anime music so yeah I get pretty anxious in that case
3054,No. Why do you care so much about what other people think?
3055,If people are gonna get judgemental about your taste in music then those are the people you don't want to surround yourself with.
3056,"The second I’m away from the homies, you just know I’m blasting Clairo"
3057,"Have you seen the new update, there’s a furry npc and party girl bathwater, Re-Logic (the company that made terraria) knows their stuff"
3058,"That's nothing, the boss for the Halloween event mourning wood that's 👌."
3059,just say masturbate so she doesn't suspect lmao
3060,Say MB
3061,Also a weapon called Golden Shower
3062,lmao i had the exact same issue a couple of years ago when i played with my now 11yo brother. basically i just called it master. so funny hearing him say it and “mourning wood” the developers knew😂
3063,Use a codename for it. Like instead of saying master bait say something different that makes sense like expert bait or something like that.
3064,Why do I see u in every post in this sub lol
3065,I'm gonna have to play this game now. It sounds great
3066,God bless
3067,"Hey bro, look how good i master baited yesterday.

If she doesn't get it, she's just a cringe normie anyway"
3068,Strong stroke?
3069,Why of course
3070,Its hard in the first part but as you start getting into the lore it gets fun
3071,"The best part IMO is the smooth progression and the never ending urge to get the next upgrade, a new weapon, a new accessory, a better mount, new armor, etc."
3072,Wait till you hear about the miniboss called Mourning wood
3073,"Why do you need to talk about it? Just refer to it as like the best bait or whatever. 

Also Terraria is a fucking great game"
3074,"Yeah, what the heck was going through Red’s mind when he programmed those?

(Or did Red quit before then? I can’t remember.)"
3075,There’s also a boss called the Mourning Wood
3076,"Terraria is great, Minecraft is great, basically everyone agrees with that, so I doubt you’re gonna get much karma. Hell, the games both say to check each other out."
3077,Say Bait Master or Baiting Master or Master B or Baiter Mast or BayMater or mast baiter
3078,Nice. They should put a surprise inquisitor because nobody expects the Spanish inquisition
3079,"If it's raining during a blood moon, the female NPCs are a lot more aggressive than normal"
3080,do a 3 second pause between the two words
3081,They used to have a holy hand grenade as a reference to monty python
3082,"Yea, just ditch that loser already"
3083,I think he left at some point during 1.3 and came back for 1.4 but I could be wrong.
3084,just never play master mode
3085,Call it Mbait
3086,r/theyknew
3087,Beg for upvotes
3088,weenie knows how a cake day works
3089,"Now I give you silver. Happy cake day, go karma farm"
3090,Thank youuu. Until now I only had one award which was an platin award. But I never had silver or gold.
3091,_**You're welcomeee!!**_
3092,Of course I do 😎
3093,I have no idea.
3094,"You're welcome. Platinum and gold is where its at, however my Reddit wallet is crying so I'm just a lowly silver fairy rn."
3095,Happy cake day
3096,Happy cake day!
3097,Happy cake day!!
3098,Happy cake day!
3099,I noticed you finnaily got a unique tag from the mods.
3100,Silver is more than enough.
3101,Happy cake day man
3102,Thank you woman.
3103,"Yeah, reddit demanded it."
3104,"Happy non gay day, Redditor"
3105,Happy cake day my dude
3106,You get free upvotes now ⏏️
3107,Now we kiss
3108,Happy cake day bröther
3109,No problem at all sir
3110,Did you say happy cake day to urself?
3111,Eat the tasty cake
3112,I missed my cake day :(
3113,You go to r/teenagers and ask for upvotes to boost your karma
3114,we give you lots of orange arrows
3115,Lmao
3116,"alot of upvotes thats what
happy cakeday"
3117,not taking care of ourselves (eg. not showering or wearing deodorant)
3118,All we care about is sex. Don't people say we think about it every 7 seconds or some shit?
3119,Wild parties seem to be an exaggeration in most cases
3120,*That’s something a 13 year old would say*
3121,"Being dumber than girls , the fact that we cannot have female friends with wanting to have sex with them . Like I think that is the stupidest thing"
3122,That when a dude is looking at a girl they’re instantly a creep
3123,And skincare. Still don’t understand how taking care of ur face is considered gay :// but enjoy looking crusty
3124,"1. All I want is sex
2. I’m disorganized
3. If I have a close friend that’s a girl it means I immediately like her"
3125,[deleted]
3126,[deleted]
3127,That we don't take showers and stuff... to be honest some guys just smell bad and they try everything but just can't help it.
3128,"That all we care about is sex. Literally all I want is to like hold your hand. I mean a kiss would be awesome, but not sex."
3129,"Being dumber or less organized, I’m sorry but I’m smarter and more organized than like 80% of girls in my grade"
3130,"No flair, fake boy"
3131,"Oogabooga, lure female with friendship, lead to bang bang?"
3132,I wonder!
3133,That 3rd one... i can barely ever talk to any girl without someone teasing. It's like they are jealous that I am able to socialize with the other gender.
3134,"There's an online game where you're a dude walking around, and you have to make his vision avoid the girls coming, and if the cursor (basically the mouse controls where he looks) is on a girl for 0.5 seconds you lose."
3135,That we don’t care. I’m sensitive. Jokes can go too far.
3136,Hand holding? What are you a degenerate?
3137,"1. That if I'm friends with a girl I wanna fuck her/I like her.

2. All guys are sexist"
3138,[deleted]
3139,yea this might just be a bias because most teen guys who use Reddit a lot might not be the ones invited to the parties
3140,"I can't even have a skincare routine because I don't have money. And like you said if I tell my parents they're gonna use that ""boys don't use facial or hair products because they're not girls"" line."
3141,Dont kinkshame me bro
3142,That teenagers wearing hoodies or with their hands in their pockets must be up to no good.
3143,I'm glad someone realizes this. Not me personally but a good buddy of mine always smells bad no matter what he does. People will talk about him behind his back and I gotta remind them that sometimes ya just smell and ya can't do shit about it.
3144,"That we always beat our meat, come on, really? There's at least a two minute slot in-between"
3145,"Honestly that isn't true for me. I'm an average guy in terms of popularity (I play cards at lunch with my homies), and I've been at a party and been offered to go smoke weed with people."
3146,I think it's a misconception that boys are somehow weaker for having emotions
3147,Lol
3148,I think we've all been there at some point. At least my father will let me try to explain my point of view and even think about it.
3149,"I haven't cause I get along with my dad and agree with most of the things he says, and I don't talk to my mum at all really.

Also I think you'd like r/rant."
3150,Yes it really sucks when you try to have a logical discussion and it ends up as an hour long lecture on respect.
3151,You have good parents
3152,Nope when i argue with my parents its not found as disrespect but listen instead as to hear what i have to say.
3153,Wow I felt that one. Too many times. How tf does she expect me to be doing Calc questions with 14 parts as fast as I did basic math in 4th grade tf?
3154,"I don't really get _along_ with my parents. Not friends-like along just, exist without fighting, but they're very chill so I never experienced that situation."
3155,yes
3156,"My parents are awesome, so they can handle me pushing back on basically anything--though my mom is quite sensitive, and I'm quite not, so I can often make her quite upset (which isn't something I can say I'm particularly proud of)"
3157,"It can happens sometimes, and I hate it"
3158,"with my parents, arguing equals talking back, which is a no-no. If I talk back to them or say that they are wrong they just hit me and ground me until they calm down. What can ya do?

I've just learned to swallow my pride when it comes to being right or wrong with my parents."
3159,The worst part is when they don’t have anything to back it up besides “I say so”
3160,"Yeah, it’s really unfair"
3161,"Yeah, I’ve particularly noticed that with my Mum"
3162,"Same here. My dads a lot more reasonable and less hot headed than my mom, so he’ll debate w me at times but he always tries to see things from my perspective, my mom just goes full on “don’t argue w ur mother” type beat"
3163,Nope. My parents are actually sensible.
3164,Dude my mum's Asian so it's even worse
3165,"At this point I've given up on arguing with my mom. I'd just get hit with ""because I said so"", and ""don't disrespect me."""
3166,Haha I can feel the pain too
3167,"""But that isn't the same thing""

""Then same with <<if your friend tells you to jump of a bridge, will you?>>"""
3168,Do not click the link. You will be rick rolled.
3169,"Ikr, just because they were born before us, it doesn’t mean that they understand everything. Get over yourselves boomers. Smh."
3170,"Dude, just stand up to your parents. You got to start somewhere"
3171,"YES! When it comes to issues between my parents (they are divorced), I'm constantly told that I have a right to an opinion. But when it comes to an argument between one of my parents and I, they say it's disrespectful when I disagree, so I just don't say when I disagree."
3172,"My parents are pretty chill, my dad and I will have a friendly ""sparing"" every once in a blue moon to where we find things we disagree on and just argue (in a non-serious way, we both enjoy it)."
3173,"Also when they talk shit to you and insult you, but when you do it back, it's disrespectful. My parents don't even really try to defend it, they just say ""we're the parents, you have to respect us."""
3174,that goes along with “because i said so” just like a broken record
3175,"oh yes
many times
the most times is just: ""are you argueing with me?""
""DON'T SCREEM AT ME!""
or the classical ""you are not old enough to understand""

well just so you know those sentences don't come up a lot but when they do it's SO FUCKING ANGERING ME!"
3176,"Damn... You have to be patient as hell to put up with all of this, stay brave comrade"
3177,Aww thanks
3178,I only sort by new lol
3179,"It's kinda weird to think that there are people I've never seen reading my comments here, sometimes it feels like ATB/G are like a high school classroom, you think you know everyone"
3180,"Same. But I’m sure at least 26,000 don’t"
3181,"Perfect way to put it. I recognize the 50 or so active users, but only know the personal info of 20-30 and the names of about 10. Just like some of my classes."
3182,I usually sort by new but I just get 10 crappy r/askreddit questions and some shitposts
3183,Yeah
3184,Yeah I see lots of the same users
3185,[deleted]
3186,Lmao yeah that's exactly it
3187,"Lurkers. Or people like me, joined so much subreddits and sort by new that I rarely see posts from here. Nice commenting here, though."
3188,I see u frequently
3189,"And like those classrooms, nobody knows who I am"
3190,Likewise brotha
3191,Yes and I am them
3192,"u/orr2 u/definetly_not_main u/imajokeinmyownmind u/demvic3 u/weeniethotjunior u/AltandF42 u/LuxuryKingRanch69 u/are-a-mistake u/MyDadInventedGoogle u/HandsomeAndCocky u/undercoverhorsegirl u/Yeet_Muffin u/hornybislutthrowaway u/ThatTypicalLonerGal u/HelloThere501 u/WaluigiFeet u/Wxze u/CrazyQueen502 and some guy named ph1laza or something. Everywhere I go I see your faces. And special mention to u/MyDadInventedGoogle , I've seen her everywhere over Reddit, not just ATG and ATB. Lol"
3193,That's assuming I read the names of who's commenting lmaaooo
3194,"I can't remember 20 names, so i don't realise it lol"
3195,You keep seeing the same 20 people and still nobody knows who I am
3196,"BRUH SAME but yeah im fine with it, its just amazing we dont get to see quite a few thousand people lol"
3197,Same with me on almost every sub.
3198,^
3199,I always see u/WaluigiFeet
3200,Yeah lol
3201,I see you very frequently
3202,How DID I find you? Again? DUDE how?
3203,Good man
3204,Wow thats impressive lmao
3205,General Kenobi!
3206,Yes
3207,I do it in like 5 minutes
3208,[deleted]
3209,Thing is I use it as a solution to boredom so that ain't happening
3210,[deleted]
3211,[deleted]
3212,Yes except instead of quitting in two days I never start.
3213,So beat it out as much as possible to the same videos for a few days until I get bored? Sounds questionable
3214,"Hm ok well idk then either

There's this sub called r/nofap maybe that can help?"
3215,"I have this phase for like 10 minutes, usually when I'm not at home, so can't do any of the stuff yet. But when I'm at home every single bit if that motivation instantly leaves my body"
3216,"Yep, mostly at 2 am then i think the next day ""wtf is wrong with me"""
3217,[removed]
3218,"Yeah I feel the same tbh but am still porn addicted through those feelings. Every time I open up porn I feel stressed and just sorta apologise in my head to my crush for being a horny mess, but I still do it because that feeling dispels when I get going. Plus I have a few videos stored that are just that good that I can't seem to get bored of them."
3219,All the time. I'm always thinking about ways to better myself but don't do anything about it
3220,"Lmao for some reason I can't go on any post on nofap except the pinned one

That's irritating"
3221,Yep
3222,"Well there's evidence to say that lots of masturbation uses up your dopamine so you have no motivation for important things, which isn't good considering next year is year 13 which is like the hardest year of education in the UK (plus I'm doing one more subject than most people do and am aiming for all As). Plus I think I might be closing in on a gf and I've heard far too many stories of relationships being ruined by porn."
3223,"Apparently the UK starts school earlier than some, our version of kindergarten (called reception) starts at 4 rather than 5. Resultantly the last year before uni is year 13. There's also a year 14 for students who decide to retake either year 12 or year 13. It's a fucking hard year, grades are 100% based off exams taken in May and June which covers all year 12 and 13 content. If you want an idea of how insanely hard the exams are, you only need around 55% of the marks for an A in maths.

Also my only pets are a snake and a cat and both are at my dad's house which I'm only at half the week sooooo idk"
3224,"Nah living in the UK is pretty gud tbh, better than the US for sure. I mean, we have the Toby Carvery and Greggs, neither of which I could live without. And yes, the healthcare is free, though only as a result of slightly elevated taxes. Plus our education system is miles better than the US. Though I gotta admit that the weather here is pretty shit, the sky is always grey. 

If you live in the UK and are scared of snakes there's something wrong with you. The only aggressive species we have is the adder. I own a 2ft corn snake, tiny completely passive species. My snake is really scared of me actually rather than the other way around."
3225,hell yea
3226,All the time
3227,"I do, but I never really get started cause procrastination"

3229,I am speed!
3230,How much is too much for u?
3231,I mean it gets boring for me too. I just find new things though
3232,"For me it's the opposite, I watch porn because I'm bored which is especially bad as of recently as I'm more up in my room doing nothing. It seems that my dick could process stiff more quicker than my brain cause before I could think of stuff that I want to do, welp time for 2 minutes of ""bliss"" & 1/2 an hour of regret."
3233,"Well in an ideal world I masturbate about once a week without porn but atm I'm doing it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day."
3234,"Hmm 1 a week would be a little imo

But damn dawg multiple times a day is a lot, how dont your balls and penis hurt? I do it every 2 or 3 days"
3235,"Sometimes if I do 2 in quick succession it does hurt because too much scrotal shrinkage, but other than that it never hurts"
3236,Hmm well it does sound like u have a problem but if it doesnt hurt you I dont see an issue
3237,"yeah I feel like I've missed out on parties, dating, dances, vibing with the boys, etc"
3238,Well thats good you found something that made you feel like a teen
3239,"ME TOO MAN, but i hope things will turn around in college for you"
3240,"Yeah and I realized it too late. Oh well, I still got my college years at least"

3243,"Hell yeah. I mean, technically I'm only in 9th grade but I'm not *doing* anything, y'know?"
3244,yea same for me all it took was some new friends and a summer
3245,No actually. I feel like my teen years are happening while in quarantine.
3246,"Just never got my anxious fatass to actually go and do something about it. By now most of my friends are doing all those things and im just, fuck idk wtf im doing"
3247,[deleted]
3248,Mhm but if i havent done that stuff by now then it might never happen
3249,bruh how can u miss out when u just started
3250,"Yeah, hopefully those will be better"
3251,Ye that sucks :( just hang in there but not by the end of a rope
3252,I'm with DildoMachine. You've got plenty of time.
3253,"Parties,dances,dating, and if you live in europe, a ton of alcohol and weed"
3254,Absolutely. Thank you for this question. reading the comments has opened my eyes to the fact that other people feel the same thing and I'm not alone on this one. Shit I'm nearly 17 I really ought to be going out and doing stuff that teens do. My country is coming out of ISO at the moment so when it's all good I will actually go out and live my teen years.

_or normal DM? **Well the answer is still the same.**_"
3271,"Yes! I just recently came to have this exact problem. We were talking all last night, and I want to message her, but I don’t know what to say, or if I should just wait til schools out."
3272,yep.
3273,"I feel like this a lot. No one really responds to me anyways, though"
3274,yes...
3275,If you already messaged her last night she prolly already knows what you're trying to do lol. You could just start a convo irl and continue it by messaging her or just message her right away. I think that she'll be fine with it
3276,"dude i just turned notifications off because every single girl i ever try to talk to automatically assumes i like them/ i’m trying to fuck them. i’m a virgin and i like no one.

seriously, i get left on open so much i rarely check snapchat anymore."
3277,Are you talking about your (potential) gf
3278,"I only see her once a week, and I haven’t directly told her I like her, although I’m sure she thinks I do."
3279,"Yeah, and honestly, I like being her friend. Parents don’t even really want me dating. They said I could, but they’d prefer if I didn’t, so, here we are."
3280,"But what if she doesn’t, though? I’ve never done something like this before."
3281,Lucky.
3282,Yes.
3283,"The worst that can happen is that she'll reject you, but the fact that you guys are already texting means that she at least likes you as a friend :)"

3285,all the time
3286,"No I don’t get like that ever, to be honest"
3287,Exactly this.
3288,It sucks.
3289,"I'm sure you'll be great. And even if she does reject you, that doesn't mean anything. You can't be everybody's cup of tea, i don't know you personally. But I'm sure you're a fine guy with and without her. She'll definitely be missing out if she rejects you. Good luck!  :)"
3290,Lol. Thank you a lot.
3291,Lol thanks I'm just being kind ig
3292,"No, i rarely want to message anyone"
3293,"If you really like her you should just shoot your shot. Your parents aren't forbidding you to date anyone lol. Also, in my opinion it's kinda nice when boys text first bc I'm a pussy hihi. So if she likes you back that would prolly be a nice move"
3294,Yes
3295,Yeah.
3296,Yeah
3297,But I feel like this always happens to me. Like every single time. Even over text. I think I've just become boring over time.
3298,"It's normal for that to happen, often you've just talked about everything possible, get creative, ask questions that peak interest and you might get a good flow going, I suggest

3300,"It happens over text too, if not especially."
3301,Yeah. That's what me and my friends do. We just talk about ourselves and our problems and whatnot.

3307,"Bring up a controversial topic, elaborate on something someone said earlier in the conversation or if you're texting them, just send memes. Sending memes keeps the conversation going really, and it adds some humour, releasing any awkward atmosphere."

3315,When I’m around my friends we can just talk about porn and stuff but with girls it’s a slaughter
3316,I guess this is because it is harder to read the person.
3317,"ask questions about ideas and stuff rather than people, its a way better convo and can last a long time."
3318,"That's why its good to know a little of a lot, if you know little about something you can then ask questions about said thing"
3319,"Listen carefully of what they are saying, you will find things they can expand on / questions you can ask. Talking isn't just about the subject, it's about listening to the other person and perhaps understand them a little more."
3320,"just say ""mhmm tasty ketamine is"" in a Yoda voice, works every time"
3321,"one thing that works for me is asking follow up questions , either ""why is that?"" or ""what about you?"" or even ""and how did it make you feel?"""
3322,"I insult or threat my friends. For example, the default greet from me to one of my friends is ""sup fucking idiot, I'm going to shove a lathe up your ass""

Then he replies with ""sup you motherfucking necrophiliac, I hope you get run over by a train""

And we just keep going."
3323,"I can’t, and I don’t have friends"
3324,"Just don't force it. Things to talk about will come naturally after y'all know each other longer. But if you really wanna talk more, just try to do new things. Try arts and crafts, try sports try whatever you can.

Otherwise just get to know the other person and ask about their life. Likely they'll do the same thing and boom, y'all are talking. More talking requires experience though"

3364,I appreciate how girls spend a lot of time on things that are so trivial.
3365, I love how I’m able to talk to you about my feelings and you give the best hugs.

3417,"Girls are just like guys, you dont have to try to flirt or pursue them in order to talk to them. Thinking like this will make you miss out on a lot of potential friends :) If you've enjoyed talking to / hanging out with guys before you should try talking to girls. Having more people to connect with is a good thing"
3418,In my opinion it is. Avoiding it will cause you to stay behind in terms of experience with talking to girls when you will actually want to
3419,"I mean I guess it's fine? It's normal to only talk about schoolwork with some people, but like all of the girls in your entire life? Idk man"
3420,"You've never really talked to them though, right? From a girls perspective, guys only like girls with big tits yknow? 

I wont lie to you, for some people that may be true. 15 y/os can be dumb. But there are lots of guys you probably arent keen on, and there will be many girls too. That doesn't discount the guys you like, or the girls who you could be friends with. There are more of them than you think :)"
3421,Bro you're good. I'm bi yet I don't like to talk to guys or girls either except I do talk to some of my friends but generally I don't have the desire to meet new people and make new friends

3424,">I dont talk to them about schoolwork, I havent talked to them outside of schookwork."
3425,"Listen I'm not going to mince my words here, and it's going to be a little mean but it's important. Thinking that all relationships are a foregone conclusion, is stupid. The people that perpetuate that idea, are also all stupid. Bar none. 

These are the people who have had 1 or 2 bad relationships are too scared / jaded to try again, so they give people like you the wrong idea. These are the people that know nothing about starting a healthy relationship to begin with, and either don't see themselves as having problems, or are too involved in their own pity to try and fix them. These are the people that assume all relationships are the same, and very often think all *people* are basically the same or can be put into a few neat boxes, especially women. These people are ruining their own lives, do not be one of these morons. They are not happy. Do not follow their example, do not think you are 'one of them'.

You know absolutely nothing about relationships, and it's stupid for you to hold *any* strong belief about them. You are just as wrong as the person who thinks all marriages end in happy-ever-after, and are as easy as breathing. I will say it again, you do **not** know what will happen. 

---------------------

With that said, I understand how personal experience / what you have seen can colour your opinion. Maybe you don't want to end up like someone you know, or have heard of. That's okay, you dont have to do it like them. You can be a guy with commitment issues, that doesn't mean you have to stay away from relationships entirely. I'm saying this because I want you to be happy. You don't need a relationship to be happy, definitely not. But they can really help, and I just dont want you to rule them out entirely, okay?"
3426,"I do think you are likely to develop an unhealthy attitude towards women. You probably have preconceptions about what that could be, but it might be as simple as being unable to talk with women in a professional environment later in life. 

However, all of your replies seem to be just a justification for your post so I suspect you will reject that suggestion."
3427,"Oh I guess I misunderstood the title then... Yeah i guess it's a bit weird? Like never talking to girls, even schoolwork."
3428,Idk man. Most girls in my experience seem disdainful of guys who are not popular or tall.
3429,"Omg THANK YOU FOR SAYING THIS. like I seriously don’t understand why each gender thinks the opposite is going to be judgemental of them. You just need to find the right people, and sadly I didn’t realize that until a year ago or so."
3430,If you're alright with that fact no. But if you're really sad about it than no but less. It really depends on what you think about it
3431,>Some people actually think that
3432,ma man
3433,"Even if you didn’t care about relationships at all you’d still be missing out if you never talked to girls. I mean we make up half the population, I’m sure there’d be a couple you’d vibe with platonically"
3434,But why don’t you talk to girls? They are just like everyone else. You don’t automatically have to think that every girl you talk to is someone you will be in a relationship with or think about them romantically.
3435,"Man if talking to girls causes you stress, then you should try to fix it. You have to realize that they are just as stupid as the rest of us."
3436,DONT LET THE INCELS ON MGTOW GET TO YOUR HEAD
3437,No incels are a different kind of people but it does make you dumb
3438,"I’m sorry, but I SERIOUSLY can’t stand your mentality. Not all girls will dislike you. Not all girls cheat. Not all girls are the fucking same. God, looking at your comments in this thread make me feel like shit. Seriously, do you think we’re all the same?? Like, if you don’t feel like pursuing a relationship, then you do you, but if you aren’t perusing females for the sole reason that you think that they will stop loving you, cheat on you/divorce you; females NOR males will pursue you! If you lead them on to believe that you will never love them because you distrust them so much, they won’t bother. Relationships require trust, and if you can’t give even the smallest bit of chance for someone to prove themselves, they won’t put themselves through such a mentally painful situation. Again, if you have a desire but aren’t pursuing it because you’re afraid of getting hurt, you will get nowhere. But if you simply do not want a relationship because you don’t see the appeal, then do your thing."
3439,My freshman year of high school I was 5’2” and 200 pounds and I was still able to talk to girls
3440,What’s the difference between talking to girls and talking to boys? Why do you feel that there’s a separation?

3442,Why
3443,Ive never felt a need to tbh
3444,"That’s not impressive it’s just me being able to talk to people like people, girls aren’t all superficial.  Not even all the popular girls are superficial.  My girlfriend started liking me before I even lost weight."

3509,"depends who - if she's shy, yes, if not, no"
3510,True
3511,kissing before marriage is too fast tbh
3512,Nah that seems pretty normal if you know the person before hand or even if you don’t
3513,Depends entirely on the person and how the date went
3514,holding hands too
3515,Perhaps

Personally i had my first kiss when i was just hanging out with this girl i like and the mood was right. And it wasn’t even a proper date we were just sitting in tims (coffee shop for u non Canadians)  after all our friends had left"

I’d like to think if slut shamming and all wasn’t a thing then girls would maybe be kinda the same

3553,hmm idk i feel like these are all obvious but if u make direct eye contact with us we will think about it nonstop. also if our friends are looking at our asses it means we’re on our period lmao i cant really think of any others
3554,"heh lmao can agree

but not disrespectful tho, they're two different things"
3555,Well I think everyone knows we’re horny and so we are just open about it... why aren’t girls open about it or are girls just not horny?
3556,Society 😔
3557,"no problem, you got anything for us dudes?"
3558,yeah i get both of those factors lol it’s def easier online
3559,*statistically*
3560,"Well, it loops back to a social stigma. And a mindset.

Part of it is the main reason why women are slut-shamed, and why men are congratulated if they have a lot of sex. When a man thinks of a woman having sex, they think of a girl being penetrated. When a man thinks of a woman being penetrated, they think of pain. A man does not want to be penetrated, it doesn’t feel good to a straight person that’s never experienced it. We’ve never had experience with that sort of thing, so our first thought is ‘Wow, how can someone derive pleasure from pain?’ So when we hear or know about a girl that sleeps around, all we think is ‘Wow, they love pain. What the fuck is up with that?’

And that causes the social stigma. It’s an inherent mindset for men to think that sex is painful for a woman, despite it being the opposite. To us, all we know is that penetration = painful, penetrating = feels good. 

So when someone hears a woman go “Man, I’m horny” they’re grossed and weirded out, or at least they used to be. It’s more socially accepted now. But there’s still the stigma that’s ingrained in a woman’s psyche that’s its gross to talk about that sort of thing, and that it’s ‘Natural’ for a guy to talk about it.

Frankly, I hate anyone for being horny. Guy, girl. Don’t care. Keep that shit to yourself.

But I don’t know, I’m kinda spitballing"
3561,"I wouldn’t say boys are hornier.. I could be wrong, but I don’t think that’s the case."
3562,"No, you're completely right. Boys are just shamed for not having sex, whereas girls are shamed for having sex. There's a reason slut and player have the same definition but mean such different things"
3563,"I mean nowadays I’m seeing it’s a lot more acceptable for girls to talk about that kind of stuff

Last year I overheard some girl talking to her guy friends about how she likes getting eaten out by her girlfriend when she has a cold tongue cuz it feels better"
3564,It’s true. Once I made a comment about how I don’t wear bras and I got a horny guy in my pms :/

3612,I pretty sure I'm fairly unattractive.

3695,Yeah perfume can make people look much better just because of their smell imo. Any like feminine smell I guess that are nice and fresh are the best for me.
3696,bo ?
3697,Yeah that's why it's a good idea to bring a small deodorant stick/can if you're going out for long hours somewhere and put it in your backpack or something. You can just put it on in the bathroom or something so you don't smell bad.

She’s a very pretty girl and I’m an average looking guy, we’re both 19. When I broke it down to her and told her how I feel about the above-mentioned situation she didnt take it that well. We stopped talking for a week and when we saw each other again in public by coincidence she bolted to me, asking me to have a chat with her about what happened, making it seem like she was really sorry. (By the way she always smiles when I’m around and that’s what made me think she liked me). We started talking again, about what we find mildly annoying about each other and in this time i realized that she likes when i show interest in her hobbies, etc., but when it’s her turn, she just changes the subject like it’s nothing. That really affects my confidence and self esteem, thinking she finds me boring.

She didn’t. And since I had no phone, there was no way for me to know she wasn’t coming back.

She said her mom was really strict and didn’t want her to leave again, but I have met her mom before and she was really laid back.

3747,"I know you already said it yourself but ye kinda creepy, although if she liked you back she might've found it cute really depends on perspective

3771,"Yeah, but that’s exactly the thing. You will probably just have all the crush problems later on, for example at work, where you’re no longer ”sheltered” from girls, and it will probably suck and be cringer than when you were young and everything was cringey anyways.

Also, you probably won’t be friends with girls and are literally missing out at interacting with 50% of the population. I know it probably is pretty cool, but that doesn’t mean in can’t be better or you won’t regret it later on. (Like me going to a fun school w/o the subjects that interest me the most and regretting it now)"
3772,I still have cake day? Thanks!
3773,fucking simp
3774,She joined our public minecraft server and teamspeak server at the same time. Both full of 13 year olds. Within 3 minutescof her spawning in she got flooded with all kinds of good resources and compliments. I am guilty as well. The she logged off again and never came back.
3775,Oh I had selfish intentions. I do help people becuase I like it but not here
3776,"That‘s true and I wouldn’t have thought of it as “simpy” if I had given others the same treatment, but I haven’t"
3777,"yes. i have done exactly that before, once i texted my crush saying i liked her before closing the app going on a like 7 hour flight or something just to not have to deal with the response ;-;"
3778,"SORRY I WAS SLEEPING. She said no, but we're still best friends, talk for hours daily. I'm over it, personally. She gives me girl advice."
3779,I’m shaking OP what did she say?
3780,What’d she say tho
3781,He’s still under the covers to this day.
3782,what did she say?
3783,Apparently we can’t handle the truth
3784,After a risky text to anyone
3785,how’d she respond?
3786,Didnt take it to that level but i texted a crush and instantly turned off my phone for like 20 min lol
3787,Probably as pale as Darth Vader now
3788,"finally

that's not too bad of a result."
3789,I was gathering my composure because I was about to but she just came out and asked me to a movie before I could do anything.
3790,WHAT DID SHE SAY
3791,"well it’s not a full failure, you still have a good friend!"
3792,She didnt ...

3808,im always tired
3809,Your just tired ... of being at school
3810,I haven’t woken up refreshed in years
3811,That would have been much more useful the other way round: being fine in school and getting an energy boost after school.
3812,"Pretty much every day unless I sleep on the way home, but my effective school day is pretty long"
3813,You spelled the dungeon at the bottom of hell wrong
3814,"Yeah, this has been an issue for me for the last year or so. I sometimes sleep for like 3 hours in the afternoon because of this. I think it's because I don't sleep as much as I should (5-6 hours usually). I'm typically quite tired in school as well though, just not so much."
3815,I haven't woken up in years
3816,At school I’m always like “when I get home I’m gonna study and be prepared for exams” but when I get home I just wanna sleep and relax
3817,Bro if you can wake up and be like ‘hell yeah can’t wait to do a bunch of shit!’ you’re actually a fucking god
3818,Wake me up
3819,i haven't woken up
3820,But I stay in that tired state until I fall asleep; I think I’ve got a problem.
3821,I haven't woken

3839,Agreed
3840,"No, I don't use any social media other than reddit"
3841,And me
3842,Ya especially when my best friend and his gf are hanging out
3843,"Yeah, which is why I stopped using social media. I realized I was rating my happiness against the happiness I perceived my friends having without me, which simply wasn’t a fair comparison."
3844,"I mean, we're human. We're social creatures, I'm pretty sure we are meant to socialize or at least belong in a group (good ol' tribalism). We are not supposed to like everyone, but I at least like having somebody I can trust and talk to.

""Friends"" don't matter, the people who actually care about you do."
3845,"Understandable, have a great day"
3846,"No. If they're really your friends, usually they'll invite you or you'll feel comfortable enough to ask to join them."
3847,I’m glad to hear that a lot of people are not genuine even around their best friends. This is something I struggle with but I try to keep my core and my compass on track.
3848,"Well in my world, it's the other way around"
3849,Friends need you?
3850,"Yes. I set up a date and time for me and my ""friends"" to meet, they all said that they were busy, so I didn't go. Guess what I see when I get on Instagram, they met up, at the location, at the time I set up, without me. I've never felt more lonely than in that moment. Then there's the rest of the friend group hanging out, it just sucks"
3851,No because we’re all still scared about COVID
3852,I don’t look at my friend’s story
3853,"They dont really go out much but not really because they have different friend groups, and so do I"
3854,"Actually, I agree. I have never gotten asked to hang out in my entire life, not once. But honestly if you believe in yourself enough you'll find that friends don't actually become as important anymore, your life does.

Take this with a pinch of salt, I'm an aspie and very introverted, my personal preference. Just feel that there's much more to life than the people around you."
3855,I always ask to join they say no :(
3856,yeh and they tag everyone else except you
3857,"I believe you can do it. It’s hard at first. If you don’t want to delete it, put another app in the same location and move Instagram to somewhere where you will have to work a little more to open it. I put the books app in its place, and for a little while I would open up that, and then just start reading instead of scrolling through instagram."
3858,You too
3859,You probably think that but after a week sitting by yourself in class that’s when you notice you need them
3860,"One word

[ REDACTED ]"
3861,or they're just don't think you wanna hang out
3862,Of course. Why would they invite me to any sort of get together?
3863,I feel lonely and left out when we're talking
3864,honestly yeah
3865,"Yeah, it sucks. I’ve been to therapy for it (and a whole lot of other depression-related issues) and am in the process of fixing myself to be more included. It gets better, but only if you make it so."

And she said she doesn't like coffee either and that bowling would be great. My dude, this is the farthest ive been in years i have no clue what im going to do/say on the date"

3903,Hey. You’re cute.
3904,Yes. Call me cute and give me headpats. I'll melt like the Wicked Witch of the West.

3909,depends on the guy. if hes actively trying to get bigger and more muscular and doesnt like to be skinny or small then maybe avoid calling him cute but if he has a more skinny type of body and hes okay with being skinny then hes probably down w being called cute

3919,"Yeah definitely, I’ll take any compliment lol"

3944,nah i’m 6’5 i can’t get anywhere near laying down in my shower

3946,Yes but whilst taking a long hot bath

3957,"Reddit is pretty much an echo chamber of depression and circlejerks, but it's much easier to talk to people here since we're part of the same demographic, that's why I've stayed here.

3958,"Lmao yeah, I occasionally leave for that reason. A few days back was the lowest, reddit seemed so...dull and stupid. No offense. 

But hey, they say excess of anything is bad. Take time to do other stuff and come back if you feel like it. See ya, hope your day goes well."

Goodbye reddit for now 👋🏻"
3962,A response from someone who has never left the house
3963,"Yeah, I've been considering taking a break for a while now, because this website can be really annoying and toxic sometimes. But there's also quite a few people on here that I like interacting with, wich is why I haven't done that yet"
3964,"I could literally not agree more! This sub is a load of horse shit. Like 99% of the replies to most questions are stupid as fuck and should be deleted to spare my eyes. I’ve been less and less active here too. 

Oh don’t even get me started on the cross-sub simps from both genders lmaoo. 

Guys on ATG.                             Girls on ATB

3965,"Idk if you're going to see this but you are extremely right, especially about the self deprecation stuff. Just a few hours ago I saw a post on a subreddit from a 16yr old saying that he will never find love or something like that, and somebody in the comments said that it doesn't get better and he will have to settle with being lonely. Somebody replied to him saying that he is discouraging him and the guy that said that got downvoted."

3975,If it makes you suffocate or throw up you need different deodorant. Get a scent free one if you want. But if you don't wear deodorant you smell nasty and there's no way around it.
3976,"oh. I promise. 

You're awesome ok?"
3977,"We're really trying on fixing these issues. We've made some changes that actually limit a decent amount of the stuff you mention.

&#x200B;

I actually only heard of the bullying a couple days after it happened and you are correct. Imagine having such a pathetic, sad life that you bully a kid over using a font. It's not even that distracting, just slide your finger up your screen and ignore it. If a font has that much of an impact on your life anyways, you have other issues that need to be fixed.

&#x200B;

I think a lot of the other issues comes with just being a teen. The whole self deprecation thing is just being an edgy teen. This is a teen subreddit after all, not much we can do about that. Anyways the people on reddit don't tend to be the most alpha of chads out there.

&#x200B;

We still hope you come back and are able to find more fun from this sub, we will continue to work on it and try to make it better."
3978,"I feel like taking the moral high ground is slightly ironic, while calling out everyone in the sub for not being up to your standards. 

I'm not saying you're wrong, and I like to sit on my high horse as well. I'll accept that. 

Reddit has a very diverse demographic, what you're referring to is the demographic of a teenage sub which is not always mature or well-informed, and believe nothing is off-limits on an Internet forum. However, that is not everyone or even most people. 

Most of the content is light entertainment, and that's what I come back for. Most of the people are nice or amicable, and the rest will probably learn grow up. 

It's sometimes toxic, yes, but only as much as you would expect."
3979,we'd miss you :(
3980,why do some people think getting a gf is the most important thing in the universe? i legit once came across some guy ranting that school doesn't teach you socialising basics...

3982,"earn you, what do u mean?"

4019,"""I'm really flattered for someone as attractive as you to be interested in me, but I don't share your feelings."" try to pull him aside and make sure it's in person and in private. Atleast that's how I want to be rejected. I don't know if you do find him attractive in a physical way or not but atleast it won't strike a blow to his self esteem or ego. And if you are friends just add in ""I hope this doesn't affect our friendship"" idk, atleast how I want to be rejected."
4020,Yeah same lol. Better to ask her out immediately before this spreads any further.
4021,"I remember when about 2 years ago me and some friends had this game where they all wanted to guess my crush. Someone who already knew a said a list of possible names but then made it obvious which one was my crush, so the people guessing were able to get it easily. Unfortunately it spread to some more people without my knowledge and it was kinda embarrassing when they found out but I let it slide thinking I could trust them, but I was very wrong and that was me being an idiot. 

One day one of these people who the secret spread to just decided it’d be funny to fucking shout out “u/demvic1 likes (insert name here)” to an entire classroom which I wasn’t in either. So at lunch time a girl from that class told me who I liked and my crush was right next to her as she was saying this. I was a bit angry and very embarrassed so I just ran as fast as I could away from anyone, went over to where my friends would usually be and then the rest of lunch was spent them discussing what happened.

And since then I’ve made sure that if I ever had another crush that nobody would know who it was. Can’t trust people nowadays."
4022,You mean the guy right not OP
4023,"oh damn, that sounds horrible. You sound exactly like me though, I haven’t told anyone - not even my closest friends - about any crushes I get. It’s not worth the risk"
4024,"Assuming that he does ask, this is what she should do. Even if he asks in text, she shouldn't ghost him."
4025,I hate it when I trust someone with something like that and they go off and tell the exact person I was talking about. Be prepared for him to not make any moves if he finds out. But I guess you can make a move if you can.
4026,How about she doesn't reject him? She could just not say anything. The guy's feelings could blow over and he wouldn't have to be humiliated by being rejected before the fact of asking. I've had this happen to me twice and it's not fun to be rejected before or asking or rejected when you're not going to act on your feelings.
4027,"Well you can try that too, I don’t think it’ll work but I mean, shoot your shot."
4028,Yeah it really isn’t. I learnt a hard lesson that day. And even after when I got made  by a few people for liking my crush because she was ugly and that I must’ve had bad taste.
4029,"She could reject him then because he asked, but if he doesn't ask, don't react."
4030,Imagine agreeing with a point. Too bad there isn't a button to do so with.
4031,This
4032,It’s pointless because it’s never going to happen
4033,WHAT
4034,Nothing it's just that OP is a girl and the guy who commented said I'd ask her out . I then asked him if he is giveing OP advice and if he thinks she is a guy. And then you said something and that made nobsenes to me. Idk
4035,Yeah I guess
4036,"Depends on if she likes me back.

**If she does:** I would be embarrassed in a good way and would probably ask her out

**If she does not:** i would be embarrassed and probably never talk to her again because it would just be too embarrassing. I can’t even imagine what it would be like."
4037,I’d be paralyzed with fear and try to play it off if it came up in a conversation.
4038,"Hey man, it's not a matter of if someone will like you, it's when. There are so many people that you see every day, they may just be scared to say something"
4039,Was it something I said?
4040,That’s happened to me so much it doesn’t even phase me anymore
4041,(i wouldn't mind and its more of a relief if i knew you knew)
4042,ask him out if you like him
4043,Not with that attitude that’s for sure
4044,"Yep, unfortunately I had to learn that the hard way."
4045,Oh excuse me for further trying to show that his message is maybe more of a viable answer and giving him more credit for the comment. It will not happen again.
4046,I'd get sad she doesn't show any form of attraction towards me
4047,I second this
4048,I third this.
4049,"A girl (now girlfriend) I was interested in who also happened to be interested in me made the first move. I didn’t because I thought she was way out of my league and couldn’t fathom her actually liking me. Just go up and say hi and start a conversation. Even sliding into his DM’s will do the trick, just gotta let the guy know you wanna talk to him."
4050,"timesAgreed = x

I (x += 1); this."
4051,"Well, a good first step is to find more opportunities to talk to him. Whether or not this was successful, you can simply invite him somewhere. It's easiest (at least for me) if you want to share an activity, do something together. 

""Accidental"" touch, guys love that.

Then, either on the first or after a couple meetings, you can just straight up say that you can see he likes you and that you like him too.  

Or, if that's your thing, you can straight up just come to him and tell it without any previous indication that you might be into him. And then, invite him somewhere. If it becomes awkward, find something to do (or plan it so you'll have to go to class at this point or something), and tell him that you'll see him there.  

Or, option two, read some guides for guys and apply to yourself. ""Just ask him out"", as they say. You don't even need to mention the fact that you know he likes you.  

You have a big advantage over him. You know he likes you. He doesn't have that. So act with the confidence that this fact should give you."
4052,I fourth this.
4053,"I'm pretty sure anyone would to a tree if it approached them first. Unless they run away, that is."
4054,yeah uh.. i sixth this.
4055,"Just talk to him and don’t be nervous, just let the conversation  go with the flow."
4056,I seventh this
4057,"Walk up to him while menacingly posing and ask “Oh? You’re approaching me?”

Bonus points if you’re blonde and he’s half Japanese and 6’ 1”"
4058,I eighth this
4059,I ninth this

Tree : ""Howdy""
Me : ""Oh hi tree""
Tree : ""Before you ask, some freaky stuff led to me talking"""

4063,This is not in Spain is it?
4064,"Just wondering, I also play with my hair sometimes and I do some penspinning in class, and I also like a girl in my class, which we do exchange looks, but it's honestly not probable."

4104,*rhyming*
4105,Thanks
4106,damn. I guess I gotta step up my game then
4107,The popular kids at a party I wasn’t invited to (from my old school) were saying really hurtful things about me. I heard from a friend that they called me a “retarded aspergic” and said that I had “Tourette’s syndrome” (because my lips tend to twitch when I’m stressed or nervous) and apparently they said some shit about my race too.
4108,"So there was a rumour that me and this other guy in my year fucked behind my shed in Year 4 - i.e. at the age of about 7 or 8. It was obvious bullshit given the age and the fact that both of us are straight, but people believed it cuz it was being spread by the guy I supposedly fucked. It was so shit cuz I couldn’t prove the rumours were wrong, and people made the argument that he wasn’t lying because why would he start start the rumour unless it was the truth?

And I was just completely unable to answer that question. He’s left school now and I still don’t know why he spread the rumour. Perhaps attention seeking, perhaps he dreamt it? Most likely he wanted to try embarrass me cuz he didn’t like me, and he realised if he was the one to start the rumour, even if it involved himself, I’d looked bad while he’d be able to own it and be unaffected. He was a massive cunt btw."
4109,Already seeing runoff from Braincels on this sub.
4110,There was this gay game I didn’t know of and someone asked me if I’d already done it. I said yes because I didn’t want to be the only guy not to have done something and then people thought I was gay for a while. I had sex a few weeks later so the rumours quickly went away
4111,"Damn, fuck those guys fr, but not literally.

Unless you wanna"
4112,Some girls at my old middle school said I had a hit list (I didn’t) and that I threatened to rape them (didn’t happen either) the principle didn’t believe them and caught them in the lie and I didn’t get in trouble
4113,I’ll pass lmao they can fuck themselves.
4114,Some people think I’m anorexic lol
4115,"last year my best friend at the time accused me of touching him inappropriatly, he said this right before winter break so it was hard for me to defend myself. I was also moving at the time(in the same town) so I was stressed out enough. he kept saying i touched other people and said the n word and was a racist. I am not any of that and it hurted me deeply. I lost a lot of friends and do have some depressing thoughts."
4116,"What does Braincels mean, I see it around but I don’t know what it means"
4117,They call me ironman because I have pectus excavatum....
4118,Incel basically.
4119,Ahhh year 4 was gay.
4120,Limp biscuit? 😁
4121,Some popular people decided I did anal with one of my friends BC im bi. That was not fun.
4122,"Yeah but seriously they're pretty fucked up people, don't pay any attention to them."
4123,people call me a school shooter or a child molester often
4124,Hmm that I’m fat (I prefer fluffy or juicy lmao) and that I would be ugly if I didn’t have my hair.
4125,They went to the principle on you?
4126,Ye haha
4127,"That i use titan gel (dick elrgement gel).

I just don't need it cuz I am happy with my size"
4128,Probably just got a phobia for eating then
4129,Are you saying that OP is an incel or?
4130,"im known as -excuse my french- the ""faggôt"". only bc i have really long hair, i mainly hang out with women, and i have never had a gf. so people genuinely think im gay, so they do slander and call me the ""faggôt:"
4131,Group of people jack off and the last one to cum on the biscuit has to eat it (bit gay amirite?)
4132,Sounds really gay tbh
4133,"Dented chest, looks kinda weird and csn have an impact on your health if it gets reallu bad.

4134,"Lemme preface this with who I am, and how I look, vaguely as not to risk doxxing myself.

I'm legit the stereotypical school shooter, white, male, skinny as shit, nerdy and a loner, and also I like firearms because who doesn't. I also like to design maps for various shooters, like CS:GO. Y'all can see where this is going.

One day, I decided to continue a map in class, because I was done with my shit, so I booted Hammer up to do my stuff. The issue was, the map I chose to work on, I had copied a striking element of our school. Nothing else from the school, just that thing I found cool looking. Yeah. Needless to say, I was accused of training for a shooting when I was checking timings for the bomb sites and someone saw that thing on my screen. My aspie ass attempts at explaining that I wasn't training for a fucking shooting failed (because they were shit, like ""are you kidding me, I wouldn't use a fucking glock for a shooting, do you think I'm retarded!?), and now I'm the kid who's planning a shooting."
4135,Yeah but they’ve tried this before with another guy so he didn’t believe them. He had to bring me in anyway to look through my bag and ask my side tho as a precaution
4136,"That's fucked up, I don't understand why anyone would want to spread such dumb shit. I hope you are doing better - you'll find new friends and things will move on, don't worry"
4137,I am so guilty of going certain routes to see her in the halls lol
4138,I do weird big things and my crushes never notice.
4139,"Ha, I recently started doing my “signature move” which is doing shitty rolls on the ground and “accidentally “ running into shit. I also keep track of how many times I’ve dropped my pencil box and it’s broken open. For some reason she thinks thats funny so I keep doing it. 17 drops this year already."
4140,Yes
4141,Exist
4142,Happy cake day
4143,Yeah and watching them do it is pure fucking gold
4144,happy cake day
4145,That's pretty big
4146,Like what?
4147,"In chemistry I sit with a couple of very outgoing well-connected (in the school) boys. We've become pretty good friends during the course of the year so far.

Today we were doing a lab, but there was also a spectroscopy station set up. There's this one girl that the two boys I sit with think is really cute (I don't think they know her very well), and one of them went up to the station to do it with her. It was hilarious to watch--he just kept doing stupid stuff.

When she finally went back to her table he said, ""oh, well what's the point of being here now?"" I have to assume the girl heard it, since he said it pretty loudly, but she didn't react.

It was pretty funny to watch, the other guy at my table and I were laughing pretty hard."
4148,Pretty weird too.
4149,Yeah sometimes I'll talk to a certain friend just so I can catch a look at the cute girl next to him
4150,Like you’re literally rolling on the ground? Hey man do you but at a certain point imo I think that’ll come off as just stupid because I remember doing stupid shit like that when I was 13 and it’s honestly a different game at that age. But if she laughs maybe it’ll work out man
4151,right? like wtf you mean “rolls on the ground” bruh lmao you lookin like a jester right now
4152,Can confirm.  People don't just normally exist so pretty weird
4153,Happy cake day
4154,"Well, when you think about it, the number of people who don't exist is infinitely greater than the number of people who do. Or something"
4155,"ah yes 

my class is right next door from 2nd period but instead i go all the way to the third floor , back stairwell , across the school hallway to see the pretty damn girl

even better when she looks back 😩"
4156,Happy cake day
4157,Happy cake day
4158,Happy cake day
4159,"Yea I was just trying to be nice before but now that someone agrees with me I’m gonna fully honest, bro you look like a clown doing that stupid shit. It’s like when people un ironically naruto run, it’s cringey and retarded, and I know cause I did the same shit. At most it’s just like “oh he’s such a clutz ha so cute” but that’s not “damn he’s cute” kind of cute, that’s little brother kind of cute. There’s a difference between laughing with you, laughing at you, and her laughing at you while you laugh along with her for the wrong reasons. I get right now you don’t really wanna talk to her because of nerves or whatever but honestly man, chitchat is just chitchat and it’s easy to do and it’s 100% better than rolling on the ground like an ape. But again you do you, just consider what I’ve said."

4169,Yo this guy doesn't have an age
4170,Same
4171,"There's no 12M flair

Dont report pls i got reported ones"
4172,I do it alot too
4173,Yeah i also have super long arms so maybe thats another reason i do it so i dont make myself even more awkward in public lol
4174,"I dont like to lie but i'll do that

*its our secret*"

4178,"If you dont have anything to do with your hands, just start jerking off"
4179,I usually have my arms crossed or have them in my pockets. It feels weird to just have them hanging
4180,Its close enough its just one year
4181,Its just one year cmon be a bro
4182,"Ay man not cool, there are bouncers here bro if you realise you’ve got a fake ID they’re gonna ban you bro"
4183,"theyre not in your pockets, they're holstered"

4187,Yup
4188,I used to do it a lot but I stopped since it's a pretty bad habit and makes you look kinda shy and introverted.

4197,Can’t see gang
4198,I like masks :) they cover half my face so I and other people don’t have to see it
4199,"I pull the mask up until my eyelids and use the glasses to basically seal the mask from the top. Yeah I suffocate after about 10 minutes, and my bottom eyelashes are about one good gust of wind away from falling off, but at least I’m not legally blind"
4200,Rip it’s 100 here
4201,Yeah I like them; I don’t have to put as much effort into looking good when I wear them.
4202,I know it’s the best
4203,No they make me sweaty.
4204,"yeah because it covers my ugly face, but sometimes it's unbearable to wear them because of how hot the summer can be"
4205,"I do this but it still fogs up my glasses, it just takes longer. There’s really no winning with this combination."
4206,I can hide my ugliness so masks are definitely good
4207,Bank robbers love them
4208,"I think I've found a solution.

I pull my mask all the way up, and put my glasses on the bottom of my nose like an old dude. it looks strange tho"
4209,I also like them. They are cool. I fell like I’m a survivor in a apocalyptic world and you know what ? We are probably in a pre-apocalyptic world
4210,Hold up I think you cracked the code.
4211,Wut tf I was sweating my arse off at 28
4212,They're far better than nothing though
4213,You talking Celsius ?
4214,I like how they look but wearing them for too long is uncomfortable
4215,Contacts gang
4216,Fog gang
4217,"Yeah same, I don’t look ugly with them lol"
4218,"I love masks, getting to hide half my face? Hell yeah
Also glasses arent really that bad with masks"
4219,Foggy glasses game :')
4220,Live in AZ by any chance?
4221,"I did like wearing it the first time. Since, I don’t hate them, I don’t dislike them, I’m just neutral"
4222,"i dont feel like a person since it covers my face when i have one on.

like it robs me if whatever personality i have that comes from my face. im not a very social person so the most people would get out of me most of the time is my facial expression.

also i have glasses so its just annoying."

4226,"Minus the whole glasses fogging up every time I breathe, I kinda do. It's hard to tell how I feel by looking at my eyes alone (unless you're very perceptive) and I like that."
4227,"My female friends catch me all the time, they just laugh and call me a perv. There was this one time where my friends and I all went to Six Flags, so it was all of our first time seeing the girls in bathing suits. Needless to say, all of us got caught staring multiple times that day."
4228,"Just today a girl was wearing a crop top with very noticeable cleavage and even though I try not to look too much, my eyes must have accidentally wandered because in the middle of our conversation she started pulling her crop top up to reveal less. Very embarrassing lol"
4229,It's a trick. Send no reply.
4230,"I’ve accidentally touched a girls boob before. She stole a pencil of mine and when I went to reach for it, I grabbed her boob. The plus side is that we laughed it off."
4231,Started as a w but ended as an f
4232,"I have this friend and when ever I take a glance downward (it usually isn’t to stare at her chest) she says, “Eyes up here buddy”. 

Just like the simulations."
4233,I prefer small ones and sometimes you can catch a glimpse down a girls shirt... and yeah I’ve been caught doing that. I just got an embarrassing smile though.
4234,Or so you think
4235,F.
4236,"Not staring but like a quick look down, she was never one to wear something revealing and I did it on instinct. She's a close friend and I was like ""oh shit yikes bro"""
4237,"I can never understand if they wear the shirt for it to be read, or if they are the only ones supposed to know and us boys are just left in the dark. Like I always want to read but my supconscious tells me not to."

4244,Yeah just gave her a small smile
4245," I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere."
4246,"I have never been caught, that’s because I’m quite cautious, I never stare, glance at most. The only person who has ever been made aware of that fact that I take glances has been my now girlfriend.

Though. If I were caught, I would probably laugh it off, say something like “well can you blame me?” Or something like that."
4247,Ive never been caught
4248,"Six Flags America, like a ten minute drive from my house, close to DC. I was working there at the time, so I got two of my friends in for free."

4254,"You answered a question that hadn’t been asked, and then you answered the question that had."
4255,I agree. Sand is a very unattractive object. I much prefer them described as mini couch cushions. And not leather. Never leather.
4256,"Yeah, not one of my proudest moments"
4257,"twould take it as a kind and sweet platonic gesture, probably say something like... thats so nice! love you too!"
4258,"I might be different, but I totally drop the “love you” to my friends. It’s usually followed with a no homo tho"
4259,Happy that they can say that to me so casually. It probably means we are good friends.

4274,"Very confused. I literally had to summon my council of friends to discuss what it meant only because I semi-like this girl. 

Other cases its pretty easy to gauge what kinda of language they use. Context should fill in the rest but sometimes boys aren't perceptive. Feels good either way"
4275,Feels good to know I guess
4276,Was that Empire Strikes Back reference intentional?
4277,[deleted]
4278,up
4279,I’d probably uh text her later on bc nobody says that to me
4280,"Definitely would feel great that a friend would be willing to tell me sincerely. There is one person I really want to see again sometime soon and say those words to get in person, which is the only person I have ever dated. 

She and I dated for like 2 months in 7th grade (not a serious relationship, was one of those stereotypical ones), and now we're both now 19. We're not very close anymore, pretty much drifted apart in 9th grade. 

The only girl I have ever dated, she is literally the one person who made the biggest influence in my life and made me who I am today. She's the most kind, most caring, most generous person I have ever met. She's always been there for me and she shows that she loves me the way I love her too this day. 

I really miss her so much, I haven't seen her in 2 years, and even so, it was just us running into each other that time. It's hard to put it all into words everything but I love her so much and really want her to have what's best for her. 

She's currently going through a family crisis, which Especially hits me hard, not only because it's affecting her, but because I've personally met her mom and dying grandma. They are such wonderful kind people that definitely raised her right. I'm doing everything I can to support her through this tough time. I check her social media and Snapchat stories and I check in on her to make sure she's okay. 

I really hope to see her again sometime soon. I want to give her the biggest hug ever for like the longest time ever and tell her, in person, how much I love her and that I want her to have what's best for her, and that I'm always here to support her. 

I also really want to spend some time to really reconnect with her because she's the best person I've ever met and it's just really sad not really being close with her anymore. 

I moved to NYC in June so now we're 4 hours apart instead of 20 mins. She still lives in the DC area, where we both grew up. I definitely will be visiting DC sometime soon and I will be looking forward to meeting up with her."
4281,I say that to my sisters boyfriend all the time because we are close and enjoy hanging out. Also I’ll say that to the homies because you gotta give the homies some love
4282,Bro how many hoes are on you for you to think ily has to be sexually
4283,Ok boomer

4292,Free porridge
4293,retract piss
4294,When I was in 6th grade I went to the bathroom but I didn’t realize my dick got caught on my pants and I ended up pissing on my pants. Just a direct line onto them. I immediately stopped peeing so I could safely bring it to the urinal. And thank fuck no one was in there because I had to wipe off my pants and soak them with water. They were more water proof than sweatpants that’d I wear so I successfully cleaned myself without smelling like piss the whole day
4295,Piss harder
4296,Nah it happens to me too
4297,[deleted]
4298,"> I just give up

Whuh?"
4299,r/cursedcomments
4300,"You mean when it just goes left, yeah I hate that shit"
4301,I do indeed get pissed at my pisser as it’s taking the piss with my piss.
4302,best story i’ve heard this week
4303,Y’all not know how to piss? 😂
4304,It don’t go straight sometimes😔😔😔😔
4305,And that's why you should pee sitting (not in public bathroom though that's disgusting)
4306,"Because those pants dried so damn quick I didn’t even have to use my excuse of,”I spilled juice on them”. Even though there’s no juice boxes in the bathroom. Loved those pants"
4307,"Nope. I don’t. I’ve peed my pants many times because i don’t pull my pants down far enough, or i don’t point my donger up high enough to stay clear of my pants. Lol."
4308,Poor girls on this one tho
4309,Very clever
4310,Usually I know when to sit or stand
4311,In three seperate directions
4312,And if you’re having a really bad day three streams
4313,"It’s what happens when you don’t get enough sleep, it’s happened to me like only once though"
4314,"How do you simply stop peeing?

like i cant"
4315,It happens in the morning
4316,I love happy endings
4317,She called you her number one? That’s not very “little”. 😂
4318,[deleted]
4319,"Much like you, I was saying. Not bragging :)"
4320,"I do think about the stuff she says and what they could mean, but I’ll never assume. So I’ll just continue believing she’s just being nice to me"
4321,"I meant, what if you like the girl? Or at least interested."
4322,No no. I meant that it’s obvious she likes you. 👌🏼
4323,[deleted]
4324,Three months?!! How dense. But cute XD
4325,Sometimes I do but then I usually tell myself I'm reading too much into it. Like in a science class last year girl sitting next to me would occasionally bump her leg into mine and I went through a pretty deep crisis in my head about what it all meant lol
4326,I know Haha I was just fooling
4327,So you’d just be simply aware. Middle ground. Good.
4328,"it’s actually not that obvious, girls say a lot if things like that in a platonic way"
4329,"She put her minecraft bed next to mine. Not kidding, she really did that"
4330,"Yeah, unfortunately the feeling wasn’t mutual but I think it was handled well and we are good friends right now"
4331,That’s what I was eager to hear. It’s hilarious but extremely cute.
4332,"honestly if a girl hints at you but is never direct, it's her loss and not yours. Girls (and guys) who don't communicate directly are going to face this consequence."
4333,"It's really confusing with little hints because some girls drop those hints (in order to be nice) to friends eventhough they want to stay just friends.

And if you guess the answer wrong, in the best situation, not much has changed but in the worst this is where being made fun off starts.

So in order to avoid the worst case scenario they also avoid the best case scenario."
4334,"Usually not, like for example my crush she sent me a ""after shower"" video with her naked but only showing her upper body (there weren't any tits btw) but I just thought ""naaaaah I think she is just being friendly, she is way too cute for me. I don't think she actually likes guy like me I'm ugly lmao"""
4335,Damn. She bold. You one lucky dude.
4336,But what if you liked the girl? Would you have read too deep into every little thing she did?
4337,Direct! I like it! Less hassle.
4338,Either you lying or you’re just too dense. That’s not being friendly.
4339,My number one? I really don’t think that most girls would mean it in a platonic way.
4340,"Yep, I usually do if it's someone I'm talking to."
4341,I would definitely be more prone to. Like one example given to me was I went to her birthday party about a week before she confessed and apparently she was “all over me”. In hindsight she clung to be a lot over the time I was there but at the time we were very good friends and I interpreted it as normal. And I’m pretty sure if I liked her I would have questioned what she was doing a *lot* more
4342,Are you sure that are girls and not aliens that act like girls but just can’t do it perfectly?
4343,"Haha well I'm glad I could entertain you with my confusion lol. Even if it meant nothing it did make me look forward to that class, though it also gave me way too many awkward boners"
4344,"I'm not lying lmao, my self esteem was that low. We were both in a one gender school so no one gets any compliments. She also had low self esteem when I confessed to her, she said I wouldn't like her and that I'm too good for her, etc and etc. And she was pretty shy and scared since like in my country, if you get caught talking to the opposite gender, you are pretty much screwed."
4345,"You know if a boy was clinging to a girl like that, she’d know he likes her. 

It’s interesting how differently both interpret “friendship.”"
4346,"I think that, for one, that depends on the boy and how they act in general towards people. I have one friend who does that to just everyone guy and girl (he is straight btw) and so no one assumes anything. But yeah I was dense. I think part of it for me also is that I didn’t have a lot of friends till about 8th grade so I am still getting used to the “people” thing"
4347,"Wink and aggressively rub your nipples while biting your lip 


For real just smile"
4348,I'm trying to work my way up to your level of mastery haha
4349,"Small eyes, brudda"
4350,I look away as fast as possible and start pretending like I’m doing something else. You’re clearly the better man
4351,Oh dear. I am not someone who should be a role model. Just say the dumbest things you can think and you'll get there
4352,"I've never made eye contact, but  I'd do what I do in any social situation which is stare at my watch for like 5 mins and either walk away or go on my phone"
4353,Stare them down. Assert your dominance. But do it in a way that your obviously doing it as a joke not in a creepy way.
4354,That's what I typically do haha
4355,This reminds me of that post about a guy who wanted to be more like arthur morgan so he just said “hey sexy” to some guy he passed
4356,Fam he made a joke about Asians having small eyes so no one knows if they're actually looking at something or not
4357,How is it not a problem?
4358,"Not really, I'm a guy and I would freak out and open my asscheeks if someone did that to me"
4359,So is T-posing creepy or should i try something else ~~on the people in my basement~~  /s
4360,i always really awkwardly dart my eyes to the object nearest them and its really really awkward cause they always totally catch me staring
4361,I just act like I was looking at something behind them haha. You are a brave man!
4362,"I have a VERY good wolf-glare, so they usually look away pretty fast if I want them to."
4363,i stare into her soul and consume itunless she looked first then i feel super handsome
4364,Simple. Die inside. Then smile as if I didn’t
4365,gotta have a nice [smile](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/515102725680267266/587810044104409109/unknown.png)
4366,"Well I’m Korean and I still have this problem. I try to make it less obvious by pretending I’m looking somewhere behind them but if I make eye contact, they know it. Although having glasses may make my eyes more visible so idk"
4367,If your T-posing slowly walk towards them until there’s no space between you and her. All while holding a continuous stare.
4368,Establishing dominance one glare at a time!
4369,"\*breathes heavily\*  
エッチしょう

4370,"Casual smile; if you look away immediately it’s weird, and don’t keep staring for sure"
4371,This. This fully depends on how good you look
4372,Omg I’m like literally deceased rn
4373,"Not me broski, half Irish and the country my mom comes from (she's the asian one) doesn't exactly have squinty eyes. People who aren't asian have smaller eyes than me sometimes."
4374,It's funny until you say that
4375,"Whatever you do, do not address her as 'milady'"
4376,Hehe nice
4377,It would be empty lol
4378,That's just the same 2 options because I've got no friends
4379,Yea...I guess I'm just a mega introvert because I would probably pick alone. I might would pick one friend to be in the room with tho.
4380,[removed]
4381,Nope
4382,Then def friends. If u have nothing to do and no entertainment u gotta go w friends. If it was my room w my phone and computer and shit for sure alone
4383,Acquaintences?
4384,With friends of course
4385,"Again, same 2 options"
4386,Definitely friends then. I like being on my own but only when I want to be and I have stuff to do. I’d get really depressed on my own for that long.
4387,"Oh well, I would rather be awkward with my friends then being depressed on my own in a room alone"
4388,Would there be a tv/books/stuff to do or just empty?
4389,Wow this is a really good question! I guess alone would be better because it would get awkward and boring really fast with my friends(this makes me reconsider my life).
4390,^
4391,Empty
4392,Ahhh...I see...well I'm sure you'll make some friends soon!
4393,"Tbh I'd pick alone. The solitude is something I can adore and appreciate. But maybe only if the room isn't completely empty. I'd want a book and pen, my piano, anything really to express myself.

If the room is entirely empty, I would choose friends."
4394,"I feel like even an introvert would answer with friends to this one, youll go insane sitting in an empty room alone."
4395,That's true. Thinking about it now I would prob choose friends
4396,Wanna be friends?
4397,It would probably get awkward after a while tho lol
4398,The one true answer
4399,"Yeah that’s not a problem, at all."
4400,"Alone, I love my friends but to be in a empty room with them for 24 hours straight with no chance of escape would cause my social battery to drain quick. I'd be sick of them by the 11th hour."
4401,I'd be down to be friends :D
4402,It's entirely empty lmao
4403,True...true lol
4404,24 hours in a room alone. I much prefer my own company to my friends.
4405,Haha...yeeaah I definately understand that. Also thanksss:)
4406,"Nah, it'd honestly be fun. Just get to fuck around for a day straight."
4407,Yea I wish I did that but I was told by friends it wouldn’t be good for me so I went to a party she happened to be drunk there and confessed her feelings to me so. Similar outcome but longer path
4408,"1. I have seen this question before

2. No"
4409,F
4410,I mean hey if it works it works lmao
4411,Duh
4412,No because throwing expensive things is idiotic
4413,Again I felt flash banged by your username ~~weren't you 14years old last time? If so: late happy birthday~~
4414,this is pretty much what i wanna tell a specific person omfg you formulated it perfectly
4415,Literally anywhere bruh
4416,"No, why would I do that?"
4417,Yall are getting drunk at 15? The fuck do you live?
4418,Just get a pillow in the corner of your room dedicated to chucking shit at it
4419,"Yep, my birthday was the 26th. and Thank you :)"
4420,"It's not great to get drunk, especially at 15."
4421,I think we have very different definitions of perfect formulation cuz this is probably the worst message I’ve ever sent but thanks lmao
4422,"Hi >!Gustav!<, how are you."
4423,This is a fucking galactic brain move
4424,I first had alcohol at 7 when I grabbed the wrong drink and where I live as long as your on private property and you have your parents consent you can have alcohol
4425,"Yeah did that quite a few times, I don't remember what the exact texts were but probably something risky about going out"
4426,For real
4427,"Ah, ok. I’m not changing it"
4428,I knew that but I still said it btw haha funny number
4429,"What’s even wackier is that your account is 203 days old, and his account it 302."
4430,Still don't like your username tho
4431,Yay! I found my birthday buddy!
4432,Wrong crowd then. I'm just saying that you could get whatever you want wherever you want if you know the right people.
4433,"Hi >!Gustav!<, who are you"
4434,EYY MINE TOO
4435,Or we might just be the same person who knows am I right?
4436,r/conspiracytheories
4437,"Wow you’re oblivious.  Sorry but cuddling someone for an hour an a half, or for any time at all, isn’t just a friendly thing, it’s a romantic thing"
4438,"are you interested in him? If so, pick up what he did as a hint and bluntly ask him if he's interested in you"
4439,"Yeah, but the thing is I live on a different continent and I'm leaving before he comes back from holiday (he just left yesterday) and I'm not coming back here for 2 years, and unless he comes to visit me next summer with our other friend, we'll be waiting 2 years to see each other"
4440,Purest form of love
4441,"now this is tough, I feel you should have addressed this in the post"
4442,"I didn't really know. We'd hug before and hold hands jokingly and at first it seemed like a joke, and then it kind of wasn't. I felt it as a romantic thing, but i didn't know if he would too"
4443,I'm tempted to sticky this comment kate xD
4444,Ill do that
4445,"It means he loves you. Go for it.

I’m sorry but I also have to add how wholesome the situation is and how wholesome your oblivion is.

Edit: Lmao not the elder scrolls oblivion."
4446,[deleted]
4447,or purest form of attraction? ;)
4448,"From my experience this is his way of dropping hints to you that he’s interested. Especially if you are really good friends, like you mentioned, if he is interested in you he will try to be really subtle and look for reciprocation on your end as to not ruin your friendship in the case that you aren’t interested back. 

Best thing for you to do (whether you’re interested in him or not) is to be blunt and directly ask him what his intentions are. For guys, often times the girl just being blunt and asking us  this is our best case scenario and what we really want."
4449,Bruh
4450,Defiantly sounds like he wants something more
4451,Or best of both worlds!
4452,HE LIKES YOU SO MUCH
4453,How would I suddenly ask that in a conversation hough? I don't really know how to address this situation
4454,"Honestly that makes way more sense than a lot of things. He used to be the one I go to for advice about guys and he was there to pick me back up when his best friend fucked me over- that was a few weeks ago so I can see how he might think i would reject him.

Thank you, that makes a lot of sense"
4455,Yeah it was probably soooo Dragonborn like you can't even Orc it
4456,"Well, assuming you chat with this guy regularly on Snapchat or WhatsApp etc.., if I were in his place I wouldn’t mind a straight up:

 “Hey sorry if it’s weird, but do you remember that night we were watching that show and holding hands for an hour and a half? Was there any meaning behind that?”

If he did mean something this makes it much, MUCH easier for him to confess (usually guys have to build themselves all the way up to say it but you meeting him in the middle makes things easier and makes him more confident). 

If he didn’t mean anything then with the way I worded the question it shouldn’t be too hard to backpedal out of the conversation (just make for absolute certain that he does not have feelings for you before you backpedal. If he does and you say something like “Oh, sorry to ask that, it didn’t really mean anything to me I was just curious” it will crush him.)"
4457,Seemingly it is
4458,"I think most guys love language is physical (as in hugs, cuddles and kisses). I sure do know it's mine"
4459,"Ill try texting him on Discord later. I won't crush him, I would never forgive myself if I did. And that is a really good starting point and I'll probably 100% use it, thank you"
4460,That sounds so cute I’m sorry. But yeah that’s way more than friends. I think ur missing the hints.
4461,"He likes you. It just that simple (and now he prob assumes that you have some feelings for him). I mean there is a difference between a friendly hug and full blown cuddle while playing with each others hands!

^(So oblivious omg)"
4462,shatap before we make you shatap
4463,I'll try going for it. The thing is he lives In england and I live in Michigan. I'm just here visiting for the summer and I'm not going to see him again for two years unless he gets the money to come with my other friend when she visits me next summer
4464,Fus ro da!
4465,Why do you even care?! Are people not allowed to do what they want anymore?

4497,"No because you’ve still been alive for 18 years. The time you were born in America was different to the Australian time zone, if you were to be born in America you would still be 18 but you would be born at a different time because time zones"
4498,"I wouldnt assume it is, since if you were born in australia and turn 18 over there, then your 18 everywhere, I think, idk laws that well tho"
4499,I don't think so? Idk I'm gonna over think this now
4500,"I was thinking that if you went on holiday and someone asked for your ID, they'd still say you were 17 even if you're 18 in Australia?"
4501,"I mean, if you take a nude of yourself one day before you turn 18 then are you technically in possession of child porn the next day?"
4502,very good question though i’m also interested in the answer
4503,Yes the picture depicts someone who was underage
4504,"Then again what if they were born in America, have never left America then travel over to New Zealand and suddenly count as being 24 hours older than they are meaning they’re just over 18 years old? 

The law would probably say thats fine but what if they traveled over to New Zealand posted a nude then traveled back to America before they got over the age of 18 and posted another once they arrived - the second one would probably be illegal but the first probably wouldn’t.

Actually thinking about it they’d probably base it off what time it was in the place they were born when the photo’s were sent"
4505,"They’re not because he’s still been alive for 18 years.
If he was born in America he would be born at a different time than he was in Australia because time zones but he’d still be 18 at the same time as he was in Australia"
4506,It doesn’t matter whether it’s you or not it’s still considered possession of child pornography
4507,that makes sense i’m confused how i didn’t realise that myself lmao
4508,"Hmmmm, good question"
4509,Yes. Very much yes. The moment you have that photo you are in posession of CP whether you are also 16 or not and the girl can be convicted of distributing CP even if it is herself. Please be careful online as many people have been charged just because their gf sent them a nude.
4510,"Yes, but that person is you. You can see yourself nude whenever you want to. That picture is just of a younger version of you."
4511,If you actually want an answer post to r/nostupidquestions
4512,[deleted]
4513,I once had a similar thought. Let’s say you’re 16 and a girl the same age sends you nudes. You have the same phone for the next two years. So you turn 18 but still have nudes of a 16yo. Does it count as child porn?
4514,Shit why didn’t I think of that when the FBI raided my house
4515,Hahahaha wtf
4516,r/oddlyspecific
4517,Yeah that would be illegal because they haven’t been alive for 18 years
4518,Legally speaking they wouldn't prosecute because no one wants to cause an international incident over some dick pics
4519,Almost
4520,I'm pretty sure that if you're underage and own a picture of yourself nude you could still be punished for possession of child pornography. . .
4521,r/suspiciouslyspecific
4522,But is it illegal?
4523,It is but they’ll probably be lenient
4524,Let's find out! :)
4525,Any lawyer worth your fucking time would be able to fight that case off lol
4526,"God this is on my search history now but lemme see...

So, if you take a photo of yourself naked and send it to someone (in my state) you could face up to 5 years in prison, being convicted with a felony, and be registered as a sex offender, even if both individuals are consenting. However, I can't find anything concrete about taking photos of yourself and never sharing them. If you don't share them then there's no way the law would ever know about it anyways...

Then again, it probably constitutes as possession of child pornography, so I suspect that if the government somehow finds out about it you could be convicted, maybe not as harshly as the other ones though. These laws vary from state to state (and country to country obviously) so you'd have to research the laws where you live."
4527,"How long is he out for? 

I would imagine it’s hard to play video games with only one hand. I am aware that there are some bmx games though, I can’t remember any specific ones though. 

I would recommend humorous videos to watch. Some I like to watch are [sidemen](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sidemen), [YesTheory (I highly recommend)](https://www.youtube.com/c/YesTheory), [Vlog creations (humour skits and pranks)](https://www.youtube.com/c/VlogCreations), but there are plenty of YouTube channels out there to watch. Some more interesting ones in terms of content [what if](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatIfScienceShow), [Kento Bento ](https://www.youtube.com/c/KentoBento), [Wendover Productions](https://www.youtube.com/c/Wendoverproductions), [RealLifeLore](https://www.youtube.com/c/RealLifeLore), [MrBeast](https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000) is also good. You mentioned he likes bmx/climbing, [Ally Law](https://www.youtube.com/c/AllyLaws), is a youtuber who climbs buildings and sneaks into venues (his older videos are more enjoyable) 

There are also platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, which have many many tv series and movies to watch. I highly recommend these because theres literally infinite things to watch - and it’s a really good way to pass time. 

I hope this provided some help, It sounds like your a caring mother - thanks"
4528,"Have him watch movies and some anime, don’t need both hands to do that.

Oh and if he hasn’t already, tell him to watch Avatar: The Last Airbender."
4529,"Ha!  Sounds like he’s a typical 13 year old because the first three channels you recommended he watches.  :).  In fact, he wanted me to tell you he loves Vlog creations.  We just went through the others and the only hit is Kento Bento. But it was immediate and he’s watching now.  THANK YOU!!!

Edited to add:  we don’t know how long. All they said is that it takes six weeks for a broken bone to heal. We go for X-rays again next week to get a get a better idea."

4533,best show ever hands fucking down
4534,You mean one of those white space heaters?  We saw a few at the home hardware store last week and decided to skip them.
4535,Maybe you two can find a game that you can play together?
4536,"I work full time so he needs something to do during the day. :)

Edited to add:  we do sometimes play games together though.  Among Us, COD and Fortnite (this one was awhile ago though).  He tried to get me to play Brawl Stars but I just couldn’t get into it.  Most recently he’s had me playing Brawlhalla."

4538,"If he likes spending time online he would probably like chatting on discord servers. Back in October I fractured my fibula at the start of my basketball season and I'm at the end of my 5 week recovery right now. I've spent a lot of time watching TV and listening to a lot of music. This might be tough because of Covid but hanging out with friends doing indoor things like video games is a great way to kill time. If it's possible, this could be a great time for him to learn an instrument, I'm not sure what recovery is like for an injury like this, but he can play guitar sitting down with the collarbone (I think), and I'm sure you can find some online lessons for him. I hope this helped a bit, you sound like a great mom!"
4539,To play with 1 hand though? Kinda need 2 hands to even run
4540,I never thought to suggest this to him as I’ve watched most of the series. He’s checking it out now.
4541,If he likes cars then get Amazon prime and watch all of The Grand Tour seasons. U sound like an awesome mom btw. Have room for one more 🤪? Just joking lol
4542,"Galavant, New girl, the 100, modern family, how I met your mother, the flash, the arrow, good place, COMMUNITY, office, shadow hunters, stranger things, life in pieces are all amazing shows he might like. 

I don't know of if you let him watch shows rated for mature watchers so here are a few:
 Game of thrones (not the last season), vikings, the Witcher, 13 reasons why (first season) titans, money heist, sabrina the teenage witch."
4543,It's almost always relaxing unless you here the guardian song or you encounter a lynel.
4544,I don’t have any suggestions but I wish u were my mom. U sound SO SWEET. Also he might like David Dobrik if he’s not already familiar
4545,"He has unusual tv taste I think. Right now he’s four episodes into the Queens Gambit on Netflix.  Of the shows you listed Good Place is the one he’s watched and enjoyed.  Doesn’t like modern family, the office, the flash, etc.  If you have any similar to that maybe he’d take a watch.  

I don’t mind adjust content much, as long as it seems to forward the plot some.  

If I hear him mumble that he’s bored at any point, we will come back to check out some of the others he hasn’t watched."
4546,He said he tried watching it but couldn’t get into it. Thanks for the suggestion. ☺️
4547,"I appreciate the suggestions.  We are fully restricted due to COVID at the moment.  As for instruments, he can’t even breathe deeply without being in pain.  Maybe a bit further down his healing this could be an option. :)"
4548,I think you need 2 hands for Minecraft
4549,His Dad does and he’s about to check it out. Thanks!!!
4550,This comment is pure gold
4551,play minecraft with him or games he likes
4552,Esports mabye?
4553,the best thing is to ask him because you don’t wanna get him something he won’t want
4554,"Brawl Stars is an incredibly awesome with great devs! Downside is that you do need 2 hands for it...

I can recommend a great YT channel, it's called Vlog Creatons. If he's that physically active, he could try his hand at bowling if conditions are safe as you really need your dominant hand to roll the ball."
4555,Dude she's trying to get advice and you out here trying to be funny
4556,"Its tied for my fave with FMA:B, AOT S4 may surpass both of them due to how fucking good the manga is."

There’s no downside to it lmao"
4558,It’s meth.
4559,"First one. Maybe I can’t bust a nut, but you never said I can’t still orgasm. Also, if I want a child I can just have some people syringe my testicle or some shit"
4560,"i gOt MoRe tHaN a NuT tO mY fUtUrE

Shut up you optimist I’ll press the 2nd button just to drown you in my semen"
4561,"I do that all the time, what's wrong with it?"
4562,"1st, I got more than a nut to my future"
4563,There is also no purpose in life if you can’t nut
4564,So you would be okay with someone putting a needle in your balls?
4565,[deleted]
4566,Yessir
4567,yes
4568,"I need more info. If I chose 1 would I lose my sex drive all together or would I still get horny and just not be able to do anything about it? If by some miracle I actually had sex with a second person involved would I just be able to last forever, but never be satisfied? If I chose 2 would the death be painless (or extremely pleasurable I guess) or would I bust the nut, then it would happen slowly and painfully?"
4569,"Everything because a needle is meh, a punch in the balls is the good stuff :pp"

Coke is for snortin’"

For 2: instant, painless death."
4573,yes
4574,"Isn’t there? How about the daily pleasure of getting past the existential terror that is death, and the uncertainty of what happens after said terror

But then again what good is a day without a nut."
4575,yes
4576,I got a dog to take care of hell nah I ain't gonna die
4577,Or smoking cocaine
4578,yes
4579,"Yes, if I’m unconscious"
4580,So we can still orgasm with nr1?
4581,ok hit me with that 2
4582,yes
4583,You can orgasm without nutting so 1
4584,Yes
4585,The 1st button
4586,You get stage 4 dick cancer.
4587,"Yea my mom got the virus because she works at the hospital with the corona patients, she got tested recently and its positive. I dont know if I have it too but she has no symptoms so everything is going alright I guess."
4588,No. Ya boi is high risk so I don’t wanna get it either
4589,"He’s not wrong, yours probably won’t be as bad as I’ve laid it out to be"
4590,"That sucks.  Can you hold your breath for 10 seconds?  I hear it's weird.  It's  mild to a lot of people, but others it takes em out fast and ugly."
4591,"no, actually it is a maximum of 14 days. 

also, you could pass through the virus even without symptoms."
4592,I can hold my breath normally but if I do like a deep breath in it makes me cough
4593,high risk gang
4594,It might not be as bad as others with respiratory problems. I’m kinda worried to get it coz I have asthma. It’s not severe but I get chest infections often from pollen so I’m more prone to breathing problems in the summer.
4595,"I had it and got over it. It was probably the worst illness I’ve ever had — two weeks of pretty much nonstop fever — but my parents also had it, and the severity of it varied."
4596,"Ah, okay. Thanks for correcting me."
4597,Damn dude. So you never left the house and your folks bring the covid to you like pizza delivery.

4602,\*black men dancing with a coffin meme\*
4603,A mild case spread through everyone in my family except me so there's that I guess
4604,"I got it in march. Some kids in the year above me just got back from a ski trip in northern italy (where loads of people had the virus) and I remember coming to school one day with a sore throat. I didn’t think much of it until I was sitting in my science class. I was freezing and other people were complaining about the heat in the classroom. I also looked really pale and had a slight cough. I then got sent to the office then got sent home. I haven’t been to school since. I could breathe well but I had an awful fever, cough, and sore throat."
4605,"I had the opposite severeness. Bit of a cold but nothing more. Parents had it worse, but my gran (who lives with us) didn't show a single symptom! Mum tested positive."
4606,[removed]
4607,ye thats the pneumonia
4608,The 10 seconds thing was just one of those rumors people spread at the beginning. I am in a whatsapp group with older people (because I'm a soccer referee) and they shared everything because they believe it. I'm so glad this nonsense Finally stopped

4618,This is the reason why people with depression are afraid to be honest about it..

4620,"That's never happened to me or anyone I know, but that would definitely pop my lid"
4621,My sister also has epilepsy and she almost died a couple summers back... she doesn't joke about it tho cuz she's obly 9 and don't really care much about it.
4622,"Thanks for sharing, u/TinyDickCunt"
4623,[deleted]
4624,Yeah some chick keeps posting things on her story to act depressed then I talk to her and she tells me that’s she excited or in a good mood
4625,"Yeah it's pretty annoying when people who aren't actually depressed talk about their depression. I used to have a friend who would go on and on and on about their anxiety. Whether they actually had anxiety, nobody knew. But their constant droning on about it got really annoying, and it probably made their anxiety worse. 

On the other hand it's important not to assume that people do or don't have depression. For example I'm usually reasonably bright and bubbly most of the time around other people, but I go though serious depressive phases where I'll spend days or weeks not wanting to do anything (I try to hide this from others though). I don't think I have clinical depression, but I definitely get depressed, although even the majority of my friends haven't picked it. 

Sometimes people talking about their depression can be a cry for help. It's important to take people seriously with this sort of thing until given reason not to do so."
4626,"Yeah but I don't really call people out on it because I can't really be 100% sure, even if they *seem* to have a good fun life, it doesn't mean they can't have depression"
4627,"I'm pretty much depressed at this point and it pisses me off that there are people who use it for clout. If you have it and humour is your coping mechanism fair enough it's mine too, but if you fake it fuck you."
4628,"I’m just letting you know that if you continue to “hate” fake depression people that eventually you will accuse someone with actual depression, even if it’s not yet diagnosed, of faking it. Just remember to always give people the benefit of the doubt at first and support them as much as you can if they try to talk to you about mental health. You may not realize it, but what you’re doing right now is gate keeping mental illness and it is not going to help anyone if the need a friend."
4629,"Yep it happen to me. Some dude called me a faker bc 13 year olds ""cant"" be depressed"
4630,"No. Everyone's pain is subjective and different things hurt us differently. I might avoid someone if they're being all depressive but I definitely don't hate them for it. We all have issues and they're all bad to us in our opinions. Some people cope with their bad things well, some struggle to cope with their bad things. We all hate our bad things, we all get frustrated. Can't hate someone for that and good on them for expressing themselves. Learn who to express it to and how to express it appropriately and that's a recipe for (maybe not totally but at least somewhat) success"
4631,"Even fucking 4 year olds can be depressed it's the same as people saying that men can't be depressed, because they clearly can!"
4632,"Well, many people fake their mood when directly talking to people or else they would have to explain themselves. It's a possibility, nothng else."
4633,"Like right after posting about being depressed, or at random other times?"
4634,I never call people out I understand
4635,Normally an hour or a few later and they don’t specifically say they are depressed they just post depressing quotes and say true or that it’s relatable or things like that
4636,"The thing is a lot of people fake depression for karma whoring, now we don’t know wether or not a depression post is true..."
4637,"Yes, thank you!"
4638,"I feel depressed sometimes and at school or in front of family I am my ""normal"" self. But if your posting about it they are most likely doing it for attention."
4639,"Ok so I used to have depression last year, and how I work I basically had to learn everything about it. ""Depression"" and ""Being Depressed"" are two very different things and people seem to always mix up

Everyone can be ""depressed"". Depressed is just an emotion. Depression is a mental illnes"
4640,Some girl told me that I was just asking for attention.
4641,I try not to assume and I know what you mean.
4642,"What is your opinion on this, u/Rimjob_Steve"
4643,"Exactly. The problem is most people just figure a good amount of its fake, but the way I see it if we don't know, best not to chance it and push someone with real depression even closer to the edge. I'm not saying upvote and give the post gold or whatever, but just leave a nice comment showing you care. If they have real depression that will be nice, and if they're fakers trying to karma whore they don't get any karma."
4644,"I have a list of things *never* to joke about unless I’m around certain friends. *very limited* friends:  
  
1. 9/11 - I won’t *ever* joke about 9/11 unless somebody else brings up the topic  
2. Death of a loved one - common sense cmon.  
3. Faking diseases - hard to do irl but I don’t ever do it.  
4. Terrorists - just don’t."
4645,"Yeah, and i hate people who fake cancer for free karma, it's pathetic"
4646,"Who likes ""fake depression"" people?"
4647,Die
4648,"I personally wouldn't be able to handle it. I'd have a breakdown for at least tenth minutes, sit in silence for the next two, and then hurriedly call everyone I know to tell them goodbye. Once that's done I'll probably pray ferverently and then die.

Edit: this is the most upvotes I've ever had! Thanks!"
4649,Go to my five guys with my friends and family. Be like a last supper but with Cajun fries.

4667,spend the last hour with my gf and call my family and friends to tell them I love them and will miss them
4668,Fap then nap
4669,I laughed at the original comment and saw yours and immediately had a straight face on
4670,I’d hope so.
4671,What was written? I am now curious and the comment was deleted.

4682,i know right 😎
4683,"Yep. Had a dream that I was asphyxiating, and it turned out That the position my head was in relation to my headboard made it so I actually couldn’t breathe in real life. Was afraid of going to sleep for days after"
4684,When that happens I sit in bed and look up happy quotes from cartoons. Usually it ends up being either Jake from Adventure Time or Iroh
4685,"I had a dream where there was a virus that would literally destroy people. Overtime it would turn people into deformed creatures. I remember part of it somebody’s eye turned into jelly, and it just popped out of the socket."

4689,No
4690,The fuck?
4691,a classic bait and switch
4692,No but I had a dream that made me feel guilty and it kinda killed my vibe for a day
4693,Sounds like an scp lmao
4694,I have am irrational fear of spiders
4695,yeah i had one were it was just like a normal day and then a grown version of a harlequin baby spawn from the floor and beat me to death

4702,Yikes
4703,"Also known as ""catfishing"""
4704,"Yes. I’m allergic to wasps and I had a dream that I got stung and instead of giving me my epi-pen, my family just watched me die, saying that they had always wanted to get rid of me. I woke up actually not being able to breathe. It was terrifying."

4731,Yea that’s painful but have you ever miss placed a glass block in Minecraft?
4732,Being stabbed maybe?
4733,what's more painful is asking a question on a subreddit about how to do something but instead of answers you get downvoted
4734,"Yeah, I didn't think about this. Thats very painful, even though I say sorry many times, I feel sad because I know he can't understand."

edit: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA YOU FELL RIGHT IN MY TRAP"
4736,"I like to imagine my dog does understand. Then, he's a dozy git and barely even knows how to take a shit right, so.."
4737,agreed.
4738,What about only gold
4739,"Some users are giving awards in ways that weren't intended. For example, r/SuicideWatch has had a spate of awards like: I'm Deceased, Wholesome Seal of Approval, and Rocket Like given to posts about people wanting to kill themselves. This then gets reported to the mods as being uncivil/hateful/rude and the mods are tired of dealing with all of it."
4740,"I miss when there was only gold, silver is just pointless."
4741,"Yeah, the only good ones are the default trio and the ""f"" award is on thin ice"
4742,The seemingly endless scroll of awards.
4743,"Don't do this, I've seen this before. You say that awards are stupid then get hundreds of awards and thousands of upvotes."
4744,What are they complaining about? Just curious
4745,"Oh that’s... fucked up, to say the least"
4746,[deleted]
4747,"Yep. They want a way to disable awards completely, or at least disable the potentially cruel ones, but the admins don't seem to gaf. Or maybe they do but orders from on high make them unable to do anything about it."
4748,"YES! They are so freaking irritating! Some of them are cute, but a lot of them are just pointless."
4749,"If a reward doesn’t give Reddit premium, it’s worthless to me."
4750,"Christ, I was happy when there where sub specific awards. They should have left it at that, like how r/pics spell out penis or something stupid and funny like that. But the amount of awards kinda defeats the point of them. If I saw a post with 3 plat and 2 gold I would normally look at it to see what the fuss was about. When I see a post nowdays with 15 different awards that didn't exist the week before, it just reminds me that someone spent money on that."
4751,Okay who's the smart ass that give the post an award
4752,What does that have to do with the mods? Again just curious lol. I’m a little confuzzled
4753,Man if I posted something on r/suicidewatch and someone gave one of those awards on it I would deadass be more driven to kick the bucket. That’s some fucked up shit and it’s a pity that admins won’t/can’t do anything
4754,nah man I reckon it was better when it was just gold and you would summon silver with a bot
4755,"When I first joined Reddit, all you could get was gold. True bliss"
4756,That's probably his intention
4757,Yep
4758,"No, capitalism good give imaginary internet trophy please"
4759,Paid emojis
4760,"I mean, rich people who have more money than they have any idea what to do with exist"
4761,What about Argentium? It costs like lots of moneyz to hive someone that award
4762,"Have an award because why not. 

Edit: I just saw it's your cake day so the award is for your cake day now. Happy Cake Day!"
4763,What do they even do tho?
4764,Idk i think Coin Gift is nice but the rest are shit
4765,I love the snek reward... its funny... But I agree there are to many rewards
4766,"I don't get it, not even why some people receive awards for some nonsense they said"
4767,Sometimes i start a running commentary of my life in my head but i don’t talk to myself
4768,Nope. I do it all the time when nobody is around.
4769,"Yeah, I talk out loud to myself when I'm alone but I don't have a full conversation with questions and answers. Generally it'll be a narration of what I'm doing, like:
""Right Im getting up because I want pocorn"" or 
""I need to charge my controller. I'll swap""
Or I'll explain stuff to some subconsious interviewer like ""And when you're speaking Irish if you say his you add a h. For example a mála (her bag) and a mhála (his bag)"""
4770,Is that like a french horn and a trumpet combined?
4771,Do do-ro dooo
4772,"Its so weird cos during movies I always criticise them out loud, and sometimes I forget people are around. So I start saying « I fucking hate her she’s always so pissy and entitled » and shit like that, having forgotten I’m not alone, and then everyone looks at me weird haha"
4773,Ah a didgeridoo I should’ve guessed
4774,"Oh, I have conversations."
4775,"Nah, i do aswell"
4776,"Haha, a lot of people do that with movies"
4777,I do that a lot. The weirdest part is i talk to myself in english even though im Dutch lol.
4778,No I do that as well. Helps me actually
4779,I do this when im bored
4780,"No I do it. It doesn't even matter if I'm alone. I'll be in class, just talking to myself."
4781,"Yes, you are the only person, in a world of over 7 billion, to talk to yourself"
4782,I do it even if I’m surrounded by people

4788,I want to try this
4789,Sir that’s an exploded trumpet

For each type of sexual violence there are two types of data, “12 month” and “Lifetime”.

The 12 month data shows what percentage of the population has been a victim of that type of sexual violence in the past 12 months.

The lifetime data shows what percentage of the population has been a victim of that type of sexual violence in their lifetime at least once.

Some of you may notice that the percentage of women that have been raped in their lifetime is substantially higher than the percentage of men that have been “made to penetrate” in their lifetime. This is true, but lifetime is a bad indicator of how common something is.

For one, it does not account for how many times they have been victimized. It does not distinguish between someone that has been victimized five times and someone that has been victimized once. Those who have been victimized more than once could skew the lifetime data, leading us to believe that sexual violence is less common than it is actually is.

In this regard the 12 month data is far better but admittedly still not perfect. It is much less likely that survey respondents will have been victimized more than once in the past 12 months, compared to over their entire lifetime. Still possible, just less likely.

Secondly, it is affected by how common these types of sexual violence were in the past. It is highly plausible that it was far more common for women to be raped than for men to be “made to penetrate” in the past, but even though that is no longer the case it will still affect the lifetime data.

So turning our attention to the 12 month data, we can see that for 2 of the 4 reports the percentage of men who were “made to penetrate” is virtually the same as the percentage of women being “raped”.

1.6 and 1.7 in the 2011 report

1.1 for both in the 2010 report

In the 2010-2012 state report the rate for men was higher than the rate for women, 1.5 percent vs 1.2 percent.

In the 2015 report the rate for women was higher than the rate for men, 1.2 percent vs. 0.7 percent

Even if we ignored the others and only considered the most disproportionate report, the 2015 one, that’s still shows sexual assault is way less gendered than most people make it out to be, where more than ⅓ of people who have been victimized in the past 12 months are male.

What’s even more surprising than how common male victims are is how common female perpetrators are. Even as the sexual assault of men gains increased attention, I think people still assume the perpetrators are also male, which the data simply doesn’t support.

[“79% of male victims of being MTP(made-to-penetrate) reported only female perpetrators.”](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf)

And look through any of the reports and you will see that it’s far more common for men to be “made to penetrate”(mostly by women) than to be “raped”(mostly by other women)."

4810,"You didn’t deserve that. No one does. I really hope you can find someone to get this out in the open for you, because no one should ever be a victim of rape. Male or female. It can happen to anyone. 

I hope you’re doing better. Know it wasn’t your fault."
4811,"It’s disgusting, I was sexually harassed by this girl from sixth to seventh grade and the school knew and did nothing about it, I was told by people in positions of power above me to man up and stand up for myself while I was being victimized"
4812,"Somewhat surprised. I did know about this in general, but wasn't aware that the numbers were this high. It's certainly saddening, and angering too. I hate that there are so many people with no respect."
4813,"as a victim (by 4 woman) I honestly wouldn't be surprised, in my country that is something that people say that men can't reject sex, if a woman wants to have sex, he needs to do it"
4814,I can tell you I don’t
4815,Which country?
4816,"I’d believe you.

In my personal experience at least, women seem more driven by sex than men or more than me anyway. Is it too much to ask to just be loved for who I am 😔"
4817,I definitely agree
4818,"Yeah man its pretty fucked up. A woman raped a 15 year old , got pregnant and sued for child support, the worst part is that she won. Its fucked up for men nowadays"
4819,"The fact that so many people use the ""Oh He HaD An ErEcTioN hE mUst HaVE EnJoYeD iT"" honestly baffles me and shows how uneducated some people really are about this subject"
4820,but men are sex driven pigs they ought to enjoy it😡😡😡
4821,"You can't just extrapolate from the genders of reported victims in the past 12 months to the genders of perpetrators like that. What if female victims are likely to have been victimised more times, by more people, than each male victim? What if men are being victimised by other men? What if the 12 month figures omit a large percentage of rapes of women?

Data elsewhere in the survey supports all of those statements. Factoring them all in implies that as many as 85% of those who rape or force to penetrate are male.

Here's how:

**Lifetime vs 12 month figures**

The biggest problem is the emphasis on the 12-month figures. Yes, they're comparable, but the lifetime totals for women victims of rape are much higher than the lifetime totals for men made to penetrate. How could this be possible?

It turns out that the report is based on a telephone survey of people aged 18 or older (page 1). This means the 12-month figures do not include offences against people under 17. This exclusion omits up to 40% of rapes based purely on the age of the victim (page 25), and omits *all* rapes of men as 12-month numbers were too low.

If we look at the lifetime figures instead, the number of women who reported being raped is three times higher than the total number of men who reported being raped or made to penetrate.

**Repeat victimisation**

Victimised women and men do not report the same number of perpetrators (page 23). Women were less likely to report only being victimised by a single perpetrator than men for rape (71.2% vs 86.6%) and for other sexual violence in general (45.8% vs 92.1%). I'm going to hazard this bumps the ratio of perpetrators of violence against women vs. violence against men by around 15%, taking us from 3:1 up to 3.5:1.

**Male-on-male victimisation**

So who's victimising all these people? Women are almost exclusively victimised by men (98.1% of female rape victims reported exclusively male perpetrators), yes. However, the reverse is not true. 93.3% of the lifetime male rape victims surveyed *also* reported exclusively male perpetrators (page 24). That represents 1,470,000 million men raped by other men in their lifetime. Of men made to penetrate, only 79.2% of victims reported exclusively female perpetrators. The remaining 20.8% were victimised exclusively or jointly by male perpetrators. Since most male victims report only a single perpetrator, ""jointly"" seems unlikely (page 23 again).

Though 98% of women raped in their lifetime were exclusively victimised by men, only two-thirds of men either raped or made to penetrate in their lifetime were victimised exclusively by women. If one third of perpetrators of violence against men are themselves male, that bumps our 3.5:1 ratio of perpetrator gender up to 3.83:0.67 = 5.7:1.

5.7:1 = 85:15. That's eighty-five male perpetrators for every fifteen female perpetrators.

This is of course only a loose estimate, but I just wanted to show you that this survey data does not unequivocally support comparable numbers of male and female sexual offenders.

If so many more men than women committing violent offences seems implausible, we can use the DOJ's gender breakdown for convicted murderers in the US as a sanity check. [90.5% of murders committed between 1980 and 2008 were committed by men.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#In_the_United_States)"

4823,"I would not. Did you even read my comment? Literally what I am trying to say here is that I fucking hate those people and I am speaking against them. Stop gendering this. I don't give a shit if it's a man or a woman. Rape is rape. Sexual assault is sexual assault, regardless of gender."
4824,"I think it's very stupid. Rape = sex without consent of both parties, or at least that's how it should be defined.

4839,Yes definitely. I never have any idea what day it is and I barely ever look at the time. I’m also never tired for some reason so I end up going to sleep at 5 am and then wake up at 3 pm even though I wasn’t even tired.

4929,"Disclaimer: This is conjecture on my part, take it with a grain of salt. I’m phrasing it as fact purely so that I don’t have to keep repeating “theoretically” and such phrases. 


To give you probably the first serious answer in this thread, there are actually quite a few reasons. The biggest two are from an evolutionary perspective: large thighs/ass usually imply large hips, which are favorable for birthing; large thighs/ass also usually imply that the girl is in good shape— generally fit, which is also attractive in terms of creating offspring. Keep in mind, that’s ass/thighs from a combination of muscle and fat, not just pure fat. That’s why overweight girls often don’t get that kind of attention purely for their ass/thighs, theirs often aren’t effectively muscular in any sense. Obviously that doesn’t mean they can’t be attractive, just that they’ll get less attention for that specific feature. 


Now from a more sociological standpoint, both are very close to the vagina, and so both are very often involved in sexual acts. There’s this societal idea of slapping ass, running hands up thighs, etc etc, which are all very standard foreplay— we develop this sense that they themselves are even further sexualized, simply from their relation to direct sexual organs. 


Now from a much less nerdy point of view, when I see a good ass/thighs I’m not thinking to myself “hm wow what a wonderful specimen to mate with, we’d have extraordinary offspring”. I’m not Dwight Schrute. More just “god damn, she is fucking hot”. There’s something about the way good thighs jiggle, how they feel grabbing them, the twitches and reactions as you move your hands up them; just doesn’t get beat by anything else. Same sort of stuff is true for ass. 


So there you go. Hope this could provide some insight as to (from my own perspective) scientifically why, and more just generally why once you’ve had some experience. Toodaloo."

4985,"She's the only real friend i have, so it kinds sucks that i have a crush on her, because if i tell her and she rejects me things may get weird between us, so i just stay quiet and suffer :D"

5001,She's my cousin and she is soooooo beautiful and cute and funny
5002,"She could rock both short or long hair, no matter what, I’d never get tired of staring at her for hours. Has the cutest smile, big round glasses that make her look absolutely stunning. She’s my biggest crush yet. I actually like to think she’s my very first crush cuz I have never crushed on someone so hard. When I think about her, I get butterflies in my stomach. She makes all these instagram “models” look underwhelming af. Never saw her in one but I imagined her wearing a slightly oversized sweater and my heart skipped a beat at the picture of how cute she’d look. God I could go on for forever..."
5003,Curly blonde hair blue eyes white skin and a cute nice near perfect smile she’s 13 and I don’t know why I love her but I don’t want to tell her because that might ruin a our great friendship

5007,My mom gets pissed if a microscopic drop of water ends up on the bathroom counter
5008,"My biological mother once punched my throat in because I grabbed milk from the fridge. Another time she choked me because I wanted to exercise in the basement. AITA?


Edit: to be clear my mom was mentally ill and likely OCD, she’d flip out at a lot of relatively minor things. I’d have to eat food in a certain way/order, etc. thankfully I’ve been out of that situation for nearly a year so it’s all good."
5009,"My mom angrily said, “are you going to let the dogs out or what?” after not having even asked me. I then asked her why she said it like she’d already asked me before and she said, “I was thinking about it five minutes ago”. I got yelled at for not doing what my mom *thought* about telling me to do..."

Didn’t realize it. Another year of my life I’ve wasted on reddit instead of doing something productive."
5028,"Literally no reason.

She was drunk and just started yelling at me. As for my dad, he would just be mad at me for the most stupid shit. He once threatened to rip out my spine because I kept bumping the couch he was sleeping on while I was playing on his PC. Honestly kinda glad I haven't seen him in half a decade"

5044,"No it‘s not. It‘s just not comfortable thinking of things you don‘t like (i.e. thinking of homosexual sex when you‘re not homosexual).

And on top of that it‘s weird to think of friends that way. Kind of like thinking of sex with your siblings."
5045,"Yeah, kinda a lot lol"
5046,"Yeah, it's gonna be very awkward when I talk to her again"
5047,_offering what_
5048,"Yeah to me it's not a big deal when it happens. I don't hate myself or anything, I was just being funny about it in a lighthearted way lol. I doubt there are many people it hasn't happened to before, if they're being honest lol"

5051,To have sex with her
5052,"Probably once or twice but I’m not really attracted to them just my mind wandering off, also only with guys. (Gay)"
5053,"Well, it's more of a joke that we have sex but she is always ""I would like low-key fuck you"" but I think I would rather keep this as a joke. So it's not like she asks that everyday. Just whenever that joke comea up, she also talks about it seriously"
5054,You’re high key fumbling the bag rn g
5055,That's sad

5066,No
5067,"Bruh i love it when anyone texts me first, its nice to feel wanted"
5068,"Be careful with that, just bc she texts first doesn’t mena she’s interested"
5069,But it does mean she is the one that wants to talk!
5070,This ^
5071,Yup. Studies show clinginess is very unattractive
5072,I would absolutely love if a girl were to make the first move
5073,Now that is the enthusiasm we like. I know you’re a guy but if I heard that from a girl I’d have to take the day off out of shock.
5074,"I love it, and personally I like to try talking to somebody 3 times, and if on the third time they still seem a little cold I let it be. But normally people seem more comfortable after a couple times."
5075,"I definitely prefer it when a girl texts me first,I'm pretty shy and introverted so I don't really know how to start conversations"
5076,It’s ok as long as it’s not too clingy
5077,"Don't get too excited i had this girl that texted at least twice a week asked her out but i got rejected.

Reading signs isn't really my thing"
5078,*dms* LoL

Wish it twas that easy irl..."
5080,yes :DD couldn't agree more
5081,Same
5082,"I see. Well, I’m not too good at that either, I can’t even read myself most of the time. But besides, the ladies never talk to me anyways so I’ve got nothing to worry about. But for you, I wish you the best of luck."
5083,Please! It’s just such a weight lifter off my shoulders. I suck at starting the conversation
5084,This
5085,The majority of dudes are terrible at picking up hints because we're likely overthinking about it and end up doing nothing.
5086,Not only did I make the first move... I had to make all of the moves on my bf. He’s shit at picking up on hints haha
5087,"As a girl, if a guy texts me first it really makes my day, like omg you wanna talk with me?? I really used to light up if that one guy texted me lol. Like you really want to have a conversation with me/share something with me (omg this sounds really desperate I don't mean it that way, more like, omg you took the time to text me) so I kind of think boys have that as well?"
5088,"Eh, I don’t really care tbh. It’s nice to know that you wanted the conversation enough to initiate it, but if you’re responding and stuff and seem to be engaged after I sent the first text then that’s cool as well."
5089,"I absolutely love it. The girls I'm currently talking to all text me first and it's set them all up for equal candidates for my love. Girls who text first are superior because it shows they're actually interested and saves me from the risk of rejection, humiliation, and pain."
5090,"It completely depends on the person for sure. There’s a lot of bullshit about how a moderate amount of clingy is unattractive by every human on the planet, which is just completely false. It’s perfectly fine if both of you are clingy and on the same page with each other and have a healthy relationship"
5091,Thanks! But don't be sad you're 13 when i was 13 i also didn't really talk to them
5092,That’s true.
5093,"Hell yeah, but what did he say that gave you the vibe he didn’t want to talk to you?"
5094,"I don't mind clinginess. As long as it isn't too much. I'd rather have someone who shows they care rather than someone cold who responds every other day with one word replies.

It varies from person to person, just like everything else, though."

5099,Yeah it's absolutely disgusting behaviour and I don't understand why they're doing it.
5100,It's just disrespectful
5101,what the fuck?
5102,Honestly I'm not surprised a couple of dumbfuck shitbags decided to do that. An the fact that so many more people do it made me officially lose hope in humanity. World's fucked ar this point.
5103,So are you saying we should trust everything they say?

5112,"What a useless response, at least admit what you just commented was stupid asf."
5113,Its stupid
5114,That’s absolutely horrible. This is the first I’m hearing of it and I’m thankful it hasn’t taken root near me but the thought that there are people who are not only this tone deaf but completely heartless is baffling and terrifying.
5115,"According to you, we should let "" edgy kids be edgy kids"". That's condoning this type of behavior because by saying nothing and not even explaining them why it's wrong they'll think that's it okay and keep doing it & because they suffer no consequences they'll keep doing it. It's not rocket science"
5116,Pretty dumb
5117,You know sometimes I think maybe the death penalty isn’t too harsh
5118,"I agree, they're so dumb and people that actually believe what they say are even dumber"

5122,very cringe 😬

5124,Can confirm
5125,Disrespectful and sickening.

5186,Thanks I used your comment as a link because I didn’t want to type it in
5187,why do you hate the french
5188,Ok almost everyone is saying not to ask him so I'm not going to
5189,"I think you shouldn’t ask him, this coming from my own experience i didn’t like being forced out. If you are really sure he won’t be upset then ask but otherwise don’t its better for him to come out by himself. This is from my experience but it could be completely different for your brother."
5190,No. If he wants you to know he'll tell you. You asking him could make him panik.
5191,Don’t ask him! The only evidence you have is gay porn search history which would be **so** weird. You take that to the grave
5192,So many people question that guy's name now that it's not a suprise to see it anymore
5193,"def find a way to make him realize that he should just delete the history or use incognito tho lmaooo i didnt know so many people just looked up nsfw stuff on a normal google tab, especially if they dont delete the history. just make sure you don't make him think you've seen something he wouldnt want you to have seen."
5194,I agree with not telling him. You should also try to discretely let him know about incognito or something like that. You might not want your parents finding any if that stuff
5195,"He might not be gay tho, I've looked at stuff I don't like just to try."
5196,You don’t?
5197,yeah i think he just used it because he was sleeping in there we dont usually use the pc for that lol I deleted all the history when I saw it so our parents wont see
5198,"I do, I speak their shitty language"
5199,"As a gay twin, No

Leave it up to your twin to come out, even if you know your familly supports you it's still hard to come out.  It's really great how you'd support him though.

  
As others have said maybe bring up some pro lgbtq stuff, might just make your brother happier. Don't make it obvious though ha."
5200,"As a gay guy I'd advise against asking him. But start discussions about the lgbt, love, sex etc and try to make him understand that it's safe for him to come out to you"
5201,"NONONONONO As a french myself I can definitely say that French is one of the worst languages in existence. It looks simple yet it fucks you at every possibility. Ever heard of ""mute letters"" ? Basically a bunch of letters that serve ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING PURPOSE. And there is one in almost every word. Imagine writing and adding ent at the endent andent itent changesent nothingent inent theent sentenceent."
5202,would your parents be okay with it if he came out as gay?
5203,yea probably
5204,No ask me if am gay
5205,U could ask him but if u do also tell him to use incognito
5206,"Je peux confirmer. Je suis demi-français, donc je suis d’accord que c’est chiant, franchement."
5207,Do not ask him. It would make him uncomfortable. Wait till he's ready
5208,"Um you really shouldn't tbh. I'm not gay for the record just putting my input- if you bring up his porn history that's already awkward to begin with nobody wants to know another person saw their search history especially if it's NSFW. I can't really speak on actually asking if he's gay because I'm not gay myself and I don't think I should have a say in that, but if you bring up the porn that's going to be super awkward"
5209,Ok just making sure :)
5210,"Oh I’m dumb I thought you were OP lol. It’s fine if you were helped by friends asking, but the fact of the matter is that OP doesn’t know how his brother will react to being asked. He could’ve just been curious to see what gay porn looked like lmao and decided to look. Maybe he’s curious and thought he is bi but now realizes he isn’t. Maybe he actually is bi/gay and not ready to share that. If any of these situations is what actually happened, OP’s brother will rightfully be very defensive. It is not our friends or family’s job to force us out of the closet. It is a much better alternative to make that decision ourselves than having it taken away from us on the off chance we don’t end up minding it. 

Not to mention OP has reason to believe his twin is gay because of porn in their search history. That’s kind of embarrassing and another reason why they should wait."
5211,[deleted]
5212,"This. Even if OPs brother is, he might lie if asked when the time isn't right because coming out even to an accepting family or friends is scary. But like showing signs you support the community is always good. Like putting pronouns in your bio, just casually saying you support it if it comes up and stuff like that. It made me at least feel more comfortable."
5213,Bruh I see you every thread lmao
5214,"Either way, the twin could be questioning."
5215,Twist: the commenter and op are related
5216,"Hmm, idk. Suddenly starting with all of this stuff could stress him out, make him think that you know about his sexuality. I’d just continue as normal and wait for him to tell you. As a gay guy, the best way possible to support us is to not make a big deal about it. We just want to be like everyone else."
5217,Thank you for making me laugh we all live a lonely life.
5218,I get kinda lonely cause everyone I know is in a relationship but I don’t really like talking to people. It seems normal which used to make me feel bad but I can’t force it so I move at my own pace and I don’t feel bad anymore. Still not in a relationship tho ;-; but I’ll get there eventually.

5228,"You'll get used to it. 

Judging by your age you are in the middle of puberty and are at this time that you really really want a partner. That's just how it is. Everyone experiences it around the age of 14-15 

There are two options from there: 

1. You'll get a girlfriendand the feeling will be gone but many new not always positive ones will appear.

2. You won't get one and the feeling slowly fades but always comes back every once in a while. There are always this 2 days in a month when you feel like shit and lonely. But I think it's just part of puberty. Just make the best of it!

5235,"Oho, me too my guy. This one girl I liked got together with two guys even when she knew I was into her.
I was the weird kid in middle school, and all of my friends felt more like older people feel with drinking buddies, your friends, but it rarely goes beyond that one thing. One of them I liked and she liked me back but then a week later dumped me because she said she was into creepypasta characters and “couldn’t love a human.” That experience haunts my all the time, especially when my sister and cousins talk about their relationships and I have nothing but that and a list of rejections. People say it’s good that I have the confidence to tell them, which is really good, but you have to maintain that confidence when around them, and then there’s the factor of looks and what the girl likes and it just ends up putting you at a disadvantage. So it happens to me all the time."

5278,"also those gigantic tumours on people's head.

mf really waited until his eyes were popping out to go the doctor"
5279,"Honestly, I don’t. I’ve seen so many people I knew from high school throw there life away with drugs and alcohol. Dropping out of college, spending thousands on weed. 

I don’t drink and I don’t do drugs because I don’t see any upside. I don’t mind being around people who do it at a party but I see no reason for me to do it. Knowing myself I would get addicted"
5280,"It’s easier than you think. Your resort to food and drugs when you are sad.

I have felt that way sometimes, but resist the urge. That frightened me, realizing how easy it is to ruin your life.

That got me working."
5281,I understand everything but weighing more than an elephant. it makes me wonder if their full time job is consuming fast food restaurants like galactus
5282,"I mean, haven't you ever been morbidly curious?"
5283,"it’s an eating disorder, BED to be exact. it’s horrible, almost just like a drugg addiction except you don’t have the choice to completely distance yourself from it like you can with drugs and alcohol. no matter what you have to eat four meals a day."
5284,"getting addicted to things is absolutely horrible. and you’ll never truly recover either. it’s terribly easy aswell, depending on the person."
5285,I watch 600 lbs life with my mom and gaining an excessive amount of weight due to trauma as a child or teen. Eating is the only think that makes them feel safe. I don’t think this goes for all people who are morbidly obese but for some that’s the case.
5286,"You can't really just ask ""why do people become morbidly obese"" or ""why do people become drug addicts"" because it's highly individual. 

With extreme obesity (i.e more than being just a bit fat) it's almost always either because of mental illness or because your parents brought you up to be fat/overeat and it's hard to break those habits. And the thing is that being fat can cause mental illness so even if the original reason you were fat wasn't because of mental illness, it can create a feedback loop where you gain weight, your mental health gets worse, so you gain more weight and so on."
5287,"That's what I don't understand either. Drugs are addictive, depression is uncontrollable, but I can't explain why or how people get so huge"
5288,"Yeah. I used to be addicted to porn. I'm not fully recovered, but a million times better. I've also been through a breakup, which didn't make me suicidal, but sure as hell made me understand those who are"
5289,I've been suicidal since I was nine so I've always kind of got it and I've always felt annoyed when people judged them
5290,"It just gets you away from shit you deal with, it’s like this for many( especially people I know). If you don’t want to do it, never do it if you have no intention."
5291,"it’s an eating disorder, BED. i wish people felt more empathy for overweight/obese people. you never know what theyre dealing with. some people on r/fatlogic absolutely disgust me"
5292,"i've read something about bravery which i found really intriguing

""all it takes is one small moment of courage""

reading this thread made me realize how morbidly fitting it is when you talk about addiction"
5293,That sounds horrible
5294,nope still dont understand 600 lbs or drugs but suicide yes.
5295,Yeah exactly. Like i don’t think I could get to that point even if I didn’t care abt my body at all
5296,"i sorta get being overweight, i used to be. i was depressed (i'm doing better now) and just didn't care cause there was i thought there was no point in caring. you get blinded and don't realize how bad it really is"
5297,"A lot of times people will go to drugs or large amounts of food to cope with things outside their control.

I can speak from experience that it is easier than you think to succumb to these harmful coping mechanisms."
5298,"Sometimes people don’t realize their harming themselves. And if they do, they may either enjoy it, or can’t help it. When a person has been so emotionally damaged that this helps, they don’t necessarily want to stop. It becomes their addiction. They can’t help but do it. Most of the time they hide it because they’re afraid of how the people in their lives will react, but sometimes they do it to bring attention to abuse they may be experiencing behind closed doors."
5299,"I’ll give you a basic reasoning, it’s deeper than this but this will be easier to understand.

When it comes down to it, self-harm typically comes from a lack of control over pain. Emotional pain is not something one can control, no matter how hard they try, so in order to get control over it, people turn to inflicting physical pain upon themselves to get that sense of control. 9/10 times they are NOT doing it just for attention, and I think that’s important to know."
5300,I watch my figure constantly bc I’m ✨disordered✨
5301,"Idk how people become crack heads or morbidly obese. Even after all the shit I've been through and seen it hasn't made me want to do drugs or drink to ""get away"". More the opposite really. I've seen how addiction like that can destroy, not just your life, but the lives of the others around you. And I've just never understood why you would let yourself become morbidly obese. Like I get some people have an issue controlling their weight but no one is stuck at being morbidly obese because they legitimately can't change it. If you get that far it's because you don't want to try to be better."
5302,"I also didn’t know how you could get so bad to get into drugs until i did get so bad i started taking everything i could find, i’m now not exactly addicted but i really need smth every couple days to like not freak out. it just gets so bad sometimes you want some way to get the fuck out and forget, you don’t get answers but you forget the questions"
5303,I’m trying to quit that now. Wish somebody told 12 year old me not to start watching that stuff.
5304,"For drugs, a lot of kids are peer pressured into it or maybe do it to escape their depression / reality. But I can literally never understand how someone can become 500 pounds and keep eating. Its ok to be chubby, it's even ok to be fat, but how do you get to the point where your legs can't even hold your own weight??"
5305,I understand em but I still don’t understand why people do self harm
5306,I don’t understand the 600 pounds thing

5337,A girl asked me out over text like 3 years ago and I was like legit “sorry I have depression so I don’t like being around people.” And that was that. Kinda regret it tho. She ended up dating this guy that got her into all sorts of drugs. Too bad i guess
5338,"Aww poor girl A, he could of just politely declined"
5339,"One asked me whether I could take her home on my bike. I said yes. Usually, a friend of mine would ride w/ me home and I asked if he could follow me. And then the girl gave my friend a look and then he said that he had to hurry home.

So there I was taking this girl home on my bike. she told me the directions and stuff and when we got to her home she asked if I could stay for a drink to thank me. I said I was fine and I had to hurry home (I really didn't, I just wanted to go back home after a long day)  but she kept on insisting. So I was desperate to get home enough that I just left without her letting me.

The next day my friend asked me how it went, I told him about her not letting me go and stuff. He told me I was an idiot and that she wanted to hook up.

And that's when I had to choose between coming out as ace or getting called gay for the rest of the school year. (I chose the former)"
5340,I was a complete dumbass and I thought she WAS joking
5341,*That's how you know you fucked up starts playing*
5342,"IF my gf was here she'd tell you all of my dumbass moments

&#x200B;

However since she's not here ill tell you the only one that happened : I was at her house one night,before we started dating and during the timewe both had been developing feelings for each other) It was a cold night and I knew that but I was still determined to help this girl get ready with all her assignments so he could ace the tests she had coming up. (that and I also needed help with some some math questions) So the night got REALLY cold, colder than I expected and on top off all of that it started raining buckets, so her being the slick girl she is told me that I could just stay with her until the weather got better. I thanked her but rejected the offer, she kept insisting that it was ok if I stayed and the we could even share her bed together. The idea sounded REALLY good to me but 1) I didn't want to look like a creep and 2) I didn't know she had feelings for me and I sure as hell wasn't gonna let her know that I had feelings for her. So my dumbass decided to walk a full 3 miles in the freezing rain, because I was to scared to share the same room with my crush over night. But hey I didn't get sick so thats good."
5343,Could h a v e
5344,yeah i'd cry to that. if you don't like her back just say you don't return her feelings bruh
5345,honestly screw anyone who calls you gay for that. I'm sick these guys perpetuating the idea that if a girl makes advances on a guy then he must not reject her or else that means there's something wrong with him. This leads to guys feeling pressured into sex when they really aren't comfortable with it.
5346,"Well one simply texted me ""I like you"" and I didn't realize what this meant until a few years after. To be fair it was when I was 13 or so. And a pity I actually really liked her"
5347,No.
5348,"No hold on,  being 13 isn’t an excuse, she wasn’t dropping hints or anything.. she just straight up told you"
5349,"I was 14 at an amusement park, and I’ve always looked much older than I am. I was next to this really hot chick on a roller coaster and was hitting it off well, but at one point she said “I go to VCU, what college do you go to?” I almost said I go to ______ Middle School. Without thinking I said “me and my boyfriend go to GMU!” I could tell she was really turned off and walked away when the ride was done. She was probably 6-8 years older then me"
5350,">could of

Please. I beg mercy"
5351,"in that case you didn't really miss an opportunity (although you prob messed up by hurting her feelings, i'm assuming), considering you would have rejected her anyway"
5352,"This one girl acts WAY too happy to see me, even though we don’t know each other like that. She still stares at me in class. 

One time when we were walking in the hall way, she came up behind me and tried to give me a hug. I took a sharp right and got a drink from the water fountain. Another time the same happened and I saw it coming so I got on the other side of a male friend. I’m a little put off by her efforts

She’s not a creep or a weirdo, I’m just not interested. Like, she nice and all, but (no offense to her) I feel like I can do better"
5353,"okay, did you actually like her?"
5354,Idk what that means lmao
5355,wdym? how have you fucked up by curving someone?  Or do you mean there are better ways to reject someone
5356,"Well yeah I was dumb. But to be honest, the biggest reason I didn't capitalize on that was because I just couldn't comprehend that someone actually liked me. Well but it's been the only option so far, so I feel even worse"
5357,"There are 3 probable possible ways.(off the top of my head)
1. You hurt her self esteem/ego.
2. You hurt her feelings
3. You did want her but just didn't notice the hints

Of course i can be too fast in my judgement but it was just intended as a joke."

5362,Went to a different school for 2 weeks. To look if i want to switch schools (I wasn't happy with my old school to say the least) and there was a really cute girl and she was like 3 months older then me. So after school when i went to my bus she walked up to me and literally asked me if i wanted to go eat somwhere in the city. (The school was a bit on the outside of the city so we would have hd to walk 3km or so) and bc I was hungry and it was faster for me to just go home (and I didn't have any money by me) I then said I just want to go home said by and left. She didn't talk much to me after that and I went to a different school :^ )

5378,"Yeah, usually dreams involving my crush. Like there was one dream where we were just sitting under a tree with her head leaning against my shoulder and I was feeling all warm and fuzzy, then I bloody woke up.

Have had others like that too."
5379,"Yesss

I lived in england ( where i wish to live), worked in a maid cafe (dunno why but cute job ig.) And had a boyfriend which i was exactly my type and everything was honestly perfect.

Then i work up but everything felt.. Off. Then my dream tricked me because apperantly i was still sleeping. I woke up in my ""boyfriends"" arms and i was like ""wait my whole life was a dream? Is this my real life?"" *existential crisis*

And then i actually woke up. Felt weird for days"
5380,I had wings and grabbed another planet and slammed it into the earth waiting for it to remake itself. Sucked when I realized it wasn't real.

I don’t remember that much about the specifics of the dream, but I think I were on my balcony, and I think some people I knew also were there and they somehow made me feel accepted and normal, and goddammit did that feel good. Then I woke up and well, I realized I were still myself, aaand I had to go to school."

But there’s not much you can do about it besides blocking them and moving on."

5431,Maybe they're just pretending to be boys when they're actually pedos?
5432,Haha tits
5433,It was always the opposite for me. The girls turned it into a sexual thing. But seriously who asks a 13 year old girl sexual questions? Are there really such dickheads out there?
5434,Damn. The only place I've ever found friends online is Discord (and only because I lucked into a really nice niche community)
5435,"i hate that sub, utter garbage more than half the time"
5436,Have you had any luck anywhere else?
5437,Haha dicks
5438,You mean all the time. When I joined Reddit at like 14 it was garbage. The quality has surprisingly remained consistent.
5439,"Maybe yeah but most the pedos have empty profiles. If they're commenting on normal teen things for like a year to pretend to be teen guys then wow that's commitment

Nah I think it's normal teens but just only seem to wanna chat to a girl when they're horny or something. Rip"
5440,"not to mention cringe too. some girl posted about 'bravely' going to school with a hoodie with porn in it, and she was getting thousands of upvotes

later on, made a follow-up post of going to the school photo day with the same hoodie. unsurprisingly getting thousands of upvotes"
5441,Haha asexuality
5442,"Dang thats interesting, I've probably talked to like a hundred people on reddit in the past almost 3 years and cant remember a single conversation going sexual"
5443,[deleted]
5444,[deleted]
5445,"> Are they really such dickheads out there? 

Yeahh and soo many of them. It's tiring and annoying.

Like I just want to have a good, normal conversation with a guy and actually be friends but noo nearly every conversation that goes for longer than 5 minutes always turns sexual after half an hour.."
5446,"I would never start to talk to a girl about sexual stuff unless I know her well and I'm sure she's okay with it. It doesn't suprise me that many boys do this, they will hopefully stop doing it when they realize it's not working."
5447,I didn't think about that. You're right. I guess some teen boys have too many raging hormones to control them all. :)
5448,Yeah those communities are full of horny teenagers who have no respect for other people; I wouldn’t judge an entire gender based on two subreddits.
5449,I talked to some people. I talked with 4 people over multiple days. One gay guy who asked me out and 3 girls. 1 girl didn't say anything sexual at all.
5450,Might be the guys youre talking with because i dont know a single guy that would do that
5451,"r/suddenlygay

Edit: me no see flair.

r/expectedlystraight    ?"
5452,On my last account I had maybe 300 people blocked between horny or creepy teen boys and pedos lmao its a huge oof
5453,"They’re idiots. I don’t know anybody personally who would do that but here on reddit even I (a male) have been messaged a few time’s by some..... questionable people

Just block and ignore them is my best advice"
5454,What sub would you think is good to find boys to talk to who actually want to have a normal chat / be online friends then?
5455,"Honestly, no idea, this place seems *better* but i'm not sure about it since there's always a handful of pervs in any place.

Reddit in general isn't very friendly towards women now that i think about it."
5456,"I'd like to, but I have no idea of where to start"
5457,Because we treat body spray like pepper spray and the locker room is a battlefield.
5458,Jeeze
5459,I'm so glad my school didn't let us use axe
5460,"> 13F


Yup, Axe body spray. The worst stench in all of middle school, I don't miss it lol"
5461,"Yeah, here it's a warzone and that one kid that never has axe is suffocating in the air"
5462,It all makes sense now ಠ_ಠ
5463,My school doesn't let anyone use spray deoderant. That doesn't stop them in the slightest though.
5464,That's why you bring a lighter and...
5465,"they banned bodyspray at our class because some dude would always spray that shit across the entire room, and after pe everyone had a headache because of it"
5466,"It’s nasty and horrible, many of the guys will stop. Not all I’m afraid. Also, some people (in my school at least) inhale it to get high so there’s that..."
5467,[deleted]
5468,"I dunno it’s kinda iconic now... not good, but iconic"
5469,Young lads think it's cool to use axe when they first start using that stuff so they load up. Basically your smelling almost a full bottle of that stuff emptied into a room for like 15 guys
5470,"Don't worry, in a few years they'll be sent off to WW3 where they can do the same thing and hopefully die."
5471,"STAPH, U BETTER STAPH"
5472,"On a completely unrelated note, someone at my school taped the trigger thingy down on one of those and threw it across the gym locker room, one kid ended up getting asphyxiated by the shot and had to go to the hospital"
5473,"Ya I remember being in grade 6 or 7 and this kid tried to impress me my friend and I by spraying axe in his butthole and my other classmate who was desperately trying to be our friend did it too. Now being a senior these two kids have been arrested at least once and nobody in my class knows where they went after

Edit: spelling and grammar mistakes"
5474,Now I see why my friends get out of there as fast as possible
5475,"What's worse is that some dudes use Axe without showering beforehand so the already horrendous smell of their body spray mixes with their own stench, ugh."
5476,They're practing for wwiii by exposing themselves to chemical warfare
5477,No no... he’s got a point
5478,Auschwitz time
5479,5 years is quite a long time to perfect our axe body spray gas attack
5480,Glue.
5481,Because someone taped the can
5482,I have asthma and axe is my enemy
5483,"Yeah I'm just glad when I was their age my school didn't make us change, or even have changing rooms"
5484,*screeches*
5485,"Ya know how they have the tear gas chamber at basic traning in the military, yeah its basically that but instead of tear gas, its axe which is pretty much the same thing"

5490,my gf has that arm chip thing
5491,"So you can track her, right?



Jokes I know it’s birth control hormones"
5492,I’d do something sexual that doesn’t involve insertion.
5493,Harsh but very true. Teenagers can be so stupid.
5494,Probably just wouldn’t have sex with them.
5495,shhh she doesnt know I track her
5496,Are you telling me to fuck you in the ass?
5497,Stay pure.
5498,No sex 🙅‍♂️🚷
5499,Like what? Oral sex can still spread STDs
5500,"Why from all the comments you have to reply mine, is this a hint? lmao 😳"
5501,I'm down 🤭
5502,"Yeah fr tho I had barely hit puberty at 14, I swear these freshman are something else."
5503,"Well, you can’t get pregnant. I wouldn’t sleep with anyone other than my girlfriend, so STDs wouldn’t be a concern in my case."
5504,Yep
5505,"HPV, HIV, Herpes, Syphilis, Gonorrhea.

“Studies have shown that the risk of getting HIV from having oral sex with an infected partner (either giving or getting oral sex) is much lower than the risk of getting HIV from anal or vaginal sex with an infected partner. “ (But there’s still risk)

5506,I haven't really tried either but I wouldn't compare passionately enjoying a hot moment with your partner to putting your dick in molded cold plastic
5507,Your 14? How old is your GF?
5508,I’d say « bye bye 🙋‍♀️ »
5509,"The same people will use fleshlights because they are ""realistic"""
5510,Molded cold plastic is the most accurate description that a person could give tbh
5511,Yo
5512,[deleted]
5513,Are they? Asking for a friend
5514,"Oop, you’re in"
5515,Birth Control can help make periods more regular and lighter and some girls have been getting their period since they were like 10 so it's not that weird
5516,In more ways than one.
5517,Yes but I think we should also normalize girls wearing pants and shirts with pockets like ours
5518,"Normalize people wearing whatever clothing they want. If a guy wants to wear a skirt, that’s his business and he shouldn’t get shit for it."
5519,"We want to....WE REALLY WANT TO. I swear if I could fit mens jeans, I would never go back"
5520,Eh I don’t know for me maybe like a one time thing to see what it’s like and I probably won’t put it on again
5521,"That's why it's gotta be normalised. Have you ever been in school on a hot day while your balls are sweaty and rubbing against each other and in pain but you can't do anything about it because it's too tight? Well now wear loose boxers and a skirt and bam, much more comfortable."
5522,Well damn you just opened a whole new door of possibilities that sounds really smart actually
5523,I would really love if this got normalized. Wouldn't have to feel that afraid
5524,"That's interesting, why do you think it's weird?"
5525,"Fine by me, I wouldn’t wear a skirt myself but I wouldn’t look down on anybody who did either"
5526,"Girls can't normalise boys wearing skirts. 

Only boys can do that by actually wearing skirts."
5527,We just need to normalize people not giving a shit about what other people do/wear.
5528,Yeah I can see that I think it looks a little weird but yeah like you said go do it they want
5529,Aye why not after all its just clothing
5530,"My mom buys more guys clothes than women’s, and at this point I’m thinking of following in her footsteps since an ungodly amount of my jeans have fake pockets that are literally sewed just to look like they have pockets."
5531,You know I don’t know I find somethings weird for no reason I guess maybe cause I’m not used to seeing it probably
5532,"Exactly how I feel! Other than the paying part, if there's money involved I'd certainly do it."
5533,[removed]
5534,"I couldn't care less what you wear.

Skirts? Cool. 

Pants? Fine.

Skulls of your enemies? Neat."
5535,that would be fucking infuriating
5536,Exactly my guy
5537,And that's not going to happen
5538,"You have no idea. You get a new, fresh pair of jeans. They fit *perfectly* and look awesome. You go to slide your phone into your pocket- the pocket won’t open. You try and push it open with your fingers. It’s shut. It will not open. It was a sick lie."
5539,"I wish I could wear a skirt in public without the fear of being assaulted, they seem very comfortable. I support it."
5540,Yeah but women’s pockets are abysmally small.
5541,we just need to normalize people wearing whatever the fuck they want
5542,Lmao a child isn’t going to be traumatized by a guy wearing a skirt.
5543,"oh fuck yeah, normalize men wearing skirts, men wearing make-up and men doing their nails!!!"
5544,Ive done much more for a lot less
5545,i wish i agreed. sometimes dresses are comfortable and sometimes they’re like “hey here’s a corset for ur tits and a really itchy hoola hoop for your legs”. my favorite dress is this rly soft black bodycon dress and i love it sooo much
5546,Isn’t that already a thing
5547,That's weird and disgusting. Nobody wants to swim in a pool full of piss which is what will happen when he gets into the water.
5548,your bf big weird
5549,"What the fuck, who does that?"
5550,"Her boyfriend, clearly."
5551,I sure as fuck don't
5552,What? No. Your boyfriend is just weird.
5553,"It’s weird but the people telling you to reevaluate your relationship are weirder. That’s just a bizarre quirk that I can’t imagine comes up often enough to have any serious implications on your relationship. Also he probably did it for a reaction, because that’s why guys do weird/annoying shit"
5554,I would recommend becoming single
5555,No that's just fuckin weird
5556,Im mean... i don’t announce it.
5557,I mean every pool is practically piss and water
5558,Lmao no
5559,Hes speaking the language of the gods!
5560,"Piss in the water not just standing there. Wtf is up with this guy? 
(Looks into the distance as he pees into the face of a mole)"
5561,"I agree, you don't have to dump someone over such a small thing. That's the point of love, seeing past their flaws."
5562,People who willing piss their pants usually aren't the type to have healthy relationships buddy
5563,Lol reevaluate your relationship.
5564,"Ik this is probably a joke, but if it isn't just know that a healthy relationship is not so fragile."
5565,Maybe in the ocean at a beach but not In a pool
5566,Lurker?
5567,I can only assume he thought it was funny
5568,[deleted]
5569,"He got the Big W, I'm afraid... 😔"
5570,Just new here
5571,"Wait, what water parks are open now?"
5572,"I used to pee in the pool, but I never announced it. Is it weird that I find this hilarious?"
5573,Uhhhhhhh that’s pretty weird tbh
5574,"I think you’re over analysing it, I honestly just think he’s a little weird and thought it would be funny. Sometimes jokes don’t hit and this was just a pretty outrageous miss"
5575,When I was like 5 maybe but even then I tried to at least make sure I was out of sight or close to the water
5576,You do realize that the pools will have piss and shit particles no matter what right? Children were invented for that exact reason.
5577,Hmm.....it depends on the type of people listening to it; the ending was pretty funny imo
5578,Yeah it cracked me up when I saw it on r/jokes the other day
5579,A little too much on the description of what he's doing to her breasts but it made me laugh. Good one. Just know your crowd before you say that kind of joke.
5580,"I just saw it in r/Jokes, I think it's pretty funny. Don't say it in a room full of people you know will we shocked"
5581,Not offensive and not funny either
5582,"Ehh its not offensive but it is not funny either

In my opinion of course"
5583,yeah it doesn't feel like a joke more like a plot
5584,i keep miss reading imo for lmao
5585,"i guess it's not really offensive, but also just painfully unfunny. just in general an awful joke"
5586,Neither offensive nor particularly funny.
5587,"seems kinda trashy, and reads like a shitty fanfic but otherwise is alright humor-wise"
5588,Not a fan of jokes about sexually harassing women and following them. These jokes tend to bleed into reality and make people think that’s ok
5589,"Weird joke. If someone told that to me (im a girl) I think I'd be quite uncomfortable and avoid that person. It's more of a man's joke idk. 

It's not offensive really but just weird"
5590,"but i can definitely see why people could see it as offensive, the guy does trick her into letting him caress her boobs"
5591,that's not funny 😂😂
5592,"Isn't really funny, it's kinda of a boomer joke than anything"
5593,"Not really, i'd say it's for the girls to decide anyways since that's the sensitive part if anything"
5594,There was nothing particularly funny about it so it's just gross tbh
5595,"I’m gonna argue that he did force himself on her by bribing her when she was visibly uncomfortable, and then tricking her.

Either way not really offensive and not real but figured I’d nitpick lol."
5596,"It's a joke about harassment so its in bad taste and possibly offensive to some, but it's not as funny as I thought it would be."
5597,a whole novel…
5598,"Well it kind of does. Nothing happens to the man to suggest it wasn't okay, and the reaction of the woman suggests that this behavior isnt as bad as it really is, when in reality the woman would be fearing for her life if someone did this to her. It uses unrealistic events, like the woman's reaction, to tell the joke. The unrealistic events can give an altered view of what happens in the real world which is why people might find it offensive."
5599,"there's a difference lmao, it's juvenile and gross but it's not bigoted"
5600,"i don't find it offensive bc it's a joke, but I see why people would. It suggests that harassing a woman about her body is an okay thing to do, and he ends up tricking her and using her. Would be offensive to people who have experienced this sort of thing irl"
5601,"Yea, I dislike overly long jokes in general"
5602,"I'm talking this particular case though, but i don't think it would be either"
5603,I dont see how this is offensive to anyone at all
5604,[deleted]
5605,"Not offensive, decently funny, 3.5/5"
5606,"It doesn’t suggest that it’s ok. People who get that idea from this are the ones at fault, not the joke."

5637,We all know this moment where a girl puts deodorant at 10 meters away from you and then  8 hours later your mother ask who's she
5638,In my school there’s a kid who goes round spraying deodorant in others faces
5639,what did i ever do to you
5640,"It's not personal, it's just eliminating possible threats"
5641,[deleted]
5642,I know people who would do that but in a shoe or a gym back then inhale it to get high
5643,She puts on so much deodorant from hella far away that it smells like she was all over you
5644,So my mother doesn’t find out I smoke
5645,I'm terrified I that i smell bad so naturally I dont think just a little is enough
5646,In my school there are kids who don't use deodorant and it's a hell.
5647,Can you explain this in english?
5648,to cover up the scent of gamer
5649,So every school.
5650,"for how long have you been doin this tho? she might get suspicious on why you use a lot of spray (unless you have done it for years already).

also sorry for asking, but whats the problem if she finds out? i mean you re 19"
5651,Lol it's just badly written
5652,Teach me this new young person language
5653,Cleansing the gene pool

5655,Using deodorant is a last minute resort when you realized you should have showered but already have to go
5656,body odor?? more like gamer odor 😎
5657,"Oh no bud.

I recommend old spice. Smelling good helps get girls in the mood like 10 x faster. Unfortunately for you 10 x 0 is still zero"
5658,"It's nothing personal kid.

5700,I really really love music it's been apart of my life since I was like 5 mostly with rock and rap that my mom and dad would play constantly so now I always have music playing in the background of everything and it's gotten me in trouble a few times
5701,Heck yeah! It’s hard to be in the silence and work. Gotta have music.
5702,I am lol it's good though it relaxes me
5703,"yes. i listen to music for atleast 10 hours a day, the whole school day and then when im home while im playing games or browsing my phone"
5704,But video games have music
5705,Lol same especially during this quarentine
5706,"Yo, how are you able to listen to music at school?"

music + games = A great night"

5714,During class I'll have my music on and teacher will tell me to take them off but like I'm never at a school longer then 3 months most of the time so I honestly don't care
5715,"Yeah, but my school would give me detention for using earbuds in class."
5716,"I’ve always been addicted to music, and I always will be. I never go anywhere without my headphones"
5717,jokes on you a was addicted to music before all of this shit
5718,I like music but I hate listening to it as background noise. Whenever I play video games or do homework or something like that I listen to YouTube videos and podcasts.
5719,always listening
5720,I’m a girl but this was SO ME!!! Until I got unwell for a few days and didn’t want to listen to music for that time and now I just listen to music less. I think it’s a shame. I did love listening for like hours a day
5721,"Same, even when playing video games/watching something, I ALWAYS pay very close attention to the music.
It got me through the hardest times, and I can listen to it 24/7"
5722,i definitely could not live without music

~~lol~~"
5724,That sucks
5725,Yeah but I got used to it

5816,"I tend to be the same, but I see hot and cute as two different kinds of attractiveness if that makes any sense."
5817,i think it's because guys think girls do. i had another girl tell me the same thing. so my best guess would just be that they think if it isn't big enough they won't get into a relationship
5818,Not constantly talking about it but at the most random times💀 I’m fine with it but I guess he probably is insecure
5819,Ohhhh okkk
5820,side note: lots of guys prefer shape & smaller breasts & ass over huge breasts and huge ass
5821,"Because a lot of girls do care even when they say the don't, and it's not like we know which girls those are.... I wont talk about my dick size tho that's kinda too much info"
5822,yeah most likely
5823,But this guy has been in many relationships...
5824,Exactly this! To be honest I think that too sometimes.
5825,maybe nobody's told him. another possibility is that regardless if girls care or not he just wants to be seen as better like a confidence thing like you said idk
5826,"Yeah, oversized features are a real turn off"
5827,It’s tied to masculinity. Lots of guys think little dick=less of a man
5828,Alot of girls *do* care though. At least in my experience in talking to them.
5829,"I get trying to life up girls with small boobs, but that’s really hurtful to say. It’s not like girls with big boobs can control how big they are, and here you are saying it’s a turnoff."
5830,"As a bi guy, yes dick looks wonderful"
5831,Well. Lucky for them other guys are into big boobs. Different guys are into different things. He’s speaking for himself here. I personally also think big boobs are a turn off
5832,"Well, that isn't so strange. When there is a man who's being an asshole, there's is always a comment about how he probably has a micropenis. The same as those 'racism is smalldickenergy' signs during the BLM protests. Apparently for many, small dicks are the equivalent of being an asshole or being inferior."
5833,Because other dudes make fun of us if we have small dicks
5834,Idk either. I’m pretty comfortable with my size but I don’t talk about it.
5835,"No, that’s not what I’m saying, small boobs are great big boobs are great, it’s when they oversize their boobs, it doesn’t look right"
5836,#boobs are boobs
5837,"It is one of the main masculinity traits. Fortunately, many girls think like you. But for boys, they may think the bigger their ""manhood"", the better, you know. Also, watching porn where they use camera tricks and small girls to make the pp's seem huge can heavily skew one's perceptions, and someone may feel like their 5.5in average dick is tiny."
5838,Yeah that could be
5839,coming from a bi guy - is a dick ever attractive? they look fucking ugly lmao
5840,"Maybe just testosterone or insecurity, or a combination of the two"
5841,That’s the question that they aren’t willing to answer
5842,"I am open about it among my male friends but they are open about it aswell, it is a big inscurity of mine even tho it doesnt need to be because my size is fine but its just a voice in the back of your head telling you you arent good enough, big enough, good enough to satisfy her."
5843,That sounds gay... why are they worried about YOUR dick size
5844,[deleted]
5845,"I’m not really worried about it at all. I have a decent sized dick and thats that. If the girl I fall in love with and want to spend my life with is shallow enough to not be with me cause i’m not 7-8 inches, then they aren’t someone I would want to be with in the first place. 

Thats all I care about. It all comes down to one person. That’s why I have self confidence and don’t mind who I am."

1. Do it irl, online asking out is a no no

2. Do it when there's only the two of you. If he is with his friends he might get joked about and it's not a good feeling to make such decision in front of other people.

3. Be straight and simple, guys generally don't like nor understand little hints, just tell that you like him, anyone would be happy to hear that. The worst thing that can happen is a ""not interested"""

If you have a really close friend, then I guess you can talk about stuff like that, but tbh I wouldn’t feel comfortable talking about stuff like that with my bros (here’s to being able to do that in a few years tho).

5907,"I completely agree I don’t think it’s right. However, I think the main reason I think it isn’t acceptable to judge breast/butt size is because it’s right there for the world to see. But it isn’t obvious for guys when you first meet them. 

Basically, you can immediately judge a girl when you meet her, but guys kinda get a chance to let their personality shine through before getting judged."
5908,I think it’s only disrespectful for a guy to judge a womans boob or ass size if he’s being rude or treating her solely like a sex object. There’s nothing wrong with having preferences and talking to your mates about things you like.
5909,"I think everyone should be allowed to judge whatever they want, so long as they don’t make someone feel bad about their body it’s fine. I’m attracted to girls with smaller features but I wouldn’t say someone’s unattractive because she has large breasts, just not as attractive to me."

5915,:(
5916,I think what OPs talking about is some people think its rude and disrespectful to want to date a girl with a big ass/tits but find it acceptable to want to date someone with a big dick. Obviously not everyone thinks like this but those are the people OPs referring to
5917,"It not considered disrespectful because men dont usually speak out about it or dont care, women seem to be more outraged when its about them. Like its not socially acceptable to call a woman fat but men tend to be more accepting of it."
5918,"Perfectly said

As expected from a veteran"
5919,I feel like it's kinda bullshit both ways. The size of various body parts shouldn't be the reason you go for someone
5920,That’s what everyone told me. I’m 18 and 5’6 now. -.-
5921,"Oh I see

Yeah I can totally see that

Like say, a dude says a woman has small boobs everyone around them might gasp a little and look slightly offended

But if a woman says a dude has a small peen he'll prob just make a joke about it"
5922,"At least in the case of my female acquaintances, they don’t care that much over it, and if they do, they consider it their personal preferences. I think it’s more the vocal minority that directly criticizes small dicks, and shouldn’t be seen as the whole.

In the case of guys, there’s major a difference between stating a simple personal taste, and being more insulting. I can say that I’m into small boobs, but no one should say say “girls without small boobs are eh”. Because that’s not only insulting, it’s also simply not true. And if a guy actually thinks that, I hope they aren’t vocal about it. 

Just like how it makes us insecure if a girl is vocal that she doesn’t like guys with small dicks, we shouldn’t be vocal in the same vein. Be the change you want to see."
5923,"I think it should be that various body parts shouldn’t be the ONLY reason why. I can see why someone would like someone cause of looks (it’s hard wired into our brain), but if that’s all then either you’re a fuckboii or you just met that person."
5924,"I'm sorry but I don't think I understand

Complaining about what exactly?"
5925,I meant more in the sense of a relationship not a hookup. During a hookup you still shouldn’t treat a girl like a sex object because it’s meant to be pleasurable for both. She’s not a sex doll kinda thing. That’s not quite what I meant but like I said I meant more in the context of a relationship.
5926,"Just seems that men have thicker skins and can deal with it better than woman, but that just makes it seem as if it's okay to say that to men"
5927,"Thats how it always seems, you ever heard a girl say ""ughh boys are such idiots""? Well i have and i dont complain about it but its pretty annoying to see women complaining about dudes saying ""ughh you lost to a girl?"" Its pretty hypocritical ngl"
5928,"Of course, thanks mate. Still waiting for my veteran’s discount tho smh"
5929,">  or treating her solely like a sex object.

You mean only wanting her for sex?

Isn't that what all ""no strings attached"" hookups are? Wanting the other person only for sex?"
5930,"Just one of the many double standards, there’s a lot of fake facts in the feminist movement, such as the wage gap, which many companies, such as google have researched and have found they are overpaying women, I’m all for feminism, but I feel they should focus on places such as the Middle East, where women don’t get equal rights"
5931,Well obviously. The term ‘object’ implies it it solely for one person when the experience is for both. If you care about the other persons pleasure then they aren’t an object even though you are both using each other solely for sex.
5932,I mean 5’6” isn’t bad it’s around the average right?

5956,Some people have a high risk of developing psychosis and weed can sometimes accelerate the process or cause symptoms to become apparent early
5957,"Weed: Numbness feels good, especially when society holds ridiciolous standards and youre lonely and depressed, the fate of a teenage boy in the modern age. I also got kind of addicted to it after my breakup half a year ago. Feelsbadman.

Alcohol: I don't really enjoy it. I believe it turns me into a more stupid, annoying and generally just worse version of myself. Also makes me throw up because I'm a binge drinker and usually go overboard. Yet I could've easily seen myself becoming an alcoholic, good thing weed exists.

LSD: I tend to say it's for self-growth and spiritual awakening, but I'd have to lie. Doing psychedelics recreationally is really damn fun. In any case, disregarding my possibly irresponsible recreational use of such a powerful substance, I have used it for advanced introspection and the likes and I do believe it has helped me be a better person, to myself and others.

I don't advocate for drugs, but I won't tell anyone not to try stuff. Noone is obligated to prove anything to anyone or hold up to any standards. If you are happy being a coke snorting party monster, go for it. If you are happy laying in bed all day after swallowing a couple of Valium pills, sure man. I personally like to take the line between ""drugs"" and medicine and throw it out of the fucking window. I feel self fulfilled after having done drugs and used them to my advantage. Yeah sure I still get high on the weekends, but as long as I'm not hurting anyone or hindering my own performance in day to day life I see it as a decently unhealthy way to spend time with friends. LSD is a great tool, but just like an electrical engineer needs to know theory before cutting up wires and circuits, someone looking to take a psychedelic and learn a lesson should inform themselves thoroughly. I took acid twice in my life, the last time about a month ago. Since then I've started regularly going to the gym, controlling my ego and wiping out any cognitive dissonance in my life.

It is the dose that makes the poison."
5958,"I've discovered from here as well as from the ""do you drink"" question that a lot of guys here still have the ""if you drink or do drugs you are an evil person"" mentality PSA's wrongly teach you. Drug users are victims and drinking really isn't all that bad."

I've done LSD, Mushrooms, Coke, and Weed all multiple times. Also booze^(obviously) and I still smoke cigarettes. I don't think i really qualify as a teen *Boy* anymore, but I feel like my experience might be relevant. Anyways, here's some negativity:

**Psychedelics.**

Look, shrooms and acid are usually harmless. But even doing psychedelics once may change your entire outlook on not only life, but reality, particularly if you have a basic understanding of what reality itself is made up of. You're gonna see visual anomolies and have a massive internal creative Renaissance, maybe even rediscover yourself and become happier. *But* this is not substantial. Psychedelics aren't a fix for your problems, they're an escape mechanism.
Speaking of escape mechanisms,

**Weed**

This shit is overrated. It *WILL* make you less intelligent, unambitious, and worst of all uninteresting. But only if you overdo it.
Smoking weed no more than thrice a month will help mediate these negative effects and will actually help you unwind and have a LOT of fun. 
That is, unless you have pre-existing mental problems and/or have a brain that does not enjoy being high as fuck. 
Honestly, you'd be better off doing magic mushrooms. It's way more fun when done right, and you don't feel like a moron during and after the high^like^with^weed.

**Cigarettes**

Do not ever try a cigarette. It is never worth the risk of becoming a habitual user. Those things are a pain to stop using and will make you feel *immediately* worse while you're using them. It is literally just toxic fumes and respiratory problems in exchange for a shitty headrush

Honestly, alcohol is fine. Except it makes you fat and can be surprisingly addicting, especially if you feel sad often. Good rule of thumb to avoid addiction/abuse is to drink with friends only, and reduce consumption of you blackout/puke. 



I know this all comes off very negatively, but the good times people have while getting fucked up can so easily end up altering the course of their life. Don't smoke, drink with friends, and **hold off on psychedelics until you develop mentally and emotionally**."
5966,The only thing I find concerning is 14/15 YOs here taking drugs lol like that shit is not for kids to mess around with
5967,I saw someone compare it to the Boston tea party to justify the riot. um no lmao. They dumped tea bc there was an unjust tax on tea. Like wtf did target and your local family coffee shop do to deserve being robbed and burnt down
5968,sick of this year. and this country. and like every country in the entire world except like 3
5969,"""A riot is the language of the unheard"" - MLK 

Yeah I don't agree with a crime spree to get the point across, no one does. But when stuff like this keeps happening and everytime there's a massive out cry, what happens?

Nothing usually, an officer gets put on leave and then a few weeks later they go back to work doing what they've always done. 

This sorta stuff was bound to happen, people are calling for systematic change and reprocussions for abuse of power and negligence for public safety. 

Being a white Australian, I don't really know what it's like to be discriminated against and we all know that if George was a white man he would have been cuffed and sat in the back seat of the cruiser. Not choked to death for ""resisting"" 

The only way to make a point is massive public unrest. Movements like BLM have existed for a long time and unfortunately they're not winning their battle because they're too easy to ignore. We can only hope this time is different."
5970,"The problems is, if you have 100 bad cops, and 10 are bad, but the other 90 don't report it, you have 100 bad cops. The whole system of police accountability is fucked. Cops work closely with prosecutors and local DAs. That makes it awkward when the local prosecutors that know these guys have to prosecute them, or when they're being investigated by their peers. There's both a culture that discourages reporting misconduct, and a shitty system of investigating it. Now I'm not going to exclude the protests from being really shitty, but from what I've heard, the majority were criminals and looters who were dissociated from the actual cause of social justice and police accountability. Not excusing the unlawful actions of anyone participating, but the majority were not doing it for justice."

5973,"Thing is, it’s not a few bad apples. Vast majority of police wouldn’t snitch on one another, just like how a gang member would never snitch on other gang members. There’s a saying I’ve seen quite a bit and I think it’s accurate.


It’s something like this.


“Only good cops are former cops.” Meaning that the majority of police who do actually care about upholding the law and justice leave the police force due to how much corruption has been rooted in it."

Healthcare may be free, but you often won't get any treatment at all and if you do you have to wait a long time for it, i'd rather pay to be healthy than die for free. Our police actively try so hard for a case like George Floyd not to happen so they basically aren't allowed to do anything. We have one of the highest taxes in the world, yet there's a lack of funding for everything. Source: Am a swede."
5988,I fell like I’m being desensitised to the wickedness and stupidity on all sides of society
5989,"There’s a reason we hear about police brutality a lot more now than we did 20 years ago. There have always been racist cops (West Side Story’s Officer Krupke was pretty realistic), but something changed after 1990. The FBI [caught on](http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/402521/doc-26-white-supremacist-infiltration.pdf) in 2006. White supremacists have been infiltrating police forces in the US. A few rotten apples spoil the whole bunch (what with all the “protect your fellow cops” and all that). Combine that with the mentality that “cops can do whatever they want,” and you can start to see why this is a problem that isn’t going away anytime soon. You can also see why most retired cops are absolutely horrified: they (mostly) weren’t working with violent racists.

Frankly, it’s upsetting to learn about people’s response as well. As absolutely horrifying as the murder was, and as important as the message Black Lives Matter is, looting and violent riots (I saw video of fireworks being launched at police cars and people looting and trying to set fire to a Target) aren’t going to fix the issue. There’s a lot of anger to be taken out, but it needs to be more narrowly targeted. Stage a constant protest outside the DA’s office (or home address, if that’s not too ridiculous). Refuse to leave until the officers are brought up on charges. Figure out how to recall the sheriff. Whatever the protest method, it shouldn’t leave anyone injured or confused about their involvement in it. I’m sure the owner of the McDonald’s that got burned down is really confused as to why their business was targeted.

Then again, nonviolent protest doesn’t really work, now did it? That’s been happening since 2012, and the problem never went away. In 2014, it got violent. It still didn’t go away. At this point, everybody is just angry, and nobody knows how to use that anger productively because nothing works. Just sucking it up isn’t an option either. The only thing that has ever worked involved getting the government to pass legislation. MLK managed to do it because his issue could be fixed by the government. But the Black Panthers had to start open carrying in Oakland to actually get any change, and they were met with an open carry ban. Is the solution to arm the protesting crowd? That seemed to work for the anti-lockdown protestors, but Louisville has shown that it just isn’t always a great solution.

However it happens, nothing will change until the hiring process for cops changes. It needs to weed out the high school bullies who just want to exert their power. It needs to weed out the racists who want an excuse to kill black people. It needs to eliminate the thin blue line mentality that makes cops defend each other over the law. It needs to attract the kind of people we actually want to be cops. If that never changes, we’re only going to see the murders and the riots get worse and worse until the metaphorical explosion at the center of the gravity spiral when two unstable objects collide. If anyone knows about LA in 1992, that’s nothing compared to the ticking time bomb that is America’s police force."
5990,I feel like if you are more outraged at the protests than the murder of a man something is wrong. The police need to hold each other accountable. Obviously not every single cop is a murderer but by not holding the bad cops accountable for their actions they’re just as bad as them.
5991,"How so? How is 170 business looted, damaged, or burned overblown? And that’s just in St. Paul. I genuinely want to know your opinion btw. I haven’t heard anyone raise this argument."
5992,Wait what? Hurricane landfalls
5993,"Cyclone Amphan in India/Bangladesh, Typhoon Vongfong in Philippines, Cyclone Harold in Vanuatu and Fiji, Tropical Storm Bertha in South Carolina, and a near miss from tropical storm Arthur in North Carolina.   And we have about 95 percent of all tropical cyclone activity in the northern hemisphere left.  (The Atlantic Hurricane season is supposed to start in June and peak in September)."

5998,There are a good amount of people who know for sure they never want kids. That's completely different from not being able to have kids at all. That shit fucking sucks. I know some people who for various reasons can't have children and its awful.

But if we are talking like you'd get the average period then I would 100% go with having a period over getting kicked in the balls. But if we are talking my kinda period, then I'd want to be kicked in the balls."

6004,yeah exactly
6005,"It depends, even a small hit to the balls can drop a grown man to the ground and keep him there for a minute or two and the pain weakens but lingers around for about an hour.

6009,"Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.

Contents: Section 1: In Pornography Section 2: Ball stretcher Section 3: Parachute Section 4: Humbler Section 5: Testicle cuff

Section 1: In pornography

In addition to it’s occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (literally Ball kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.

Section 2: Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds.

Section 3: Parachute

A Parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and squeezing effects on the man’s testicles. Moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.

Section 4: Humbler

A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Section 5: Testicle cuff

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.

Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.

However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm."
6010,How long does that pain last
6011,"I got kicked in my balls really hard onvce, lasted for 3 days"

6013,Like an hour but I'd rather be able to have kids
6014,"Yeah that's true

Idk I think in general getting kicked in the balls is more painful than the average period, but there are periods like mine that in my opinion are much wprse. Literally one time I passed out from a cramp and then when I woke up I literally couldn't walk😂"

6016,"Period. A hard kick in the balls can genuinely make a male infertile. If I'm gonna lose that ability, I want it to be my own choice. And getting kicked in the balls is absolutely horrible of course."

6022,You found a loophole in the question
6023,Preferably.
6024,"""There’s no clear answer to the question of which is more painful, as comparing the two events is nearly impossible. One causes a brief rush of pain that disappears relatively quickly, and the other comes and goes, but for several hours (at least). When ASAPScience investigated this question in 2013, they ruled that it was a tie:

The claim that getting hit in the testicles causes “9000 del of pain” and that child birth causes “57 del of pain” is not based on any scientific information and appears to have been made up out of whole cloth.""

6025,Yes.
6026,Holy shit I thought I was the only one
6027,"The second one has started to drive me insane recently. Last week (I sort by Rising) I saw a post from /teenagers in my feed, and the title was something like “I don’t get why guys don’t get more compliments”. It already had 7 awards if I’m not mistaken. The meat of the post was something like “I (a female (she literally put that in parentheses)), think that guys don’t get enough compliments! I know I run on compliments and they make me feel nice, so I’m going to start going out of my way to start complimenting guys more often”. Please shut up. When you’re playing up the gender roles and specifying yourself as a certain one, you’re just baiting. Also “as a guy” or “as a girl” does not qualify you to have some unique or special opinion others can’t or don’t hold (*unless* it’s a specific, physical problem only one sex experiences) and if you’re using your gender as a reason for why your opinion should be listened to more, or why yours matters more than someone else’s, again, unless it’s specific to a certain gender, then you’re either baiting, have a superiority complex simply for your gender, or are just being sexist.

I also have this with my best friends, sometimes I wanna make a joke but I know that she'll probably die from laughter so I dont make the joke cause of the bro code:

6207,It can change your perception of a healthy sexual relationship. You can also get addicted quite easily and this can sometimes result in a hard time getting it up. It’s perfectly fine to watch porn but people need to not watch it excessively. Maybe add some amateur into your private time occasionally.
6208,https://imgur.com/a/k9KD3DR
6209,"Porn can be addictive in the same way as candy, it only becomes harmful in excess. Porn isn't very realistic and the porn industry isn't always ethical."
6210,"I don’t think OP’s talking about whether or not it’s possible to get addicted to porn, cuz yeah duh of course it is. I think he’s more talking about whether the nature of porn or the way the industry’s designed means people who consume it are prone to get addicted to it. Kinda like how you can get addicted to both smoking cigarettes or collecting bottle caps, but are far more likely to get addicted to the former."
6211,Totally agree but i prefer to use my imagination
6212,"Harmful... Sort of. To be honest, I’m a bit scared that if people can’t ‘vent’ their hornyness they’ll end up venting it to real people. Or not. But that’s just a thought I have. 

Addictive is not a good way to describe it. Everything is addictive, it’s your head making it so. If it has certain chemicals added in to make it addictive /on purpose/, like drugs do or cigarettes, then it’s addictive. But this is hormones making it addictive, it doesn’t have to do with the content itself. That being said, it’s a risky place. It’s hard to control prostitution, because governments simply don’t really want to burn their hand on it. The internet is already a mess, and two messy fields of work are double trouble. And that’s why I think governments should try to regulate it more."
6213,haha beatme
6214,It never really harmed me. I just gave up on it since it is very unattractive to me.
6215,"Same, masturbation in itself is fine and maybe even ""healthy/good"", but I feel like porn can ruin your perception of what sex should be, and cause you to always expect more from your s/o... idk, just my personal take on it."

6227,"USA regulates almost nothing and that's why it's going to shit. In my opinion. By commercializing you give people the opportunity to be complete dicks and there's always gonna be someone like that. So no, I don't think that regulating nothing is good. Opposite really. I think that there should be a few rules firmly set, but nothing like China cuz that's oppressing. Just a few base rules, heavily discussed and thought through and then come to an agreement and /then/ they can make it happen."
6228, NO government regulating our lives.
6229,Approximately 8% of adults have a porn addiction. That’s a lot
6230,r/beatmeattoit
6231,"I feel like Reddit is really overreacting.

Addiction is far worse than what Reddit think addicting is. The threshold for addiction is preferring porn to real sex and not being able to stay of Pornhub for one day.

Porn is not harmful because you require stimulation to balance hormones and keep a good mood. It’s basic biology and homeostasis. 

Porn every day might be harmful, but most people are smart and reasonable enough to know and enjoy real sex compared to porn. These claims really only affect the socially deprived and mentally ill individuals.

Too much of anything is harmful."
6232,... You're kidding right? They control pretty much everything..
6233,I think it’s better to do it when you need to and use your imagination instead of porn. Just my opinion
6234,r/canyouallshutthefuckup
6235,"Yeah that’s not true. According to this source, which is a review on current research as of 2019:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352245/

“Hypersexual disorder is sometimes considered one of those behavioral addictions. It is used as an umbrella construct that encompasses various problematic behaviors (excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, telephone sex, sexual behavior with consenting adults, strip club visitations, etc.) [7]. Its prevalence rates range from 3% to 6%, though it is difficult to determine since there is not a formal definition of the disorder”

So not only is there not a formal definition of the disorder, it also encompasses an array of conditions, further muddling the stats and meaning the amount of people who have hypersexual disorder because of pornography use would be less than that 3-6%.

Specifically talking about problematic use of online pornography (POPU):

“The only study with a representative sample to date is an Australian one, with a sample of 20,094 participants; 1.2% of the women surveyed considered themselves addicted, whereas for the men it was 4.4%”

Which is significantly less than 8% of all adults."
6236,"Its not bad in moderation, but too much can change the way you see people, im trying to cut back rn"
6237,That's what I thought but my friends disagreed. (also you replied crazy fast I posted this less than a minute ago)
6238,"For me, it's yes. As long as she follows the bro code, and understands that boys will be boys sometimes she's welcome to be a bro."
6239,Yes thay can be. A Girl Bro. None the Bros can have feelings for her then
6240,"Yeah, but not part of the boys"
6241,That is a hard rule that CANNOT be crossed
6242,"“She can be a bro, if she is not a hoe”

Homielations 4:17"
6243,Any time we’ve inaugurated a girl as part of the boys it has ended poorly. Would not advise
6244,"As long as she doesn't get all ew the second we start doing sexual burns and all yeah, but I'm yet to find a girl who's completely comfortable with them (at least around boys)"
6245,It's when someone gets aroused by being burned. Usually by hot wax.
6246,I mean if it is crossed it's technically a bromance...
6247,I think you're on the wrong subreddit
6248,"So at least in my experience girls that have been part of “the boys” have either been really good friends with us or dating someone in the circle. 

I don’t think I need to explain why the dating scenario would be a problem. But boys and girls are fundamentally different and there’s always going to be a bit of a rift in how you behave around them, or the way you think about them. It’s nothing against women, and I’ve been friends with a circle of women before where I was the only guy so I’ve seen the other side of the coin. 

It’s just by sheer virtue of gender that division will be there. When they become “one of the boys” and you still act differently around her or vice versa, or the friendship ends between the guys and her, it can create problems. They never have the same relation with you as your guy friends and when that precedent is set that they will, and then it doesn’t happen, that’s where things mess up. 

This isn’t to say you shouldn’t be friends with girls, because I think that’s a wonderful thing. But laying out certain expectations that can’t be reached isn’t a good idea"
6249,"What if she becomes... a step-bro

I am very sorry and will unsub immediately"
6250,[deleted]
6251,Could you elaborate?
6252,No. She’s not a bro then cuz that doesn’t fit the definition of a bro anymore
6253,Da Bois is what you say if you’re a little edgy kid. The Boys is universally recognized as the truest form of friendship
6254,"As a girl, I appreciate the acceptance, as I believe that I am a Bro, but I wanted to check what actual Bros think"
6255,"A girl that was dating my friend placed herself at a very high importance and repeatedly tried to become one of the boys, despite the fact that we repeatedly respectfully stopped this from happening. She got so obsessed with being of the same level of importance and respect as the boys that she got overprotective and incredibly overthinking and tried to pick arguments with my friend group often. This eventually got us to be forceful and firm in our rejection of her, and led to my friend breaking up with her because she wouldn’t stop. 

Girls can be a bro. But never one of the boys."
6256,"yes, like dude, bro is gender neutral"

There isnt any shame in saying any of that, it saves everyone a lot if embarrassment. But just be blunt and honest and respectful about it."
6318,He is 16. I’m just saying that if he’s close enough to 17 he can say he’s 17
6319,Great advice from a gangster such as yourself
6320,I had this happen to me too except I met her at work. She is like 23 and I'm 17. I told her but she kept flirting and texting me constantly. I tried hinting that I wasn't interested (several times) but  she kept going. She even brought me some gifts and stuff. Eventually I had enough and told her directly that I wasn't interested and then she still kept going so I blocked her.
6321,"Say you’re 16. Are you close to age 17? If so, say you’re 17."
6322,"Or just say he 16, because he isn't 17 yet."

6423,OP wears a suit to school lol
6424,"Taking drugs doesn’t set you up for addiction if you’re responsible. Posts like this are so naive it makes me frustrated, life is full of struggle and suffering so stepping out of that and being 100% blissful for a few hours is a GOOD THING. Regardless of how people choose to make that happen"
6425,"""I'm here for a good time, not a long time"""
6426,"The thing about drugs and alcohol being mainstream is that it encourages parties. I come from a region (Hong Kong) where the drugs and alcohol are really restricted, and people are either busy or just studying here because the sex and drug culture is so conservative. I personally believe that its the kids fault if they fuck themselves up and they should have access to drugs because not all drugs are bad to some people."
6427,"Give them white wine and white wine with red food colouring they'll taste the diferrence (eventhough the food colouring is tasteless)
This experiment has been done with multiple ""professional wine tasters"" and those guys still ""tasted"" a big difference between the red and the white wine. There is a word for this effect, i think it's the placebo effect but i'm not sure."
6428,I guess so. I don't mind TBH.
6429,[deleted]
6430,"Definitely agree, I like some wine myself but 15  is too young to be doing that. Oh no no no"
6431,Why is weed acceptable?
6432,"If doing something enjoyable involves alcohol at 15 then yeah, you are dumb"
6433,"Big stoner weighing in, it's important to keep in mind that we don't know all of the effects of weed yet. It is known that heavy use can lead to a decrease in certain brain functions, namely memory, and especially in people under 25. New research suggests that it may also lead to psychological illnesses later in life, though nothing has been proven yet. Actually one of the cases for legalization is that research is nearly impossible right now because it is a schedule one narcotic. If weed becomes legal, we will better understand the long term effects of it. Remember that tobacco was used for hundreds of years before anyone knew it was bad for you.

&#x200B;

Anyway all this is to say that while I think smoking is a beautiful thing that really can put your life into perspective, it is not totally risk free and that is important to remember."
6434,Have fun with your nicotine addiction champ
6435,"It’s not that big of a deal ngl, it’s personal thing and if you do it that’s cool, if you don’t that’s cool too"
6436,"Nothing to do with being allergic, just either bad history with alcohol or you're not into it"
6437,"As long as it's in moderation, who cares?"
6438,"I’m not against drugs I’ve done some before and I don’t do em often, but I will stay away from nicotine and alcohol because most the guys in my family are addicted"
6439,[removed]
6440,These posts just seem condensing to me
6441,"Just the smell makes me throw up, makes me dizzy and my face grows pale. So I never really managed to take even a sip."
6442,"I have a problem with people who repeatedly drink to excess in their teens, it's really not good for your brain development or liver."
6443,It’s fun
6444,Because it is a fucking choice. As long as you don’t smoke next to someone who doesn’t want to and it is legal it’s a fucking choice
6445,I’m not going out every night snorting coke or anything I’ve tried some drugs and I don’t do em often
6446,Cause people can do what they want. I've done weed before but that's it. Only did it a few times and have no interest in doing it again. 0 interest in drinking. But if others want to. go for it. idc
6447,Real questions..
6448,I’d imagine some of them are of age but just don’t want to show their exact age.
6449,Neither. Id say im kinda the av age around here. But I figured that my posts and comments although very few would kinda give me away if any friends found my account. Its Unknown015 for a reason. 015 cuz all the number from 000 to 014 were taken
6450,Yeah I think so too but there is a part of me that’s worried that they are either too young or old to be here.
6451,I know for sure that my father has no access to my social media and he has told me that he doesn't try to access it nor is interested on ever doing it but i'm still paranoied.
6452,I'm in-between 13 and 19 but I just don't like judgement because of my age.
6453,"u/are-a-mistake

Clever."
6454,I just don’t really wanna give that away but I’m still a teen
6455,So you’re 13?
6456,"There’s inevitably going to be younger and older people here. It’s the internet, people can easily lie about their age. I could be lying about being 16 (trust me I am). Anyways the point is that you can’t fully trust anyone and there’s always going to be people who aren’t of age whether you like it or not. Did you know that there are even flairs for older people anyways?"
6457,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) yes
6458,ok boomer
6459, Damn violet what’s with all these philosophical questions
6460,Yes
6461,so 15’s the limit huh
6462,"I used to be hella paranoid since i watched hella ncis,csi,csi Miami. So I don't blame you. No I give 0 shits lmfao"
6463,I should've just said judgement
6464,No the limit is 947
6465,"Tbf I don’t think you’ll get written judgment, but in my head I do cringe a bit when I see people with 13 flairs saying certain things, but I’m sure people with 18 and 19 flairs cringe when people my age chat shit. So I think you’re fine"
6466,Yeah I know all of that but I’m still curious about it.
6467,when you turn 20 will you be kicked out of this sub and no longer be a mod or will you get to stay?
6468,Heads up its CSI not cis
6469,I misspelled it whoops
6470,Son ur in trouble
6471,"I always cringe when 13 and 14 year olds on this sub give dating and sex advice, because the freshmen at my school are still incredibly immature and look like middle schoolers. So whenever I see a flair saying 13 or 14, I just imagine the freshmen from my school giving dating and sex advice, and it’s just plain weird. I also “dated” around the time I was 13, and I hate myself whenever I look back at it lol"
6472,Wait if ur 16
6473,"Neither, I’d guess I’m about average. Just not really comfortable sharing my exact age."
6474,"I prefer not to think about it because it doesn’t change anything, anyways I wouldn’t be too worried about younger people, it’s more the older people. A lot of the questions here seem like questions a teenager would ask so I think personally most of us aren’t lying. But I wouldn’t get too worried."
6475,Let’s save the questions we don’t want answered for when they can no longer be postponed
6476,Ye ik
6477,Age is just a number
6478,and jail is just a room
6479,"Yeah it's normal, I had friends my age but I liked hanging around the older guys. I gradually came to like the kids my age better because of stuff being more in common. But essentially, it is normal"
6480,that was the case with me a few years ago. Until now actually. Yes it's strange but you do what you got to do
6481,It's not illegal if you don't get caught
6482,"My best friend is 25 (and married), one of the reason’s he is my best friend is cuz he’s my crush’s brother"
6483,Not really. Everyone who's older has graduation and the friends my age are all close
6484,"Jail is just a room. Jail is a holding facility while you’re on trial. Once you’re convicted, you go to prison, where you really don’t want to drop the soap"
6485,I find most of my friends are two years younger to  2 years older. Just depends on the acticity or what group I'm hanging out with.
6486,how else im a supposed to clean my penis i usually slide it along the shaft.
6487,"i find that people a year or two older are the sweet spot, any older and it gets weird to hang out with them and their intentions can get murky. and i feel like we don’t have enough in common anymore"
6488,I mean I got adult friends at work but I don't generally think they are better.
6489,"I do but only cus I’m a choir kid and we only got like 10 guys (5 are seniors) but as long as you like hanging out with em, go for it"
6490,[deleted]
6491,I'd say the reason for that is prob cuz ur 13 and a lot of ur friends are prob immature and can be annoying at times. It all just depends on ur age and the ages of the he people around u
6492,"we gigachads, y'all are practically toddlers. it makes 
sense, y'all know the heirarchy

jk but really you might prefer it because older teenagers may have more confidence."
6493,A majority of my friends are older than me in age and grade. And tbh it’s gunner to hang out with them than my same grade friends
6494,Unfortunately the judge didn't see it the same way
6495,Yea. When I was a freshman I became friends with some seniors. ‘‘Twas cool. Got to visit them in college the other week
6496,I prefer hanging out with people 50+ years older
6497,I like hanging out with kids younger than me. Lmao
6498,"Strange? No. I hang out with people decades older than me. I can't connect to almost anyone my age. I much prefer older adults. And if it's online, they largely will never know that I'm a teen. One of my friends I game with online was shocked to see I was 14 when I revealed it to him."
6499,"Sometimes I hang out with my sister and her friends (5 boys, she's not interested with them and they are a lot firends) and I have lot of fun"
6500,"I can be friends with anyone who is 12 and older. Little kids are ok, I am not great with them when it comes to teaching and schooling (I worked as an apprentice ski instructor with 3 4 and 5 year olds, it is was the shittiest job yet.)"
6501,I like chilling with people younger and older than me because for some reason they are more easy to talk to
6502,"Yeah, I think freshmen especially like hanging out with upper classmen because they subconsciously look up to up to them (literally and figuratively)."
6503,"It's the exact opposite for me. A lot of my friends are several years younger than me. Some more than 3 years or older. Me and you'd be great friends. lol.

I don't know why it is like that though."
6504,I am sometimes with my uncle who is 3 years older and his friends it is much better than kids my age
6505,Yeah it's totally normal. My two best friends are 1.5 and 3 years older than me.
6506,"One of my managers(he's sadly leaving soon tho) is a really cool dude. He's 21 but always have a good time talking about Baseball, Football, Basketball, and Comics. He doesn't talk down to me like another manager who's about his age"
6507,"Since you’re talking about porn, no it’s not racist at all. I think you’re right even."
6508,"No of course not. that porn is racist imo. A lot of porn sexualizes different races, black men, Asian girls, Latinos really one of the worst things about porn besides it’s addictive nature and setting false sexual expectations"
6509,"Thank you for understanding :) and yes I agree, I believe it reinforces negative generalisations of people as a whole but I feel black men in particular are affected by it"
6510,"Jesus, like I said its happened to my black friends too and i just feel so bad for them"
6511,Kinda similar to what your saying I'm a white guy dating a black girl people make jokes that I have a big dick because I date a black girl or just flat out ask me how big it is it's racist and makes me uncomfortable.
6512,[Porn is racist. (SFW)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/fyxs1h/interracial_porn_helped_me_realize_how_disgusting/)
6513,Pretty much anything that's become popular in porn is generally questionable
6514,"And if you don't meet the expectations of having a big dick and you're black, it'll make you feel insecure because of all the generalizations that caused this. Wow, that's incredibly fucked."
6515,"Risky click of the day

^(but an interesting read tbf)"
6516,I agree with this
6517,"""I see it absolutely everywhere and it just makes me think ""is this the ONLY interracial relationship that people actually see?"" because I never tend to see white M/black F or black M/middle eastern F in the main page unless I specifically search for it.""

I've also dated latina and black women so I'm pretty sure I like mixed couples :)"
6518,God that sounds horrible :( also the fact that white men are made to look like they have small penises and can't satisfy a woman in the kind of videos I described is also really degenerative and racist
6519,what are you doing step-bro? ;))
6520,Right but i imagine your comment probably didnt help for any insecurities that they might have
6521,"Yeah that kind of porn is actually racist cuz it reinforces the stereotype of black men having ""bbc"" as their only worth, which is bad"
6522,"Nah I dont hate the concept, i hate how that specific relationship type is pushed forward at the expense of other mixed race relationships. I also hate how that pushing forward fetishises black men, which you're right about"
6523,"It depends on how you phrase it. If you come off as having a problem with the *concept* of a black man and a white woman being together, yikes. But there is an argument to be made that the popularity of this genre fetishizes black men in the same way that a lot of white men fetishize Asian women, which you could argue is a negative thing."
6524,"That’s a pretty good post, says what I wanted to say but better than I could say it."
6525,"You are absolutely right, this is just one of many ways porn negatively impact society and sustain stereotypes. Just think about the ways porn portray women in general, think about how it normalize violent sex and rape, how it objectifys women."
6526,"Yeah that's true, I stick to amateur for that reason"
6527,"That was a really good post, really thought provoking! I may just start posting the link to it on PH videos that the post describes"
6528,No
6529,"Porn is very very racist. It is that way because it's easy to be. It's simple. It's easy to cater to people by categorising people by their skin colour. If you're looking for a type of woman you can search for redhead, blond, skinny, teen, milf _or ebony_. There is no 'white' category in porn because it's the default. If you're black and in porn, there's one category you're getting put in, ebony.

And for men it's even worse. You can be in two types of films, interracial, and ghetto street bangers. Could you be in a nice romantic scene where your race isn't mentioned? No. It's a fetish, it must be capitalised on. And you will only ever be described as 'BBC'. Doesn't matter if you're old, young, fat, glasses, tattooed. If you're a black man, you're BBC.

You're not racist for criticizing porn."
6530,"Nah it isn't racist. Porn fetishizes black men and treats them like some kind of animal and treats white women like objects. Blacked . com is fucked up. Having racial preferences is fine, but when you have shit like ""MONSTER n\*gg\*r cock DESTROYS white SNOWBUNNY DP gangbang anal gaping"" on the front page of some porn sites then it is fucked up."
6531,And down you go
6532,It's pretty clearly implied that she meant every guy she talkes to *about their dicks*
6533,"Not racist at all. I don’t like how fetishized it’s become, it puts pressure on black men to have horse cocks and be ultra dominant during sex."
6534,Not to mention incest in some cases!
6535,I think not

I’ve always been on the low spectrum of friends but I’m trying this year to meet new people, so far it’s pretty good, haven’t really hung out with these new friends yet but I’m getting there. Also, I may get a girlfriend in like 18 days (her parents don’t want her dating until she’s 16 and her bday is December 30, and I really like her)"
6628,"Lol same

I went to a new school because I graduated the last one (german system) and made a bunch of new friends in the first year. I hang around with my group since the start of 11th grade and I'm now in 12th. But they kind of exclude me :(
Like, I can't sit with them anymore because there was a table with three seats and we are four. Because they were in class before me they decided to just together and I'll have to sit in the next row.
It's not like they don't talk to me anymore, or they don't like me anymore, but it feels like they enjoy themselves more without me"
6629,"who cares if people have more friends than you, you just need good friends"
6630,Hell yeah
6631,Yes all the time
6632,"Even though I have had teachers that somewhat facilitate socializing in the class, no matter how well I am hitting it off with someone it never starts a friendship

Most of my friends come from meeting through out of school activities like theater"
6633,this couldn’t describe what i go through more. i’m so social in class but once the class is over i’m back to being alone and it sucks because i really thought i’d made a new friend to hang out w
6634,I've always made long friends due to regular out of school activities. It's so much easier when you aren't just limited to the school environment to make friends.
6635,"School system in Austria works differently, we don't have classes individually organized by subject, the teachers come to our classroom and we're a fixed group of people. 

But I failed 2 years of school so i met 3 different classes in the same grade, I only talk to a quarter of my old classmates"
6636,"I went to five different schools. This happens nearly every single time. A lot of times people talk to you as a formality friendship isn't the goal, and so you never see them again. And then sometimes you were a good friend to that person, but they gravitate to the most popular people because they are new and don't want to become outcasts. Makes them forget about people."
6637,Congrats on the last part!
6638,Well I make “class friends” where it’s people to talk to in classes I don’t have any other friends in so I just stick to people I know a bit already or people that are extroverted and started talking to me. After that year if I don’t have those people in another class chances are I’ll barely ever talk to them again except maybe a hello if I see them in the hall.
6639,This happens a lot
6640,Its actually kind of reverse for me i dont think that im gonna make any new friends then i make like 3 new ones
6641,I don’t even have friends :p

We have netflix shows that we watch together while eating and we always play COD together(he defends in capture the flag). I tell him all about my love life and school, he tells me all about his love life and work. He does not limit me in any way just warns me if i'm doing something wrong because he knows that i'll listen to his advice and take care of myself. He is honestly all that i could ask for.

My mom lives abroad with my father-in law, she comes every once in a while but we always speak over the phone. I love her and she's awsome."

6664,"Me in a nutshell, I can't trust my parents with anything. I've had a lot of shit in my life recently, from depression to self harm. They know very little about what's going on. I got a girlfriend almost three weeks ago and they don't even know she exists. It's great what they do for me, but I wish they would stay out of my business, and let me do me without interference. I can't even hang out with friends on the weekend without telling my mom: how long I'll be gone, who I'm with, where we're going, and parents phone numbers in some cases. I've resorted to sneaking away now, because I can't trust them to let me have some privacy about what I'm doing."

6669,Dude get some recordings of it happening and report it to the police. If you get it right you can make it so that your dad has custody rights instead of your mum and you could possibly try not seeing her at all
6670,"uno reverse her, say she's being disrespectful for not listening to your side"
6671,Dad is dead and I never knew him do that. Relationship with mom is great. Some would argue she's a awful parent because on the surface it looks like she doesn't care because of how Little sh butts in my life. But she's always there if you need her. And if things get bad. She'll butt in to help fix it.
6672,"I do that too, sort of. Not because I have a bad relationship with my parents, but if I’m like in the living room all the time they’d be like « you shouldn’t be eating that » or « why aren’t you working » or just asking me random questions even when I’m doing something important"

When Im not learning this dam stuff (get it), collect all of the friendly dogs (especially the not neutered ones) I can and make them mine. Become the pack leader. Teach them to hunt with me and bring them everywhere with me. 

When done that, start the gardens. Spend a week building wooden boxes (no lid), fill with soil and start planting food. Then stock up on all of the canned goods and shit.

6743,Probably don't do that if anything happens they won't know where you are.
6744,They don’t understand that you can be just friends with someone of the opposite gender. Usually I lie when I go to a girls house to avoid their comments and today I made the mistake of telling the truth.
6745,"They don’t assume, but they like to tease me about it, I’d go someplace with a group of people, and they’ll ask who’s going, and as soon as I mention a girls name they’re like “oOoOh Seobulmai’s hanging out with a girl!”"
6746,"I mentioned I had a really shitty day yesterday cuz two of my guy friends got into a big fight and it was really draining cuz I had to counsel both of them about it and the whole mess took half my day.  It also had to do with a girl that one of them has a crush on and has been pushing his friends away for, so after I finished my mom started teasing me about having mentioned boys and I said that made me really uncomfortable, then my mom said, ""You talking about boys makes *me* very uncomfortable.""  Like how??  I'm not the one they have crushes on"

Not only does it condition you to lie, you also more often than not will thus impact your relationship with them."

6768,"Not quite, but my mum can’t get it into her head that it’s possible (and for the most part quite likely) to get rejected.

6779,I live on a farm and work on it. I can assure you 100% that all the bullshit about us running round with guns and killing all the animals is NOT true at all. Firstly it is illegal to do so and you have to go to a registered slaughter house. Also the process is completely painless for the animal. Finally we don’t just send all our animals to slaughter we only send the fatter ones. I would say only about 5-10% of that years lambs actually go to slaughter.
6780,I mean i don't really care... If I'm stranded on an island and i have to kill something to eat I'll do it without hesitation.. If u tell me kill something for fun.. I ain't doing that shit
6781,No kidding I would want to nuke every insect in the world
6782,"Mine is and I can say that I feel bad, but they taste super nice so all guilt disappears with a kat kebab"
6783,"How is shooting a cow inhuame? If it's bred for food, treated well (enough space to live, good food) then I see no problem. Also a quick bullet to the head isn't very painful since it will kill the cow instantly. ""Just to eat their meat"" humans require protein and not everybody wants to resort to beans. Sorry if I seem aggressive, you just sound pretentious as fuck."
6784,Depending on what you specialize in. There’s a huge difference between euthanizing a dog with an aggressive tumor and slaughtering a cow in an inhumane way just to eat their meat.
6785,"""entitled sociopath"" 95% of people eat meat, so are we all sociopaths who show no empathy? Cows aren't going to become doctors or lawyers, I am against cruel treatment but this is the circle of life. There is nothing wrong with eating meat. I am convinced that you are a pretentious twat. I was going to try to be polite but you are an asshole! ""fill my arteries with death carcasses"" are you listening to yourself?  The vast majority of humans eat meat, and we did for a long time and we live. I love animals, I ride a horse and I have 4 cats. I apologise if I was ignorant about the bean thing but not everybody is going to want to stop eating meat, especially if we were doing it for a long ass time. Finally, you say if I want to eat meat I can keep on going but you say it in such a condescending way. I was polite in my reply but you are just a dick. Fuck you"
6786,I've killed a few animals. Actually pulling the trigger isnt much different than shooting a target. Idk if I could do it like at a slaughterhouse.

6793,"Here where I live we need to get the animals checked for illnesses first and if the tests come back ok, we kill them ourselves.

For pigs, we usually kill them by hitting them with a big hammer or an axe on the back of their head. If they are still alive, hit again. 

For chickens, we just catch them and chop their heads off. 

If you have empathy for the animal, you just suck it up and do it."
6794,"You fit the vegan archetype of look at me I'm a vegan and I'm above you all. Which is an overall douchy way to express yourself, while you are acting like a saint towards animals you are aggressive and ignorant towards humans which makes you worse than a meat eater in my opinion cus what you eat isn't a personality trait (something that is missconsepted by a lot of the vegans I have encountered on the internet, not all, just the majority)"

6818,I wish I had coins to give you a gold or platinum.
6819,"Yeah, we do. We lack confidence because of the values and standards forced on us by our parents and society. It would be a whole lot easier for the girl to make the first move because of that. It depends on the guy, but most guys would like it if you made the first move."

6827,"I mean, guessing the future isn't great. You can be surprised"
6828,Yes very much
6829,Tbh I personally could not make the first move because my parents don't let me date. I would rather anyone say they like me so I know if it's that I'm expected to make the first move or I'm just that dislikable. Even if it's someone I absolutely dispise cause I can just say no.

6868,"shit that was deep

as deep as i was un your mom"
6869,"if he's dating a girl, I don't think he's gay lmao"
6870,"Lmao, I certainly don’t moan loudly when farting but I act gay with my guy friends. I mean who doesn’t love to tell their friends they be looking like a snacc. So he’s probably not gay, I know many people who act gay with their friends, it’s just friendly banter."
6871,HAHAHA the way you described this
6872,he must be fun at parties
6873,"Sorry ma’am, but yes he is gay. According to your testimony he shows all the signs of a budding homosexual. I’m a certified homologist and have been studying gay men for years. 
 
One of the telltale signs is moaning during the passing of gaseous excrement, as the gay man is releasing his gay pheromones to attract other potential gay mates. The moaning is also part of the process, as there is not only a chemical communication but verbal as well.
 
As for the “spank me daddy” behavior, my hypothesis is that he is courting his fellow males. Testing their gayness, a gay litmus test if you will.
 
I’m sorry you have to hear this heartbreaking news so suddenly, but your boyfriend is unequivocally, absolutely a homosexual. My recommendation for the next course of action would be to twist the penis 50 degrees clockwise, this should reset him to being asexual, then twist it another 80 degrees counter-clockwise to turn him straight. The effects will not be immediate, but within 5-8 days you should see some changes in his behavior."
6874,Yeah lol my boys do anal on me and we kiss on the lips frequently. My gf finds it weird but I’ve told her several times it’s just boys being boys 🤣🤣🤣
6875,As deep as i was in ur dad
6876,That's a bit gay ngl. My friend fingers our asses and kisses our hands sometimes so you ain't that high on the sus scale.

6881,Yeah
6882,Gottem
6883,This
6884,Gay dudes don't moan when they fart.
6885,"Honestly can’t tell if you’re joking or if you’re genuinely worried about your boyfriend being homosexual and think asking a bunch of horny teens with terrible senses of humour is your best bet on getting an answer, but no, gay people typically do not get pleasure from farts or ask their friends to spank them.

It sounds like he’s just messing around. If he were gay, I’m sure you’d know."
6886,This is fucking amazing (also please twist my cock)
6887,Nah he's not gay. He's just messing around. It's more common than you'd think lol
6888,"Lmao this, I cant reply because of the boys only flair but yes he's just messing around, some straight guys do that"
6889,He kinda sounds like me just...the calmer version of me
6890,I'm not gay and i do stuff sorta like this i think its fine
6891,"He's just enjoying it, most probably not gay... If you're not that sure and if it's okay... Ask him in person 🤔"
6892,Oh I actually know the answer to this! Gun reloading seems sexy because firing guns is seen by the body as sexy because during the act of firing a gun your body releases a hormone called oxytocin which is a bonding hormone released during sex as well.
6893,Like a car with a really nice exhaust*
6894,Guy with M1903: stares
6895,Wait it doesn't turn you on? Weird... 👀

My favorite probably is a double Barrell shotgun reload cause for some reason I love the sound and feel of the shells being ejected then slid into the barrel."
6920,"For real tho....kinda like how some noises make you feel the tingles in ASMR but guns reloading are just satisfying for some reason. Tbh, I wanna buy a gun just so I can reload it and listen to the sounds."
6921,does that mean a hot person reloading a gun would be double sexy?
6922,Honestly I just cringe at the sight of people holding hands. I get somewhat jealous seeing all these young couples with interesting conversations and lives. Eh I got no girlfriend and I feel like I don't fit in with most people because I haven't done anything interesting with my life yet. Sure I've been to a million concerts but no one cares about that
6923,"There isn't a set age that people are expected to have date by, the universe has gifted you with time to mature and know yourself better than they would at that age, so when you do (and you will i promise) meet someone you will be true to yourself and more self reliant in the fragile dance of love!

also realise the insecurities you will face while dating might just be so much crazier than just being lonely, we are designed to be lonely and if you view it in the right way it is a healthy thing which can help shape a wiser ego"
6924,Yeah man i can relate
6925,bro i cant do it anymore
6926,"This entire thing is basically me. I'm in the exact same boat at 16, and I honestly don't think I'll even have a girlfriend anytime soon; but I don't let it bother me, and instead I focus on other things."
6927,"Its alright man, 18 isnt old im sure you will get one soon"
6928,Well if it comforts you not all 14-15 year olds are like that because i feel just like you but im only about to turn 16
6929,If it makes you feel better those relationships aren't gonna last anyways
6930,Don’t do stuff on the basis that it’ll be interesting for other people to hear. Do stuff because you enjoy it(with all the responsibility that it entails).
6931,"You know what additionally sucks? I have a gf. But she lives like really really far, so then it’s not possible to meet and seeing couples makes me super duper sad.."
6932,im already 16 and i feel the same. my little brother (13) has a gf and i dont :(
6933,Keep your chin up fam
6934,"Dude it’s all right, same case here but I’m content. Personally I don’t believe these relationships at 14-15 actually last. As long as you have healthy encounters with both sexes it’s just fine."
6935,fuck man I thought it was just me. i feel you
6936,"*not to sound all self pity and stuff*

dude crying in ur room and being a little bitch is your wake up call. no one is gonna want someone who gets sad at the thought of not having a girlfriend

hit up r/fitness and read the side bar, get big and approach more people. no girl is ever gonna approach you, you need to approach them"
6937,I meant they dont last but they still get to hold hands and stuff im only 15 but i feel like im gonna be in ops situation im 3 years and it saddens me
6938,Its alright man im sure you'll get one soon. 18 is still young
6939,"Oof, thats gotta be even harder. Luckily i am the youngest so i dont have to deal with that"
6940,Oof to you bro
6941,"right to them feelings, buddy.."
6942,"Idk, at first it's depressing but for me personally I've developed an ability to not give 2 fucks. Whatever negative feelings I experience, I just ignore the fuck out of it"
6943,"I’m very lonely, but if I see a couple in public laughing or having fun, it makes me smile. I rarely show a smile so I feel corny when I do it"
6944,I’m not as old as you but I too have never dated anyone. Hopefully our patience will pay off
6945,Same
6946,[deleted]
6947,Yeah same I try and focus on keeping myself happy above other people just so I don't go crazy. Hence why I do most things by myself because no one else is available or will do anything with me. Just means they miss out on the fun not me
6948,Or whenever you see someone so depressingly out of your league
6949,"Same here.

But I just haven't found anyone that I would really fall in love with so I'm not gonna rush it for no reason. 

We'll see I guess."
6950,"Yeah same. It makes me wish someone liked me in that way, and makes me regret not living while I was young. I mean sure, I’m still pretty young, but it feels like I’ve wasted the past 2 or 3 years of my life by isolating myself, and that’s time I’ll never get back."

7011,Even now it’s still the funniest shit
7012,"Give it, he would like it as you made the effort even if he may not really use it"
7013,[deleted]
7014,Exactly a personal touch adds so much to a gift so I’m sure he will love it.
7015,"honestly, if someone i cared for gave me a literal bowl of piss, i'd be happy with it.

if my gf gave me a gift, any gift, i'd take it."
7016,But if she gives you a breakup text?
7017,If my (nonexistent) bf gave me a gift I would take that shit
7018,"Imo you should just give it to him. He'll most likely still appreciate that you thought about it and worked on it too. I'm not a guy, but I just saw that there were no replies."
7019,Did you not hear?
7020,"well i'm glad it did, jake."
7021,"I am a guy, he’ll definitely appreciate it because it’s a personalized one of a kind switch cover being gifted from his gf."
7022,Give it to him. The fact that he doesn’t need it doesn’t mean he doesn’t want it. If someone gave me a 12 inch iPad Pro I wouldn’t need it but I’d definitely take that straight away
7023,this made me laugh!
7024,Good job connecting the thots man!
7025,It’s the thought that matters
7026,Accept a gift from the boyfriend you can obtain
7027,Yes absolutely give it
7028,Oh yeah he would 100% use that
7029,He's gonna love it; give it to him!
7030,Of course I would
7031,Yeah
7032,I’d take anything my gf have to me
7033,"Anything my girlfriend would get me, I'd accept it wholeheartedly. And use it."
7034,"The only gifts we don't want are generic things, unless if those said generic things are things we need.

Since you say you've added personal flavoring to the case you got, you should totally give it to him. Hands down, probably the coolest thing I've ever heard a girl do for her boyfriend at this age range.

Good job!"
7035,"Give it to him, I am sure he will appreciate the effort you put in."
7036,Even if he doesn’t “want” it he will appreciate the effort
7037,Happy cake day!
7038,"I mean…facts, but irrelevant facts"
7039,Oh! Ok
7040,Can someone explain?
7041,"Yayy! I totally would, to make him feel good for giving me a present"
7042,yeah all the time and it honestly doesn’t bother me too deeply. i have friend groups that are like that and i also have friend groups where everyone cares deeply about me
7043,"That's my entire existence. I've decided that I'm most certainly a background character. It'd kinda suck if I got taken out of the plot, but in the end, all anybody cares about are the protagonists."
7044, why are you describing me right now why are you spying on me.
7045,same. i was like the number one hired background cast. i did have 2 people who became my best mates though
7046,Lucky
7047,Oh good I’m going into my freshman year and I thought it was going to be the same
7048,bruh that’s me all the fucking time
7049,"Speaking from my recent realization, this is probably a sign that your friend group finds you hard to approach, or they think you're disinterested in hanging out with them. You just need to be more engaged in conversation with them and be more friendly and honest."
7050,"Same tho, I only have one or two real friends, the rest are really just acquaintances"
7051,Ha imagine having *multiple* friends
7052,yeah. I was invited to a double date without knowing it was a double date and they didn't think for a second how it would affect me. I still have nightmares about it
7053,happy cake day dude
7054,Yeah man this was my life all the way through middle school and into high school. I have a few friends now who I never initiate bcuz every time I do they are busy with and only want to hang out like once a wk :/ at least I’m working and have smt to fill the other time

7060,"Absolutely

It sucks but I began to realize that ultimately we all got shit going on in one way or another and sometimes it’s up to us to deal with our own stuff. It’s important to have support, sure, but at the end of it all we’re the ones who need to fix our own issues."
7061,Not really.
7062,I second that
7063,Oh that sucks. I'm sorry :(
7064,"it changed for me since i got a few new friends and joined a sport with some old friends i knew from before.

7071,I feel like this all the time
7072,a genuine interest in me (even I don't have an interest in me so it's kinda not possible)

7103,That is awesome! I already give breaks but I will start doing the comedy videos if I can find some good ones on YouTube. Thank you!
7104,Lol that is a great way to describe it. I am not the teacher who thinks I should be best friends with all the students because that really isn't the best support but I think empathy over punishment and having a relaxed authority vs a strict authority work well with teenage students.
7105,Maybe show them why the things they learn is important
7106,Having a small portion half way through class to just breath can be very relieving for me.
7107,"Comedy sketches is a 50/50 in my opinion, starting every class with a sketch can be fun for some people while annoying the hell out of someone else"
7108,"Based. 

But, if they give you shit tho don’t give them leeway. That approach can often work great but if you have any serious troublemakers it’s best to lay the law down fast and hard. Usually you just need to do that once and they won’t give you any more trouble beyond that. But give them an inch and they’ll take you a mile.

Saw it happen last year with one of my younger teachers. She was ridiculously nice but some of the troublemakers managed to get away with a lot because of it and it harmed the study environment for the good kids.

Like I said tho, still a great mindset and attitude to begin with and I think it’ll work great, this is just a piece of advice."
7109,"This is excellent advice across the board. I care a lot about my students and it is hard to feel so disconnected from them, even though I think remote learning is the best for public safety. I miss being in a classroom and making students laugh, seeing new learning,and connecting with struggling teens

I will definitely do the recording things, I already do sometimes but I will do it across the board now, thank you for the feedback"
7110,"I think this is really important. 

I Second this."
7111,What lesson and what level of education do you teach in?
7112,"I say one way to make studying great is Kahoot or Quizizz(I dont know if I spelled that right). I say that because, for me, it's a fun a kind of competitive study guide, and it actually helps me.

I also say encourage participation. I'm a student that doesn't like to get called on much, and I do forget some things that my teachers say most of the time.

One last thing. If a student feels out of it, dont make him or her do anything. Sometimes, we just have days were we dont feel like ourselves, and if someone says something off, we might just snap. So, if a student looks off, just dont call on him/her."
7113,"I am resource room so I work with young adults with disabilities ages 14-18 is all of major subjects  (math, English/Language Arts primarily, but I love to do as much science, music, and art that I can)"
7114,"Got it! I try to do frequent breaks and check in emotionally with students as whole as allowing stretching, exercising etc"
7115,"Real life context is incredibly important to me but this is a great reminder. I love hands on learning and it is harder to do science experiments with remote learning, which bums me out"
7116,"It is important to learn to say, ""I seventh this"" or you will get downvotes on reddit.

How did I do with connecting my teaching to real consequences? Lol"
7117,I agree with this. Teenagers and especially teenage boys can be ruthless when it comes to young teachers. You deserve respect as a teacher so don't let them fuck with you.
7118,"I liked it when my english teacher asked as to tell the class what we did the day before. This made the whole class get to know each other very quickly.

Also she spent 15% of class time talking about nonsense and it was a huge breather from grumpy HS teachers."
7119,"1) change your background to something funny

2) when you finish teaching, let them go early. 

3) if you have a smaller class, take time to get a sense of each of their personalities."
7120,"Be nice, tolerant but not too much, encourage them, try to relate to them but not to the point it becomes cringe, just try to be like a friend"
7121,I third this
7122,"Dont try to be cool, and make memes and use words like bruh because that is kinda cringe. Instead try to be sweet and caring and show an interest in you class. That was all :)"
7123,It’s quizizz but u were close
7124,"The way I feel about it is kids with attitudes and anger issues are much less frustrating than the kids who just don't care. When a teen is angry or difficult, it still means they care what I think and crave attention or a reaction. Typically, they want positive attention but have been trained by past teachers and family that they are bad or stupid or not worth it. I used to volunteer weekly at a Juvie and working with kids who have raped, killed etc helped me realize how deeply important it is to connect with troubled youth and be the different voice in their life.

This is my 3rd year teaching, including a year of student teaching, and I had this student who called me (excuse the language) a ""fucking bitch"" within the first week of me working with him last school year. By the end of the year, he loved and respected me. It was very hard but I learned that putting time and tough love into those students is worth it."
7125,"I think it’s sweet that you’re doing this. Most people wouldn’t go online and visit forums just to get an idea of how to better relate to students

Think most people here covered it. Though sometimes one student will be answering a lot of questions and in my experience teachers stop calling on them after a while. Sometimes only one person will feel like participating and that’s alright. Sometimes one person can bring in others. Otherwise, everyone else pretty much covered it"
7126,Post your slides on Google classroom or the class group chat to make studying easier.
7127,I whatever comes after fourth this
7128,"D-do you not know what ""fifth"" is?

Also, I sixth this."
7129,The fact that you’re doing this already shows these kids are going to love you. Just having someone that’s willing to care about them instead of just teach at them means so much.
7130,"I love Kahoot and will check out the other one! Thank you :)

I have some incredibly eager participators and I try not to have them dominate the whole conversation lol.

As far as students having off days, I try to provide balance. I have off days and still have to work, this is the reality of being an adult. So I still have expectations
BUT, I don't require active class participation when I can tell someone is struggling and then I check in one on one. I have made some strong connections this way, young people go through so much and deserve quality education and emotional support. High School was a hard time for me and remembering that makes me a better teacher"
7131,Yeah do fun stuff with them! And it’s an age group where they’re older but the younger ones won’t be mature yet. They’ll mess around a lot probably. You need to be firm but not be too strict cos they won’t like you
7132,"Yes, definitely"
7133,"Yup, all my life and my identity is based around academic acheivement"
7134,"Yeah. I barely hang out with my friends outside of school, I’ve never had a girlfriend before, I’m never invited to parties (do those exist?), & quarantine has definitely put a damper on my plans to hang out with friends."
7135,same my guy just with my sister shes the popular one with all the friends and always going out but im always inside pretty much. hoping the same thing as you in college
7136,this is the mentality i like
7137,Eh teenage years are overhyped in movies.
7138,nah man i’m chillin
7139,">just

Ah yes just"
7140,"I am not a boy, but yes, I relate to this so much. Idk I think it's because of my bad start upon first joining secondary school, because while others were making friends and forming large groups and being invited to places pretty much since they were very young, I was dealing with bullying at the time, my academic successes as I was very bad at my subjects and didn't have the motivation or self esteem to try fix it, and my terrible mental health as a result of these things which was getting worst, so all the socialising stuff wasn't even a priority let alone an opportunity for me. However, as we grew older I didn't really get a lot of chances to practice and the others already formed cliques so making new friends I could hang out with wasn't a possibility, so there that went. But as I have recently been invited to a bit more stuff recently due to changing schools, I have come to realise that I feel so empty and unable to make new friends in social events and I am always so awkward. It just feels like a chore, which doesn't sound like a problem, but I feel as if I am missing out so much, on making a lot of friends and having a great time with them like a lot of others my age seem to have. Like ever since restrictions have eased around my area I see everyone on social media getting together and enjoying themselves while I don't even miss not seeing my friends as much as I should since I haven't seen them since mid March. It makes me feel bad to know that I have such an empty outlook towards friendships that should supposedly mean a lot to me but don't, and while being unsatisfied with my friend circle not having the motivation or the will to make new friends really doesn't help and makes me feel so lonely."
7141,"Got an age flair just to reply to this, but besides from the male part, are you me?"
7142,This. I was the one who declined going to parties because I have to study for high school entrance exams. I missed out so mucc during that period
7143,Yeah I’m in the same situation
7144,User flair checks out!
7145,Shiiit my teensgr moments is just hanging with my friends and not giving a fuck. Even the stress from school is so much more free compared to later and shit. All the other shit like girls and parties. Maaann they'll come to me later. Why chase girls when I can play Mario kart and chill
7146,I think those teen movies you might've watched have really affected the way you picture teenagehood. Most teenagers usually have a pretty normal lifestyle.
7147,"Literally my vibe rn. I never liked trying out new stuff, always assuming it's potentially dangerous. In the end I had almost no fun in my first eight years of school. 

This year I have started high school and I sort of hope I'll get to try all the things I haven't tried out yet, but probably it will just end up as always. ~~I need to get a life.~~"
7148,This is beyond science!

7151,YO My boi be livin' his life
7152,"Some of us have it harder befriending people than others, I've changed 4 schools and 2 kindergartens bcuz of my dad having to move with work, and to cut expenses we (my mom and brother) moved with him wherever he was going, so I never had the chance to settle roots down, get friends, just after 1 or max 2 years of being around people and finally getting to have some buddies and few friends, we had to move, I was young at the time, and didn't mind making more and more friends but lately in high school I just couldn't find people to fit in with, as they already had friends since childhood and went to the same school for a decade. Currently I have 2 best friends (an awesome girl, classmate, she is the best person I've met) and a boy 2 years younger than me who I've been playin video games with, and that about sums up the people that like me... So yeah, I just hope I'll turn out as a normal adult, and wish the best luck to other people who are having a hard time getting friends (European here, sry for bad English)"
7153,Screw experiences imo.  I'm perfectly happy being a single shut in virgin
7154,"You not alone man. Just hang on, good shit will find you"
7155,I blame Disney/Nickeloden sit-coms for some reason they made me think life had all these exciting moments and that they were all memorable and funny or something. Made me feel bad then I woke up from this daydream and realized reality is different.
7156,"Periodt. This is how everyone should be, living them lives in their own pace. I may not have a gameboy and PlayStation in my entire life, I might not have lost my virginity in high school days, I might be missing out on a lot of mainstream tv shows, as long as I'm going forward that's a-ok."
7157,"> when I can play Mario kart and chill 

Hell yeah bro"
7158,"i don't think trying ""potentially dangerous"" things is living a good life tbh."
7159,"boi u 15 gj on already investing in stocks, congrats to you 👏👏👏"
7160,"Yea same. I went through a phase where I was upset because teen life wasn't all parties, relationships and sneaking out like portrayed in those movies but eventually I realised that they were movies made to entertain and how entertaining would a movie about a kid who stays at home playing video games be?"
7161,I wish I was invited to parties. I'm not even sure if people have parties where I live...
7162,Username checks out
7163,"yessir, although not just in the shower but i do think about it"
7164,Nah all I do in the shower is explain my opinions to imaginary people (and jack off sometimes)
7165,Those imaginary people must be scarred seeing you go from talking to jacking off
7166,Bruh thats all i think about when im taking a shower lol. I just fantasize about how great a relationship would be. *shower cuddling does sound real good*
7167,Yeah I mean obviously this is a constant thought but for me showers are the biggest vibe
7168,[deleted]
7169,"Ah, a fellow r/teenagers veteran. Glad to see you made it out alive"
7170,Honestly man the shampoo bottles are always there for me when I need to rant
7171,"Yeah it rly does sound good ngl

And wet"
7172,"Yeah, but for me (semi-long distance relationship. Within driving distance but not old enough to drive), it’s more like, “shit, I wish she were with me and I could just hold her rn, or lay on her lap, or exchange mutual words of affection.”"
7173,Both of you would be getting wet so I guess that would be hot
7174,^yes
7175,Not really
7176,"Why would you need someone to give you a home?

7179,"I mean, not really in the shower. I’m too busy trying not to look down at my body to focus on anything else lol. But sometimes I guess"
7180,Yeah man existence is pain

at least not in the shower"
7182,Hell yeah bro
7183,"Harsh, but good one."
7184,Not really

7186,We don't kink shame here
7187,Pretty uh... Specific... Uh... Dude are you okay?
7188,"Well, I wish I could cuddle my bf but he lives several states away"
7189,"To be honest though, I don't think you're ever going to be completely content with yourself for any more than a few hours at a time. Like I think people become obsessed with the idea that they'll get to some point of self-improvement and then they'll be good enough, but its worth recognising that everyone is a work in progress until they die.

I'm not saying that you should ignore self-improvement and rush into a relationship, but everyone should know that you don't need to be perfect or even particularly good to deserve love. 

Maybe this isn't your mindset at all, but I know too many people that think this was so I thought it was worth saying."
7190,True that
7191,lmaoo

7213,Yet another thought to cringe at
7214,"today I thought ”I’m too lazy to shower, I’ll rather snooze 10 more minutes and do it tomorrow, it’s corona and I won’t come close to anybody the whole day”.

Arrive at school and instantaneously greet a girl with a hug. FML."
7215,Does anyone else ever NOT cringe at their own thoughts?
7216,"yea, idk what that dude is even thinking half the time lmao"
7217,"Dude , if you knew what kind of thoughts I have. You will realise what is the definition of cringe."
7218,yeah... often i’ll be doing math homework or something and my brain will go 7*6=36 and i’ll just stare at a wall and think about what a dumbass i am
7219,Yeah. Something I’m still working on is not making jokes every time because my jokes tend to be pretty fucking stupid lol.
7220,yeah man I get PTSD from all the crazy shit I've done and thought
7221,Kinda. And when it's cringe I hope that no one who can read my thoughts is reading mine
7222,"depends, if it’s mild acne it’s all good but if your face is red and covered in it, it’s kinda unattractive. just my opinion though, everyone has acne at our ages"

7228,"I mean, I guess it depends how much acne she has ig"
7229,I have minor acne. Complaining about it would be hypocritical.

7244,facts
7245,Never gave a fuck about acne
7246,Indeed.
7247,Fax as a guy with acne I know it’s kinda something you can’t really prevent so I don’t mind of a girl has it
7248,Acne will pass anyway so even if it's bad it won't affect you for long and most guys won't care too much but if they do there shallow so don't worry about it.
7249,^facts
7250,What u/not-siam said
7251,"What about guys with acne? Still the same? Tbh I don't notice if people have acne unless they try to cover it up with makeup and it goes blotchy, then I just feel sorry for their skin"
7252,Idk about other people but I prefer small boobs ngl.. like I don't really care about appearance (I care mostly about personality) but when it comes to preference I'm team small boobs all the way.
7253,"Honestly some girls think short is cute so it's good to be short. I'm 5'1"" by the way but I don't care about my height. My crush is like 5'6"" but that doesn't matter because I like it when the girl is taller and she thinks that me being short makes me even more adorable. Some people just love short and maybe you haven't met the right people yet"
7254,It can be annoying to be mistaken for someone like 1 or 2 years younger but I agree on the being picked up thing. I'm like 44kg and my crush once spun me around while hugging me and my heart died it was awesome. Also I wasnt expecting it lol. Another advantage is hugging tall girls. If you know you know
7255,"I knew this one kid who was 5’2 and was the best dudebro ever. Another chick in our class was at least 6’0, drop dead gorgeous and on the volleyball team... they dated for a year and a half. I wish I could express my jealousy in words.

I’m not short myself, so I can’t offer my personal experience, but from what I’ve seen through friends it doesn’t seem to be worth pulling your hair out over it. If looks really were everything, then natural selection would’ve bred out short people a long time ago.

TL;DR: Don’t let your height define you, I’m sure what you have on the inside is much more unique."
7256,"Wait seriously? I never knew people like you existed!!! 

WHAT SPECIES ARE YOU

CAN YOU GET ONE OF YOUR KIND TO LOVE MEEEEEEEEEEE"
7257,"Yessss short is really cute! My crush is like 2 inches shorter than me, I think short is adorable"
7258,"I'm about the same height and believe me ik what it's like. You need to look at the positives. When was the last time you hit your head on anything? About the partner thing, you'll grow."
7259,“The equivalent in height in girls is boobs basically” ... 6’2 boobs? *i’LL TAKE EM*
7260,"Sorry, I'm one of a kind.."
7261,"Just embrace it, if people are assholes tell them they're assholes. If it's teachers remind them that such conduct can get them fired from any decent school, and watch your grades go up. If it's other people, take the time to learn to roast a motherfucker."
7262,"Wouldn't it be better being the tall guy to not have to rely on others, so you don't get picked on?"
7263,They're like pillows though lol. When cuddling they're the BEST
7264,I mean I prefer small boobs too but mainly personality
7265,"I know but still, I'm into small boobs"
7266,"Fair, fair.

I do believe too big is a thing though. My personal opinion is that D's are the perfect size (but I'm down for anything between B and DDD)"
7267,"If it helps i was 5'4~ when i was your age and senior/junior year i gained 4~ inches, At your age expect a lil more growth to come"
7268,"Hell no that's one thing I won't stand for. Anything taller than 5""9 and I don't like it"

7274,"You may be right, but I am not growing much, so I'll have to stick to what I have"
7275,"I also go by personality but I’ve never dated because that’s not important.

Right?"
7276,3
7277,"Being short is an advantage. Espesially if you have tall friends.
I've got the tallest guys in the class to be my friends and no one picks on me. Ever."
7278,"He actually might. He mentioned he's 15 and growth plates sometimes don't close until you're about 25. People don't all grow at the same rate, and some take longer to grow even if they grow taller than their peers. I'd incorporate K2 and Vitamin D in the diet. Do what the Dutch do, and eat a bunch of cheese!"
7279,The comment replies say otherwise
7280,I've never dated either I just don't think I'm mature enough yet
7281,4
7282,Where I'm from it is quite well known however the other way round isn't all that uncommon. So I guess It really depends on the setting
7283,It definitely hurts men the most. That’s literally what toxic masculinity is
7284,"Is it acknowledged amongst girls that guys are way more insecure than girls? Unlike girls, we can't talk about how we feel which leads to more and more insecurities that we have to endure. 

Most of us don't even know how to actually make the first move because we never got together with anyone."
7285,I don’t blame you
7286,"It's where masculinity is too much

Examplés: men aren't supposed to show emotion, men aren't supposed to open up, men are supposed to make the first move, etc. Honestly most masculine stereotypes are pretty dumb (or feminine ones for that matter)"
7287,"What’s toxic masculinity, (sorry, all I know about it is that people boycotted Gillette because they caused all men of it)"
7288,"I don’t think ‘guys are way more insecure than girls’ I know guys can be insecure (as can girls) and I’m not disagreeing that their insecurities can be over looked (as can girls). My question wasn’t if it was fair or not, I’m just wondering if it’s a commonly accepted fact or not."
7289,I'm that person who doubts themselves and stuff so this doesn't help
7290,no please do try it makes things so much easier for us
7291,Yeah even as girl im told not to make the first move because i will look boy hunger or a hoe. So i stoped making the first move.
7292,I fucking hate it so much
7293,"So it’s actually expected that we make the first move? They aren’t just scared? If so, they can fuck off then. And come back when they’re willing to try for it.

I always thought they were a lot less likely to because that’s just their instincts and what society has made them used to, not that they were just expecting of us to do it."
7294,"Nope. I can't bring myself to ask out anyone at all and I have a friend who is pretty much the same. He and a girl friend of mine liked each other but he didn't know how to ask her out and he secretly didn't even want a girlfriend but everyone was bugging him to.

Ofc, my girl friend, even tho she dated before, couldn't ask him out even tho she had more experience. Nope, fucking let him do the anxious part with no experience whatsoever because he's a man. A man has to be tough, he has to have hair everywhere, he has to act like a man and it's never about what he wants, but rather what girls want. Ofc.

And I do agree that girls can be very insecure too but at least you can talk about it without being shamed by the society about it every single day for the rest of your life and being called a pussy by your parents :/"
7295,[deleted]
7296,It’s basically how concepts of masculinity is inherently toxic. Like how guys aren’t really expected to show emotion or do anything remotely feminine
7297,"Not necessarily masculinity, but certain points of it. As someone else said, it’s boys not being able to show emotion, or having to make the first move. Masculinity isn’t toxic but certain facets of it are."
7298,"Not sure. It probably is, but fuck that. Girls can make the first move if they want. Makes no difference for me."
7299,Yes but I refuse to make the first move because I’m socially awkward and have a huge fear of rejection
7300,This ^
7301,"Ok I'm sorry. Idk how am I an r/niceguys tho since I'm not thinking a girl owes me sex for being nice but sure r/thewrongfuckingsub or r/lostredditors (whatever you'd like).

But again, if both teams are scared why tf do we have to make the first move. Pretty sure you're more social than us. I seen you girls always talking while we're here only talking when playing in video games. Oh yeah and we don't hug each other.  But that's just generalizing, maybe girls hate each others in other schools, idk. Don't bug us to make first move either way."
7302,Doubt guys would say yes to 99% of girls.
7303,Actually my gf asked me to homecoming
7304,"Then it looks like I’m never getting a girlfriend. 
**Anxiety 100**"
7305,It does but at the same time don't ask a guy out if you run the risk of alienating yourself with your friends
7306,"Society is the world

My dad always calls me pussy every time I do any sort of self-care and I know I'm not the only one. A girl on reddit once commented about this because her boyfriend said no for beauty but it was obvious he wanted to go so she bought him acne soap and he was more than thankful.

Kind of. Everytime I take out a single tear people judge me so now I prefer the shower as everyone else. 

I did interact with people before. Girls are the only ones who show tears at school. 

And no, pretty sure it's not all in my head."
7307,"my dude she meant like, are you aware that this is the stereotype, do you know that traditionally the guy makes the first move. she's not saying it's fair, just asking if we are familiar with the concept."
7308,"Maybe it's just me, but I throw myself at any girl who waves to me in the halls. I'd propose if you made the first move."
7309,"Sadly, yeah. That’s why I always try to make first moves with my boyfriend."
7310,"Despite suicidal intentions being far more widespread among women, up to 4x more men commit suicide in many age groups. I think insecurity is more common in women, but when found in men is more severe, likely due to what you're talking about.

Just food for thought."

7377,"Sounds about right since the ""higher league"" girls usually only date guys above six foot, have a six pack, and play a lot of sports"
7378,"Do you have the link to that?

I wanna read it"
7379,"What, so the guys that are equally attractive as they are? Sounds pretty standard to me. I mean this study makes sense from a biological point of view. Female animals are more selective to create the best offspring but male animals just want to create any offspring but I’m not sure if it still works like that for 21st century humans. So if we’re using that mean rating system and that study, that means a girl who is rated a 2 or 3 is competing for a 9 or 10 guy which just isn’t true. The attractive boy would never date the less attractive girl and she would probably end up with someone similar in looks to her.

Edit: that study is also implying that an 8 or 7 out of 10 man is competing for a 2.2 and below woman which is absolute bollocks."
7380,"I mean... idk... how do you even do a study like that and the conclusion seems very ambiguous. 

First of all, attractiveness is an abiguous thing itself. You can't rate people by attractiveness because, for example, while my girlfriend thinks I'm cute another person thinks that I'm too skinny and whatnot. To my girlfriend I'd be a 8.5/10 and to another person I'd be a 2/10. Same goes for any other person, for both genders. You simply cannot say that one person is more attractive (in the top 20, perhaps) and one is less attractive (bottom 80).

With this, if we go to a personal level, a lady who is in the bottom 22% for one man could be in the top 78% for another. So a study like that would either have to get super personal and time consuming, or it could get the same conclusion from very general means of conducting the study. I wouldn't trust the study unless I knew how they got those conclusions. 

At the same time, I believe it's normal to aim above yourself. I don't consider myself to be very attractive, yet I aimed for a girl who's much more attractive (in my opinion) than I am. To my surprise, she liked me back. So, if we ignore that you cannot rate people by attractiveness, yes. It sounds right that girls go for the top 20%. But I don't believe that guys fight for thr bottom 78%. I think both genders should be about equal."
7381,True
7382,"Bro this ""study"" was done by one guy who supposedly sucks at getting a date, says that there is definitely a research bias, and is obviously salty because he can't get any. Overall, I don't agree this.

Support
- There are more men on dating apps than women. Therefore on apps such as Tindr, which is used as the data source, women are able to be more choosy. 
- Men more interested in non commital sex than women. 
- Women realize they don't have to lower their standards for guys who feel entitled to their attention. Guys who are unattractive to them are far more likely to feel this way. 


Debunk 
- Men prioritize physical looks more than women do. 
- There are more women in the US than men. The 'study' is american.
- There is more societal pressure on women to look nice. So the average girl is likely better looking than the average man, meaning they are not equal on a 1-10 scale, but are equal on a scale that only includes their gender."

7385,"I don't know man, seems kinda gay to me"
7386,Thaaank you
7387,I havent seen the study but it sounds like bs from the title
7388,"Yeah that's what society is looking like. Just imagine a dude saying he only dates girls that have a perfect hourglass figure and are tall (or short), it doesn't feel good. Let's just not body shame anyone"
7389,"Idk if I should believe this, I'd definitely go for average and not top"
7390,"Study shows that babies are naturally attracted to attractive faces. You can conclude that there IS a common definition of beauty to everyone but everyone can choose t change it as they grow up. Moreover when we grow up, the personality enter in the equation. By the way humans ARE animals and we have an archaic brain that physically discriminate some people. (Example :A woman well dressed will get more money for an association than when the same woman would be not as well dressed as before) . Female are attracted to great jawline, straight chin, tall men because their brain analyse it to be a men able to protect her children. Again what I'm saying is common to everyone but there can be some changes around individuals. Men just want to have a posterity."
7391,To be fair even just 2 girls at 15 is pretty decent.
7392,Tbf taking home 2 girls in a year when you're only 15 is pretty much unachievable for most people
7393,"Obviously a nice guy wouldn’t explicitly say that (and neither would a nice girl). But it usually ends up that if that man is very attractive, the girl he ends up with will probably be too and that wouldn’t be the guy being a dick and having a mental checklist of the features the partner has to have, that’s just him being attracted to someone equal to him."
7394,I didn't write the article
7395,That entire study was a insane oversimplification of terribly acquired data that barely even has actual basis. Whether or not people take this to heart it’s a dangerous step towards the kind of incel type stuff you see all over the internet
7396,Holy shit the fact you are getting downvoted for that is hilarious
7397,Your comment is implying that 20% of men are 8s or 7s. I think it's more of a bell curve.
7398,The devs of the universe got bored and just put a 80-20 ratio to everything
7399,This should be higher up.
7400,"Incels use this to motivate their defeatist attitute toward life, basically saying that its hopeless to try and date because ""femoids only go for the chads"". 

It's not a very realistic way of looking at life."
7401,not at all realistic and very sexist
7402,We really do live in a society after all
7403,"Yea, the panic buyers who are scared of shortages are actually the ones causing the shortages that we now have

Stupid bullshit. Like of course, buy as much as you need but you don't need 20 packages of TP"
7404, Yes. 100x yes. Society is too erratic to handle any new potential threat and 5 times out of 10 react worse than the coronavirus reacts to the elderly.
7405,BOTTOM TEXT
7406,it was always that stupid if not worse
7407,"Humans have always done stupid stuff during bad events. It's also in our nature to be sheep, so it's not surprising at all to me that this has happened.

More terrifying? In my opinion it's not really terrifying, but disappointing."
7408,Yes people are acting crazy
7409,"Sure, but the flu is also no longer a serious lingering threat. It just kinda comes and bothers some people every now and then and then pisses off. Of course people with deficiencies in their immune system are at risk of it being more serious, but that's the case with any illness, and we're not getting to a point where we don't have to worry about illnesses any time soon. Same thing is probably gonna happen with the coronavirus."
7410,[deleted]
7411,I’m sure of that
7412,I'm a senior in high school and my school got closed down this week. I'm going to be absolutely livid if my school doesn't have some sort of graduation. I'll be damned if I have to do summer school over this since I have trade school that starts in July.
7413,"I wouldn't say the reaction is ""terrifying"", but it definitely shows some flaws in our behaviour"
7414,Yes. Especially the reaction in the market
7415,"Yes. The virus is bad, but panic buying has made the virus SO much worse for everyone."
7416,"Yes, sinophobia/racism has risen and while I'm not Asian, right wing nuts are definitely going to use it as an excuse to try to enforce stricter immigration laws and there's almost certainly going to be an increase in xenophobia, my friend has lost his job and theatre (one of the few places I feel comfortable in) has shut down. And then there's the effect it'll have on my school work, I'm majorly stressing over my unfinished coursework now. And again on the economy, I worry about what'll happen to people post-quarantine who live paycheck-to-paycheck like I do, Denmark's employed a 75% quarantaine pay rate and I hope other countries follow suit. Shit's not looking great."
7417,If trump tries to keep himself in office indefinitely then that’s when we grab the guns
7418,"Yeah, it’s pretty scary how these people act but I mean, you only have so much space in your basement so once that’s filled up, the basic buying will end"
7419,Yes. I fear riots will come.
7420,"The toilet paper thing is dumb but it's understandable to self quarantine even up to 9 yards, they just don't want to get sick and spread the pandemic"
7421,"YES, every store I go to, there is literally no toilet paper, it's really stupid tbh."
7422,This is exactly what Andrew Cuomo is talking about at this second
7423,"Yes and I hate those people,they're absolutely not helping the situation (especially people trying to turn it to profit)"
7424,Yup it's like in every zombie movie or TV show where the humans are the real danger
7425,"Yea. I swear it's gonna cause more mental trauma than physical trauma. Don't quote me on that bc I probably have no idea what I'm talking about. BUT, it does seem that people freaking out just makes things worse, and if you're stressed out enough, it can lower you're immune system. SO, if you're one of the crazies and get the virus, there is a POSSIBILITY that your immune system is weakened because of stress. 

You're welcome."
7426,"Yes, I agree that some people are overreacting to this. Panic buyers hoarding all of the food and TP just makes the situation worst for everyone else who couldn't buy it at the time, since it means one person has an amount that can last them a year while another person barely has enough to survive daily life with.

Not talking about you in this situation OP, but I believe that the teenagers and adults who believe that there's no problem with the virus and that the common cold should still be aware that the situation is getting worst. Most of the people in this sub has a low chance of death from the virus but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't help flatten the curve of the rate that the virus is spreading. If we all wash our hands, keep basic hygiene like we're supposed to do anyway, and just be aware of our surroundings, this virus wouldn't spread as quickly."
7427,Yesyesyes
7428,"Yeah, I've read a news story about people at grocery stores causing a stampede and trampling a 13 year old because the toilet paper was near the entrance.

Then again, though, people from the hard-hit countries like China and Italy are saying to be prepared and warning us to take it seriously. Trampling children is a terrible extreme, but I can understand where the panic comes from since we're told by some not to worry and by others to worry."
7429,I thought it would be one of those things that people would just brush off but apparently not... some people are irrational as heck
7430,I'm not scared of the virus but I'm scared of there being no food
7431,If this is a test run for an even deadlier virus were in a fuckton of trouble as a society idc where u live
7432,"Be clear, just don't be mean"
7433,"Please don’t text him, either call him or talk to him in person. Clear things up and ask whether he is viewing this as more than friends or not and then tell him you don’t want that."
7434,">Please don’t text him, either call him or talk to him in person.

Agreed. If I got rejected via text, I'ld probably be spiraling from thinking she will be showing the text to everyone she knows at school the next day."
7435,"just tell him you're gay 


_~~^(on a serious note: I think it would be kinda dick move to turn him down like that, I guess.... just go with the flow and see how things go, then try to do something and just try your best not to be mean, okay? I dunno man I'm not some relationship expert or something)~~_"
7436,"If i asked a girl out, especially my friend I would appreciate honesty (so B), but if you don't think he'd take that well I'd recommend option A (the bad side is that he might try searching online or keeping tabs to see if you break up in the future).

Edit: Do what you can via text because of Covid 19, gotta prevent the spread"
7437,"Also, he might not still be 100% sure over text or could take something wrong and think there’s still hope which makes things 10x harder when you’re trying to get over someone."
7438,"Just tell him the truth. You don’t wanna date, but you can stay friends. If it’s too uncomfortable for you, maybe find new friends."
7439,I would just be up front about it. It might hurt his feelings a little but I don’t think there’s any way of doing it that wouldn’t hurt his feelings a little and it leaves no doubt in his mind about how you feel.
7440,Yeah dont do this
7441,Their gender is non binary. They aren’t a boy or girl. They don’t feel like a boy or a girl
7442,for sure
7443,Friendly reminder that sex and gender are different things
7444,Update us
7445,Then talk to him in person. It could make a huge difference and I’m sure you’d like to make it as least painful for him as possible.
7446,They don’t affiliate as a male or female
7447,im not sure about that.. i have some anxiety about phone calls and we don't call each other anyway. i am definitely going to make sure i'm clear but let him down gently
7448,Non binary
7449,"That's the difference between gender and sex. Biological sex of a person may be male, female, or intersex, but their gender identity may be different. Youre right that feelings don't change chromosomes, but it does affect one's gender identity."
7450,You are in every post this sub has lol
7451, i will
7452,"Just tell him, don't make something up. It honestly hurts worse."
7453,"Give him a chance lol, if it’s awkward it’s only like 3 hours at most if it’s fun then good. Nice"
7454,What does nb mean?
7455,Well I’d rather have the person actually talk to me because you can feel the emotion better and you will know that they are being genuine instead of just brushing you off with a text.
7456,What does that mean?
7457,*they
7458,"There is a difference between sex and gender, read a biology book"
7459,i will. it will probably not be that interesting though.. also will take me a few days to build up the strength to do it
7460,"It’s not that I don’t know my identity lol my gender is neither male or female, understood?"
7461,"Sex is chromosomes, gender is what you feel like. Often people have the same gender and sex, but not all of the time"
7462,"Yeah, especially when I get downvoted for something I thought was reasonable :("
7463,No but I’ve gotten used to it I’m always at the bottom :(
7464,gay bottoms don't rise up
7465,its ok dude i accept you for who you are 👉😎👉
7466,I’m straight 😔
7467,Thanks dude i accept you too 👉😎👉
7468,Ouch
7469,"When you post something and someone else steals it and gets like 200x more upvotes than you do. Or even worse, whenever you have a completely original shower thought, but the malfunctioning showerthoughts bot still fucks you in the ass because your post is ""Unoriginal"". Seriously... Fuck that bot. I searched for an hour to find even ONE post that was remotely similar to mine, and I found NOTHING. I didn't violate any of the rules, but the bot still found some way to penetrate my chocolate starfish and take down my post.

Edit: Similar story, but I posted something on cursed comments a few months ago, and not only did it get taken down for ""not being cursed enough"" which I call complete bullshit on, but suddenly clones of my post started popping up with not only WAY more upvotes than mine did, but NONE of them were taken down. At least not instantly, but I was too pissed off to care or check. Before my clones started popping up I contacted one of the mods on that sub and he tried to pass some bullshit like ""Oh your post has to make people question what the hell they just read. It has to shock people."" Which I reluctantly agreed with, but then the fucking clone war started and absolutely nothing happened to those posts! What I should've done is contact the mod team again and asked what the fuck was going on, but like I said I was too pissed off at this point."
7470,Thank you 😉✌
7471,"Petty, I like you"
7472,"Normally I'm not this petty but this situation really pissed me off. Just the fact that I was the first to post that screenshot to cursed comments and the fact that I was the one who was taken down and my clones got off scott free really got to me. Actually now that I think of it resposts aren't even allowed so I'm sure that at least some of them were taken down, but that didn't make me any less upset. I ended up just reluctantly giving up because the mods most likely wouldn't have given two shits anyways if I had messaged them to ask what was going on."
7473,"You can still be a bottom when you’re straight
          ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
7474,Oh shit 😳
7475,My pleasure 😎
7476,"Lmao yeah. It’s a fucking hivemind, if other people upvote everyone will follow suit same for downvotes"
7477,You aren't a real gamer if your gunshot wounds don't heal themselves after a few seconds
7478,My crush calls me bro
7479,No I don’t think so
7480,That reminds me of the time I made a great comment and it got downvoted while the top comment said exaclty what I said. That's pretty much Reddit at this point
7481,"Yes, there is a worse feeling. It’s called social oppression."
7482,Getting shot
7483,"yes

posting [something](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cigtzb/preciouslysuicidal_people_of_reddit_what_stopped/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) on r/askreddit and getting 6 upvotes

then having someone post the exact [same thing worded ever so slightly differently](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d5bek2/formerly_suicidal_people_of_reddit_how_did_things/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) two months later and getting 30k upvotes and topping reddit-wide 'popular'"
7484,I think seeing your mother being brutally murdered with a chainsaw in front of you might be a worse feeling... maybe.
7485,Waking up and seeing something in hot in new and it's too late for your answer to matter to anyone
7486,Having your post lost in New. Can confirm.
7487,"u/BOOCESTERseat had a really similar situation 

It is so fucked lmao"
7488,But I am late so It makes sense

7513,"yeah it was pretty cool seeing how the kids from the church that i hadnt seen in \~2 years turned out, one of them was always in casts because of some problem and seeing her running around was crazy. also one of the kids that asked ""can you eat poop"" now has a rad skrillex haircut and it looks awesome tbh"

7521,Mine curved the exact opposite direction to my masturbation hand for some reason

7526,"Typically chrome allows some free vpn extensions. The one I know a few people using is uVPN. You do have to create an account tho, but is it free.

With it being free tho, I don't recommend going on too personal sites or whatever since they probably sell what you do like most free vpns"

7528,Yes we don't. We only use paper and pens

7542,If you're not paying for the product you are the product. I guess it's fine for browsing Reddit in school though
7543,you guys get laptops????
7544,"Yeah some schools get school issued laptops. Idk about everyone but ours are really shitty Chromebooks with the most locked down Version of chromeos i have ever seen. A good 60% of websites are blocked (yes, even educational ones). No wallpaper uploads and you only get 8 gbs of on board storage plus 15gbs free in Google drive.

And plugins arnt allowed, so they're basically a brick since we barely use them.

On the bright side that ""brick"" is only about 3 lbs so not a big deal ig."

7622,"no but I was sitting in APUSH this year before corona and heard two girls who I no longer talk to as friends talk about me badly in that way, stuff like ""I mean he'd be attractive if he just got some balls haha I dont get why people are introverts, just say what you want to say"", ""yeah true he's a little above average but I don't get why he doesn't just speak up with girls a lot, gay or something I guess HAHA""

Probably worse than acting like someone likes me, acting like someone's friends with you then talking behind your back (literally)."
7623,"Nervous laughter



Nervous laughter is laughter provoked from an  persons expression of alarm, embarrassment, discomfort or confusion, rather than amusement. Nervous laughter is usually less robust in expression than ""a good belly laugh"", and may be combined with confused glances or awkward silence on the part of others in the audience. Nervous laughter is considered analogous to a courtesy laugh, which may be rendered by more of a conscious effort in an attempt to move a situation along more quickly.



People don't like to be put on the spot in public."
7624,Consistently telling yourself you are ugly is usually what makes you ugly; *very* rarely is it ever looks.
7625,"Of course people *can* be objectively ugly, I didn’t deny that. My point, which I may have been able to phrase better, is that consistent self-deprecation will actively make you less attractive. It is far more often the case that things like that are making you unattractive as opposed to your looks. I know plenty of guys who aren’t physically very attractive at all, but are still very successful in sexual and romantic endeavors because they are confident in themselves and never put themselves down."

7627,Nope
7628,"No, but my friends dared me to ask out a girl and it turns out she liked me."
7629,"People can be objectively ugly, I could be the most charismatic person in the world and I would still be ugly"
7630,"yikes indeed. that's a shit feeling, knowing that someone who's claiming to care for you, is with you for no reason other than pity."
7631,[removed]
7632,That's already suspicious cause no 15 year old would say that seriously
7633,Bruh they were just upset that you somehow weren't attracted to them and actively insulted you as a defense against their insecurities
7634,Sometimes I think this might have been the case but I don’t think it really was. I was 15 and this 17 year old girl asked me for my number while I was at work. We didn’t know each other’s ages but both looked around the same age. We were texting later and found out our ages but still kept texting. A couple of days later she ghosted me. I think she just didn’t want to be a pedo tho and fair enough I guess but ghosting is shitty lmao
7635,"Damn, that happened to one of my friends, RIP"
7636,"Yeah, we still are"
7637,[removed]
7638,Yeah I think so either middle or elementary school can’t remember their name
7639,"Not a dare per se

But I asked her out, she said yes, stuck with me for a solid YEAR, we broke it off and a year later admitted she never liked me and didn't want to hurt my feelings."
7640,"Same thing, used to be my girlfriend, now a girl-friend and these i love yous hurt for some reason"
7641,holy shit thats low. ofc the i love yous hurt thats so cruel u used to date!! how come u still talk to her g

7643,Life hack for all my bruddas out there: if you have an unwanted boner flex both of your leg muscles and it goes away.
7644,"If it’s not a horny boner the thinking of gross stuff doesn’t work. You just have to try and distract yourself until it goes away. If it is a horny boner you just have to try and turn yourself off.

I’m not really sure how to explain how it feels but they do get sore if they last too long.

They spring up whenever it is least convenient so however often it is inconvenient to have one."
7645,"It can be painful having it pushing on your pants

they come about 3-5 times daily"
7646,3-5 TIMES A DAY?!
7647,Wait wtf is the last one
7648,[deleted]
7649,"Actually much more often than that. I envy someone who would only have 3-5 a day. I get one whenever I'm sitting and need to stand up, and it's stressful, especially when there are people near me, so I always pull down my shirt or hoodie. I prolly get 10+ a day, but flexing my leg muscle redirects blood flow and makes them go away quickly."
7650,Alexa play Careless Whisper
7651,That number is about correct to me. And for me they can stay for multiple minutes
7652,"they happen at the worst times. I had one once in the middle of a soccer match, let me tell ya, running with a boner ain't easy.  


And I have absolutely no idea how to get rid of them, they just randomly disappear after like 2 mins"
7653,"I've gotten so used to it I mostly dont even feel it, and it's not THAT noticable if you're wearing pants"
7654,I can feel that guy’s cringe at thinking about having to explain
7655,"Pro tip, flex your leg really hard for 30 seconds. Works good for me. Make lame excuses before a presentation for 30 seconds if you have on"
7656,But what if you are NOT wearing pants??
7657,Rape
7658,"Uncomfortable. If you’re wearing jeans it’s easier to conceal, but also more uncomfortable since everything is being all constricted down there.

Sweats or shorts are more comfortable, and possible to hide with a waist strap tuck, but also a risky paradox if you’re standing. If your boner stays strong, you still have a boner, but if it weakens it is still visible but then it slips out of the waist strap.

Worst case scenario: awkward slouching or turning away if you have no other choice. 

I probably only get a boner at school 1-2 times a day if nothing abnormal is going on."
7659,"The start of a very, very bad porno"
7660,Story time
7661,I need to remember this
7662,"A useful tip for a guy who can't get rid of a boner: When you sit, have one leg rest on the toes instead of the whole foot. Then kinda make the heel go up and down very quickly to vibrate your whole leg. This will make blood go away from your pp."
7663,it is annoying as fuck. uncomfortable in my school uniform and i can't even adjust it properly. one upside is it is less visible but if i am at home and am not wearing underwear and wearing loose clothing it will pop up like a tent and i have to hide in the toilet for a bit while it calms down cuz my parents are ultra conservative. they unintentionally spring up on me randomly. like i would be thinking about cars and shit and \*boop\* there's one. fucking annoying i tell you.
7664,"Personally, I don't show that part of me in online lessons"

That’s how fetishes are born"
7668,"yea, but its not fully hard every time, and they only last for about a minute"
7669,"I didn’t know that they can happen when thinking about random things. Sounds extremely inconvenient and makes me feel worse for the dude (after his presentation, almost all the girls dubbed him as a perv)"
7670,Works for me. Basically it redirects your blood to your leg muscles
7671,"It depends. I seem to be on a schedule where I get them randomly about the same time every day, about 3-5 is accurate. And that’s just random ones that happen for no reason. Actual sexually turned on boners add to that number."
7672,Why wouldn't he mean it?
7673,"most girls are cute tbh

if they call you cute, they probably do mean it lol"
7674,"It’s hard to know, sometimes I actually mean it, sometimes I’m just being polite"
7675,That can depend. A high functioning sociopath might know that his position is not threatened by revealing it online.
7676,Maybe not to hurt her feelings
7677,I just thought of it logically. If I was a sociopath why would I give a shit about reddit knowing it while they don't know my identity?
7678,Honestly saying nothing is better. I don't wanna be given false confidence and then start questioning myself and other people's intentions in the future.
7679,"Very true, but how would you know that?"
7680,Say nothing then?!
7681,Very true.
7682,"Most of the time yes

It's especially obvious if instead of just saying 'you're cute' they say something like 'yoooo you're cuuuuute'

Besides, girls are all just so cute anyway"
7683,"Most of the times I'm just being polite, and I can't get myself to talk to cute girls, because I faint when they're cute (metaphor)"
7684,Depends. Some people can be really nice and it doesn't mean anything. There are smaller signs that show if it's genuine though but normally. I only call someone cute if I mean it.
7685,"Lmao yeah, if I talk to a cute girl I’ll have to constantly make a conscious effort to not start talking about how cute she is and to not seem creepy"
7686,[deleted]
7687,"Yeah, I am yet to meet a girl online who I don’t think is cute"
7688,The entirety of fucking reddit?
7689,"False as in I believe I possess a certain quality that doesn't actually exist, which in this case would be good looks. Even if I were confident for a short period of time, it'd probably backfire on me."
7690,Good looks are just a matter of perception. There’s no way that having confidence in yourself would make you unhappy in the long run.
7691,What is false confidence? Wouldn’t that just be confidence?
7692,The Chinese probably do.
7693,What if they do know your identity tho
7694,Usually yes
7695,I call my homies cute after tucking them in for bed and giving them a good night kiss
7696,"that's probs cuz they send u cute pics, not bad ones, so u think they look better than they do. not by much though"
7697,everyone thinks i’m cute. i’m adorable. i have had a burst of confidence
7698,I don’t see how it can even be faking it when it’s something as undefined as good looks
7699,"He thinks OP is a guy, my friend."
7700,"Many sociopaths are actually necessary to our survival as a people. Doctors, lawyers, and journalists all have tendencies towards sociopathic traits. It does not make them evil it makes them less empathetic, which makes them more valuable in scenarios where cold logic is absolutely necessary."
7701,"I can have a fist fight with a hundred guys, but I can never talk to a girl, most of the times I've talked to girls, it's because I'm asking them notes"
7702,"Parents to you when you are...

a) Below 18: “before you turn 18, you have to listen to whatever I say”

b) Over 18: “as long as you are under my roof, you have to listen to whatever I say”"
7703,"Nah bro because I go alone and sit ""over there"" because I'm introvert 😶"
7704,"That’s exactly it, I hate it sometimes. Then they’re surprised when we have nothing to contribute to the conversation"
7705,sit on her womb to assert dominance
7706,And then there is the special kind that still tries to tell you what to do at age 30 because “tHeY GaVe bIrTH tO yOu“
7707,I know right? It sucks how parents want you to talk but on their terms and not ours
7708,"Never bothered me, I have alot of old people in my family so they need the seat more than I do."
7709,"My mom used to say this, my answer always was, “and whos choice was that, i was never asked of the option.” She doesnt do it anymore thankfully"
7710,the only good response to that is that you didn't ask to be born. like what they gonna do? ground you when you are 30 for not enjoying life?
7711,Or how I still sit at the kid's table for Christmas or any other large family gatherings.
7712,"No I normally get told to sit somewhere because I should be active instead of never talking, but then I get yelled at because I voice my opinions whenever it conflicts with an “adult”’s opinion because I’m “too young and you wouldn’t understand”"
7713,Understandable
7714,my parents have been complaining nonstop about me nOt EnJoYiNg My LiFe
7715,"damn im sorry for you. are they saying it because you are an introvert or did you opened up about your feelings with them? either way, that is a really fucked up thing to say, especially to your own kid."
7716,The kid’s table is always the shitty one that nobody ever uses too
7717,"I’m a bit of an introvert but I’m pretty sure the main reason is that I just don’t really like any of my family, so I’m not always just having a jolly old time around em"
7718,Yep
7719,Just sit on the floor. Problem solved. Thats what I do
7720,"Question: How do you get to go from the “kids table” to the “adult table” at a family holiday? 

Answer: Somebody has to die."
7721,"Haha assert yourself dominance by sitting in the floor, fantastic idea"
7722,This ^
7723,"Nah not really, I don't really mind since there's tons of room in my house"
7724,"yeah, i kinda feel a bit humiliated at family gatherings when im grouped together with my 2-7 year old cousins"
7725,"I was sitting on a bench and my adult cousin told me to go sit elsewhere so he could sit by the other adults (with whom I was having a conversation with), I was pretty pissed when my mom made me move ""so I wouldn't make a scene"""
7726,"oh i understand. honestly, they can't make you like your family. also i know this isn't really helpful but even if you did like them the odds of your parents saying the same thing would have been pretty big if most of your relatives are really old or just don't have common interests"
7727,"This has been my arc.

Under 18: you're a kid, you'll do what I tell you to do.

Above 18: as long as you live in my house, you'll do what I tell you to do.

Above 18 and living separately: we took care of you for 18 years and gave you all the freedom in the world, how can you not be grateful to us?"
7728,"That’s the worst man, sorry about that"
7729,Lol I usually just lock myself in my room when there's guests until my mom calls me out to greet them. I usually just go out if there's food tho
7730,I literally just want to move to the mountains with my cats and live alone.

7734,"Listen to me kings, never let a two streamer ruin your day. Sure, maybe you had a fap the previous night and it wasn't really what you expected it to be. Maybe you're frustrated about school or your love life or all those other ultimately insignificant things we have to stress about. But you should never let a two streamer ruin your day.  YOU are the only one who can determine how good your day is and that should be decided after your nighttime fap not at your morning pee! Keep your chin up, boys"

7774,"All races are attractive. Although a lot of cultures prefer white skin. I'm a brown latino dude. Although I'm gonna guess you're indian or middle eastern idk.

The key to go from looking like an average brown dude to cool/attractive brown dude is in the hair. In my opinion, us brown dudes become a lot more attractive because our hair is slightly wavy and volumous, like a lion's mane. Pretty majestic Imo."
7775,"That’s the average woman’s height, not mans."
7776,How tall does one have to be to be considered tall
7777,"Your post describes perfectly what I feel for those posts, and I guess it’s an interesting topic too"
7778,"yeah, sometimes they give me a small confidence boost  ^_^"
7779,"yeah i find tall girls super attractive because im 6'4"" and dating a short girl would feel wrong like dating a kid"
7780,"Not true

Source: I'm a girl and I like shorter guys"
7781,"Nope! I don't need popular guys with 10/10 faces. If he has a good personality, I like him. Also, I'm sure a lot of short women wouldn't mind being with shorter guys (can't confirm that though, I'm 5'10 and not short)"

7791,"I stg down theres so many self doubting or self loathing south asians in this comments section

just learn:

Theres a group of people that have their preferences, like we might have our own. 

And if they dismiss you because youre brown then dont let it hurt your esteem, its not your fault that they judge or treat people differently by their skin colour"
7792,"Couple reasons. 

Reason number 1, they're just dicks who feel like calling you down.

Reason number 2, you are too focused on your ""girl"". You're 17, a high school student. Your life shouldn't revolve around your girlfriend. I see it all the time, dudes enter their first real relationship and they think it's going to last forever (it might, but statistics show it is more likely the first of many) so they shut out all their friends and no longer give them the time of day. Instead of saving up for a car, a movie or a nice meal with the fam they shower their girlfriend with gifts and buy them shit. If you're doing this, people are going to call you a simp. 

Reason 3, you could be a simp."
7793,Turning saints into the sea
7794,and they think they're cool by doing so
7795,"To answer number 2: definitely not, we almost didn’t date because we was focus on work but we made it work, and she is super independent so it’s like she don’t NEED to be with me but she wants too so we are not together all the time like maybe 2-3 a week and everything else is in private, but they call me a simp because I call her beautiful and buy her things on special occasions and events and I cook for her, and go on extra romantic dates but that’s once every 2-3 months because we always busy like we don’t have time since we are seniors and coronavirus"
7796,"They're most likely screwing with you then. Simp is just another word at this point. It's the same as calling your friend a bitch or whatever tf. Guys will call you whatever they want if it gets a laugh out of someone else in the area. Teens our age like to feel empowered and calling out others is the easiest way to accomplish this. Just ignore it and laugh it off, theres no point in stressing out over it."
7797,Swimming through sick lullabies
7798,choking on your alibis
7799,Yk my thought's are exactly the same as yours. You gotta treat your girl like she deserves it. And if people call you simp they are jealous cuz you found a nice person who loves you
7800,"The word was initially used to mock dudes who are just desperate, obsessing over girls who probably don't care about them, and would do literally anything to get a crumb of pussy. Nowadays, it has been stripped off its actual definition by morons."
7801,Sounds like smth a simp would say ...
7802,But it’s just the price I pay
7803,Destiny is calling me
7804,‘cause i’m Mr. Brightside
7805,Open up my eeeaagerrr eyeeees
7806,"I think the word ""simp"" has its appropriate uses.   
the definition of ""simp"" is Sucker Idolizing Mediocre Pussy  
this might mean something different to you but this is basically a person putting their partner on a pedestal or idolizing them. I use the word simp jokingly when my friends choose their partners over me. sometimes I use the word seriously when I meet people who spend all their time and give everything to a girl who wont date them. another way people use simp is for guys who will do/say anything to have sex with someone and when they are denied they say things like ""whore"". people who use it in that way usually are confusing it with the term ""niceguy""   
In conclusion, when someone calls you a simp dont take it seriously, but also sometimes take a look at yourself to make sure you arent an actual simp."
7807,usually it’s for when they’re doing hella nice shut and they’re not even their girl
7808,"I’m sure 90% of it is either jokes

Or people who think they are funny and overuse the joke"
7809,"Nope it’s a joke 

I’m not gonna say it’s a funny joke, but the whole joke is calling someone a sImP for literally anything

7821,Because everyone is misidentifying simps. Being nice to girls isn’t being a simp. You’re a simp when you put aside your financial and mental responsibilities for a girl who is obviously not interested in you and possibly doesn’t even know who you are

7871,I tried for months but my puny arms and legs just couldn't do it.
7872,you ok?
7873,ya I live in Canada lol
7874,My dad used to swim competitively so he made sure I could swim well by the time I was 6 or 7
7875,Same
7876,I can stay upright sort of and move forward at a very slow crawl.
7877,Username checks out
7878,"Yeah man I'm fine, just surprised that it didn't really impact me"
7879,Why did you never learn?
7880,Yeah me too
7881,"no, the only ice I've ever seen is the stuff that come out the fridge"
7882,I feel u. Its actually pretty bad coz its sexism
7883,[deleted]
7884,Not “basically”… its sexism
7885,"Yup 100% im pretty sure most of my teachers prefer the girls, also when students would do presentations and assemblies id say 70% was girls doing it. It is annoying really."
7886,Ok I want to strangle the person who made that decision. I hate it when people who deserve something dont get it.
7887,"Yup, my 8th grade science teacher had a HUGE preference for girls. Once she gave two boys detention for playing the snake game on their computers, then proceeded to check their histories and got mad that they were looking up phone prices, but she never bat an eye when any of the girls looked up anything on their computers during class time."
7888,"Girl here
We had a teacher than would say girls are more ""art"" people, so she would give the most creative projects to girls. One time I wanted some project that had to do with the radio but she suggested something else instead, cause that was a boy thing. Needless to say she didn't like what happened next."
7889,Yeah I fixed it
7890,"Now that you mention it, I can see the favoritism from some of my own past teachers. If I had been a guy, some of my teachers would've been pretty hands-off and not as encouraging, especially in stuff like physics."
7891,"They wouldn't tell me who made that decision, guess they feared my backlash quite a bit"
7892,Yeah I agree. Thanks for answering
7893,"Yeah, a lot of the times the teacher let girls go for lunch break earlier than boys"
7894,"Oh my teacher admits that she prefers girls over boys smh, which is why I am the least interested in that class….."
7895,"A girl in one of my primary school classs (5th year, last years before middle school/Junior High) slapped another girl right in front of the teacher and the teacher did nothing, but one of maybe friends accidentally hit someone with a ball while playing kickball and got in trouble"
7896,👉😎👉
7897,if I were you I would go to some anger management classes
7898,"Ye, some teachers. Like our history teacher way preferred girls.

But our art teacher kinda preferred boys. But those were the only two where it was blatantly obvious"
7899,"They wouldn't even humour me, they denied requests to see the Organizer and ignored me when I talked about it"
7900,Yeah the 'Ask me a hundred times and I will explain' mostly goes only for girls. My teacher used to be so irritated when I didnt get a problem
7901,What?! That's utterly baloney. Did you contact the school and try to fight it?
7902,If it were 4 boys and 1 girl they would have made sure she had a private suite in the most expensive part of the hotel all by herself
7903,"My school is an all boys school, so not really"
7904,"Yeah, some teachers said that girls are just the better gender, and like half of all teachers preferred girls. Idk, the only time girls weren't preferred was when boys were called to move heavy stuff"
7905,"16 girls at the shitter at the same time, teachers won’t let three guys stay for 2 minutes"
7906,Thats just horrible. Someones gender cant decide their likes and dislikes
7907,Nice to see a girl saying this. Thnx for ur reply.
7908,yeah grades and no shorts when girls are allowed to show stomach and have short af skirts and participations in projects and even scholarship money and all of them admitted by the teachers without shame
7909,Mom would be upset > Anger management classes
7910,That's really frustrating. Imagine if the genders had been flipped. That would've woken them up right away.
7911,"Not so much in my current school, but it still happens. Happened a lot in my previous schools. If boys helped each other with the problems, we'd be punished for distributing class. But then some girls would be almost yelling about some random shit, having a conversation distributing class, the teacher would never care. That was juts one example, boys were punished for way less than girls."
7912,MASON IS UP FOR AUCTION
7913,"why are you creeping on teen boys, pedo"
7914,"More like down for auction, but okay."
7915,"If someone dates you, will he/she be getting a pinned post advantage?"
7916,Oh MASON IS DOWN FOR AUCTION
7917,I'm very expensive btw

7928,The question is will they date me
7929,Pretty please?
7930,Anyone going higher?
7931,Peedddoooo
7932,Please date us
7933,I'm married to many people
7934,Yes <3
7935,"I think ""OK"" wants to bid"
7936,55
7937,Possibly
7938,I thought you were married to Cat...
7939,"Pardon me from interrupting your November 19, but I’d like to ask the vital question if all moderators of the subreddit r/askteenboys are in fact not heterosexual but in fact homosexual in nature?"
7940,That is just a saying hmmm
7941,"There’s only two girls; Kate and games and I’m straight

Games already has a boyfriend, and since MDIG went with Cat I’l go with Kate"
7942,Ok it hurts less now so i think its temporary
7943,The sperms are rebelling
7944,Happens to me all the time I think it's just something normal during puberty
7945,Were you just exercising? Or beating ur meat? Because either of those things can cause testicular discomfort
7946,Haven't been beating my meat but i did bike today for like 4km
7947,Bad
7948,wait i still have not got the pain yet. how's it feel?
7949,Not really but like a spiking pain
7950,F
7951,"like a flying, burning tire from across the world into your nutsuck at full speed?"
7952,Probably bc of the wet dream i had last night
7953,"Yeah i've had the same thing too, but it was probably because i had to sit 5 hours straight in school and i probably sat on my testicle.
Are you finnish btw?"
7954,Nice
7955,Yeah
7956,Dude I cum in my sheets every night like a boss
7957,Does it happen when you land on your feet?
7958,Like a stabbing pain for me it's completely different from being hit in the balls
7959,This entire thread is just 13 year olds lmfao
7960,PERKELE TORILLE
7961,"I saw that you did bike before. I had the same thing about 3 years ago and it solved itself twice. Unfortunately 2 years ago, it wouldn't solve itself so I went to the doctor and he told me I had a testicle torsion. It's pretty bad and need to be operated before 4 hours after the beginning of the pain. You had a semi-torsion , that's why it solve itself but I might not always be. During semi torsion, the testicle still receive blood so it don't necrose but if you have a full torsion you have 4h until you are a testicle down if its not operated.
I hope you understood my message. Btw, I went to the hospital just in time to keep my 2 balls.

notta bene : this happens to a lot of teenager so don't be too shy to tell anyone . Sometime the testicles are attached to the ball sack, sometimes not which leads to torsion. It's more common than people are willing to admit"
7962,F
7963,en voi ku palliin sattuu :(
7964,Nah
7965,Looking at this thread gave me teenage boy vibes
7966,They are trying to escape because they know that they cant for the next month.
7967,You maybe sat on it accidentally
7968,"no, not nice! then you have to clean it all up which takes ages .-."
7969,it just started hurting all of a sudden like 10 mins ago
7970,death bro
7971,"If it is sharp pain, check with your parents.
I could possibly be testicular contortion"

7987,"Yeah but like if the person doesn't give much info and lets just say i call the cops in my town in Wisconsin and the creep ends up being in like Kazakhstan or something

Not much they can do then and like theres so many its a bit tough to catch them"
7988,Yeah tons of pedos
7989,"Honestly, I never got sharing nudes with random people.


Hundreds of thousands of stories, dozens of movies, films, and YA and romance/drama books, and you’d think we as a society would learn not to share nudes with random ass people"
7990,did it end with liz?
7991,small fucking world huh
7992,Yuh they tried to offer me nudes in DMs and it was super awkward to turn them down
7993,She offered me nudes too i turned her down aswell. I looked on her profile after and she sexted so many guys like omg
7994,She’s probably the horniest girl i ever seen tbh
7995,"Kinda, on my main I followed this girl that had a pedophilic abusive boyfriend (he started dating her when she was 12) and she doesnt know I follow her and we never interacted, weird tho"
7996,Same
7997,yesterday we found a married 40 year old dude calling girls sexy and saying he would date them on TeensMeetTeens. he deleted his account after we started commenting on his posts. u/p0six433

8017,"Yes but there's very different types of watching porn

The addict or excessive watcher:
Watches porn almost every day. It's like brushing their teeth

The horny dude:
Watches a lot because he's horny a lot

The Hobby watcher:
Sometimes even watches porn just because they're bored

The occasional watcher:
Watches maybe once or twice a week or a month when he's in the mood

8063,For me it isn't but that's because I'm not even sure how I'd describe my music taste
8064,Me too
8065,"I mean, it's not special just showing it to her, but if she has the same music taste you can bet I 100% have a crush on you at that point."
8066,Me too

8069,"Most won't approve. The kind of music girls in my year like is rap, rave and pop. I like hard rock and heavy metal."
8070,"I am shy and rarely start a convo irl but I definitely make sure everyone knows that I am a metalhead by constantly wearing t-shirts. So if I am to ever start a convo with anyone (which is rare - irl I always wait to be approached or after a shitton of hesitation, I start it on Fb) and I'm talking about my music taste, it usually means I'm seeking at least a friendship."
8071,Absolutely same
8072,Me too but its because no one listens to 80’s thrash metal
8073,"Same, I listen to everything except rap, so it's kinda weird if I listen to some disney songs and anime openings and then some pop stuff, lmao. But idk if music taste can even be weird, yk?"
8074,Yep
8075,There is a reason we pass on the AUX when they give it to us to play something. xD
8076,Depends

8083,No. It isn't anything special for me.
8084,"Not shy in any form. But I do have different music taste. Metal, blues, old country, and classic Fock. It is a good feeling when someone (especially a female) shows interest in the stuff I listen too."
8085,"For shy boys, yeah I think so. It means they like you enough to tell you (not necessarily have a crush on you, just that they feel comfortable with you)"
8086,Me too
8087,Not really

8089,HOW CAN YOU HATE PEACE SELLS?!
8090,"Definitely. I don't talk about what music I listen to very often unless someone just straight-up asks me to. If I talked about my music tastes with a girl without her coaxing me to do it, then I'm probably into her."
8091,"I never show anyone my music taste unless I know they like the same stuff, so yes it definitely would be for me"
8092,I more then often think why do I exist. Why am I alive. Life is just an endless hell hole of cycles.

8097,Every time i look in the mirror i ponder whether or not we are living in a simulation

8102,"According to Descartes (the guy who didn’t believe that his senses necessarily gave him correct information), if you are being sent faulty information from some evil power, you must exist in order for that evil power to give you the bad information in the first place.

8130,"Honestly I understand where you’re coming from, I thought the exact same way when I was 14 and can’t blame you for it, maybe your mind will change later on (or not). But I guess it’s good that you want to focus on yourself first, you will live the rest of your life with yourself, so taking care of your mind and body is more important than anything else"

:("
8155,"Try sitting down and talking with her. Give her two options so she feels in control and don’t try to blame anyone, if you blame her she’ll get defensive, if you blame yourself she’ll feel she’s in the right. Stay on topic, remain calm and confident. If that doesn’t work assuming there is someway to connect to the internet, take advantage of any time she’s not around, if it’s important enough consider staying up late but try not to stay up too late (maybe copy it down on paper to work out during the day and copy it down online when you get the chance) or you can gmail your teacher(s) what’s up. Hope this helps"
8156,No problem man. My dms are open if you need anything.
8157,You dont have to go to war if you join the military. You could pick a job that is in the rear lines. But I would say only do It if it makes you happy
8158,I hear its frowned upon over there
8159,Friend in the Marines actually likes it a lot. He's mostly repairing helis tho so it's not like he's out shooting people.
8160,"You could tell het what you told us, specifically the part about only being able to advance with dual credit. 

I would also recommend getting a mediator to intercede for you, someone you know she'll listen to.

Alternatively, you could make threats, such as running off to the military and cutting contact with, play with emotions by making her fear losing you if she doesn't stop being an idiot."
8161,The military in the US ain't great from what I've heard. Personally I'm joining the army as soon as I leave school but I'm joining british army. Hope it's better
8162,I'm not sure about that. Bot my parents are retired army and they haven't gotten fucked over. The only thing fucked is how the VA sucks and other things for veterans do to. The only thing the military tried to do was get my dad to join back up for iraq or sum
8163,I was going to join the royal marines but I opted for royal signals instead as it can set you up for a job later in life

8209,Lol true

8211,How far back do your eyebrows go? /s
8212,"Not a direct answer, but I wanted to say this:


Let's say you identify 100 posts as fakes for karma per week. 


You might be right on 99 of those. But there's always times where you're mistaken. 1 out of 100 is generous; you're going to be wrong much more often than that. 


Now, let's say you've accidentally identified 100 genuine posts as fakes throughout your time on reddit. Again, maybe 99 times that leads to no consequence. But that other 1 time, the guy you hated on may have been going through some serious shit and turned to the internet for help. His last resort. But then he sees that even the internet is against him. 


People committing suicide because of hate received on the internet is a real thing, people. Yes, people who take their lives just because someone was mean to them on the internet are pretty fragile, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't just try to be kinder once in a while. 


I can't stop you all from continuing to call people out. Believe me, I've tried. But I certainly don't want to live knowing I might have had a part in making another human being self-harm or even commit suicide. 


If you see a post that you think is fake, just leave it, people. Maybe leave a downvote, and keep scrolling. If it's fake, it's not worth your time. If it's real, well, you probably don't want to call it ""fake"".


Fake, karmawhoring posts are stupid, yes. But just leave them, people. We all understand that karma is useless, yet some of you don't understand that it's equally pointless to stop someone from getting karma that they didn't deserve. It's not like they robbed a bank or something."
8213,"Cause internet points give that sweet, sweet dopamine

I don't fake stories though"
8214,Cancer or fake cancer?
8215,The guy who made the fake post
8216,Who's he?

8284,"when im excited or laughing: voice goes up

when i’m talking to people when i first meet them or i’m tired of not in the mood, or just how i normally talk at my “baseline” voice (when i’m calm): voice subconsciously deepens to the point where i sound like an adult to every one i’ve talked to."

8346,"A crush is you idolizing the person in a romantic sense, while you aren’t actually romantically close to them or know them very well (essentially you make a perfect fantasy version of them in your mind based on limited info and then obsess over that). 

Love is an intense feeling of deep affection and strong bond you have with someone who is very close to you.

In a way, you can think of crushes as someone fantasizing about being in love with someone else"

idk why   
i guess i pretty much knew all the girls wouldnt be into me lol"

8351,"Hey man you're only 14 maybe 15 soon but hey life still got surprises for you so don't let yourself down ! There are really some awesome people who will like you and will make you happy, trust me. If you get ""friendzoned"" again, get past over her and still be friends! It's still worth it and you can still grow close even while not being in a relationship. Just make sure you get past over her ! Maybe she wasn't the one for you, even if you wanted to it wouldn't change so why bothering getting down anyway ? I promise you you'll find someone better ! ;)"

8373,"Best thing I found is to have something to do. 

Don’t think it’s unhealthy or your disgusting if you masturbate once a day or so. It’s completely healthy actually. 

I also found that not being holed up in my room all day and eating healthier (surprisingly, I think I was sad a little so this might just be that) stopped my urges to masturbate more often. 

Also, only masturbate if you’re extremely horny. Like your body is saying “not later. Right now, gotta make sure your dick works” type horny."
8374,Yeah they are.
8375,"I tried this for a few weeks, it's so goddamn irritating I hated it"
8376,That's the point no?
8377,How is that even possible. I can’t even nut more than 3 times a day. But to answer your question. Don’t watch porn. Find something you enjoy to put your energy into or just occupy your time. Try and become aware when you feel the urge.
8378,"Sounds like an addiction, Does it interfere with your life/ Stop you from doing things?"

8435,"If telling an authority that that happens (like a teacher) would actually get you beaten up, then there are a couple options I see.

You could keep really close guard of your phone whenever he or someone else who is known for stealing is around. Some ways to accomplish this would be to hold it tightly when you have it out so it’s harder to take out of your hand, hold onto it if it’s in your pocket (then it would be impossible to take), or put it in your backpack when your not using it (also would render stealing impossible unless your backpack goes unsupervised by yourself if something happens, for example the class gets organized into groups and you have to move tables).

The other option I see is to simply not bring it to school."
8436,"Report him to the school staff anonymously and tell them about the knife. Send an email to a teacher or something.

He should get shit at least for having a knife at school. Maybe even for stealing if you can prove it."

8439,Steal his phone an eye for an eye
8440,"I get where you're coming from, but our personalities are definitely different there. Once you let people get away with taking advantage of you (in this case, someone stealing OP's phone), they're gonna do it over and over again because they know you won't do anything back."
8441,Damn...
8442,If you really don’t want him to take it just don’t bring it or wear shorts or something under whatever your wearing and put it in that pocket
8443,"If you can’t snitch then try to convince (or pay) someone bigger than him to threaten him.

You can also go to the police, afterall, stealing is a crime."
8444,If you can submit anonymous evidence that he has a knife at school he should get expelled.
8445,Umm well that’s not what he was talking about
8446,"Is there any way you can report it anonymously, then if the guy tries to confront you act surprised and be like it must have been a witness or something."
8447,That's a crime. Report that mf.
8448,"Keep it inside your underwear right next to your pp. That way if he tries to steal it again you can call it a sexual assault.     


Just a joke, don't do this unless you like smelling your pp every time you talk on the phone."
8449,You'd be surprised. If it were me I wouldn't risk my life over a cell phone
8450,Alot of then are probably fake
8451,"You made that point already, and I already told you why I don't feel the same way as you. Let's just stop here and agree to disagree, we clearly have different approaches to this."
8452,where do you live
8453,"I know, but there is no standardized system so I was just hoping people knew their equivalent. btw im Swiss --> California so its confusing for me too"
8454,Because they might not want to be single
8455,Why the question avout wether we would be interested in a relationship if we are single?
8456,ah ok thx
8457,could someone translate “which grade are you in” for the british
8458,Yeah... There wasnt really an equivalent as my school system literally has more grades than 12 and our HS is shorter somehow. It just doesnt seem logical.. Pickef 11th tho because thats the 2nd last year for HS in Usa and Im in my 2nd year in HS but considering we only have 3 years of HS its also the 2nd last year.
8459,Why is there not portuguese? It's the 5th most spoken language my dude
8460,Good survey. I'd like to see more in this sub!
8461,"sorry, it means what year of school. 12th is the final year before uni"
8462,"There's an issue with nit having time fir a relationship because of school :(

God damn school :("
8463,you did 7th graders dirty
8464,ill add it
8465,"usually 17-18 for 12th, 16-17 for 11th, etc"
8466,thanks broski
8467,"ik, i meant what year for what age?"
8468,Idk. I have almost 200 responses rn and going so probably when it levels off a bit
8469,I know what u mean
8470,Because a relationship takes 2 people wanting and feeling the same
8471,When will you post the results?
8472,So there was this part about being single and being open to a relationship... Does this mean my new fleshlight will arrive sooner?
8473,Dude you made Asia one choice but then split the us and Canada?
8474,So like...do I redo it?
8475,no need
8476,oof sorry bro
8477,It would’ve been easier to do it by age
8478,thx
8479,Sounds like a plan my dude
8480,How dare you say Biggie Cheese is ugly. HE IS BEAUTIFUL
8481,"That mention of “that one guy from of mice and men” killed me lmfao

His name’s Lennie iirc"
8482,So you mean to tell me that you don’t care about carbines???? Not even the m1a1????
8483,"I care if a girl is curvy because it’s an attractive feature to have, but it’s certainly not a dealbreaker. I think most guys would agree."
8484,I'm so starved for affection that I don't even care how one looks as long as I feel that they're beautiful
8485,I’m more a fan of the G36C
8486,It all comes down to preference. Not all guys like the same things
8487,Aight thanks 😎
8488,"Preference wise, there probably are a lot of guys who care but it's not a must for most. Personally I could care less about curves. Some of my crushes have them, others don't."
8489,I felt this deep man
8490,R-34c is better imo
8491,Y’all are talkin weak shit. The Mauser Trench Carbine is where it’s at.
8492,"Do we care? Yes (I mean would you not prefer, say, a fit build over an out of shape one?), but it's whether a guy likes curvy or non curvy builds is up to his preference, so you're better off having the type of body that you're comfortable with and not worry much about that."
8493,"Probably gonna be seen as an arsehole for this but I dont care. I have a type and rarely would I find a girl attractive if they don't fit it. That said I won't treat a girl badly because I don't find her attractive, she's still a person, but I wouldn't necessarily want to have something to do with them."
8494,"Wow, an amazing insight to be sure. Thank you so much u/Chads_bulge."
8495,"Not too many of us, maybe 30% or so. To me, face matters. I feel that those who are body first are confusing attraction and lust."
8496,[removed]
8497,"The answer to any “Do guys/girls/etc. care …” question is “It depends.” Not everyone of a certain gender or whatnot shares the same opinions or has the same preferences and attractions.

Btw, your boyfriend sounds sweet af. You’re a lucky girl."
8498,Id want a g36k with a ras barrel
8499,Agreed
8500,"We might like curvyness, but tbh, it doesn't take much for us straight guys to find a girl attractive"
8501,"Nah you’re fine ,ik some people have preferences and some dont care and either way is fine"
8502,I wouldn’t really care
8503,True dat
8504,Ik i love him with all my heart ❤️😪
8505,ACW-R gets me going
8506,"Honestly, the only thing about the body i care about is that the girl isn't fat. Chubby is ok and ngl, I'd prefer a bit chubby girl over a fit girl. The face is what matters more to me. If the girl has a cute face, I'm sold. Personality is also very important, but of course, you need to be into someone in order to be interested in them in the first place."
8507,M4 carbine
8508,Not really pretty face and good personality is more what I look for
8509,Mean :(
8510,Very well said
8511,You should be in politics because you can talk and not hurt anyone with it.
8512,"r/waterniggas got quarantined, that’s the only difference. I just thought it’d be better to put r/hydrohomies instead since more people would be able to access that sub."
8513,What’s the difference between that sub and r/waterniggas
8514,r/waterniggas
8515,I don't know if that's healthy
8516,Waterniggas actually got quarantined not banned.
8517,Rip 😔
8518,yeah I get that but this guy said he drinks eight to nine 44 Oz cups so unless he weighs like 800 or 900 pounds it's not really healthy I mean  it's not unhealthy but I don't really think it can be good for you
8519,"It is, actually. You're supposed to drink half your body weight in ounces. So say I weigh 100lbs, I should technically be drinking 50oz a day.


EDIT: Totally misread the statement. My apologies."
8520,r/waterniggas got banned and they created r/hydrohomies
8521,"oh well i cant access it

Oh tried again and i could access it"
8522,Wdym? We still going strong 👊 no matter if reddit quarantine us
8523,Yes
8524,"That’s because when a sub gets quarantined, I think you need a verified email to be able to see it. So it’s basically stops a lot of people from being able t access a sub without completely banning that subreddit. I can still access it but many others won’t be able to."
8525,Usually around 3 liters a day
8526,Drinking too much water can get unhealthy quite fast
8527,r/waterniggas wants to neuter you
8528,"whatever is in the food + a glass or two if im thirsty

so yeah

not enough"
8529,Wasn't there a girl who died from drinking too much water in a radio contest I think it was something to do with the fact that she didn't have enough salt to water ratio
8530,r/waterniggas for life
8531,not enough
8532,5 or 6 1 liter bottles a day

8536,r/hydrohomies 🤝 r/waterniggas
8537,What? Are you against hydration?
8538,That was also a LOT of water in a very short time. That amount of water throughout the day won't kill you
8539,Imagine how much you have to go pee though
8540,Only when im thirsty

8593,"Not just that. But being stuck and not being able to do anything for at least ~~a week~~ a few days(That's what it takes for the average person to die of ~~starvation/~~ dehydration) is worse than just starving in general. Not being able to move, talk, walk, scratch yourself etc. triggers such a huge phobia of mine"
8594,"You sould not be afraid of that

Are you okay or need to talk or someting?"
8595,"I’m actually going to conditionally disagree here. While this is true if you are young and depressed, if you choose to end your own life because you are satisfied with what you have accomplished, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I’d actually argue that it is a great way to die. I have every intent of committing suicide, but only once I am very old and content with my achievements and life. I’d like to have control over the way that I pass."

8600,No thanks I’m good
8601,[deleted]
8602,"That makes sense, thank you!!!"
8603,"Some guys are more comfortable speaking to girls because their friends may be those macho types that are like “THATS GAY DUDE DERP DERP” or they may not trust them to keep things secret. They could also just in general be more open to talking about feelings with girls because it feels more natural. I’m lucky that I have a few friends that are guys and also girls that I can talk to about anything, and I know they will either support me or get my ass back on track if I’m being stupid. I think it says a lot about YOU , that he opened up so soon to you. He feels like you are trustworthy and feels comfortable saying things to you. That sounds like to me you are a great person. Keep his trust! That’s important and will help you move to the next step!"
8604,"Yeah I’ve always thought that guys are more likely to do that, albeit I’ve never had many male friends of my own. Thank you for the reply!!"
8605,"Thank you for giving such a detailed answer!!! What you’re saying makes sense, and honestly I guess he just feels more natural when talking to me since his friends are the opposite of macho and they don’t seem to be that untrustworthy. It’s awesome that you have such good friends, that’s something I really admire! And thank you so much for the kind words :)) I try to be as good as I can be haha."
8606,"In general, yes, but it depends."
8607,Same thing. Its just way easier. Im talking about things like this with an ex-crush of mine (it is also way easier to talk about things when both have the relationship idea off the table) and I wouldnt say anything like that to male friends
8608,i aint like talking about my emotions with anybody cuz i dont have them
8609,"Yeah that makes sense, thank you for responding :)"
8610,Then they usually make fun of you after if they don’t as your talking
8611,Fair enough
8612,Yeha definitely feel more comfortable talking to girls about emotions
8613,"Not gender specific but i would like to speak about those stuff who :

Would not rat on me to others

I Know very well for a long time

Not make fun of me

Not pretend to overreact and give false sympathy"
8614,that’s really fucked up ngl
8615,Yeah np! Went back and fixed a few autocorrects lol
8616,"Definitely. The only person I've ever completely opened up to is a girl, and my best friend. I've also had plenty of experiences that really made me feel like it's harder to confide in guys. I also know a lot of girls in my drama class who seem very kind, gentle, and supportive, and even if I don't consider them all friends, I feel like I could talk to them about stuff if I needed to. People in drama are different though, everyone in that class is like on their own level. All in all though, yes, girls are easier to talk to because in my experience, they're the ones who listen. Not to say I don't have male friends I could talk to, cause I do, but I feel far more comfortable being emotional around girls."
8617,"Good to know, thank you!"
8618,"heck, i dont reveal what im really thinking about to my good friends even though i know they're not macho types"
8619,"Thank you for answering! I totally get what you mean, like there’s a guy I used to have a one-sided crush on & confessed to a few years ago and talking to him is much less awkward now. Did you talk to your ex crush the same when you still had a crush though, or did it become easier only once you got over them?"
8620,"I find it easier to talk to girls more than guys anyways. i barely talk to guys unless ive known them for my whole life or are introduced to me by a good friend. girls have always been easier to talk to. but one of the trade offs is that im in middle school, i get called gay all the time, plus i have long hair and that doesnt help."
8621,"Nah, it’s just a different way of processing things."
8622,"I don't talk a lot about my feelings with other guys, its not that I don't trust my friends or that we think it is weird, bit we just don't do it. It feels more natural/easier to talk to girls about emotions."
8623,I think it depends mostly on the person not the gender. I mean generally fellow guy friends are more likely to tease but I have a few I fee really comfortable with. At the same time the first person I ever opened up to was a girl so idk.
8624,"Thank you for responding!! I definitely would do the same as you since I like to feel safe when sharing personal information, but I’ve only talked to this guy for a few months and we’ve never really had a deep conversation until this happened, so he wouldn’t of known if I would’ve done those things or not. If we were really familiar with each other then I wouldn’t think twice about it, but we aren’t so idk"
8625,We were good friends for a while before and there were some weeks of silence after I confessed (later we found out it was because she thought I didnt want to talk to her and I thought she didnt want to talk to me although we both did) and after that it got soooo much better than before. If I remember correctly I made a post about that story a while ago. It was the best that coudve happened and Id do the exact same thing again if I had the chance
8626,"Depends on who the girl is, honestly... Most of the girls I know are tremendous gossipers and are quite honestly just mean people, so I wouldn't tell them. But with a girl like my crush, I'd probably hint at them (e.g. I've sent her some rewrites of songs that are kinda romantic, and she liked them even though I got friendzoned lol) but probably wouldn't directly tell her my feelings unless we got like really really close. This might be just me, but I prefer to just keep my feelings private - but if someone actually cares, and is caring enough to understand, then sure I'll tell them :)

Hope that helped! Sorry if it was long lol"
8627,I agree with you
8628,"I always keep a fake mask in front of others too, and i legit haven't talked about it to someone i know irl. He must be quite desperate to release the burden by confiding"
8629,Thanks for understanding that
8630,Yes
8631,"This might be unhelpful, but here goes. I met this girl in like the first week of school, and we started getting along pretty well. I’m not attracted to her or anything, but we’ve had a lot of deep talks. Only over text though, but I don’t know if that’s because we’ve never seen each other besides school where there’s a lot of other people or when her and her friend came over for Halloween. So I don’t have an answer, I just thought that I would share my experience. Good luck with your crush!"
8632,I say bye and when they say bye back and I end the call
8633,"I'm from Ireland, and if you don't know, it's basically culture to end phone calls by going bye, b b bye, bye, bye for a good 2 or 3 seconds until someone hangs up"
8634,That’s so adorable lol
8635,"Yes, I do."
8636,Makes sense i guess
8637,"Yeah, when else should I?"
8638,Yeah it i—
8639,I wait for the other person to end the call
8640,nah we both say goodbye first
8641,"That is normally how i do it, but if we sit too long in silence i’ll end it and feel bad anyway"
8642,"I say goodbye, wait for them to say it back and then hang up."
8643,Or when someone’s explaining something over the phone people just inhale a whole bunch of times while saying yeah
8644,weve started with the shortcuts like power button to end n shit like that
8645,Same
8646,I never call my brother and when i do its not something good
8647,"Me: bye

Them: bye

Me: bye then

Me: bye"
8648,Yeah
8649,No I actually end it with a hey like most people where I'm from.
8650,[deleted]
8651,"Yes, I hang up right after I say goodbye."
8652,I say bye! And wait for them to say it then I hang up
8653,"Depends who it is. My Dad always told me it’s rude to hang up on people but he hangs up before I finish speaking so... 

But mostly I wait for them to hang up cause I don’t want to seem rude or anything"
8654,"Well yeah immediately... I do know 1 guy who is like immediately gone... He gets ready to hang up, that's rude tbh... He's also the kind of dick that when I ace called w a buddy's gf(buddy was there to) he randomly hangs up to be a cunt... Still feel guilty since that girl bought special bread for me because an allergy"
8655,"I do if I can, sometimes I’m on the phone in the car and I can’t hit the button so I just wait for them"
8656,Lmaoo
8657,"next time just say “I gotta go take a shower i’ll see ya there, bye”"
8658,i will usually say im going to leave then they say good bye and i will too and ill wait like 1-2 seconds and leave
8659,I do it but I feel really bad cause I'm scared right after I do they are gonna try to say something
8660,I wait for the other person.
8661,"Yes, most boys are pretty precise and quick when it comes to conversations on the phone since at least in my person experience, we prefer talking irl. So yea, we hang up immediately after saying goodbye since we both said goodbye, it's literally the signal that this conversation is over. sometimes only one person says goodbye and hangs up and that's okay (I'm usually the one who's too late to say bye)

&#x200B;

in my experience with my friends, we end conversations like this, and in all the calls that i had with my friends from the past 5 years only one was longer than one minute and it was because he wanted to talk because his dog died."

8680,No
8681,"This made me laugh. Thanks, I needed that."
8682,Day 1 i did nothing because our one note servers all crashed. Day 2 did nothing because teachers where just telling me to do the one note which was still not up yet. Today did a little bit of art and math then played video games for 5 hours. My terms going great I definitely dont need to do good this year so i can go for my ATAR and be able to apply for uni.
8683,"Me in AP Stat. Sidenote: don't take AP Math classes if your lucky enough to have the choice. I didn't

Edit: typo"
8684,YES
8685,Yep... same here. It’s rough
8686,"Nah, I just have to write like 3 essays of 3’000 words each... in two different languages..."
8687,Yep
8688,"That makes me furious to think about, Alvin and the Chipmunks ruins chipmunks"
8689,"Bruh AP stats wasn’t that bad. AP calc is fucking ass. But honestly, having taken AP stats and AP calc, honors accelerated pre calc is still the hardest class I’ve ever taken."
8690,I did most of that today
8691,"2 finals to study to, 1 other very important test next week, a practical driving exam, an essay I need to do because our English teacher is bored and a project to finish. No big deal, I can do it (I'm not even sarcastic at this point I got this)"
8692,Aww. That's wholesome.
8693,Nah me and my dog cuddle just fine
8694,"idk i’ve never cuddled with anyone

only like long hugs which obviously aren’t that awkward"
8695,Extremely awkward cos it was with my crush post rejection.
8696,"Guys love cuddles w/ girls, but if you consider him just a friend, you need to clarify that the hug was plutonic, since guys will almost def misenterpret that"
8697,"I never cuddled with a girl, but I like hugs so I’m totally fine hugging"
8698,"I love the motive, but make sure you're being safe with Covid around and all :)"
8699,"OP said that she hugs a lot of people, so I think guys will be able to tell that she's just a huggy person and didn't mean anything special by it. At least that's what I've noticed with my female friends. I know which ones are more outwardly affectionate and which aren't, so there isn't too much chance of a misunderstanding."
8700,"I see guys commenting here that they wish girls would do that more often, but when I offer one, I get rejected bc I’m too ugly for them. Tbh, I’m average looking"
8701,Cuddling with the boys hit different
8702,🤗
8703,Very awkward. Cuddling with boys is a different story ☺️
8704,"Same, a girl I wasn’t even friends with at the time hugged me 4 years ago. And then a different girl hugged me 3 years ago. I’ve never forgotten those two times because it never happens"
8705,Dude same
8706,[deleted]
8707,Bruh long hugs are the most awkward thing imo
8708,"The only time I have is when we were walking through a river, and she kept clinging to me because I was tall and she didn’t want to fall in. 


later virgins 😎"
8709,even a fucking hug would make me fall in love. just make sure you don't break hearts hugging people.
8710,"If a girl randomly hugged me, I’d think she’s into me"
8711,Stuff like this reminds me I’m on Reddit. Thanks again for fitting the stereotypical incel
8712,This is wholesome as frick
8713,Bruh
8714,😐😐😐
8715,the reason women don’t talk to you is because you’re an asshole.
8716,"Can confirm. As a guy, if a girl randomly started hugging and cuddling, I’d definitely think she’s into me.   


But it’s a sweet gesture nonetheless. We’ve been deprived of physical affection for pretty long"
8717,"Yeah it does be like that, I never rejected a cuddle just because people usually need it or I do myself"
8718,"That's how it is for some of us, sadly."
8719,you seem like an incel
8720,No chance to know
8721,"i actually hug more girls than guys, and hug everyone just as much"
8722,U ARE CUTE AND HANDSOME
8723,"I like being called cute too bro, btw you're cute"
8724,depends on the context. if they’re saying it’s annoying i imagine it’s because they don’t wanna be called cute by friends or family. but if it’s their crush talking of course they’ll like it.
8725,"Some do, some don't"
8726,Noooo
8727,"not to seem like a pedo given I'm turning 17 soon but I bet you're both cute 👉👈, also like being called cute"
8728,"I never get compliments and would love anything, but “cute” that’s more of one for a girl as for guys it’s emasculating. It would be better to say just you look nice"
8729,YES
8730,"Sure I guess, but I can never tell whether it’s a pity compliment or not lol."
8731,"_~~^(shut up pedo >:()~~_



awwwww thanks cutieeee ;))"
8732,No no I like it it just never happens
8733,Never been called cute so can't say.
8734,ur cute!
8735,don’t need to🥰
8736,u are cute.
8737,stopppp
8738,You haven’t seen me but thanks
8739,ok well in that case u look nice
8740,"no I fucking love it

it gives me a confidence boost that lasts no less than 3 months"
8741,honestly any compliment made by a girl to a guy is an amazing feeling.
8742,"This so much, I get a compliment and I’m happy for weeks and also sus af."
8743,no u
8744,HI UR CUTE
8745,No
8746,"Aww thanks, shame you don’t mean it"
8747,CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE YALL R SO FUCKING CUTE
8748,don’t need to🥰😳
8749,🥺🥰🥰
8750,I’d like to be called cute
8751,In my experience only if they really care about their masculinity since cute isn't really a way to compliment masculine traits. If they don't really care about it then I'm sure they wouldn't mind
8752,[deleted]
8753,"w-wait, how do you..?"
8754,They’re girls :P
8755,Damn right it is
8756,"How do I ...?

If you're talking about what I think you're talking about.. well... heheh it's a secret"
8757,"YES! It's hot and that wiggle they do too.

Btw I saw that your previous comment got removed, because you didn't have a user flair. Which means that you must be new to the subreddit.

Welcome to the subreddit full of horny teens."
8758,b-but that’s i-illegal.. 😳
8759,"I like both high and low waisted. High look comfy and make you look taller, and low waist for obvious reasons."
8760,[deleted]
8761,"No it's not. And I won't stop doing it if it would be illegal hehe

I'm gonna look at it and hope that they don't turn around"
8762,"Wait, guys like this?"
8763,Really? I didn’t know guys actually thought that
8764,HELL YEAH BROTHER
8765,I hate low waisted jeans they look weird so high waisted it is
8766,That jummmp thoo
8767,"Aw that's so nice thanks. I've actually been on it for a while I just never commented, but thanks anyway!

Also I had no idea that was a thing that guys like so wow"
8768,This is the most wholesome and innocent comment on this post man. Good job
8769,We will always look at that amazing jump you gals do
8770,"Yea, they have a certain appeal idk why"
8771,I DIDNT KNOW BOYS KNEW ABOUT THE JUMP it makes me feel so special cause i'm tall so i wear lots of high-waisted jeans
8772,[deleted]
8773,EVERY GUY KNOWS ABOUT THE JUMP AND ITS AMAZING FOR MANY REASONS.
8774,Lmao y’all thirsty asf
8775,Haha. I thought it was obvious that guys like it. Because you know just imagine what it looks like haha
8776,Why does the word abdomen have to invoke spiders to my mind?
8777,"Nah low waisted is the worst, normal jeans are alright but high waisted are better"
8778,Nah it just looks good
8779,I’m not that big of an ass guy but it does make her hips stand out more and shows off the abdomen and I think that’s what does it for me.
8780,We all know the other reason too but we keep it hush hush
8781,Hell yeah brother
8782,English.
8783,spanish because its the second most spoken language in the world and i already know english well
8784,Japanese so I can play the big dick move and watch anime without sub or dub
8785,Chinese cuz its rly hard and id never learn it otherwise
8786,"German, I’m already fluent in English and mostly fluent in Irish, being fluent in German would just be a big help in school."
8787,Why not Mandarin. It's the most spoken language in the world
8788,Yes me same
8789,I WANT ASSEMBLY
8790,[deleted]
8791,Same. Too many people assume everyone on the internet is part of the 5% Americans
8792,Ayyy my boy
8793,mandarin is a good option too but i would like to learn spanish more
8794,"Technically japanese penis size average is on the lower end, so idk bro"
8795,german is an awesome language tbh./deutsch ist ne tolle sprache
8796,Irish. It's not useful but it would be nice to speak it
8797,Seconded
8798,Russian
8799,"French, half of my family speaks French but I don’t so that would make communicating way easier"
8800,Ich sprechen ein bisschein Deutsch. I gave up learning because the different forms of 'the' were too confusing
8801,"Este guey no sabe español. Lol I'm just kidding dude, spanish is a pretty cool language as it helps when learning French."
8802,Because we need to support The Motherland
8803,"Dutch, because I like the language. It's similar to both English and German and it sounds funny."
8804,I’d choose simlish because why not
8805,"Mandarin. It's the most used language and Chinese culture is pretty cool, so it would be useful when I'm researching their history."
8806,same here except i mostly just wanna get a nice grade on my latin class
8807,"Not gonna lie, I don't assume that a whole lot. I typically more assume Europe and the UK."
8808,chinese is my first language too and now im just total shit at it lmao
8809,"German or English  


I'm sad to see noone said Swedish."
8810,Same. I've tried to learn it but it's so god damn hard
8811,"Chinese is a language, but isn’t only one language. It has Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, Hakka etc."
8812,I've never been called it. I certainly don't want to be thought of as a simp.
8813,[deleted]
8814,"It’s dumb that when I just hang out with my best friend (who is a girl, who’s pretty attractive to people) I get called a simp"
8815,Simp!! (Jk the concept of it is so dumb)
8816,People love to overuse terms
8817,It ain't simping if it's your girl. Too many people forgot that.
8818,I never get called simp. I am SIMPLY TOO CHAD
8819,Bro same
8820,It’s lost is meaning cause people kept using it to describe people who are nice to women
8821,"let's see, I'll give it a shot.

in this regard, you're dead"
8822,Yeah its just kinda a meme at this point
8823,Unless they mean like twitch streamer simps then it’s dumb. If I’m a simp for hanging with a girl then hell yeah I’m a simp.
8824,This
8825,👏
8826,I hate being called one as I'm probably the opposite to one. I compliment both guys and girls but don't fawn over girls and treat them like royalty as that's what simps do
8827,Actually I think the concept is fairly funny because there are a lot of simps out there doing dumb stuff for girls. It has just been overused and used when it really shouldn't have which ruined it.
8828,"Think of the average person who regularly uses the word simp.

Why would I care in the slightest what they think?"
8829,"the meaning of simp in actuality means people who are blindly submissive for a relationship, towards any gender by any gender, however, because of attention whores, the proper definition has been diluted and is now used to spit on people who are legitimately decent people, which sucks."
8830,Same
8831,"I feel like originally the term had meaning, but it's spiraled out of control and it's just nothing now."
8832,Not giving opinion but if someone calls you a simp tell her / him yeah i simp for your mom she got a big ass
8833,"Shit, my cover has been blown."
8834,simp
8835,"Yeah it's pretty dumb. The funny thing is, most of the guys calling other guys simps aren't getting any girl's anytime soon."
8836,"Its just a meme bro, its so similar to 'Noob' only it is used in different context. Although the idea of just saying hi to a girl and being called a simp is just utterly ridiculous.
(Sorry for error not my first language)"
8837,"People online be like ""Oh? You're talking and being nice to a girl? YOU'RE A SIMP!"" it's annoying, but nobody here does it IRL"
8838,"Thank you, kind stranger!"
8839,"According to your profile, you’re active in r/askteengirls. SIMP.

~ Some jerk trying to be funny"
8840,"True, the only people that use it are people even more butthurt than I am about not having a gf, so they try to shame other people for having one."
8841,Same except called her out on being one too
8842,"Kinda. It’s not as bad as in movies. I’d say that the hardest part is approaching them to start a conversation, but i find that difficult with both genders"
8843,"I get that, but I also can’t wrap my head around it. How can someone just not talk to half the student population? Even during class?"
8844,[deleted]
8845,"there's a difference, yes I can ask Olga what the cos of 42° is, but I wouldn't dare ask a different girl if she wants to hang out some time"
8846,I don’t mean just approaching girls you like. Some tv shows just have guys that have zero friends who are girl and can’t even talk to random girls who ask for a pencil or something
8847,"Wow, you described me perfectly"
8848,It's 0.743
8849,This. Exactly this
8850,I have trouble because they always seem to have different tastes so never know whether I'm saying something that they like or something that they dont. I can talk to any stranger about anything tho
8851,"We do.

I used to freeze while talking to girls till 6 months ago."
8852,"At least for me, I have no reason to talk to girls so I don’t"
8853,Because they are awkward
8854,Man are you a mirror? Cuz you're the same as me
8855,Username checks out
8856,radian or degree?
8857,Fuck that hits too close to home
8858,So he likes it
8859,The stuttering thing I think is just in movies but guys do have trouble with it
8860,if it was a degree it would be minuscule so hopefully radian
8861,It is degree.
8862,"A lot do have trouble actually, and I'm sure they prefer the girls talking to them."
8863,"No, i mean i don’t know what i would talk about so i just don’t have conversations."
8864,Yes i struggle a lot ngl
8865,i do because i can’t talk to people i don’t know and if i do it’s a very awkward conversation. i typically say stuff in a conversation if i see that i can make a shitty joke in there or if it’s something i’m into.
8866,"Nah, I suck at flirting I’m absolutely terrible but like a normal conversation with a girl is easy"
8867,I indeed do have zero female friends ...but why does it matter? I dont need them nor do i want them
8868,"I'm in an allboys school, though it's built in with a girla only. Log story tho"
8869,Oh hey Olga
8870,I’m not gay either so
8871,"Because they never tried it, not even a single time they thought about having conversations with the opposite sex and so they have trouble when trying to do it."
8872,"OK, most importantly, if you're not comfortable, he needs to respect that.  You're 14, don't let him pressure you into doing something you're uncomfortable with.  If he can't handle that, he's not the guy for you.

For me personally, I wouldn't mind at all.  I'd rather wait for that myself."
8873,"i'm appreciating all these guys commenting stuff like this, it's reassuring to me because i want to take things slow but i also know that with my current bf, i'd like to lose my virginity to him"
8874,"Adding something to the comment above:

Sex is a **bonus** to a relationship, not the base. It should never be considered a necessity for a relationship to work."
8875,Ok thanks
8876,sex shouldn't even be a factor at 14 imo
8877,Im seeing too many 15s for this to be comfortable
8878,"No, if a girl is saving herself for marriage then that’s her choice. Personally I am not hasty to have sex. I’m not wanting to save exclusively for marriage, if I truly like a girl and the moment arises where we’re gonna have sex and I feel it’s the right time then I’ll do it. But say my partner wants to wait for marriage then I will wait till we either break up or get married, I don’t think it’s ok to try and pressure your partner into sex against their wishes. That just isn’t a healthy relationship.

edit: you’re also 14, to me I think 14 is too young an age to be having sex at, 15 is I believe the limit for me. my previous statement still stands and that he shouldn’t pressure you into having sex, but this is a bonus on top of that."
8879,No. If a guy breaks up with you over lack of sex he cares more about using you than loving you. I'm waiting for marriage myself.
8880,You're fucking 14 if he forces you he's a dick without good dick anyway
8881,"Facts I would say 16-17 is when you can start considering it if you’re ready, but 18 and up is probably ideal so you know you have your shit figured out. 14, 13 is way too early. Even 16 is probably too early for most people but that depends on your level of maturity, etc.
Even waiting is always an option. The age people are being pressured / sexualized is getting younger and younger which is sort of fucked up imo. 14 year olds don’t need to be making these decisions."
8882,"To me it isn’t. There should be a common ground of agreement to doing it without pressure imo, especially if you wanna wait until you feel ready or the time is right to do it."
8883,Ok thanks
8884,Bro theres only a one year difference between us and them
8885,Well tbh girls want sex just as much if not more than guys so I think everyone should go at their own pace.
8886,Women are temporary. Constantinople is forever.
8887,"Im no special either, 12 through 16 is odd. My bro lost it at 17 so i guess thats fine."
8888,"Deus Vult, brother!"
8889,No problem.  I hope your boyfriend can understand your position.
8890,"What he said. Do NOT have sex with him if you’re only doing it for him and if you’re being pressured into it. Have sex when you want to and if you feel ready for it.

Also 14 is too young anyways. Don’t let him make you feel bad for not doing something you’re not comfortable with."
8891,i mean fifteen isn’t that bad. i’m not a virgin but i lost it at 16. but i also knew ppl who lost theirs at like twelve and that’s kinda sus
8892,And those kids will grow up to have serious problems
8893,Exactly my thought. I was super concerned about the fact she'd 14
8894,[deleted]
8895,"To be honest it is a major variable in a lot of relationships, if a person with a high sex drive is in a relationship with someone with a low libido it is perfectly natural for that person to be dissatisfied with the relationship and it’s justified for that person to want to break up with the other. In many relationships it is not just a bonus."
8896,"Everyone was fucking at 14 and some were at 13 lol in my middle school and highschool infact Im not condoning or fetishsizing this behavior but we heard and witnessed 12 year olds fucking in the stalls, basically everyone was ducking at that time tbh no wonder kids get pressured to have sex early. I remember at my middle school we had an 8th grade boy having sex with a 6th grade girl behind the school in the woods as fucked up as that sounds"
8897,okay you’re the only person who has said this so far and i rly agree
8898,For me definitely not. It is her choice and I respect that
8899,I'm certainly not speaking out of experience but it is definitely better to make it something special than to rush it. Even if you're not together anymore in a few months/years it should be a memory that you can value and remember smiling.
8900,"Yeah my girlfriend tells me about it all the time, and yes society wants to pretend women don’t have a sex drive, if I think back to 5th I remember during joint(male and female)  sex Ed they were talking heavily about how a man gets aroused and this and that. I think someone asked if the same thing happens to women and the dude said no. 🤣"
8901,Guys might think it’s personal or that they’re ugly. Let them know your reasoning
8902,That's the exact same thing that happened with ours but they couldn't find out who it was so they started giving detentions to everyone who followed it
8903,Mine too all they post is random   gossip story about   plus meme are fucking  trash
8904,"Bruh. Is that even legal? Like, it's outside of the school..."
8905,"Yeah. There's even a reddit one but I am the only one who posts ""memes"". Its more of just me venting my frustration from power hungry librarians and the pain in the ass rules that the school has. It's on my main account though."
8906,"Directly expelling students who followed the page probably isn’t legal, but if that meme page has any mention of the actual school on it anywhere, then the school has the right to press charges. Sorta like how if you create a business, if someone sets up a fake account for your business and then tries to make you look bad, you can take them to court."
8907,"One of my teachers is a pedo. Or at least we think. He arranges seating chart so that all the girls are in the front of the classroom, and he was also caught watching porn where the girl was dressed up as a cheerleader. All the students think he should be fired but the school hasn’t done anything."
8908,"Yeah man, there are like three of them in this insane small library. All they do is walk around and tell people to fuck off. They will tell us to leave 10 minutes before class starts during our break and say that they are also on break and deserve the library empty because of it. Like no you don't, this is your fucking job, you do not deserve to push us around with your 40 000 + USD salary.

&#x200B;

Imagine letting such a minute amount of power get to your head like that."
8909,power hungry librarians?
8910,"Yeah but it's really bad, it used to be ok but they sold the account and now it's just terrible"
8911,"Yeah, they had one but it was pretty cringe and got shutdown because it turned pretty nasty with the admins basically just randomly accusing male teachers of looking at young girls' butts and boobs and shit like that

Like those meme pages can be funny but it shouldn't just turn into teacher bullying"
8912,Not gonna dox myself bro
8913,"“Selling fresh new meme page, slightly used but still good condition. Prices start at 20$, hmu”"
8914,"i know the pain man our school also had a asshole librarian. she fucking never let me read a book! cause i was amongst the ""bad students"". 
i was glad that our town had a little library."
8915,I want the memes dummy
8916,It's not official. It's a FB Group which means I've never seen it. I've hear a lot of it is cruel but accurate because of all the scandals our football team has had over the years.
8917,"Yeah, it has two actually, one for the main school and one for the sixth form. The sixth form also used to also have a 'tinder' instagram account where people would send the account messages about who they liked, but people complained about it because some messages called people ugly and others were just really creepy. It got shut down by the head of the sixth form, which caused the account to rename itself to the fan club of one of the students in my year and blatantly framing that student for the creation of the account. Nobody found out who actually ran the account.

Also me and my friends once got a photo of the head of sixth form and content-aware scaled it, then printed it out and gave it to people. The head in question thought it was hilarious. Our sixth form has a 'meme board' so that content-awared photo is now a permanent fixture in the common room, along with that time we created a fake communist party to run in the mock election and we designed a communist version of the school logo."
8918,One time there was a pedo at my school and when the police came to school everyone made memes about it and then school made everyone take down the memes
8919,I hate it so much when girls just Go around saying X is a pedo because he looked at my boobs.
8920,Yeah. These people should not be let near power. Some people just can not handle it.
8921,Wdym wym? It's pretty obvious
8922,Bruh no. It's with my main. I don't want to get found out.
8923,What if the school has a common name: e.g. “river school” or something and you were to use the name river in the page but no logos or anything belonging to the school. Bc we had something similar except it was a confessions page abt the school but it mysteriously vanished and I don’t think that would’ve given ground for them to take action
8924,"i think we have a subreddit

Not by the school itself, just some students"
8925,"makker

de description bevat letterlijk de stad en de naam van de school ik vertel je niets"
8926,"Bitch, I run it"
8927,Hoe heet het?
8928,I mean I'm not gonna post what school I go to for everyone on Reddit to see
8929,"My school did and it was great, until the school led an investigation, they found the two people who ran the account and they were expelled, so yeah i wouldn’t recommend :/"
8930,Can you add me to the sub
8931,Why are you so curious to know where I go to school?
8932,"Thanks for the offer but tbh I wouldnt even know where to begin. I dont even know what im feeling most the time. Thats why I described it as ""meh"" because  i juet feel devoid of anything."
8933,That’s perfectly fine. I’m here anytime you are.
8934,"It sounds to me like what your feeling is detached. I felt this a lot when I isolated myself from other people, but it can come from plenty of other things too.   
If you don't see the meaning of life, you might want to look up absurdism. It deals with the existential crisis and how to overcome it."
8935,Too often ugh
8936,I'm Catholic and I always feel trash no matter what 😎😎
8937,Same.
8938,"Thank you but im a stainch atheist. I dont ahve anything against religous peopke seeing as i just was one up unti, about 6 months ago but I dont think that sib would help me. Im glad it helped you though!"
8939,"Yeah, I second this. A year back I wouldn't have expected to be the person I am today. Funny what some good people, some good music and a shit ton of reading and introspecting can do for you. Be a friend to yourself."
8940,"Yeah, I feel everything you just described. Quite ironic condsidering that I don't feel lmao"
8941,"Yeah! I feel Meh every time my phone's battery starts to reach 8% :/

_**I'm assuming that the majority's gonna say ""yeah, right after jerkin' off"" or something similar to that.**_"
8942,Yep
8943,"I'm a Catholic myself, and I haven't struggled with this is much because my faith has helped guide me along what I should be doing with my life. Does this mean I have a perfect life and am happy all the time? No, but I can't really say I've been through a period of depression, thankfully.

Not trying to put pressure on you or anything, but if you ever feel like it you can post about this in r/Catholicism just to see if any of the responses can give you something you haven't thought before. I've seen a good amount of posts like these and I just don't see how we could be meant for a life that is meaningless.

Anyway, keep it in the back of your head, if you want, I hope you have a good day / night!"
8944,Yeah...i mean i am being home schooled right now and go weeks or even up to over a month without seeing anyone my age. And i looked it up and checks out to me.
8945,Brainwashed gang*
8946,"Yeah I feel it a lot of the time. That feeling like when you're in a video game and you don't have any quests or goals.  

I usually try to find a goal when I'm feeling like that. Either that or I think about all the cool stuff I wish I could do, pick one of them and start working on it.
I find the best remedy is to find something you can work towards. That tends to help my moods when I'm meh."
8947,"Gonna be honest, I have tons of hobbies, but that's barely done anything to counter said feeling. I wouldn't exactly endorse this solution. Personally, at least."
8948,I feel that
8949,"I've had periods like that, find a passion or a hobby, it gives you motivation and something to strive for"
8950,Normal at our age my guy
8951,"This is exactly how I've been feeling throughout this school year. Those words clicked with me. While I'm struggling with it too, don't let it get you down. We both have so much ahead of us, it may suck now, but I bet you it's soon going to be phenomenal. For every dark moment, we have our brightest days. Hang in there, we're all here for you. :)"

8957,"Yeah kinda in it at this very second, I've been using drugs to fill the void recently but hopefully the happy part everyone talks about comes soon."
8958,"All the time. It seems like that’s all I feel sometimes. Like most of the time I don’t have anything to be really sad about, but I don’t have anything to make me really happy either."
8959,"Totally! Find something (or multiple things) you enjoy doing, and do it! For me these are guitar and rock climbing, and I always feel so much better after doing them"

8962,Kayaking when my boat flipped out in the middle of the lake
8963,Yeah driving I've been there too. Friend almost killed two people while on a bike.
8964,"Once or twice on the highway before when I was driving by myself, I drive a lot more definitively now because I don’t trust any other cars on the road unless I know the driver and trust the driver, which boils it down to pretty much friends and their parents along with my parents."
8965,"THIS.
kayaking now scares the shit out of me because i was alone and that lake had water moccasins. i flipped, hit my head(and probably just about needed stitches) and couldn't touch the ground because i was just about as far from shore as possible. every plant that touched my leg made me scream. took me an hour to swim with my kayak back to our campsite. i now refuse to kayak"

I’ve been kayaking once, on a lake on a field trip, and it was awesome.

8978,"Probably a lesson everyone should know: don’t fuck around near pools. Doesn’t matter if you’re trying to... throw some girl in it, don’t fuck around with them. 

Reasons you should goof off around a pool:

• On a slippery surface

• Said surface happens to usually be hard as fuck

• You’re near a deep body of water"

guys staring at my penis,

guys grabbing my penis while it was in my pants

various slurs and racial insults thrown around, random miscellaneous screaming,

and to top it all off, a guy masturbated right next to me ""as a joke"" while he was high from eating weed brownies."
9091,😳
9092,I’m that guy who pushed myself into a corner. Actually I was sensitive about people seeing me naked so I came up with a contraception where I put the towel between two lockers in a corner so it would hold itself up and I could change in peace.
9093,My friends and I always started a group sing-along almost everyday. Really all it was was that we started singing a i want it that way and people joined in. Our pe teachers were so annoyed.

9118,">he's my friend I want to hug him like how I hug my other friends 

I'm not sure it's necessarily awkward if you just say this. ""You're my friend and I'd like to hug you like I hug my other friends. Can I hug you"""
9119,"some of my classmates have already asked if i’m into him because i lean on him to watch him play games on his phone when i’m bored, i don’t wanna imagine if i hugged him how much explaining i’d have to do aaaa"

9123,"Ah yes, hello there human male companion, I too am human and not a robot sent down to kill all of you humans. I mean us humans."
9124,trust me. no guy is gonna turn down a hug from a female friend unless he is dating someone.
9125,Just hug
9126,"I think the hugging part would be pretty easy. The problem is he'll 100% think you're into him, and guys can develop crushes really easily, so I wouldn't be surprised if he's into you."
9127,yes. I have a really close female friend and I've never hugged a girl before. I'm not really all that physically expressive when it comes to friends but she is. She literally hugs me all the time and has put her head on my shoulder but i don't think much of it. I just go along with it to keep her happy.
9128,Don't ask. When you're hanging out and you're about to go your own ways just put your arm around him and then just a bit more every time. I'm sure he won't complain.
9129,"Actually though. Guys love physical affection just as much as Women. Just give us a hug, we won't complain."
9130,"""Wanna hug? Just as friends tho"""
9131,"""Got any games on your phone?"""
9132,"Greet them with ‘Hey!’ and put your arms out. The hardest part will likely be not acting awkward, but as long as you act confident rather than cheeky it’s less likely to be seen as flirty."
9133,“guys can develop crushes really easily” SIR ELABORATE
9134,sounds like a plan to me
9135,that’s so sweet :( you don’t mind it at all ?
9136,"Lmao okay lemme tell you something:

Guys generally don't have super powerful crushes on people, they grow them over time (at least my friends and I do). The more time they spend with you and how you act can turn a guy's minor interest into a huge crush.

Also he probably has a crush on you if he:

1. Always is available to hangout or talk and prioritizes being with you.
2. Just wants to be around you. Even if he's not talking he always wants to be near you no matter what he's doing.
3. Offers to help you do boring stuff (like homework) or something to spend more time with you.
4. He smiles a lot when you're around, like a lot.
5. He looks to you after doing something cool or making a joke while in a group. This is because he is trying to get your approval and that out of the group you matter most to him.

With how physical you are if there was the slightest chance he'd have a crush on you he definitely has one."
9137,you think so ?
9138,I used to feel a little uncomfortable but i’m used to it at this point.
9139,LIFESAVER i’m taking mental notes what this is so much good information you’re the best !!
9140,Yeah probably.
9141,"Just suspecting a girl has a crush on a guy can give him a crush. Being physical can cause a crush. If he's friends with you and you're not \*extremely\* ugly then he probably has a crush on you.

&#x200B;

Edit: This is what I'm getting from what little info you've provided. I'm just saying what I think, don't take it as fact."

9158,"Sometimes ill see a thread thats interesting so i upvote, but then i dont have an answer to the question so i just upvote."

9168,No karma for the other karma is for me hehehehehehehehe
9169,"well, its because most people don't upvote, maybe because they don't like the questions, or more because they're more interested in the actual answer

I know i had a question that had around 4 upvotes and 100 answers."
9170,I upvote and not comment. Lol most of the time I don't know what to answer or the answer I was gonna say was said by one of those fast ass mods
9171,"Why does it matter? I don't want to be obliged to do anything.

I rarely vote even because votes seem worthless points shit. Sure, if something actually really positively influences me, I will upvote, but generally I probably have 10 times more comments than upvotes.

Well, I might (it'd probably be my only chance at it). But u/urmumsydad raised a good point, it depends on what ""she"" looks like. 

Would she look like an EXACT CARBON-COPY of me, or just a female looking me? If the latter, then yea. But if it's the first option, then I'd have to pass. 

They say ""if you saw a clone of yourself walking down the street, you wouldn't recognize them at all"" but I think I'd recognize this ugly looking dipshit.

Good question tho."

I was actually reading Ultimate Spider-Man and at one point Peter Parker gets multiple clones, one of them being a female one.  I thought she seemed kind of hot (hair and costume might’ve been why? Don’t know what that was about me.)"
9275,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA! I have to say, you sir, are quite humorous! I came to this comment section not excpecting to get a laugh better than the one I got from the original post, but you've done it! You absolute mad genius! For all the people with less than 140 IQ (I've taken a test online, mine was along the lines of 230), the fine gentleman I'm responding to mentioned the song 'Sweet Home Alabama' by the Rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. This is a reference to the high incest rate of the state. Oftentimes me and the boys at our 'Genius Club' should I say (we meet every Tuesday after school to talk about intellectual topics such as physics, philosophy and the development of AI (that's Artificial Intelligence for you dumbasses)) crack jokes at the expense of Alabama with its high incestuality, but I don't expect peasants like you to have the subtle sense of humor we have. Again, my kind friend, I'll have to congratulate you on coming up with such an amazing piece of humor and delivering it in such a subtle manner. If they awarded people with actual life skills like you with humor and me with my deep understanding of quantum physics (I'm even self-taught) instead of those jocks at school that do nothing with their lifes but play sports maybe we'd live in a society that wasn't so fucked up. But most people don't understand smart guys like us, and we just have to put up with living alongside complete braindead morons every day. I quote the great Adolph Hitler: ""I use emotion for the many and reserve reason for the few."" These words of that quite excellent man convey my emotions so well in this time and place, that I ought to get philosophical myself. ""If the unintelligent masses rule over the intelligent few, what purpose is there to exist?"" (Don't quote me on that lol I just think about stuff like this quite often.) The situation we are at reminds me too well about the novel '1984' written by George Orwell. In the novel language is being heavily moderated in the same manner many people responding to you here are trying to censor your innocent, albeit a bit dark joke. But I will forgive them, they will all be forgiven by death at the end. To quote Jesus on this: ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."" (Don't worry I'm not a religitard, I was just bored in religion class and decided to browse the Bible and found this pretty cool quote.) But hey you seem like a really rad friend, maybe you'd like to join our club for intellectual persons? If you don't live in Houston you can attend via Skype, just add me. My Skype name is adam.goldberg. One of our members is a communist so we can't talk about how (((Jews))) rule the world but he's moving to LA next fall so until then. But, after all these pleasantries, I have to thank you one more time, for making me laugh and for bringing me one step back from the brink of suicide!"
9276,Ofc that's one of the first things you think of.
9277,No one said you like your appearance in the first place
9278,"Sure, two extra hands to help out, fuck it. Hell, I'd Jill my clone off.

It just feels unnatural"
9292,"I stay in the same boat pretty much. The people I consider my closest friends are actually some of my cousins. Everyone else seems to come and go. Pretty hard keeping long term friends sometimes. I get attached to people so that’s hard for me, I def understand."
9293,"It’s really good advice, I know that’s what I should do, but how would you recommend chilling out and not being desperate af? Also I’m nervous that if I stop actively looking for it then it won’t ever come."
9294,"I just stopped caring after a while, and that's when i met this dude max on discord. I was just looking for a fureteam for destiny 2 on discord and after we did the strike, he just stayed in the chat and we talked for like 2 hours! A few days later he thought I'd be a good fit for his raid team so now i know another 4 people :)"

9298,"I definitely don’t think inaction is the best course to take, just start a conversation with someone, find common ground. If that’s too much just position yourself around people and chime in when you hear something you can relate to. And don’t be afraid to ask to hang out outside of school or work or clubs or wherever - that’s the hardest part."
9299,"I’ve had a couple online friends before, but does it ever feel weird for you? Like, not as good as irl friends?"
9300,"What if they are having the same thought? Now neither of you are going to have each other as a friend. It’s good to let some people approach you too of course, but you need to be able to be the one to do so as well."
9301,"Honestly you’ve just gotta wait it out. Eventually someone will find an interest in you and you’ll end up speaking to them. I know how you feel because I was literally like this a month ago. If you feel that it’s right, you can go ahead and approach people but be aware that eventually other people will naturally want to go to you for whatever reason be it that you’ve spoken in class or you’re alone."
9302,"I know bro, saaaame. At least I know I can say I’ve never abandoned a friendship, it was always the other person. But if they don’t need me in their life, then I guess it’s better that way anyway"
9303,"Try to get into conversations with people, and try to find a topic you both like"
9304,"Wise words Mr..... MckNeckass.



I love reddit."
9305,"That’s the only way to do it. I’m just not good at talking to people without making a fool of myself. And if it goes successfully, they tend to grow distant after a while."
9306,"I mean, it's definitely not as good but it's the best i can get right now."
9307,"This is the right answer right here, the hobby doesn't absolutely need to force you to interact with people but that may make it easier. Finding a hobby which you do in a group is a great way to get friends though. I don't have any friends IRL but I've met a few people on Twitch chat and Twitter because we were all interested in Overwatch."
9308,Get a hobby that requires you to interact with people.
9309,"Honestly, I dont, I have like 3 friends, 3 other people who tolerate me, and that's about it"
9310,All you need to do is talk to people. You are in college with new people around you. Sit next to new people introduce yourself ask them about them and just you know.. talk.
9311,"Makes me anxious, but introducing yourself to strangers would spark conversations and may actually work. I’ll try it. Thanks."
9312,"If you think that’s funny, I’d check out r/rimjob_steve"
9313,"I’ve left friendships that I thought were too toxic for my own good because I cared about them substantially more than they cared about me. That’s how I lost the best friend of my life, but she was pretty mean to me too tbh."
9314,It's not weird.

9327,just go to kindergartens if you want a gf smh
9328,Ayo Welcome to the club bud
9329,"lmao I feel that, it does seem like some people tend to have a lot of relationships while I haven’t even been in one yet. I’ve gotten to where I’m ok with that because it’ll mean that when I do find someone the relationship should be worth it"
9330,"Yeah, my teacher’s stubble made it really hurt 😞"
9331,Damn straight
9332,"Wow, I was having a great day so far"
9333,"I’ve never had one. And it’s weird since I am in the top 25 of my class of almost 800, so people do know me, but I’ve never been asked out. I also never asked someone out because I have no idea how to do it, I have no idea how to flirt since no one taught me. I’ve just kinda accepted it and will just try to get with someone in college if I’m lucky

Edit: I probably should also mention that I also have trouble finding a girl who would work with me. And that’s hard when you value intelligence, so your stuck with the top 50 girls, half of who are dating, and the other have you hate for their arrogance"
9334,"exactly, that's what i always do"
9335,People like that confuse me lmao

9349,18 w/o a relationship. Never even kissed as well.
9350,"Yes officer, this comment right here."

9352,same lmao it just reminds me of how much I lack physical attention

9356,No it's just wholesome and I like it
9357,"Here's a virtual hug friend.

lmao seriously though same. I already lack physical touch so reminding me just makes it worse"
9358,"No I am not annoyed by it. I totally get wanting to hug someone without being able to due to corona. If you're just doing it for karma on Reddit then maybe, but if it's in an online convo it totally makes sense"
9359,idk why it mattered in the beginning but yea both ig
9360,I did a post like that but I wanted to make people happy. I didn't do it for karma. I just wanted to make people happier in this time because some people just aren't rn
9361,"No like when people say ""here a virtual hug for you"""
9362,Maybe it doesn't help you idk I understand your viewpoint
9363,Idk but i meant like on reddit bcuz to me it just feels like a really uncreative way of karmawhoring
9364,"Do you mean things like this: 🤗?

It's one of my favorite emojis. I even have a keyboard macro to make it easy to use."
9365,*virtual hug*

9368,I always saw this as jazz hands.
9369,"Ah ok, I don't really care they can do what they want"
9370,That wasnt my point? My point is i dont see why it should matter whichever I say lmao it gets the message across
9371,strongly disagree
9372,"Dude yes, plus I'll take any hug I can get haha. Ultimately its just a kind message though, not really worth thinking more into it than that"
9373,Oh. If that's why someone does it then I hope they won't get any karma for it. I just use mine to express the emotion of giving someone a friendly or just comforting hug. I don't care much about karma.
9374,"No, I love it. It’s super wholesome!

^and ^for ^some ^of ^us ^nobody ^hugs ^us ^in ^real ^life"
9375,But it dont help for shit
9376,"The Unicode Consortium defines that as a [Hugging Face](https://emojipedia.org/hugging-face/), but it can be used for Jazz Hands.

>May be used to offer thanks and support, show love and care, or express warm, positive feelings more generally. Due to its hand gesture, often used to represent jazz hands, indicating such feelings as excitement, enthusiasm, or a sense of flourish or accomplishment."
9377,Delete this
9378,Same lol
9379,Actually no. I think they show you that they care and wants to be nice. Ofc they won't buy a plane ticket to go and hug a stranger.

9416,yeah lmao i wanted to make it clear since a lot of people (even guys) don’t quite understand *why* post nut clarity happens
9417,"Ok a girl here, it is still possible for us to achieve post-nut clarity. I have done it a few times and the best way to describe it is like your mind is clear and your third eye gets opened. It makes you think about the other possibilities of your decision. It’s just a bit uncommon among girls in media because when we nut we don’t necessarily “nut” we just cum but same thing applies."
9418,Always my dude... always
9419,I bet Einstein utilised post-nut clarity to come up with his theorems
9420,You ever get post nut clarity and be like: I wanna stop masturbating
9421,"I experience it sometimes, but like, it's not severe. Like ""Shit, that shit I busted to might be a bit weird. Must've been kinda awkward for the people in the video""."
9422,"I'm just scared of the idea that maybe some serial killers experience this. I mean, certain serial killers kill because they're horny. It's their sexaul attraction. Imagine being horny and you kill somebody and then post nut clarity hits and you realise how fucked up you really are. But you just can't stop yourself. It must be horrible."
9423,"Yea when horny your brain has one objective and when its reached your brain is like ""wtf why""








It's like training so hard to win and then when you do win you realize it's not that big of a deal"

9434,When I first like started masturbating I would finish and I would feel like it's a dirty thing cuz I was like 11 or 12. Of course now I don't think it's that bad and I know that it's a totally normal thing so I don't get it anymore.
9435,"100%

i was gonna agree to hook up with this girl from my school but then i had a wank and when post nut clarity hit i remembered that i fucking hate this chick and she’d definitely tell the entire school"

Over text? Less than average/average, as idk how to read body language of someone when they are fucking kilometers away lol."

*and without a swedish gorl*😥😥"
9454,"You made me laugh loud reading this, thanks"
9455,"I only flirt with my friends but I think I'm pretty decent. Like a few days ago I took one of my girl friends hands, twirled her around and put my arm around her and said ""sup?"""
9456,Yeah bro. It's so much tougher on text since the touching and body language part is missing
9457,"I've done that too!

Except I gave her that little dip thing in the end."
9458,"Oh shit, looks like we have a real cool Joe on the block guys, watch out, next thing you know you turn the corner and there he is. With his half smile and everything. If you're not careful he'll make you the center of attention with his compliments that are not layed on too thick.

9462,If only there was more than 1 not straight guy in 100 miles of me lol
9463,I don't really mind lol
9464,ikr! One advantage of text flirting though is that you can always just rethink what you wrote. Can't do that while talking continuously lmao.
9465,Never tried so I guess I have a 100% success rate
9466,"I give them stone cold psychopath look directly in the eyes, she feels uncomfortable, so she turns her look, she checks again in about 5 mins but there I am, staring at her, no flinch and drinking my pure whiskey, no cola,not like the other whimps of our age, I down the fucking shot, I'm supposed to move in, but no, I hold my ground, and wait for her to initiate. Eventually that never happens and she will probably think of me as a creep and I'll go home sad"

9473,Seems risky.
9474,Can't she just turn me into a vampire too?
9475,*kinky
9476,Will I become a vampire if she drinks my blood?
9477,I’d give her 470 mls of my blood every year on our anniversary.
9478,Will she eventually turn me into a vampire if our relationship develops that much?
9479,"I’m into fitness, digging ditches through an isthmus! Rough riding down to Cuba like what’s up bitches?!"
9480,Wait so who's blood is gonna get sucked then? Vampires can't suck other vampires blood right? So threesome then? And then it just goes on and on till the whole world is just a giant vampire orgy..

Ive had blood drawn before, its like no big deal at all."

9492,470 mls is a safe amount of blood given during blood donations. I did research on it. That amount of blood also restores itself within the body of a homo sapien in anywhere from 24-48 hours.

9504,That's what I came from
9505,"Thats so short, I started using reddit back then and this was one of the first subs I subscribed to. I thought it was here for ages"
9506,"What a journey it has been. I remember seeing a post on r/teenagers, then I visited ATG and ATB, I saw the mod apps so I straight away applied on both the subs.        

I was interviewed by these amazing people, u/Gamesareunderrated and u/GreekLoser for ATG and then thankfully got approved and modded. It has been so great knowing you all guys through the time. Sadly, Greek had to leave the mod spot for personal reasons but we're still very much in contact (P.S. It was her birthday this week, so if you know her by any means, go and wish her).        

We have faced a few backlashes as moderators of ATG but mostly it has been a lovely journey and I have had a great time helping you guys.          

Thanks for all the support. 🧡"
9507,I came from there too. I’m really glad I saw that post because these subs are a good replacement to r/teenagers
9508,"Happy 4 month anniversary!

I’ve only been here for 20 days though..."
9509,"Oh damn, only 4 months ago?"
9510,😢 Mason istg you're literally the sweetest person 💖

9512,I really love both of the subs! I've been here for about 2-3 months
9513,❤💗
9514,"I'm really thankful to Kate for this amazing opportunity that she has given us to help her. I love ATB and ATG so much and I remember being really happy when she asked me to help mod ATB when ATB had absent mods. 

ATG and ATB have grown into such amazing subreddits and I am so thankful for u/Mason0816 and u/Kate_19035 for standing beside me and guiding me along with the moderation of both subs. I continue to advertise both subs very very often to help them grow and they have grown beautifully.


I'm very thankful for the mods and users u/Mason0816 u/Kate_19035 u/CatMafia_ and u/MyDadInventedGoogle for keeping a smile on my face when I was being attacked or when I was going through a depressive phase. 

I hope that this community continues to blossom beautifully and that I meet more amazing people. 


I'll continue to help grow and mod this wonderful sub and ATG.  I love you ATB and ATG. Thanks for being amazing ❤💗"
9515,"Aye hey, thanks!"
9516,I came here from someone's profile don't remember why I was looking at it but ATB/ATG were frequent subreddits for them.
9517,"Likewise Games, not only have you helped me so much with learning to mod but you've been such a great person to know as well. 💜"
9518,No way that was 4 months ago.
9519,Awesome! I’d love to volunteer to mod
9520,"Wow, 4 months and the subs have grown so much. I remember finding r/AskTeenGirls and being so happy cause I'd been wanting to find that type of subreddit for over a year. The entire moderation team is awesome, and I'm really grateful you and u/Gamesareunderrated reached out to me for a modding position on ATG, it's been a fun journey so far and I look forward to being apart of it for a while. :)"

9535,Cool
9536,Dam so disappointing to hear that overseas it's almost just as bad as here
9537,"depends on what movie/tv shows, if it shows them as depressing and suicidal then yes, if it shows them happy and lucky to be alive no, if it shows the bathrooms clean no, our bathrooms aka Juul/cocaine/weed/meth/heroine rooms are very gross, especially the boys, and bullies are not everywhere, and we don't have school shooters everyday"
9538,Bruh only pussies die in school shootings. Like just tell them they can’t kill u. They legally can’t do it without consent
9539,"fuck no. I live in california where it's too hot to have schools be one building 

instead it's a bunch of buildings with multiple rooms (classrooms) scattered around everywhere"
9540,"honestly it kinda depends on how big of an area your in, and when your school was built. like my school hallway, gym, front entrance, and library wise is kind of accurate. the lunch room for us is much more compact. we actually have a massive theatre, so that’s cool. but like we don’t have parking on school campus, and we have a football field but it’s like a mile away."
9541,I came to leave the exact same comment
9542,"No where near. We don't have lockers,free time, ECT. Fun fact if school was a job it would be braking labor laws."
9543,"100% I was surprised about the bullies though, because they’re there it’s just it’s not physical bullying it’s all through texting and antagonizing someone."
9544,They can't kill you if you kill yourself first
9545,You don't have lockers?
9546,"Yeah. No cliques though. Couldnbe because its a tiny school, but everybody gets along unless somebody's being an ass to you."
9547,"It also depends on how big your school is. I go to a school with almost 3000 kids in it, and everyone has lunch at once, so people don't have to sit in the lunch rooms and people just sit wherever"
9548,Haha... no
9549,"We all die you either kill yourself or get killed, *music starts playing*, what u gonna do"
9550,"Same here, we have 4 different buildings and in almost non of them the AC is working"
9551,My school has lockers. Their school is just kinda backwards I guess
9552,Ha we don't even have lunch time u would have to eat on the 10 minute break thats between every two periods and that only applies for the first 4 peroids
9553,"yea, it's just not your traditional ""Hey Billy Imma give you a swirly then shove you into a locker"""
9554,No there seen as a waste of time and cost to much. And yes we go to one of the most ghetto schools in America.
9555,And its rare
9556,"*Yeah, this is big brain time.*"
9557,"Absolutely not, at my school we have lockers, but the school is so big (3k students, 3 floors, a heck a lot of square feet) that having a locker in one section of the school would be redundant when your starting class is at one end of the school, your locker is 2 floors up and several hundred feet away, and then your next class is another floor down and an entire different section of the school. We don't use them. There's also not the general moderate hubbub portrayed in movies, mostly filled with a few obnoxious student s yelling and cussing over larger crowds of students trying to get to class. School lunch portrayal is on point though."
9558,"I have lockers, but my school was *state of the art *  30 years ago"

Like he was persistent and was shoving it in my face, I had to push him off me and he was just really weird about it for some reason like he had to make me try it.

9616,Under 18s really shouldn't be (especially) smoking weed or drinking heavily every weekend tbh. I understand where OP is coming from - I have friends who drink but personally don't like heavy drinkers because I feel left out when I hang out with them (usually they'll always want to drink).
9617,"Yeah I get your point if that's how your friends are.

For me though i normally only drink every 2 or so weeks. Kinda depends what's happening though over summer we getting fucked every weekend. But even so like I never feel pressured to drink when I'm hanging out with them like most of us hanging out is just completely normal friend stuff. Sometimes well hang out earlier in the day do whatever for like 5 hours then whoever wants to drink might go do that later but like no pressure too.

I've personally never smoked weed, not because I don't want to but mostly because my best friend had a bad experience with it once so we just opt to all drink instead."
9618,Depends on who you hang around. You have to choose your friends wisely.
9619,"ik people who pressure me to hang out w them and all they do is smoke. so theyre not directly pressuring me into drugs, but its implied"

9622,"I was literally googling something about beatsaber so I could make a meme about it, and personified beatsaber hentai showed up in the images section despite the fact I had safe search on and it was absolutely unrelated to what I searched. It's everywhere, and it's going to show up somewhere. The average age for exposure to porn is ten years old. I don't think the ten year olds are seeking out porn, but they come across it anyway. I remember personally encountering it when I was seven and looking for Minecraft videos. It's absolutely not avoidable if you browse the internet for any significant length of time.

&#x200B;

Also, it absolutely isn't, but it seems politicians are more interested in helping Disney clutch onto their 90+ year old cartoon so it doesn't fall into the hands of the public."
9623,">personified beatsaber hentai

what.

There is definitely not done enough to stop kids from seeing porn tbh. Google anything, and you'll probably find something."
9624,"I am mostly referring to how almost all of the porn industry's advertising is based off of things like ""barely legal teens"" and it's almost always a girl with braises, dressed like a schoolgirl, and acting like a schoolgirl. Of course, this is TOTALLY just a kink and not at all related to the fact porn search results go up 4600% when school gets out. It couldn't possibly be, that would be ILLEGAL O.O"
9625,What do you mean by this?
9626,"it's disgusting for those who plan on taking a break. trust me, if anytime you decide to take a break (which I highly recommend) you will realise how unavoidable it is and that it's everywhere. after not wanking for a while, you come to your senses, similar to how you feel right after you're done, which for the most part includes disgust towards porn."
9627,"I mean... they know their audience ig.  It's always been that way, even with playboy mags.  I don't think it's disgusting, and it technically isn't illegal as long as they don't flat out say ""yeah, this one is for those under 18"".  I don't usually think about what the target audience was of the brazzers video I just watched... I have more of an issue with all the step-relative shit.  Like, look, I get that some people find it arousing, but can I not just get some normal pov? Please?  Why does everyone have to be related?  That's disgusting."
9628,"Tbf most of that could just be attempting to appeal to a more pedophilia demographic which porn companies definitely try to do and is not illegal, just really weird."
9629,It's one of the many disgusting things the porn industry does
9630,"Dude it's just basic r34, if there wasn't beatsaber hentai,  then the internet wouldn't be in balance"
9631,"I think it is a bit of both, horney teens wanting to look at younger women, and creepy pedos wanting to look at younger women"
9632,"Are you serious? There’s a lot of shit that happens behind closed doors in the porn industry, or even in plain sight. Sex trafficking, actual rape, revenge porn, pedophelia, coercion, blackmail, videos that were shared without ones party’s consent. In India there was a gang rape on the news a few weeks ago, the top search in India for porn was the victims name. Not to mention that it does have a negative effect to people who watch it in excess. It can rewire your brain. Porn addiction is real and so toxic. People who have watched it their whole lives can become desensitised to real life situations and have problems maintaining boners for example. Or when they actually have sex its violent and they try to imitate porn, which is NOT OKAY if there wasn’t a conversation with your partner about it beforehand. It adds to female objectification.

There are several ted talks about this stuff and a lot of studies have been made. Porn isn’t as harmless as you think."
9633,"Definitely illegal but I feel like they get around it by never using teens in their advertising and only as a term for people who are doing porn in the 18-19 range, which is technically legal."
9634,"Lots of teens and underaged women and men end up in the porn industry, many unwillingly. There’s been a petition to shut down pornhub after videos of a 15 year old teen had surfaced a year after she had been kidnapped and had disappeared. Her kidnapped and rapist was found because of a gas station camera, and he is thankfully facing felony charges."
9635,The first time I've been exposed to porn is via adds on the computer. Didn't click or anything but they were pretty explicit. Well... I used to use the same computer as my dad and I didn't really mind about it until few month ago where ot came to my mind and Oh Lord I don't see him in the same way now
9636,"Tbh I was talking about how it isn't legal to watch porn if you aren't 18, not sure how true that is, and that they don't do enough to stop that because horny teens is their audience"
9637,">Tbh I was talking about how it isn't legal to watch porn if you aren't 18, not sure how true that is

There's nothing stating that anyone under the age of 18 is not allowed to view porn. There's only laws against advertising or giving pornographic content to those under the age of 18. That's why sites will ask you if you're older than 18. It's not that you'll get in trouble if you're not 18, it's just that the site needs to make sure they're not liable if you view their content. 

>and that they don't do enough to stop that because horny teens is their audience

They're not obligated to go out of their way to hide it from teens and therefore they won't because yes as you said, they're a large part of the porn industry's audience. However, they can't explicitly target a teen audience either which kind of toes the line with some advertising schemes of some companies."
9638,What exactly do you mean?
9639,"Honestly, the fact it’s audience are teens isn’t the issue with it. The main issue with the porn industry is just how many amateurs turn out to be underaged, some barely highschool freshmen. Many actresses are pressured or coerced into doing acts they aren’t willing to do, and a lot of it is just rape porn in disguise. It’s sad that not many know and even worse that not many even *care*"
9640,"Honestly no, and the only reason you think it's disgusting is because you've told all your life that 18 is adult.

Teens are horny and should be allowed to explore that without being shamed"
9641,"I wouldn't say it's unavoidable, you can download filters and shit onto your computer to block porn websites, along with you know just not searching for porn, how do they target teens though specifically?"
9642,"Its also weird how they emphasize that the ""actress"" just turned 18 in the titles. If they were a year younger it would be considered child pornography and pedophilia."
9643,How does the porn industry target teens?
9644,Agreed
9645,"Teens definitely don't need an easy access to unrealistic porn that showcases little to no respect towards women. Watching a bit of porn may be okay, but the amount that is accessible is way to much.

Teens don't need porn. You are a 14 year old boy, and I'm guessing your dick is talking for you here."
9646,Break from porn or jerking off that gives you post nut clarity
9647,"I'm just wondering how you r34 beatsaber.

It just doesn't make sense to me"
9648,"Sorry that I think child-grooming, hyper-sexualization of teens, the biggest source of sex-trafficking, abuse of women, the act of peddling a product that causes decreased grey-matter in the brain as well as hypo-frontality, and getting children hooked on a highly addictive and unhealthy product that provides ZERO benefit to society disgusting. 

I literally cannot find ONE solid reason for why it should even be legal behind a pay wall with a credit-card lock.

It is FACTUALLY a disgusting industry

 dis·gust·ing/disˈɡəstiNG/ *adjective*

1. arousing revulsion or strong indignation.

All of the things I listed above arouse that in almost EVERY SINGLE mentally healthy person. If you listed out those things to someone without telling them what industry was behind it, they would far more than likely be revolted by it. I can call it disgusting if I want, because factually, it is."
9649,"FUCK THE PORN INDUSTRY

YOU DONT NEED PORN TO NUT"
9650,I hope that in the coming years this view gains traction among teens
9651,100% agree
9652,"Living things are capable of interacting with/reacting to their environment, are made up cells, reproduce on their own (e.g. viruses and computers can’t reproduce without something there to build them for them, so they don’t qualify), maintain homeostasis, have a metabolism, and grow/have a life cycle."
9653,"No that's not scary. I think I'll die and see nothing after my death, I can live with this fact"
9654,I knew I'd find a biologically accurate explanation for it in the comments here somewhere
9655,no thats just cool
9656,It's strange to think that someone could take 13 bullets to the chest and be fine but one small knock to the head and they're gone.
9657,Indeed.
9658,"Yeah I know but what ""magic spark"" separated us from something non living. I mean ultimately we're all made up of the same elements. Idk man."
9659,nah its all perspective in some perspectives we dont even exist no point in getting stressed over it
9660,Yeah. I guess we’re only built to withstand the threats that cavemen faced
9661,"Nope,its kinda cool"
9662,"Once you accept the fact, you stop fearing death as much.

As a matter of fact, your brain has a built-in mechanism to help you cope with the idea of death because those who didn't have it became suicidal. That's because ""what's the point"" always comes up."
9663,"I just dread the day I take my last breaths, and I know that there's no tomorrow. I dread the day that I'm not relevant anymore. I'm just another speck in the universe. A skeleton decaying in the ground. I don't like it. What if I haven't accomplished everything."
9664,"You just don't need to overthink about it. You can do nothing with this, so it's uselles to be scared of it. Instead of thinking about that, do something that will make your life better"
9665,Nah
9666,This absolutely scares me.
9667,"there's no magic. it's just that our brain made it to a point where we acknowledge our presence and therefore every other thing. 
i read a comment which intrigued me a while ago. it said that the idea of soul is derived from the instinct of self-preservation which makes it so we think of ourselves as more important creatures which leads to us valuing our life and want to propagate."
9668,No I think it's cool
9669,i mean MRS GREN is the things used to determine living organisms. it’s been years since i used it but i think it’s Movement Respiration Sensitivity Growth Reproduction Excretion Nutrition.
9670,emotions are chemical reactions and they effect the way you think but they dont make you do things. in the end the decision of what to do is yours. (you can be scared and not run away from the thing for example)
9671,No
9672,"It's not scary to me. Rather, it's fascinating to think about how complex we are and that it's all because of the proper balance of chemicals, hormones, structure, and genetics, and how DNA is responsible for all of it."
9673,"i dont think i get the question, why would that be scary?"
9674,"Our brains aren’t super computers, super computers are just dumbed down Brains"
9675,"my question is what is consciousness then

a self awareness, yes, but what causes it?"
9676,"We’re a little more than any supercomputer ever will be; computers won’t be able to match us for decades. Natural intelligence and *extremely* efficient power usage (the difference between a building and a dim light bulb). The brain can rewire itself too, exponentially increasing storage and making it far more complex than any computer ever will be for a long ass time. 

It’s really super super fascinating."
9677,"Agreed. We think technology is great because we vitness great improvements, but it’s primitive compared to biological ”machinery”. I once went out on a googling journey trying to find a perfect display that matches the human eye in everything, no matter the budget. It doesn’t exist. There’s always some drawback. I watched a fly when I ate breakfast today. That’s a thing that can fly, walk, process information, heal and reproduce and it’s fucking tiny. There’s no technological thing that can compare"
9678,No I think it’s fascinating
9679,No
9680,"You still are making decisions though, your soul is just kind of along for the ride to give you consciousness"
9681,Being a biologic computer is awesome but the updates and patches are very slow... There are even unused beta features.
9682,"I don't need to live up to a bullshits stereotype of being a drunken retard who also smokes to be a teenager, not that I want to be that in the first place"
9683,You mean alcohol instead of school right
9684,"Everyone’s got their balance.

The party go-ers almost certainly crave something you have. I’m sure people who live extroverted lifestyles have as much, if not more shit to deal with so don’t worry about it, just do what makes you happy and you got your balance"
9685,Yes already changed it but school instead of alcohol is funny.
9686,"Bro I felt this hard in highschool. I wish I had focused more on what I wanted instead of comparing myself to others.

I wish I had decided I wanted to learn a skill or do something new I thought might be fun instead of just playing videogames and  hoping someone would invite me to something.

The main thing to realize is that satisfaction comes from progress, if you're not aiming for something it's rlly hard to go towards it and be satisfied. Secondly, if you have goals that are independent of others you will always be able to progress and find satisfaction regardless of what other people do.

Even if you find a group of friends that invites you out to have fun, if you don't have your own stuff, you will always be relying on them.

The point of this rant is to say.
DON'T BUY INTO THIS REAL TEENAGERS THING.
Teenage years are when children start developing identity, this is one reason why teenagers are often miserable. If you center your identity around the drinking, partying, fucking, teenage ideal then 
A) you will be super boring when you graduate
B) chances are you will be unsatisfied, as what you're chasing hardly exists.

Pick something you like and work towards it. Chances are you will find cool interesting people along the way.

TL:DR
Trying to be like everyone else is a surefire way to fuck yourself in the ass. Find something you want and go towards it. Take everything else day by day.

(Side note: idk if u actually have stuff you're working towards or not, this is just something I wish I had heard when I was feeling similarly.)"
9687,"I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser

shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter

while y'all out there drinkin, I'm just here thinkin'

'bout where I should've been

^(I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah!)"
9688,Just because they do drink it doesn’t mean they should
9689,"I second this.

u/iguessstillyoung, I'm around your age and on 10th grade. There's not a ""real teenager"" thing. There's a ""*common* teenager"" thing, but you shouldn't chase it if you don't really like it. You're on your teenage years and soon starting a time in your life where every small decision matters. You'll have to study a lot (depending on the area you go to ofc, I'm on the Science-biology area so it's a lot of work) so use these 2 years to not only have fun (your *own* way, be it playing GTA, cooking, learning Spanish or going to parties), but to create some study habits so you can get to higher places in the future.

You need 0 to no addictions to be happy, in fact you'll only be happier long term.

TL DR; fuck the others, be yourself, stay away from bad shit and be happy with what you like and not with what society likes."
9690, I take it you arent familiar with kids in the uk
9691,Laughs in European
9692,"if they're drinking beer at 14, you're lucky you weren't there with them, just saying."
9693,"I don't think it's living up to stereotypes (for me at least), it's just nice to have friends you can hang with and people to talk to."
9694,Although I have felt said when I realize I could be hanging out with my friends.
9695,In Australia there was a 13 or 14 (can't remember) year old kid who drank a litre of vodka in half an hour. He was found dead in a field 3 days later. Died from alcohol poisoning. He wasn't on drugs. Teens get fucked up on alcohol all the time bro.
9696,"La la la la, la la la la

LONELYYYYY"
9697,"Yeah definitely. Having friends and socializing is a big thing in happiness. What's important is to make sure you are also self sufficient so you're ok when you're alone.

I personally was a lot happier when I first found friends that would drink and throw parties and hang out.

What ended up happening though was I always felt needy because I never was doing anything myself, I was always just showing up to what they wanted to do, and when they were busy doing their own stuff I was doing nothing. I was reliant on them for happiness.

What I'm trying to say is focus on your goals and directions first and foremost. Make sure you're on your own journey surrounded by other people, not on someone else's journey if that makes sense.

If you don't have any friends, people with direction tend to attract friends more than people with no direction. Same with relationships."
9698,"> It also... kinda proves it's not that bad

I take it you arent familiar with kids in the uk"
9699,"Yeah but the people who party and have friends and hangout always and drink and smoke and are in a relationship are often happiest. While I have none of that and I'm depressed, so it's gotta have to be something to do with it."
9700,"It is, but it's five if your parents allow it. It's fucked up."
9701,You're 14. I didn't do that either at that age. You're fine
9702,^(I'm a lonely bitch)
9703,most of us have gotten smashed with our mates by 14 lol
9704,"Dude you shouldn’t associate yourself with the drunks and stoners. All they are gonna do is be funny and then try to get you to drink/take drugs. You’re 14 man, you deserve much better. Don’t start taking drugs/drinking and mess your life up.

And yes I know weed isn’t considered that bad anymore, but for children it is still harmful. The rule of thumb is follow what science says and if they say it’s okay to take it at whatever the legal age is then that’s when it’s okay to take it. Not a 14 year old child who still has a developing brain."
9705,Yeah or just any fucking where I'm In the Midwest of the us and drink beer regularly and most of my friends do to
9706,"La la la la, la la la la

LONELYYYYY"
9707,"You don’t have to follow the stereotype of a drunken rebellious douche to be a teen. Just follow your own path and try to enjoy these years. You’re only 14, there’s many ahead."
9708,"Man don't worry about it, if you can enjoy life without them, then don't get into them, ESPECIALLY smoking."
9709,Or just being lonely and getting cross faded by yourself (meeeee)
9710,"Yeah, but he's 13. He didn't know any better. They don't teach you these things until your 17/18 atleast in my school. He thought it was cool. He probably got pressured by his mates."
9711,"Same with me, but honestly it doesn’t appeal to me like I would love to be ‘normal’ but i dont want to drink or smoke like my friends do idk it just makes me feel different from them. But yeah I completely get what ur saying"
9712,This actually has a name it’s called “the call of the void”
9713,That's normal my guy
9714,"Nah I get that feeling like when I hold a gun and stuff too. I think it’s just instinctive your body letting you know that you can kill someone and it’s dangerous but at the same time to let you know that you can kill someone and it makes you feel kinda safe... 

It’s a weird feeling but you don’t need to get rid of it it’s just your instincts I doubt you gonna go killing people just because of that feeling it doesn’t effect your consciousness."
9715,"or as the french say, l'appel du fromage"
9716,Thats the call of chese my friend
9717,I guess you acted on your thoughts once or else orr1 would still be here today
9718,This is propoganda
9719,"The I can just jump thing is called l’appel du vide which in English means call of the void. It is really common and most people have it and you don't need to be suicidal for it to happen so don't worry. 

The main theory about it is that when you stand next to a high place your mind instinctively jumps back even though it's not in danger. It then tries to rationalize it because it knows there was never any danger and concludes it must've wanted to jump hence that thought.

About the I can just kill everyone in this room thing I don't know. It's not the same as l’appel du vide and I have it too but I don't know what's the cause of it is.

[source](https://allthatsinteresting.com/call-of-the-void)"
9720,The ones where you go “what it I do this thing that will kill me” are often called “the call of the void” and happened even when you’re not suicidal
9721,Well you’re wrong then
9722,He's hunting or at the range?
9723,Void Cheese
9724,Shooting at a range and hunting? Yes it is legal. Have you really thought no one can use guns for fun?
9725,"Yeah I hold knifes and im like, holy shit this would slide into my neck easily"
9726,Hol up why tf you holding a gun
9727,It's l'appel du vide (spelling?)
9728,No it’s not. It is legal where I am so I assume for him also. The laws in your state/nation/province do not apply to everyone online.
9729,"Yeah exactly, it stand by a cliff and thinks how easy it is to jump"
9730,ok
9731, Wait what there's a name for that?
9732,Um... they don’t go through my brain
9733,"Don't be so worried about it, a lot of people have these thoughts, it normally is a form of OCD called Pure O, they cause those intrusive thoughts and you shouldn't worry so much about them, they can be caused by anxiety or similar"
9734,So you know where that person lives and that it’s illegal where he/she lives? Because it’s legal in a lot of places.
9735,That's normal. Our brains are like that. I have them too sometimes. Vsauce made a video where he once mentioned it. It must be in his human behaviour videos
9736,Yeah exactly. It’s so weird
9737,"Best guess (personal opinion) Is that the killing everyone thing is a primal instinct on the want to be able to protect oneself. Or, preparing yourself for the worst."
9738,The call of the void
9739,"Like, if I was to jump right now nothing could stop my dearh"

Understating yourself, selling yourself short and acting like a damsel in distress. It's great to feel needed and if you need anything don't hesitate to ask for it, but confidence is way hotter than a girl who makes you feel like she's only holding back to make you feel better.

9836,"Gwen (any variation), Luna, Elvira, Astrid, things like that. Cool, somewhat fantasy esqe names. However, it literally makes no difference, names are just neat I guess.

However, if you're named Gertrude or Mildred, I am going to assume you're a witch. Not a hot one, like a really old one who's using magic to look young."

Sounds like an ugly female troll"
9850,Only if she looks like Emma Watson
9851,F for our fallen soldier
9852,Heather sounds like the girl who dates the quarterback in every movie before 2005
9853,"This guy right here, officer."
9854,Breh we’re just murdering the self esteem of anyone with these names XD
9855,Or Gertrude

9857,I like Lilje or lily quite a bit. It’s sweet and nice

9860,i know a girl called Bee and she doesn't lengthen it to Beatrice its just BEE. she's so strange
9861,Ema/Emma. Hot. Girls with that name? Hot.
9862,That’s extremely messed up
9863,My stylist  has said that she has angry parents come in and try to get her to cut their child’s hair short frequently. It might be more common than you think.
9864,That’s fucked dude
9865,"Yeah, it’ll grow back eventually 

And dw, I got smash to cope"
9866,"Well it’s not as common where I live, that’s a weird punishment"
9867,What about animal crossing?
9868,"No actually 

I prolly should get it but ya boi is broke"
9869,"Thats not normal, thats bullshit"
9870,Ah understandable.
9871,"Holy shit, thats fucking horrible"
9872,"Not normal, and was used for to minor of an offence, if you did something properly wrong I would say that was a decent punishment, but this is way to minor."
9873,"I’ve seen your posts before, your parents are abusive tbh"
9874,"Nah, that is not normal. You have every right to be pissed off about that"
9875,Not at all. That's terrible
9876,I can't imagine any situation in which an ugly haircut as a punishment would make any sense.
9877,"Dude, I've heard of this punishment happening once. You wanna know what the kid did? Cocaine. Yeah, they're fucking nuts, this isn't good, I feel sorry for you."
9878,damn bro you always have my back 🥺
9879,Um no?? I’ve never heard of a haircut as a punishment
9880,I'm hope you won't have to deal with this shit in the future.
9881,"I live in a military family, that’s not even normal for me. My parents do really bad punishments but it’s only for big stuff like they don’t care about little stuff like that. We don’t really do family stuff anyway."
9882,"Bro I know this is getting repetitive, but working out can really help get rid of your frustration and anger. Also if you ever wanna rant or vent I am there.

Not gonna forgive you though. You wanted me to get rammed by a car to check if I am Shredded lol."
9883,My parents won't try this on me cuz buzz cuts are my usual hairstyle. But your story is fucked up man
9884,Hold the hell up what? Are you joking that isn't normal at all!
9885,I swear I'm not Jerry
9886,"No. Far from it. I hate my mother but even she wouldnt punish me with something like that, a belt maybe but not that. Theres something more psychological behind the punishment you recieved"
9887,"First time I've recognized a poster on this subreddit, or even just in general.  Anyways that is absolutely not normal.  That's just cruel.  If you were bullying a kid or something then *maybe* then but their reasoning was just ridicules."
9888,I KNOW IT DOESN’T FIT ME AT ALL AND I FUCKING HATE IT AND IT’S DISGUSTING I LIKE MY MESSY-ASS EMO/EBOY HAIR CAUSE I’M FUCKING SMOL AND I DON’T LOOK GOOD WITH A BUZZ CUT CAUSE THAT ONLY LOOKS GOOD ON PEOPLE WITH A COMMANDING PRESENCE AND I’M JUST FUNNY SMOL BROWN BOI IN THE CORNER MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH I HATE THIS
9889,"I have longish hair, If that happened to me i'd leave to live in the woods like a hermit druid"
9890,"My friend just had to get a buzz cut for not bringing his grades up, so I guess it is fairly normal. Wait, Jerry is that you?"
9891,"no that is not normal at all. my dad won't even let me buzz my own head because he is afraid it would come out bad and neither he would never want me to purposely get a bad looking haircut.

ik it is quarantine so many people don't have access to barbers so buzz cut may be a way to keep things neat.  I don't think it's normal at all for parents to use a haircut as punishment, or purposely destroy their child's self-confidence/give them a bad haircut on purpose. if a parent by accident gave you a bad haircut because they felt it was getting too long or out of control that is understandable but as a punishment? no haircuts are not punishment.

from that though were your parents drunk for some reason that sounds like a drunk person's logic? do they do this type of attitude/punishment frequently? if this kind of behavior is frequent I don't want to be the bad guy here but that is abusive or at least bad parenting."
9892,"Damn, that’s cold."
9893,If I had a gf and she did that I’d probably be pretty heart broken
9894,"Nice pun. But in all seriousness, that was a pretty shitty thing to do"
9895,Nah it’s just dickish and makes Christmas feel shitty. If you can wait until Christmas to break up you can wait a few more days still so it won’t hurt as bad
9896,"That’s a scummy thing to do to someone. I’m sorry he did that, he should have at least waited until after christmas"
9897,"More money bc you don’t have to buy them a present. Focus on yourself and more importantly, the bag😤"
9898,The day wouldn't matter heh I'd still feel bad.
9899,Already bought it and packaged it though... it was an expensive halo action figure thing bcs I know he loves that game...
9900,I mean I’m an Aussie so ours is in the summer
9901,"winter is cold

christmas is during the winter"
9902,I don't get it
9903,I hope so.
9904,"Yeah good idea, I'll probably just waste the money on league of legend skins or something."
9905,Australian go brrrrr
9906,It’s better than Christmas Eve imo. If he really wanted to go the extra mile he could wait until after but around the 27th or 28th would be best if waiting until after New Years is too much
9907,No refunds?
9908,"Man that really sucks. You put a lot of time and thought into the gift and it shows you cared. I hope you can refund it and buy something nice for yourself. If you can’t refund it, maybe gift it to another dude you know who is into Halo (it might be hard to find a guy who’s *that* into it though). Good luck and you’ll get through this!"
9909,that's not cool thing to do
9910,"Well, my GF just told me we should meet in public on sunday, pretty sure she‘s gonna break up with me so yeah, feeling you bro..."
9911,Turn it into a voodoo doll😈
9912,"No they don’t, because it’s summer"
9913,Aww. I hope ur doing well. That would be terrible.
9914,"I mean, you only do it if you forgot to make a Christmas gift right? /s

I'd be *crushed* to my very core."
9915,"According to my niggalations i only get three days

Day one, to feel the pain.

Day two, to mourn the death of the relationship

Day three, to rise up again"
9916,"I'm sorry to hear, hope it turns out for the better!❤"
9917,Tbf maybe he didn’t want to receive a gift from her and then immediately dump her a few days later. I know I’d feel like a massive asshole if I did that.
9918,"Well what else is new? Aussies have summer for winter, winter for summer, everyone is upside down, etc"
9919,Now that’s a stretch. There’s a whole month and a half between New Years and Valentines
9920,Absolutely would never speak to them again because that would make me the biggest mug on the planet

9936,and the moment they get cuffs on they will say tighter daddy or some shit

but i like using the word pp :("
9938,I haven't seen any of those so they're probably already doing it.
9939,"I mean, aren't they already tagged with nsfw ?"
9940,[this](https://emojipedia.org/hot-face/)
9941,No. Its part of being a teenager. Probs tag them though
9942,Question: will it make a difference if i say things like pp instead of dick?
9943,Im sorry for the comment I made earlier it was a horrible joke <3 sorryyyyy
9944,Yeah my phone went in to get repairs the headphone jack is messed up so I'm useing a phone with android 7.0

9953,"Your mother is a wise person, tell her op says thank you."
9954,"super creepy. 4 years age difference usually isn't an issue in relationships where both participants are adults, but 4 years age different is HUGE for teenagers."
9955,That’s a big nono
9956,"Just think about: When he turns 18, she'll be 14. That's illegal."
9957,This is exactly what I thought when I heard of this.
9958,"Exactly, and I don’t think it is that hard to tell someone simply “You’re too young for me” or “I’m to young for you”"
9959,"Exactly what I told him, maybe when you both are in your 20’s or so but now it is beyond unacceptable."
9960,Just a question- what age would you feel is too old for a 13 yo?
9961,Most definitely 16 and above. I mainly posted this just to get a bit of 2nd party advice.
9962,"The fuck is wrong with this world, is there no sense of ethics anymore"
9963,"Typically people say half your age + 7 is the youngest you should date, so for a 17 yearold that’s a 15 yearold"
9964,Because he knows that females around his age know what red flags to look out for. Some 13 year olds don't which is why ages of consent are a thing.
9965,That’s kinda really weird. Please ask your friend to reconsider what he’s doing.
9966,"Thanks, imo 17 is too old for a 13 yo btw"
9967,Nope it isn't. Statutory rape laws allows a 4 year age gap. So the dude would not be a pedo if there is consent. This is in most places. It's still fucked up that à 13 yo who just started puberty is supposed to be mature enough to date a soon to be adult. But legally he's safe but morally he deserves to be beat the fuck up.
9968,Wait as a 14 year old i should date only other 14 year olds :)
9969,Thirteen yearolds used to give birth to the babies of 25 year olds in ancient Rome.
9970,Not in the slightest. A 13 year old is just a kid. Imo the max acxeptable age for a 13 yo to date is 14. 14-18 the max age range is +2 and after that whatever the heck floats your boat.
9971,"Well that rule is just for like the youngest you date, but it’s just a general rule you know? Like it’s a good approximation"
9972,No this ain’t it
9973,Seniors should not be dating 7th graders
9974,"*FBI, open up*"
9975,Exactly. It would still be weird if it was a 15 year old and a 13 year old. 17 is basically a legal adult.
9976,no it definitely is not. 4 year age gap what? that's too much.
9977,I lost definitely agree with you.
9978,tis actually a good idea
9979,"Well, dear OP there are two options:1) Tell him to wait because atm this really ducked up or 2) enter the semi-dad mode and load a shotgun"
9980,After 14
9981,"I agree, I only support a time of 2 years apart and no 13 year olds. If that makes sense, dating is always hard in the teens since it is so close to childhood it makes everything difficult."
9982,good man
9983,Because they dont want to hurt the person but imo just dont respond at all in that case
9984,I say serve it like it is or dont serve it at all
9985,"I've got to agree with that, a lot of people just don't though."
9986,"I wouldn’t want people to sugarcoat it for me, so I don’t for them"
9987,that's the best way to go about it I think
9988,I put a selfie in there so if I’m mean to other people they might be mean about my looks and my mental health is too bad for that shit.
9989,true dat
9990,"hot chocolate is good tho, being blunt is like serving an onion"
9991,"Look, I can serve you some hot chocolate in a glass and just leave it as it is... or I put it in a beautiful cup, put some whipped cream on top and sprinkle cinnamon and maybe some chocolate sauce on top of that."
9992,well in the end of the day I think honesty wins uno
9993,"I get what you mean, and I don't look at selfie threads, but to me it's because I know everyone has at least one feature worth complimenting, and people deserve to feel pretty. I used to think I was ugly for a long time, and it's a terrible feeling. It's also because over the last year I've just realised... very very few people are *actually* ugly. And I think everyone should try to see the beauty in each other."
9994,Want me to honestly rate you main boi?
9995,No. I hope other people do the same thing but if I think somebody doesn’t look very good I don’t say anything
9996,Honestly the thing about me is that I literally can’t see people as ugly if I don’t know anything about them. Like literally to me you are beautiful unless you’re a bad person.
9997,Because only relatively good looking people are brave enough to post a photo of themselves.
9998,good boi
9999,kinda harsh but I see where you're coming from
10000,Well there’s the expression “sweet little lies” which is what I’m doing i guess soooo
10001,Yeah most people are lying but if I start to think like that I get depressed which is just really annoying.
10002,alrightey then
10003,why
10004,Because they think people can't handle negative opinions. You can see this on every damn post on r/teenamiugly
10005,"If I complimented I meant it. Most of the time I didn't, even downvoted."
10006,"Idk what you mean, I meant any compliments that I said"
10007,It hurts them in the long run. These people think that they’re something they’re not and make choices based on this. It would be better if they were told how it is and told how they could fix it.

10044,"I've basically made my own fantasy world that I get lost in.

It's basically a world where people used to own magic in ancient times (which  would explain all of the world's mysteries to modern society,  except they don't know about the magic), but it was deemed too powerful in the wrong hands.  So, the elders of these ancient civilizations came together and used the four elements to create a portal, where they managed to cast all of the magic into another realm. Then, the elemental elders created a prison made of a volcano (fire,  earth)  under a frothing sea filled with dangerous tornadoes that never cease (water, wind). As their last act, they drew all of the elemental magic into gemstones, and hide them with a powerful magical creature to guard them. 

Without magic, most of the ancient world collapsed, including magical beings. But some managed to find hidden sources of magic. Viper and Scorpia are two dangerous magical assassins who survived the Downfall (what the dramatic ending of the world was called by modern society), who kill and use blood magic to live on. They think it's their god appreciating their sacrifice,  but really they just absorb the strength of their victims.

They didn't have a purpose until someone began mass murdering snakes and scorpions, who they believe is their god's children and therefore sacred. They investigate and discover a young girl,  raised by an elder witch who also survived on blood magic (the girl was unaware of this). The mother witch told the girl of the evil elders who destroyed the world,  and told her that to save her, the girl needed to find the elements .

Guardians of magic exist in this world, who also know about this and want to stop her. So the girl goes out and finds these assassins, among others, to help her. 

Yeah, that's my lore in my head for my story. Right now I'm trying to flesh out the character backstories."

10105,"Personally I think that's a pretty fucked up way to share a joke in relation to female friends. In a male group I'll often jokingly hit on my friends, but when there's girls around that just feels shitty 'cause I'm actually attracted to girls and I don't want to be a creep."
10106,I really don't know how to react
10107,I don’t think it’s something to think too much over.
10108,yeah lol
10109,"I get you- if I was in that situation I’d feel pretty weird. It’s definitely not a bad thing, if anything it’s a compliment but the idea of that happening definitely makes me uncomfortable. Probably just the fact that by asking you to put the glasses on it’s sexualising you (by making you look like a porn star) without you being aware of what was going on until after. 

It’s probably best to just fully erase that from your memory and ignore it forevermore, but if it makes you feel any better I get you."
10110,"Yea i get what u mean, I appreciate it"
10111,"Well they think you're hot, that's something ig

Weird thing for them to say though"
10112,Any slightly middle eastern girl can look like Mia Khalifa with glasses according to some
10113,"Huh yea i know, it was just so unusual that it got stuck in my head"
10114,"I think ur the first girl to answer lol. Thanks for understanding, it really was odd"
10115,Me and the boys used to do that just to make fun of that girl that we were saying that to
10116,Mean
10117,I disagree but I can't explain why
10118,"I take it you mean to say that it isn't so much her being ""hot"" as it is sexualizing/objectifying her and seeing her as ""attractive"" only in that light? 

So yeah, I wouldn't take it as a compliment but I wouldn't take it as offense either. You could brush it off in jest and be ""a good sport"". 

Just be wary about the implications of these jokes and if you feel it violates your personal morals (for lack of a better term) and/or you feel uncomfortable from the (excessive) teasing about this, then communicate with your male friends and set some boundaries."
10119,Im kinda like... Really white tho
10120,"But theyre about my age too, so it wasnt really creepy"
10121,"I wouldn't think about that too much, I doubt they mean that in a sexual way."
10122,Still pretty weird to say though.
10123,Huh yea ig
10124,O.o
10125,She was having fun too
10126,Yeah so basically they think youre hot
10127,no its not lmao
10128,"They are probably thinking of that typical teacher or secretery in those movies, maybe nurse even."
10129,"I think they’re joking, as long as they’re not objectifying/sexualizing you"
10130,It will be wrong
10131,"many people are addicted to it and wont admit that they are


Watching pornography ruins thousands of relationships and makes the female of the relationship feel like she isnt enough and also makes her have no self confidence by knowing that the man would choose porn over his wife or girlfriend


Its messed up that women and men would post these pictures and videos for anyone to watch just so that they can have a little more money in their wallet


I used to watch it but all i ever got from it was depression and anxiety so im not watching it anymore


Ps. i dont rlly care if i get downvotes on this comment its just a bunch of pixels on a screen :/"
10132,"Ikr, selling clubpenguin is the lowest you could go in life"
10133,"No, need to have one to dump one"
10134,"No, idrc. As long as she tells me about it straight-up and doesn't do anything stupid, I'd support her. Idk if my family would tho."
10135,Naw ill help her film that shit its just extra cash for us. People pay just to get a glimpse at what I have full access to for free
10136,Yes
10137,Pretty much sums it up for me aswell
10138,"Ha! I can’t get a divorce if I have no girlfriend in the first place!

*smile with thumb up whilst crying*"
10139,It’s supposed to be free 😡😡
10140,"I mean, thirsty neckbeards paying to get a glimpse of my gf would feel pretty... idk that would be someone’s kink I guess"
10141,king shit
10142,a major breech indeed
10143,You can show your body online and still be a virgin/save yourself for marriage
10144,Ayy we love a supporting bf
10145,"I think the problem would be that most people that save themselves for marriage do it because they think that it's morally right and immoral to do it before (not everyone), so it would be weird for someone to think that that's immoral but selling your body online isn't."
10146,"No, as long as she tells me first about it, it isn't a biggie"
10147,"Yea, I’m personally saving my virginity for marriage, and I don’t think someone who has an onlyfans would really agree with me on that."
10148,You don't say
10149,Lol. Not like my girl would ever do it though since she's shy and asexual
10150,Thanks. It's been almost two years now. And unlike most anime protagonist I gave the child hood friend a chance
10151,No? She can do what she wants it’s not like she’s cheating on me lmao
10152,*drags down your pants and whips you with a spatula*
10153,...
10154,I would ask if I can be in the background posing with sunglasses to let them see to whom belongs what they can’t have.
10155,Aww thats so cute i wish you all the luck
10156,"I meannnn as long as she doesn’t directly do anything with anyone else, I’m fine her her making the extra cash"
10157,BREECH CHARGE READY
10158,If I get into a relationship and they already have one I’d be fine with it but if they started one while we were going out I’d not be ok with it
10159,I might. Definitely if she didn’t talk about it with me first.
10160,*vortex would like to know your location*
10161,Thank you lol I try my best for her
10162,"It’s not really a plan, more like an ideal outcome if the world was perfect. But it’s not, so I don’t really make it a defined thing that needs to happen. I won’t make my
happiness depend on it. 

I’d love to adopt kids if I get married."
10163,[removed]
10164,"Every time a girl sits next to me, I start planning the cost of the wedding."
10165,"Yeah, I am worried I'd fuck up as in divorce and everything like my parents"
10166,Im not having kids
10167,Yup
10168,yeah pretty much
10169,I *might* get married but i would have to be with the girl for at least 5 years so i know for sure she isnt gonna fuck me over
10170,"Yep, I do it almost any time I'm alone and have nothing better to do. Like laying in bed trying to fall asleep"
10171,Yea but I think the point is that planning on having kids and a wife isn't exactly the easiest thing to organize.
10172,Me too lol. Not even marriage I'm just gonna stay alone.
10173,[deleted]
10174,hahaha I know what you mean
10175,"I can’t speak for him, but some people would rather adopt kids that already exist and need homes than add new ones to the world. Others don’t want to go through the hassle of pregnancy, or pregnancy doesn’t work out. There’s lots of reasons, I guess"
10176,"Yah, I love kids and cannot wait to be married and have kids I’m just so excited"
10177,">in bed trying to fall asleep

I relate to this one"
10178,"Thats nice to hear lol, tired of hearing everyone saying they hate kids."

10180,"Nah, I need that any% lose custody of my kids and much of my money speedrun. 🏃‍♀️nyoooom"
10181,"In Skyrim yes...

Real life, no"
10182,same man
10183,Selfish? Raising a kid is extremely expensive and time consuming. You have to be willing to give up alot of shit if you want to raise a child into adulthood. Not selfish imo
10184,Imo the upsides to having a kid are much much much less than the downsides of having a kid. But i agree with the adoption thing. Way too many kids in foster homes as we speak
10185,"Eh, kids aren’t for everyone"
10186,[deleted]
10187,Not into to much detail but yeah
10188,"Yes  
I am 19  
And I have thought about this since I have been about 7 or 8  
Hopefully one day have a wife and family of 5   
But also have a really well paying job such as a civil or mechanical engineer  
And also my grappling/weightlifting/bodyweight fitness hobbies on the side to make money"
10189,"I definitely do, dunno about others but I do"
10190,"A lot of people do, lol"

10216,i didn’t even realize that ugh
10217,[deleted]
10218,"""why is there a dude in my dms"""
10219,that was really my last text at that moment
10220,Yeah around that time
10221,question for the chair: biggie or tupac
10222,pain
10223,No. But have you ever walked up the same stairs that you walk up every single day and still manage to miss entire stairs constantly
10224,i know i'm literally curled up on my chair rn
10225,No
10226,"I'm now thankful I'm female 😎

Feel better dude"
10227,"ugh i hate when I turn too sharply for no reason and my table is low enough to hit my balls too 



Sooo relatable"
10228,No😎
10229,yeah but in the midsection and it wasn’t fun in the slightest
10230,Yeah okay I feel that
10231,Before I finished reading the question I knew who it was posted by. Always too damn relatable
10232,No because I’m short 😔
10233,https://imgur.com/gallery/j6JCw3S yes
10234,damn bro
10235,Yeah and its exactly tall enough for my balls
10236,[deleted]
10237,Are you okay?
10238,"nope, i’m in a wheelchair so that doesn’t happen"
10239,...or the table is too high
10240,Holy shit that's a sharp corner
10241,***BUSTER WOLF***
10242,that's both lucky and unlucky
10243,Do you really fucking think I did that intentionally
10244,I’ve felt it a lot recently lol. I did it 3 times in 2 weeks
10245,"Yes, that stuff’s the scary part lol"
10246,"That's an odd coincidence. 

I actually know someone else with DMD - my dad's friend's son Greg. He's about 10 and doesn't need a wheelchair yet, but he's not far from it.

I took part in a charity bike ride to raise money for a Duchenne charity with my dad and Greg's dad last year :)"
10247,"yeah i was unable to walk by 12, and that’s a lot longer than most kids with dmd make it. i hope he doesn’t let losing his ability to walk get him down too much. Thank you for helping me and people like me by doing that charity bike ride :)"
10248,"No, we keep the tables out of the way for this exact reason"
10249,yep definitely
10250,Im sorry bro stay strong
10251,YES
10252,"Ok that too, it's really something that makes me reflect about on some nights. Things like ""hey men don't cry"" or ""So you're actually a wimpy girl"" and stuff. What only happens to these things is just, in my observation, men has tendencies of extreme anger and resentment, or becomes arrogant. Me being open to my own feelings really helps a lot in avoiding being a walking volcano. I wish boys can do the same."
10253,We live in a society.
10254,You wouldn't get it...
10255,"Not really. Like for example I can't just randomly compliment anyone because I'll be seen as a creep. If I work with young kids I will be labeled as dangerous and a pedophile. Society leaves us alone. There's no help for men, we are assumed to have it well off so we don't get any help. If two people are starving and are sitting next to each other begging, giving one 100 dollars does actively hurt the other one. The same works with opportunities given to members of a society."
10256,"This attitude kills people, and needs to die itself, it is one of the most toxic bits of society"
10257,Wow is it just me or my post now suddenly became a meme? xD
10258,"I see, interesting. I do agree that gender roles should either be less restrictive, or has equal amount of restrictions when making policies/regulations (especially in schools)."
10259,"My country treats us boys just like girls and girls just like boys. We have no real restrictions and so do the girls. We get taught how important both equality and women are for a working society (even though men still make more money than women), so I'd say that girls still have it worst than we do. Of course there are some gender stereotypes and expectations but they are toxic both ways.

In what country do you live OP?"
10260,"We live in a society

Bottom text"
10261,"Wow that's awesome, very fortunate of you. Unfortunately, in here it's entirely opposite. I live in the Philippines you see, where if ever have a feminine looking bag, you will instantly shunned and called gay by teens."
10262,Gender equality is starting to have to be reversed if we want true equality. Women have it much easier off in the judicial system and in schools
10263,"Tbh I’m fine with most of it except 

1) negligence of mental disorders in men (I.e anxiety depression

2) limited clothing styles. I literally wear black sweat pants, a t-shirt, and a navy blue hoodie my grandma bought me every day. I was excited when I got sweatpants with a PUMA logo on the side lol"
10264,It turned into a meme the moment you mentioned society
10265,This kind of attitude really affected my self confidence some time ago and made me doubt everything I did. It's really toxic.
10266,">I can't just randomly compliment anyone because I'll be seen as a creep

I felt that, I really did. But I think that's just real creeps' fault."
10267,Damn that sucks
10268,"/r/RoleReversal is a pretty interesting sub about stuff like that, in its own way at least"
10269,I don’t feel like I’m forced to it’s just encouraged but I don’t mind I prefer physical labour over the traditional things women do
10270,"I have the privilege to be born into a culture that has opposing ideas of masculinity compared to those of most countries. Men are supposed to have long hair, wear all sorts of colours (often more colourful than women), and other things that are seen as feminine to most cultures. It is normal for us, and expected by the elder generations despite the white people trying so hard to change us. I live in a primarily liberal country, but we face a lot of the issues others do like people calling us gay or even killing us for being this way. 

But honestly, I dont give a fuck how society treats me or my people in regards to how we present ourselves. I can do whatever I want with my looks and I'd rather be called gay than be an ignorant bitch with such a limited vocabulary that they think gay is an insult. In my culture, being gay or bisexual or whatever is actually seen as almost an honour because you were gifted with two souls instead of one. 

If anything, I feel bad for people who have a hateful mindset, and for the fact that my generation is falling prey to the white man ways so much so that we start believing it."
10271,"It's hard when for your whole life nobody loved or cared about you, you know you are just temporary for everyone you meet and make friends with, and the girl I loved and cared about said she didn't feel the same, I told her if she wants to just be friends I will understand and was honest, I liked her a lot because she was my best friend even more then my then guy friends but she disconnected any connection with me knowing I was at the lowest and loneliest point of my life.
Nowadays I accepted depression as inevitable after going through so much shit, and I still function well. 

About fashion, I mean I like male fashion, my clothes represent me pretty well. (Allstars, hoodies, jeans etc...)"
10272,"Agree with this heavily, as soon as in my experience anytime I’ve felt shit or had really bad thoughts it’s Wales been a case of 
“Oh just got do something to forget about it it’s only temporary”"
10273,"Absolutely Not. At every turn in the system, I'm facing some or the other issue where I'm pushed back for being born as the wrong person. I'm not a girl to join that NCC camp my school has, or to participate in that exciting scholarship program. I'm not a Muslim, or a OBC or an SC or ST to get one of those reservation benefits. I'm not a poor person who can get seek additional support. I'm not a rich person, who can buy whatever I want. I'm not a talented person who can make a name just with the few talents they have.

Painful truth is, I'm absolutely an average person in the eyes of everyone because I'm my parent's son. All the while everyone I know is just having the luxury to claim one or more of these benefits. And I have no one to blame for this other than the system that's been screwed over since ages before, and maybe for ages to come. I can't speak for the rest of the world, but this is the case in India. ~~I've heard of a few such things in places abroad, but I can't be sure of this~~

The problem goes far deeper than what you mentioned. Many people, More particularly boys, are facing situations nothing short of oppression.

But just What can I do? Complaining isn't going to help. Nor will feeling sorry for myself or others feeling sorry for me will help. All I can do is work my ass off, and hope for the best results. Hope that my effort is enough to overcome the entire mess I'm in. It's working for now. I'm one of the top students in the school, and slightly beyond. But the fact remains, it's not enough. It won't be enough when it counts."
10274,"Where do you live?

Scandinavia ?"
10275,"Gamers are the most oppressed race, and it is about time we rise up and fight!"
10276,"My country isn’t good with this, we’re taught by society that being a man is bad, especially if you’re white, the schools treat boys with the same standards as girls, which makes no sense because boys act differently than girls, and society teaches us that “masculinity is toxic” so I hate the way society treats guys"
10277,Ok let me guess this one ....America?
10278,"Its not just an attitude. I see it happening every day. At school whenever a girl looks down then there are 50 people there to save the day. I was going through a life changing event and multiple people asked if I was okay, when I said no they just looked at me like I was crazy and either walked away or started a conversation with someone else."

10280,"Germany, near Frankfurt"
10281,You do realise men are more likely to be affected by assault or domestic abuse. Also wage gap doesn't account that women work lower paying jobs and less hours by choice not because they can't get them there is nothing to stop them going through the same procedures as men to get these jobs. One more thing look at Google women complained they were being under payed turns out they were payed more than men.
10282,"it’s just annoying and stupid, especially when people aren’t minding their business"
10283,"Uhh, if you do any banking on your computer, you have something to hide. What the fuck is wrong with people?"

10285,[deleted]
10286,"Here's a really good arguement against it, it's pretty long but it's a very good read in my opinion. This was from a few years ago by u/161719:

>I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. 

>A few points: 
1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people. 

>Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person. 

>With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad. 

>2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke. 

>3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. 

>Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police. 

>You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there. 

 > 4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?"" 
""Sorry,"" he says. ""I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."" There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail. 

  >Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons. 

  >You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors. 
 
  >This all happened in the country where I live. 

>  You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality. 

>Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not? 
You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant ""liberty and justice for all."" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety? 

>Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe? 

>I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen. 

>I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.

10287,Criminal mastermind here
10288,it diminishes people’s reasonable expectations of privacy and is very invasive.
10289,LMAOO I'm just saying I've never seen someone just tell on themselves like that
10290,It’s still illegal for the government to do anything with that? Just the same as someone else hacking your bank account or peaking at your PIN at the ATM or self checkout at the store
10291,*Technically* legal is the best kind of legal.
10292,Like I said I’m not breaking the law unless I distribute the video but it’s not a big deal even if I do to just friends
10293,"It’s annoying and stupid. The only answer is because it’s my private life and I don’t want you looking at it, and that’s still not a great answer"
10294,Its stupid. Its my life and I choose what to reveal and what not to reveal.
10295,"This needs to be up way more, like way way more."
10296,Invasion of privacy
10297,"I disagree with that it doesn’t matter if the government has access or not because a tyrranical one would get access anyways.

The tyrranical one would still have a much harder time if access isn’t there already, and the government should *not* have it."
10298,i have nothing to hide on my phone. doesn’t mean i like it or don’t mind when my sister grabs it from my hand & starts scrolling thru my apps & texts. that’s annoying & a major invasion of privacy
10299,"Privacy is a right and it's your right to give it away or keep it.  The problem with government just taking it is partly because they didn't ask us, they just took it. 

Currently, you don't have a right to privacy.  For states that have a lock down, you don't have a right assemble freely even though it's a constitutional right.

Another reason losing your privacy is horrible is because if the government has access, so do other people.  So imagine a day, when someone can read every email, text, see every video you've watched or made and every picture you've taken or sexted and every website and picture you've EVER looked at.  Every dick pic/boob pic you've sent or received. 

There are already two huge data storage locations in the USA and a third is almost done. 

My dad works in encryption for AT&T, so I've been aware of privacy issues for a few years now."
10300,"It's just assuming you have something to hide that's illegal rather than something personal. It's a fair argument but it's countered with privacy. On the other hand, asking to snoop is enough because we have the right to silence (assuming youre not the child of some king in a 3rd world country who has an iphone7 with no actual rights)"
10301,That's the slippery slope fallacy.
10302,[deleted]
10303,I strongly disagree. I don't want the government breathing down my neck or my parents looking through my phone.
10304,this is really good storytelling holy crap
10305,And if you let the police search your car for no reason what's to stop them from planting something or making something up?
10306,"Still they don’t have a magical button that gives them access to everyone’s emails. They have to coerce your email provider into giving it to them, or pay hackers to come get them. And people will  notice, some won’t keep silent, some will blow the whistle and be a catalyst for a revolution. If it’s already business as usual they can start abusing their power right away and nobody will notice."
10307,I'm not hiding anything I would just like to keep some things private because you snoop through my phone while I am asleep Dad
10308,"It was popularized by Joesph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, so that says a lot about the argument"
10309,"Stupid, because just because we don't have something to hide doesn't mean the other person does. And what if we do have something to hide? What if we have something that we don't want you to see because we know you'll react badly and take it out of context?"
10310,I’d only give up my privacy to clear my name of a crime. I wouldn’t give up my privacy just because someone wants me to
10311,In real life you don't share the conversations you have with your parents or girlfriend/boyfriend. Then why would you share the text messages?
10312,"Its part of the XY agenda, we are giving girls as many body parts to worry about as possible, but seriously its just because its cute to have thicc thighs"
10313,I think it's an evolutionary thing. Nice thighs and wide hips meaning that they have an easier time bearing children and being a mother.
10314,"Oh okay, cool, thank you!!"
10315,Caveman brain says wide hips are good for child bearing
10316,You have perfectly summed up why thighs are amazing my good sir.

Hats off to you dude"
10318,Fair enough
10319,I have no idea.
10320,"No idea why, they just are so damn attractive"
10321,"You could probably extrapolate and find the reason to be some sort of prehistoric psychological conundrum, like for instance fat thighs are cool because fat = lots of food = survival, or maybe strong thighs are cool because running and agility, who knows. Women tend to store fat in the lower body too, so I guess that's feminine."
10322,No
10323,"That actually makes a lot of sense, thanks!!"

10325,Ah yes good to know thanks

10329,"Yeah I guess that makes sense, thanks!"
10330,"There's just something about a girl with *thicc* thighs. Think about it the other way, what if they had super skinny thighs? I mean there's nothing wrong with that, it's just, thicc is better."
10331,If she can crush a watermelon in them then I will gladly let her crush my head in them
10332,Okay then

oh hell nooooooooo brother

just a fine for ruining someone's life?"
10434,"Obviously some type of punishment, not sure what it’d be tho m, maybe just a fine for like “accusing an innocent of a crime”

So it could apply to other cases

Or maybe that’s like defamation already? Idk laws"
10435,Definitely prison time and have to pay compensation to the actual victim
10436,And the slaughter of the respect of the accused in society

10438,Is this not something that can already happen?
10439,"When someone is accused of rape, hatred, anger, pain, and many other emotions are all forced onto an innocent person. They could have thousands of people hating them with every fiber of their being for something that didn’t even happen.

10440,Yes... slander

10445,"Is your life, social standing, reputation and record worth only upwards of 25k? Barring any legal fees? You couldn't even get a job afterwards because no one would want to hire a registered sex offender."
10446,"bit weird that you’re a victim yourself and are suggesting such an intense punishment for someone that lied... there’s so many rapists in hollywood who continue to strive so yes accusations can ruin lives but majority of the time, they don’t

I never mentioned my stand on rapists themselves because I don’t like bringing out that side of me, but since you are saying it’s a “bit weird” that I hate people who manipulate me into hating others and ruin others people’s lives, I’ll go ahead and tell you a little glimpse of how I feel.

Rapists are the most pathetic scum of all life. They are pathetic, disgusting trash. They take advantage of those who are helpless and destroy them, turning what should have been an act of love into an action of violence, of pain. They warp something inside you, twist the goodness and make it unrecognizable. They leave you broken, shattered.

To say I hate them is by far an understatement. The rivers of hate I feel for rapists flow as deep as the Mariana Trench and flow with the force of a tsunami. My rage seethes and burns, and endless cesspool of burning red fire that never ends. My pain and despair at the memory of what was done to me is like a never ending pit, hollow and never ending yet so full of pain at the same time. Jail isn’t enough for them, they deserve to rot in eternal agony for taking what was not their to take. For taking what was good and shattering it with no regard to anyone else. For breaking the love that I one felt into mistrust and paranoia.

So yes, I do fucking hate rapists. They are the worst life form to ever exist. But imagine feeling all the feelings I described towards someone, then you find out that it was all a lie. Someone you once admired and looked up you began to hate, but then you realize all that hate and anger at them was for nothing. Imagine thinking your idol was just another of the pathetic scum that ruins lives, then realizing it was all for naught?

People who make fake rape accusations don’t just hurt the ones they accuse, they hurt everyone who loves the accused. This I why I hate them too, u/sicario18."
10447,jail
10448,"They should be given the same punishment as a rapist, plus a few extra changers."
10449,Έλληνας στο r/askteenboys? Να και κάτι που νόμιζα ότι δεν θα δω ποτέ
10450," I actually know two people that this has happened too. the people fake accusing should be put in jail for actually ruining someones life with a petty little lie, the sad thing is that these fake accusations will effect that persons life forever, it will stop them from getting jobs etc. so in conclusion i believe they should be thrown away in jail, possibly for life."
10451,[deleted]
10452,"let the person falsey accused decide whether to press charges or not, then figure out a sentence. probably a large fine or few years in jail."
10453,Upwards of like 25k maybe
10454,"**tl;dr**: i get why people want it to be, but it shouldn't be a unique crime. there’s no way to create a standard that can be applied to everyone, and there’s already ways to get recourse in the legal system

if you have probable cause to believe they filed a false police report or perjured themselves, they should be arrested, charged, and tried. the falsely accusing person should also be liable in civil court for defamation.

if you wanted to criminalize it though, what does false and rape mean? does it mean it was reported but charges were never filed? does it mean a jury found the person not guilty, even though not guilty does *not* mean innocent? what if a civil jury found them *responsible*, which has a lower standard than criminal guilt? does it mean the accuser doesn't have consistent enough facts or can't pin down a time? plenty of people (including myself) can't give an exact date or clear memory of a sexual assault. what about the fact there's already a system for defamation in civil courts? what is an accusation — a private conversation? a group conversation? a social media post? what about a post on a private account? a private story or a spam?

keep in mind too that the prosecution has to *prove the rape didn't happen,* not the defense that the rape *did* happen, which now creates the issue of what if the accused person thought it was consensual but it wasn't. that also brings in the same reason that rape cases are often not prosecuted — rape is often a he-said-she-said situation because sex of any level of consent is almost always done in private. so now you have a situation where someone goes to the DA, says they're falsely accused, and now it's their testimony versus their accuser's, just like in a rape case.

i appreciate and agree with the intent behind wanting to criminalize false rape accusations, but criminalizing *any* speech, let alone on an issue as touchy as this, presents a mass of issues and it's better just not to, because it's speech. there are already ways for a falsely accused person to get retribution in the civil court system, and false accusations can be criminal in certain contexts."
10455,"Yeah like the other person said it can already, but I think the top comment is saying there should be something more, a specific charge for false accusation, as it ruins the person's life whether its true or false."
10456,Agreed. And in the criminal court they could be persecuted for falsely reporting a crime
10457,"Finding out its false does not change shit bro. My cousins best friend got accuses of rape. Completely false. No proof. However bc we are not in the US, he was not guilty because in France, you have to be proven guilty in order to have punishment, not like in the US where you have to be proven not guilty to escape a punishment. If this whole shit had happened in the US, he would be in prison right now. Just because he was gaming with my cousin the night of the alleged rape, and apparently that is not enough proof to prove him absolutely not guilty. Well his budget that his school had given him to be able to study in England got cancelled, and was given to someone else, he lost a lot of friends over this, friends that he did not see ever again, because he fucking killed himself. He did a mental breakdown bc of all of this. My cousin ended up almost killing himself after this as well, bc they were so close, and now he is a shut-in bc he cant bear the death of his best friend since childhood. But yeah. A fine."
10458,[deleted]
10459,Don’t be lazy make your argument
10460,"If that false allegation is validated by the court, the person falsely accused of rape will suffer through the charges and lose valuable years of their life. That is one of the most evil things I can think of. The accuser knows this, and is still willing to put the man behind bars for something he didn’t do. So it’s only fair that the chargers that she filed against him, get thrown right back at her, plus some.

See how that works?"
10461,He literally just said and i quote “Being raped takes a mental toll on the victim”
10462,"Most of the things you listed are inaccurate and nearly sexist at times in the way you put us all in the category of objectifying, bad men. That may not have been your intention, but repeating that the only value you have to us is your attractiveness is a lie and downright bullshit. 

Also, don't take things out of context - when guys say their life is hard too, or that a girl's life is easier even, they mean in their own society/country. So to talk about forced marriage or any other type of obvious sexism like that doesn't make your argument better, it just makes it sound like you're fishing for examples anywhere you can find them.

Lastly, most of us aren't saying we have it any easier than you do, I sure am not. All we're trying to say is that we have issues, too. After hearing people laugh at you for saying you have problems or people not taking your depression seriously, it can get quite frustrating being a guy. We are seen as the ""stronger"" sex, but that's not good at all - we're not stronger (mentally) but because we're seen as the ""stronger"" sex, we have to put up with more shit/people are less empathetic towards us.

(I didn't mean to sound angry or anything at any point btw, just trying to get my point(s) across. Also, some of the things I said may not be exact or worded correctly, I wrote this pretty fast)

10463,"It's fucking

#RAW"
10464,"I mean in certain aspects yeah, it's easier to be female, like when you guys are sad, you get moral support by most people while guys just kinda have to deal with it, we're not allowed to show weakness you could say, the only negative emotion were allowed to have is anger"
10465,"The most fickle up one I’ve heard is:

#DO YOU NEED ME TO REVIVE HITLER TO TEACH YOU HOW TO USE A FUCKING OVEN?!?!"
10466,I just feel there is a verry strong social stigma about how men should act and then if we break out of this it’s seen as weird or that there’s something wrong with us  whereas is girls act differently there’s this idea that she’s being strong and independent and I know that’s a cliche but from my experience there’s more general social acceptance for girls than there is boys and I’m not saying that girls don’t have problems but it’s just more accepted that they do and there more support and if would be nice if it where the same for men
10467,agreed!
10468,this is true
10469,">guys just kinda have to deal with it

I unnironically felt that"
10470,"Yea, I'm still surprised of how many teens are sexist. HUMANS ARE HUMANS"
10471,"**Now here's a list of guy problems:**  
\- Six times the amount of suicides

\- Always expected to be interested in sex, but at the same time our sexuality is always talked about like a problem

\- To a lot of people guys are only valuable if they provide money and power

\- We're not allowed to be emotional, loving or sensitive. When we are, we're ridiculed, attacked, excluded, reprimanded (even beaten sometimes, ""I'll give you something to cry about!""). If a guy is they're seen as lesser, weaker, pathetic etc. Also we can't complain about it or talk about it without being judged. At the same time we're punished when we don't live up to being the strong dominators. It's like guys are worthless to many, and I hate it.

\- Almost all war deaths are males. Work deaths, homeless people, violence targets are mostly male. 

\- Hate crimes towards guys is a lot larger, gay guys get 55% of attacks, lesbians get 12% 

\- Guys are forced into the military, forced to fight at a young age, and shamed when they don't want to (by women as well).

\- Not only feminists oppress guys, but management and military as well, they want guys that are cheap and worthless slaves so they push the macho stuff on us, trying to control what being ""masculine"" means. If you like art, don't like sports, like cooking or something you're suddenly ""in touch with your feminine side"", it's BS and I hate it. 

\- Guys get much harder punishments for the same crime, almost never win custody battles for their kids but are expected to pay and guys are more likely to be convicted  

\- Dads don't get rights to decide anything about their babies until they're born

\- Most men can't get near children or say that they like children without people thinking you're a pedo

\- Laws say that guys can't be raped in a lot of places, no matter if you were drugged etc, bco feminists. If you're abused you're shamed and joked about. 

\- Billions of baby boys have to suffer through genital mutilation when they're born, lots of babies die bco it every year, from things like heart attacks even because it hurts so much. Some do it without giving painkillers, like some religions think that ""it's supposed to hurt"". Have a look at the pics, it's so sick it makes me cry looking at it. Then you hear girls saying bs like ""but it looks so much better"", ""ew I don't want any of that excess skin there"" or any other number of idiotic things that tbh makes me want to rip their head off. If anyone reading this is one of the lowlifes that support it you don't deserve to have a boy in your life.

\- Girls hitting guys is seen as funny or ok, guys can never hit back. Guys even get kicked between the legs and some shitheads will think it's funny, or threaten guys with it, it can make guys sterile. 

\- If a girl even accuses a teenboy of sexual abuse they will literally be dragged out of school in the US in shackles and put on electronic monitoring without an investigation first. Even if the girls lie about it the guys don't get compensation and the girls don't get punished. 

\- Women/girls are seen as more valuable, beautiful, more precious etc when they aren't. ""Women and children first"", ""Ladies first"", ""The fairer sex"" etc. Guys are treated as worthless all over the place and are judged a lot harder.  

\- Guys get discriminated in school, the same test results will give lower grades and teachers will correct the same answers much more generally for girls, because ""they need encouragement"". Then when it comes to getting jobs and applying for education, they get priority over guys. 

\- When they try to give funding for programs to help boys, feminists block it ""because it's at the expense of girls""  


Any more questions?"
10472,"So basically we agree with each other but just worded things weirdly lmao

But yeah, saying the other sex has it easier is just stupid"
10473,"My opinion is actually the opposite. You know the ""vsco girl skskskks"" meme? It's just making fun of girls doing trends. If girls have any hobby they are immediately called quirky and told they're not special (a little bit exaggerating but it's hard for a girl to have interesting hobbies in general). For example, a girl's into art? She's an art hoe! She's into playing the ukelele? Better tell her that that's not a real instrument! It's exhausting

(Not saying boys don't have problems themselves with being unique, just sharing the girls side.)"
10474,"Atta boy Tommy. Both sexes have their troubles, let’s stop comparing and instead recognize them."
10475,You don't microwave a fucking salad!
10476,"Being treated like a ""gorgeous princess"" is what a lot of women hate though, basically that women don't get taken seriously often. Women are also often referred to as the ""emotional gender"" (at least by a lot of old men) and if a woman has problems, it's blamed on that."
10477,"Suffer in silence type of deal, you know?"
10478,"yeah sorry about that, it’s late and i couldn’t be bothered typing it out better tbh. and yup, i totally get what you’re saying, i probably worded things wrong but i was just mentioning things that i have seen in the media and what i’ve experienced myself. i’m not saying all men are like this because i know that’s not true and it’s a very sexist comment to make, i was just noting things down, not attacking you personally or anyone at all. i don’t doubt for a second that guys have issues too - we’re only human - i just don’t think it’s right for some guys in this community to say ‘girls have it easier’ and ‘i wish i were a girl’ all the time because you really don’t, just like how i don’t want to be a boy. i hope this clears some things up. also when i said the stronger gender i meant physically, not emotionally because that’s a dumb statement to make - probably should’ve explained myself better"
10479,We’re all equally fucked by life
10480,And bodies are apparently bodies Mr. 42069
10481,"I just want to make one point, the gender pay gap isn't real. Plus each gender has their positive and negative things like if a man is being attacked by a woman no one would step up and do something but when the man fights back they are the ones being blamed and yelled at.. society is cruel, no matter the gender. Plus there's children custody, if a man calls the police to report his abusive girlfriend/wife/spouse they are the ones being kicked out of the house, and less jail time for the same crime..there are a lot of disadvantages for being a man in today's society so no one can say it's ""easier"" being a man or a woman. Plus the ""like"" a girl is kinda true tbh..like males are biologically stronger and are more physically capable then females."
10482,"not nescessarily true and it varies with society. 

Imagine that a girl gets impregnated by her boyfriend and the guy vanishes upon being told about the pregnancy. Now she has to tell her parents, In a place such as America, depending on the family she would be treated ell but imagine this happening on the middle east, the girl would surely be honour killed."
10483,I'd take being treated like a gorgeous princess every day of the week instead of not being acknowledged at all for my emotions.
10484,"basically haha but yes, i agree with you 100%"
10485,a lot of the things you said that makes it harder to be a woman just arent true. such as the pay gap and having to be worried while walking the street at night even tho men are far more likely to be victims of violent crime. end of the day men and women both have problems but a lot of young lads would think its socially easier to be a woman and that theyd get into relationships far easier which is true
10486,"That’s kind of an online thing only, people in real life don’t give half a shit what female hobbies are. I think it stemmed from r/notlikeothergirls which schcowcases girls that call other girls basic or whatever, but many times strays from its path"
10487,"Personally I don't think it's easier to be a girl, but I also don't think it's easier to be a man either.
Yes of course periods, probably the biggest downside of being a woman together with pregnancy.

I agree, that if you live in such a country where you get married to a guy like 3 times older that sucks, but that's not what people aree getting onto when they say it would be easier to be that gender. They talk about being that gender in America or some other developed european country.

The thing with men being congrated if they sleep with a lot of women is just absolute bs.

The walking at night thing, yeah I get it. But ever thought about the other side of the spectrum? Don't you think it's rather shitty if you are a grown up men, especially if you're quite muscular, walking alone at night and everyone thinks you are gonna rape or rob them?

Representation in porn is another dumb example and really makes me question, if you actually thought just a second about what you write. 
Yes, it is true, women in porn are reduced to pussy, ass and tits.
And what are men in Porn?
Correct a cock. There could just as well be a flying cock. It wouldn't make a difference. At least in straight porn. Not sure about gay porn and I'm also not gonna watch it.

If I forgot something feel free to ask for that. Your text wasn't very well structured and I'm too lazy to search for everything. Also you can just ask for further explanation."
10488,Hot
10489,"yup, agreed. men need a better support system 100% and i wish things were different. it’s almost 2020 for fucks sake. edit: i agree that men have it hard socially and am downvoted... make it make sense"
10490,"Of course this gets mostly ignored... You're not wrong. Both sides have their own complaints. They don't cancel out.

I also wrote a long answer but you went into it a lot more, I like it."
10491,wage gap be a myth dawg
10492,My adoptive parents are two moms so plus the one biological one and I have three moms.
10493,Three? That’s pretty cool
10494,"Haven’t talked to my dad in years, parents divorced when i was 8 :/"
10495,"So you're stuck in an endless cycle of ""go ask your mom""?"
10496,But you do have a mother. She’s doing the best she can to be both. Go thank her being a good parent and tell her happy Father’s Day. Then hug her and tell her you love her
10497,"My parents got divorced a few days ago, my father was an alcoholic for over 25 years, I'm trying to forget him, but it's hard"
10498,"pretty much, its also a mess when I say ""mom"" because either one or the other and sometimes both will respond. So I just call them by their first names, ""mom Karen"" and ""mom Irina"""
10499,I'm motherless but thanks. I hope your day isn't too bad.
10500,"Yeah, my dad died, thanks."
10501,bro that is really cool ngl
10502,That sucks bro I’m so sorry
10503,I’m sorry bro
10504,You’re not really fatherless...your mom has been both for you. Go tell her happy Father’s Day and thank her for raising you the best she’s been able to so far.
10505,He died to cancer 5 years ago. Been rough but I've been lucky to have great brothers and other father figures in my life
10506,"Yea, I’m glad he’s gone tho, I’m doing way better now without him"
10507,"Pros: no dad jokes
Cons: yo mama jokes are twice as powerful"
10508,*thrice
10509,"That sucks man, im so sorry."
10510,Hopefully not
10511,Because she’s playing both the role of the mother and the role of the father since they don’t have one
10512,"My parents divorced before I was born, but still I’m having a great life. I don’t want to meet him."
10513,Dam I only have one :(
10514,"(Someone makes a your mama joke)

**IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE!**"
10515,"I call them ""mom Karen"" and ""mom Irina"", I just use mom and their first name when trying to get one of their attentions."
10516,"Not fatherless, but just wanna wish anyone without their dad a great day today. Stay strong."
10517,"I dont have a real mom, she left me and abandon me for drugs and such, my dad always has been there for me."
10518,That’s really cool! Do you call both of them “mom” or do you have a different name for them?
10519,Wholesome
10520,I’m sorry but why would he tell his mother happy Father’s day?
10521,which one?
10522,This is the usual response and I’m okay w it
10523,"I'd hit on them too

""Roll for charisma!""

1

I stutter relentlessly, run to the bathroom, and have an anxiety attack knowing that i just missed an opportunity to finally not be single"
10524,"First, arbitrary self-deprecation joke (reddit policy): you guys are getting hit on?

Second, the answer. I would probably be confused and think it’s a joke at first, but when they tell me they’re serious I won’t threaten to beat them up or anything. I’ll politely tell them that I’m straight. If they keep pushing after that, then I’ll be more firm about it."
10525,"I'm 100% in favor of it. Except for right now because I have a boyfriend.

You make some good points though. Especially with regard to a guy approaching a girl who turns out to be lesbian.

There's just no certain way to know what someone's sexuality is until you find out. And if that involves politely hitting on someone that seems just fine to me. If the other person isn't interested they'll hopefully politely decline.

PS. Great question and very thoughtfully written."
10526,You just gotta roll w it dude. I used to get really anxious as well but after I came out and started being my own person and comfortable with myself altogether I stopped being so anxious. I know easier said than done but what’ve you got to lose ya know? A little bit more anxiety?
10527,"Say it with me now!

F>!uck homophobia!<!"
10528,Whatd the guy say
10529,Flattered I guess but I’d just make it apparent that am not interested
10530,"It’s just so crazy to me that you have to clarify right off the bat “I won’t threaten to beat them up or anything.” That that’s an expected and normal thing for me to go through, even for me. I understand ya though having been the “pushy” gay I’ve seen firsthand it’s not cool to do"
10531,"Probably the f word, the one that’s not fuck"
10532,"I've had it happen, for quite a while. It wasn't confirmed he was gay, but he really didn't seem to be joking for that whole year when he would say the kind of stuff he did.

Realizing later, he was most likely legitimately gay, either way it was insanely uncomfortable even being around him. And not because he was gay, but because of the disgusting comments he would have on me and others, how much he pursued us, all of that. I just took it as a weird middle-schooler joke and thought nothing of it, but looking back now it seemed to be more than that."
10533,"Guy who actually follows the Victorian Gentleman’s Code of Honour and Chivalry here — this guy asked me whilst I was playing cards with a few friends, and I momentarily thought he was trying to trick me into revealing my hand. I then dismissed the idea and my brain kind of went into full confusion. I frowned, opened my mouth and just stared for a few seconds. Then my best friend comes to my defence (but incredibly terribly). He says: “MrGamerMooseBTW’s pretty right-wing; that’s not really a good question to ask.”
Before I could protest what he said the poor guy had already stormed out. So that was handled pretty fucking terribly"
10534,I do love the internet
10535,"Removed due to Rule #14: Personal Attacks, Targeted Harassment & Uncivil Behavior.

10537,It’s fucked up. Shouldn’t be that way.
10538,"i’d be confused and think they’re lying cuz nobody is ever attracted to me

but i’m bi so it wouldn’t bother me"
10539,I'd think people had figured out I'm gay so run away and cry maybe?
10540,"Idk not really that excited for possibly getting bullied, having some of my family dislike me and losing a bunch of my friends. Doesn't sound all that fun to me"
10541,That’s quite the saving throw
10542,What the? Do u have a hobby of writing or something? Cos what u wrote right here was really good !
10543,"Id feel honoured and tell them how much i apreciate it and respect them actualy making a move on me, but id kindly reject them because im straight."
10544,Same lol
10545,OH MY GOD I DIDNT REALIZE YOURE ACTUALLY GAY I MISREAD THE COMMENT IM SO SORRY
10546,Bruh my bisexual ass it completely with you.
10547,Yikes I didn’t like where this was going until I got to the end of the sentence hahaha. I thought you were gonna say you’re doing some queer baiting shit lmao
10548,"If your friends would cease being friends with you because you came out as gay then they're not worth having as friends. Good friends should accept you for who you really are, it's their loss if they can't do that."
10549,"Yeah that’s a no no but unfortunately it’s something a lot of gay guys do, myself included but I haven’t in a good minute (this is something I see especially bottoms/submissive guys do) is they’re very persistent and pushy and everything and every interaction is spiced up some how.

For a lot of us I understand it stems from as I mentioned in my post not growing up with a regular sense of availability in society for a partner or to have kids and stuff. It can scar your mental state and the way we perceive sex and love. It’s really sad and unfortunately it can come off in, as much as I don’t like to associate the word with being gay, ‘predatory’ behavior."
10550,"In a country with anti-discrimination laws and less homophobia ingrained within society itself, this would be true. Alas, take for example Eastern Europe and pretty much most of Asia where being gay by default makes you a bad person and an abomination. In those countries even friends who would help you clean a murder AND die for you, would leave you for being gay. It's unfortunate, but true, that in some countries even the rumour that you ain't straight is enough for your family to disown you and for you to get jail time."
10551,"hasn't happened to me, but I would probably feel sorry for them because I cant reciprocate those feelings"

10565,"I THOUGHT THIS MEANT AFTER CLASS. After high school I have no clue what I'm going to do, I just want to be loved by many people and be a good part of a community"

10678,"Yeah I guess, thank God he has no idea how to set the parental control up"
10679,"Parents parent differently from other parents

 My parents dont, but I know plenty of friends who do have parents who have, idk, life360, or a time-limiting app installed on thier phones"
10680,Is it an android? If so boot it in safe mode and delete the third party app.
10681,Its kinda harmless. They know where i am anyway.  Plus if you go out somewhere you dont want them to know you can leave it at homevor your friends house
10682,Nice username too
10683,"Not unheard of , but definitely not normal.

My dad uses lock screen to lock the whole phone. I can use my phone when he unlocks"
10684,"First things first, BACK UP YOUR PHONE. And do it before anyone else even touches it. 
Then you can do the rest"
10685,"Thanks u/FuckedAnallyByLife69, very cool"
10686,No. Only one guy in my class has them and all that it does is make him be excluded from the other and have to just sit around with nothing to do while everyone is having fun
10687,My mom uses screentime on my phone that I paid for and it’s hell. Not normal. And I’m almost 18 and can’t even have Snapchat
10688,"Nope. Seems like a breach of privacy if you ask me. I don't know how your household is, but if you asked most people, they would say that your parents are overprotective and controlling. However, this is just going by the context."
10689,"why does he even lock it?, and he still does that shit at 17 ?......you’re wayyy too old for that type of stuff lol"
10690,Or turn off you location
10691,How do I boot it up in safe mode? And he's probably gonna try setting it up tonight too
10692,"Screentime isn’t an app, it’s just in Apple settings"
10693,you can turn on your battery saver and it'll say your battery saver is on which is less suspicious
10694,It’s still good idea to back up his phone regardless
10695,"My parents have made me install Life360, so they know where I am constantly"
10696,"my mom has a tracking app downloaded on my phone and doesn’t let me out of the house anyways, like i’m not allowed to see friends or go on a walk anyways but i still gotta be tracked. so idk"
10697,"I didn’t even get a phone until I was 14 and that was from my friends dad and I still have to pay the bills without a job. But I have 360 and no social media as well
       
Edit- they also put on parental controls, but I disabled them and they haven’t found out. But even if they do, I pay for my phone"
10698,Haha good joke privacy what is that
10699,It's not a reset. Just makes anything that's not a system program inert.
10700,"People here will say no because they disagree with what your parents do.

To truly answer your question, yes it's normal and a lot of parents do it. Whether it's right or not to do it."
10701,"Nah, this ain't normal. Doesn't make sense to download it now that you have even less time to use your phone"
10702,Whatever feels natural
10703,"Yeah, sexual compatibility is a totally valid reason to call off a relationship.

“I want to wait until marriage.”

“I respect that, but I really don’t think I can, nor do I want to.”

“Then I don’t think we should be in a relationship.”

“That’s upsetting, but you’re probably right.”"
10704,It would depend on how serious the relationship is
10705,From my experience I'd say definitely do not rush into it right away. One of the biggest mistakes of my life.
10706,same
10707,Nah I dont agree to have to wait till marriage I have urges and that also has to be respected.
10708,When we’re both ready ig
10709,Whenever the girl wants
10710,I'm wanting to wait till we're both 18 I don't wanna risk being fucked over
10711,"If it were someone I just met recently, a while, but if it were a longtime friend and we went into it being pretty serious about each other (like my current GF) I wouldn’t mind not waiting that long. I wouldn’t want to rush anything, though"
10712,"Being 18 doesn't solve these problems bukaroo, but you do (hopefully) have a better understanding of how to deal with them. Stay safe :)"
10713,"Get caught, have her get pregnant that type of sjit"
10714,Agreed.
10715, But depends on how serious the relationship is and how much she means to me
10716,"For anyone on this sub wait atleast 3 weeks to a month, make sure this isn't you wanting to rush things and making a bad decision"
10717,"wym fucked over, in what way"
10718,I hope you’re doing better now.
10719,Sure but I have enough self control and I don't really care enough to force myself upon her. Sex just isn't a high expectation for me. We can have sex everyday or not at all. Idc.
10720,Yes I am.
10721,Ngl sounds kind of stupid to me but whatever floats your boat
10722,"Marriage, probably. Though I'd want to talk about it on the 3rd or 4th date just to make sure we are sexually compatible."
10723,Respect
10724,"I could see that, yet honestly id dump the perfect girl if she wanted to wait till mariage"
10725,"never, im ace lmao"
10726,She’s not perfect for you if she wants to wait till marriage and you dont
10727,"Whenever the other person is comfortable with it. If she wants to do it, fine, if she doesn't fine"
10728,"that's kinda what i was thinking, there's no rush for me because i only just started dating my boyfriend in febuary. but if it was someone i'd known, i wouldn't wait as long. i wouldn't trade what i have with him, though. im fine waiting, as long as we're both comfortable."
10729,"Why? Because i dont wanna wait till mariage? First of all i am not sure if i even ever wanna get married, but for sake of argument lets say i do want that....what is wrong with not dating someone because of that? Id have to wait till im 25/30 or something, i couldnt do that even if she is perfect. Everyone bas different opinions, values and needs."
10730,"In general a few months, 4-6, 7 I’d say. But of course if things were going fast, and as others say, if it feels natural sooner, I’d be okay with that too. I would have to love this person, either way. I won’t have sex with someone I don’t love. Be that I start feeling love in a matter of a handful of weeks or a year"

Haha you neet"
10734,Noooo my fragile ego how could you😭😭

10736,I couldn’t have said it better myself.
10737,Here we see a three act play

10742,"Nah, the only insults that hurt me nowadays are my own to myself because if other people hate me I see it coming."
10743,"I agree. 

TBH, I can't remember an insult from any girl and any insult from a guy is either laughable or accurate and both of those are good for me IMO."
10744,Nah because the girls hit where it hurts more often whereas the boys just say more general things (in my experience)
10745,"Yeah this is it. Like a lot of people value the way the opposite gender sees them, so it hits harder, but it really comes down to if you value their opinion of you."
10746,Yep
10747,prolly cause ur not attracted to them😤
10748,damn now I wish I was gay
10749,Depends on the insult

**bE gaY** lmao"
10757,Yes... and I wish it didn’t but even when I see a guy insult some random girl for a trait I have... it makes me feel bad for her and me too lmao
10758,Only one girl insults me and I'm not afraid of giving it back to her
10759,Deep
10760,Not really. I don't think so.
10761,"Absolutely. Guys joke around/tease/ and insult their friends all the time, but it’s in good fun. If that’s the social dynamic between me and a female friend, then is fine. If it’s not, then yeah that hurts"
10762,"In public or in private? If it was in public I’d think she was kinda weird ngl. But both ways, I’d think it was cute."
10763,Bro Same
10764,I honestly don't get why most guys don't like cosplayers or catgirls. Catgirls are cute and cosplayers are awesome!
10765,"I will probably do a catgirl cosplay for comic con , so idk if that counts as “public”"
10766,It is public but it kinda fits the occasion so that’s fine :)
10767,If a guy did that at my school he will be bullied relentlessly
10768,Some find it so cute they do it too. There was a senior (guy) at my school that wore cat ears to school everyday.
10769,Very.
10770,Doesn't to anything for me either way really.
10771,Kinda weird and I wouldn’t like it
10772,Absolutely
10773,I think people felt bad for him so he didn’t get bullied
10774,most guys don't have anything against cosplayers
10775,"Cute is subjective. If you want to do a cosplay you like, then go for it, don’t let other’s subjective opinions stop you from doing what makes you happy."
10776,Why does that make you insecure? It’s more like why would you bully someone that’s having a rough time already.
10777,*Watch out for elon musk tho*
10778,I’m not really a fan
10779,Depends on what the guy likes
10780,"For me no, but I  think most guys will like it"
10781,tbh most guys don't even know what that is
10782,What is your opinion on it?
10783,He'll take you to his secret lab and make you an actual cat girl
10784,Wdym
10785,"Sucks to say but this will generally rely on your looks and each person's own opinion. Some people will find it cute others find it cringe. There's no pleasing everyone

Do what you feel like, you look 1000x cuter when you are confident in yourself and don't need to be loved by everyone.

Go for it and have some fun :)"
10786,"Depends on the effort put into the full cosplay. If it’s a good cosplay then yeah, if it’s a crap cosplay then maybe the ears could redeem it a bit. If you’re just gonna dress normally and put cat ears on then it’d only really be cute if you’re cute anyway."
10787,It may be cute but I don’t think I’d be into it that much.
10788,fuck yes
10789,"I will be with a group of 20 guys, i trust they wont do anything creepy and will help/protect me if anyone would try that"
10790,"eh, depends"
10791,"Mostly the guys into anime would like it, personally i dont but if you’re going to ComicCon you should be fine"
10792,idk about you guys but someone can go from a 5/10 to a 8/10 if they smell really good

10828,nope

10830,Not at all! I don’t mind it and wear it almost everywhere even though I don’t have to wear it in my country
10831,Masks are ass. Tend to fog up my glasses.

10833,Same bro I got hella acne

10835,"My acne isn’t bad anywhere on my face... except my forehead.

Edit: I can’t type so I changed “is” to “isn’t”

It’s also pretty bad like right beside my eyes. 

Why is acne so goddamn weird?"

10838,"Oh my god shut the fuck up, this is such a cringey Reddit culture comment lmao. I genuinely rolled my eyes at this. 
  
Surgeons work in air-conditioned rooms and hardly move. You can’t compare a surgeon to a marching band member. I think everyone should be masked up but acting like they don’t restrict breathing during physical activity is just complete nonsense.  
  
Good lord, people like this claim to be pro-science but then just ignore reality and act like it isn’t harder to breathe with a mask on. Of course it is, your airflow is objectively restricted."
10839,"That video was stupid lol, it doesn’t mean you can’t breathe in them at all it means it’s harder to breathe. You should go try it, go run with 10 layers of masks on and then take them off and see what feels better.  
  
Do you think firefighters enjoy wearing masks? Do you think it’s comfortable for them? Of course not, but they do it because they have to, just like us. Saying “it’s uncomfortable” doesn’t make someone a “Karen,” that’s just you jumping on some obnoxious Reddit trend for upvotes. It’s an annoying way to enforce moral superiority."
10840,Implying that everyone is in marching band and does hours of practice.
10841,"Yes, but I have no problem with it, for it is a necessary procedure we must all follow until the virus is properly dealt with."
10842,No I like wearing masks
10843,Kinda. But I wear it still the same unless I'm working outm
10844,It was a joke

10851,"Good for them, but guess what? I’m not a fucking surgeon, so I shouldn’t be subjected to their standards. I wear one when I’m out in public places, but they’re still really fucking annoying, and saying so doesn’t make me a Karen"

10912,"I think people in general tend to be a bit tribalistic and make things an us vs them thing which leads to that mindset. I think also the reason those subs in particular become misandrist is that they are made up of a majority teenage user base.

A lot subs that are majority male also have misogynistic undertones (memes, dankmemes, hiphopheads, indieheads, jokes are all subs I like and browse but also have a lot of misogyny).  Like do you remember all of the girls = boring, boys = quirky memes? The misandry in female majority subreddits is bad, but sexism is not exclusive to female majority subreddits.

I think also it’s not all female majority subs that end up being that way (just like how not all male majority subreddits end up that way).  ActualLesbians, TwoXChromosomes, Askwomen, MakeupAddiction, SkincareAddiction, and TheGirlSurvivalGuide are all pretty chill subs."
10913,"I think ""men hating"" is pretty extreme, but agree that they are pretty anti men. But I hardly ever visit those type of subreddits anymore (r/AskTeenGirls, r/AskWomen, etc), so I guess I wouldn't really know."
10914,Wierd how she gets upvoted when she says all men are bad but then downvoted when she says all white people are racist(not saying she is right becouse she obviusly isnt). So these girls like it when they hate on other groups but dont like it when people hate on them
10915,"why is it that as soon as one post about the anti-men thing on tiktok comes up on reddit people make a huge deal but when people make sexist jokes against women on reddit for years no one gives a shit and it keeps happening

just to be clear i think the ""killallmen2020"" thing is not really funny, it's technically also sexist"

10920,"Tbh I think with girls, a lot of teen girls have negative experiences with men especially on the internet. The internet isn't always a great place to be a girl in between creeps and misogynists. There are plenty of subs on Reddit devoted to misogyny and there are undertones of it all over Reddit from those ""boys Vs girls"" memes to people refusing to talk about women's issues without arguing that it's worse for men.

Of course this does not make it right but I think we should have more empathy too."
10921,"tbh, who the fuck cares. this kind of stuff isn't worth wasting your time on"
10922,"now you know how girls feel in male-oriented subreddits. This happens to everyone, you aren't oppressed buddy."

10924,ooh these comments are gonna be interesting 👀
10925,"Well sure, some girls are saying some bad shit about men, but there’s also many males in the comments saying shit like ”That’s What feminism does to people”. So it’s just as usual.
Some people are assholes, but most are just nice people sharing their theories"
10926,"Yeah, you get quite tired of dishwasher jokes after 15 years"
10927,"I have to disagree with you. Though most of those comments were sexist toward men, these subreddits don’t develop man-hating opinions. All of the people from the sample comments were over 16. I feel like by 17, people have their opinions fairly set.

Also why is your source almost a year old for the comments?

Also the girls on ATG were answering the question to the best of their abilities. They were asked a question, and answered it. They defend the girl based off of their knowledge on the topic. I’ve seen boys say the hate all women, and that women are dishwashers and maids. I can realise 9/10 times it’s a joke. We can’t really tell if it’s a joke or not by the context. And some girls think it is girl code to give the benefit of the doubt. 

“Can someone help me with my brother (15) who says he hates women?

Recently my brother (15) has been posting stuff on instagram about hating women. 

""i absolutely HATE women but like,,, i'm so obsessed with them it's a problem💔💔""

""...like ughhh go wash dishes and take care of kids or something already🙄""

""okay maybe this women deserves rights.."" (this is a reference to a tiktok)

""god i hate women <3...like wtf is wrong with them 😐""

I’m sorry but honestly if a guy posted that I would KNOW that it’s a joke. Look at the emojis.

Look I know I’m going to get downvoted to hell and back but I just disagree."

10929,I think the people in the comments saying all men are sexist and all white people are racist was pretty extreme.
10930,"tbf this is not a trend on reddit, tiktok has way more girls than reddit in the first place and boys have been making sexist jokes on teenager subreddits for a long time. i can understand they seem like harmless jokes but when it's all you see for a while and whenever you complain about them you get called a stupid feminazi who needs to learn how to take a joke it gets really annoying to see the same meme get thousands of upvotes over and over again

if the ok wallet thing started on reddit it would end like that

again i don't think condemning genocide against men makes for a funny joke"
10931,I believe he’s referring to the warped image of Feminism; people who use the banner of Feminists to advocate for far left or reverse discriminatory ideas. (they call themselves radical feminists)
10932,"Most of the ""haha I hate men"" stuff is a joke. Both male teen subreddits and r/teenagers are filled with males making sexist jokes too (to the streets, dishwasher, sandwich maker, girls boring hurr durr). So unless you want to call the misogyny I don't think it's fair calling the other thing misandry."
10933,The first two don’t seem very man hating to me but the third one is a big oof
10934,"I do, and TBH, after having a lot of arguments, I have found the solution is to ignore them.

Let them do what they want (as long as it's not illegal). They are toxic people, just like those that mistreat women. The only solution is to leave them alone and not infect yourself with their toxicity.

Key ideas: Don't mistreat either gender, ignore those who do because they will never learn the errors of their ways, and generally don't care about what people post online (the loudest voice doesn't mean the majority voice)"
10935,"No, but it explains it. For I don't know how many years girls have been told that their only purpose is to please men and do the dishes and that their stupid and only worth anything if they are pretty. Now we are making the same jokes about you and you get really upset. So when boys stop calling women dishwashers we will stop calling men trash."
10936,Why can’t we all just get along? This world is already a shitty place there’s no need to be hating each other because of our genders.
10937,Would you care about women-hating subreddits?
10938,I've commented on r/twoxchromosomes and nobody has been rude.
10939,"i use tiktok and honestly it's pretty funny, i try not to judge a whole app by one unfunny joke"
10940,Yeah I love the subreddit! It’s super wholesome.
10941,"I don’t mean this in a way to invalidate your experience and I’m sorry if this comes off as rude, but can you explain that a bit more for me? I never really noticed anything off about that sub, but that could just be me not noticing it."
10942,"I find it attractive if a girl loves hugging, cuddling and touching in general. I'm a very physical person and I enjoy it so I'd love a girl who's like that."
10943,Smart nerdy and nice
10944,[deleted]
10945,Especially if she likes k-pop its an IMMEDIATE turn off for me.
10946,"Mainly intelligence and smarts, but also caring."
10947,#*Why is this so far down*
10948,"Smart, funny, doesn’t cheat."
10949,"this is true

i mostly just look for a music taste similar to mine but certain genres like that are a no go"
10950,"Yep. Those k-pop cringy fangirls are so toxic. If she likes metal or rock though, she is IN."
10951,Yes but not sexual touching just hugs and kisses
10952,Feeling like they actually give a shit
10953,Clingy-ness lol
10954,wait really I always thought guys think I’m weird because I love metal and rock
10955,"Be honest and communicative. If you trust your partner, then don't hold your problems in. If you are worried about something/have problems, share it with him/her. I am sure you can figure out a solution together."
10956,"This! Make him feel like he should be comfortable with telling you about the cool thing he drew, made, baked, bought, created or just whatever. Its a great way to show affection and that you care!

Edit: Have my gold, for a good and genuine question!"
10957,"I can’t believe i have to say this but

Don’t cheat on the guy, it’s litterally the leading cause of break ups."
10958,Never stopped my pastor
10959,"i'm interested in a girl pretty quickly if they listen to anything somewhat similar to what i like. i listen to a lot of music, so being able to share that is something i like"
10960,Sexual touching too. Every kind of touching.
10961,Maybe not *too* much
10962,Not everyone that listens to K-pop is one of those fan girls
10963,Seductiveness
10964,But *just* right
10965,"Nope, you are very much normal. Guys will not ever think you are weird because you like metal/rock. Those are my favorite genres and if I saw a girl listen to those genres at my school I’d be friends with her quick."
10966,"Kindness, honesty (mainly with your feelings), patience and trust when discussing touchy subjects (like feelings or hot controversial topics), listening and asking to understand, not to reply

Things like this apply to both genders, but communication is where a ton of people fail. Other than general human being stuff, it's probably unique personality quirks which make you you. I'd personally love it if my future girlfriend were artistic in some way. Music/dancing/painting are preferred. I'm musical myself so if I could share and exchange that with her, it would be great."
10967,That's a high standard lol
10968,guys I caught one
10969,Sense of humour
10970,"To be fair, not everyone that enjoys kpop is one of those koreaboo fangirls with their youtube name as “BTS ARMY SUGA MARRY ME”, although I will admit there are many."

10988,is japanese really hard to learn?
10989,"Yeah I guess, there is a lot to learn and three alphabets"
10990,Hold on Japanese has three alphabets?
10991,just the society we live in
10992,I take French
10993,#BOTTOM TEXT
10994,And kanji I think is a mix of Chinese and Japanese characters
10995,אבל ערבית שלומדים בבית ספר היא ספרותית זה לא ערבית מדוברת (לפחות אצלי)
10996,"See this is why the European system is better because I’m pretty sure they start learning English and what’s basically kindergarten and then they continue with others, along with having their native language. In the US a lot of people are basically stuck with English."
10997,Well they are for different things
10998,Im dutch i speak english a bit french and learning spanish
10999,ayy what’s up
11000,Well that sounds like it’s annoyingly difficult to learn three separate alphabets for one language.
11001,How so?
11002,Preferences differ from person to person.
11003,Best answer
11004,Tall girls. I'm 6'7 so there's no chance I'll go out with a 5'3 girl for practical reasons (I hope innuendo doesn't violate the no non-educational nsfw rule lmao)
11005,_**He's speaking the language of gods.**_
11006,"they defo are, that's what i keep telling my best friend! she insists on wearing ridiculously high heels to be the same height as me"
11007,short girls tbh
11008,I'd like a girl shorter than me by a bit but not to a large extent.
11009,"that's true, it seems to be pretty evenly split"
11010,to be the same height as you the heels would have to be 5 inches she's 63 inches tall total her heels are 8 percent of her total high wtf
11011,Truth
11012,Keep in mind that when you ask any question that has anything to do with relationships on Reddit the answers are *significantly* skewed
11013,I prefer tall girls ngl
11014,shes got some 6 inch heels too lol
11015,"me being 4’6, all girls are taller than me"
11016,No preference tbh
11017,"Short girls, but like almost everything, depends on the girl."
11018,This is true.
11019,haha that's def a good reason. safety first!
11020,Tall
11021,I prefer tall girls tbh but every girl is good :D
11022,Both
11023,"fairs, you'd have to lean over a lot if u went out w a girl who was like 5'1"
11024,5’6 is perfect height to me.
11025,"Im 5'8 not the tallest guy around, I'd prefer a short girl."
11026,same
11027,I'm 6ft. So I probably wouldn't want to date someone short.
11028,Facts
11029,Both
11030,"i know, i’m pretty attractive aren’t I"
11031,that's still pretty tall! most of my friends would be shorter than you lol
11032,*He could be any one of us*
11033,"Right here bud, I'm a ginger with blue eyes and moderate freckles and I'm not pure white (day Walker if you get that reference), genetically I'm about as special as possible without having a mutation and I try to take care of my body but acne is a bitch and acne stuff makes my skin dry as hell. I dont see why people would be attracted to my looks if not for the reason to be able to say ""I dated a ginger"" or shit like that"
11034,"No, I think Im ugly."
11035,*Reality is often dissapointing*
11036,basically me but hey my gf saw something in me so badda bing
11037,"I think that many girls have had crushes on me, because of statistics, I don’t believe I’m handsome or something else, just don’t believe that a person in this earth haven’t had a crush earlier in life"
11038,"Yikes, I’m sure ur better than you think"
11039,"He could be you,"
11040,He could be me
11041,He could even be—
11042,"Yes, all the time."

11044,"*My looks aren't perfectly balanced, as all things should be*"
11045,Holy fuck same
11046,"ye

i lack confidence in public and that's why i'm sure no one would ever crush on me"
11047,I think Harry and Herimonie would be very offended
11048,A BEAN
11049,"I’m your psychiatrist, Ron"
11050,Im mega average in all aspects and yet it happens. Maybe its that one above average thing abt being tall idk.
11051,Same. My personality is shite except I’m also ugly. Bruh
11052,"Exact same story with me, my gf is amazing"
11053,F
11054,"Haha, good luck in the future"
11055,"Yeah, same"
11056,ye ikr I’m still confused by it but I won’t complain :p
11057,I'd say I'm average so once a girl called me cute I got totally flustered cause I wouldn't think anyone would find me cute.
11058,No. I think I’m ugly and I’m sure no girl had a crush on me
11059,Are you... me?
11060,"I’m just a rly big nerd, and don’t have very good social skills"
11061,Took a look at your profile and you're definitely not ugly dude.
11062,"It is a pretty great feeling ngl, especially when you know you both like eachother.

I've kissed my best friend (19f) on the cheeks and forehead a few times (we've both agreed lips are out of bounds) and she's kissed me a few times as well and it's really really nice.

However when a girl that I knew liked me came over one day (not really a date we just hung out and she stayed over) we properly kissed and it was amazing. The first one wasn't great cos I'm very inexperienced but after that it was bliss.

As someone else said, it's not so much the kiss, it's the intimacy. Holding eachother, cuddling eachother, being that close to someone and sharing a moment like that is just something else.

And then we made out and tongues got involved and that's different but still amazing, especially when it's passionate (as it was for me). Don't use too much tongue, just go with the flow and the feeling will whisk you away

Edit: it's taken me 19 years to kiss a girl so don't let it get you down if you haven't, it will happen!"
11063,"It’s warm, and you get a fuzzy feeling when it happens. If you’re talking about making out, well I haven’t gotten there yet :("
11064,"Soft lips, it's nice n all and if it wasn't on truth or dare, I'm sure it would've been better"
11065,"Woah, this just took me on a trip...in my head"
11066,"Well, glad I got another year to kiss a guy 😂"
11067,Wait. Truth or Dare kisses are a real thing? I thought they were a myth
11068,Woah can we keep this child friendly
11069,[deleted]
11070,Yea
11071,Great explanation :)
11072,Wanna kiss me virtually before marriage? 😳
11073,I dont know :(
11074,Does your dick grow when kissing?
11075,"It'll happen when it happens, there's genuinely no rush. It happened to me pretty unexpectedly and out of the blue so don't worry about missing out!"
11076,Depends on the kiss ish? and the girl.
11077,Get a room you two
11078,[deleted]
11079,"It's pretty cool if you're attracted to the person. I'm not really sure how to explain it but it's a feeling where you genuinely like the person and it makes you feel loved and needed, in my experience at least. Wish it would happen again I just need to make more of an effort to try and date and ask people out"
11080,Neither have I...
11081,My first and only was out of pity.
11082,Wow kissing before marriate is bad but VIRTUALLY yeah we can do that 😳😳
11083,😳😳😳

11086,Username checks out

11089,I thought grils always wanted an older guy 😳😳
11090,You're old 😳😳😳
11091,Only thing i have done is  making out but someone’s tongue ur mouth feels fucking good 😳
11092,"It’s a possibility, I’m not sure how the whole relationship ‘culture’ on snapchat works since I don’t use it, but it’s hard to say a definite yes or no"
11093,"as I have said countless times, I have no experience with love and/or relationships so all my knowledge comes from movies, shows and memes. this acts as a disclaimer.

probably, if he starts messaging you out of nowhere, he either likes you and didn't tell you before, or he's just part of a pyramid scheme."
11094,"i mean honestly he called you cute, and unless he's the alpha type who hangs out with a considerable amount of chicks and has had a couple of girlfriends or has a lot of friends that are girls, he probably likes you. just go for it"
11095,how do i do the remind me bot again
11096,"honestly dont be afraid to double snap, shows interest on your end. guys need the hint, were acc blind when it comes to that"
11097,!remindme 1m
11098,"Leaving someone on read doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you. Idk how it is for the majority of guys but for me, if my crush and I are snapping and i say something then all she replies with is “😂😂😂” or anything similar, im just gonna leave her on read because idk how to respond to that. But if he left you on read on the middle of a convo and you weren’t sending dry texts then thats a different case."
11099,Im pretty sure he ghosted you because he was embarrassed by calling you cute and didnt want to risk rejection
11100,Do you want to sell kitchen knives

11108,"1. Guys are oblivious on snap and don't give a care.

2. Guys think a lot of girls are cute, and say it to those they're close with (i.e. good friends who are female). Its tough for a guy to straight up call a girl they like cute so I think its worth a shot to ask him about it and probe a little bit into the topic."

11149,Aaaand it's a subject I suck at.
11150,Probably a hairdresser
11151,I will teach you
11152,"I’m at an age where dating a girl 1-2 years younger than me will be considered weird so yes definitely why not date an older girl.

When you 16 dating an 14 year old is weird."
11153,"UK side, I've heard it as 1/2 your age +7"
11154,"It’s because age difference is different relative to your age. teenagers go through puberty, they go through so many changes and phases, are seemingly completely different people one year later. 

e.g. i cringe at my 15 year old self so much- i actually used to think that i’m old and so mature. lmao, i wasnt. i fucking wasnt."
11155,"Officer, I can explain. See, you divide your age by two..."
11156,"Yeah, at most about 2 years tho.

Actually, I'm dating older girl 

 *by exactly 2 weeks*"
11157,"The ± 8 makes it less ... weird for couples.

""If you're 20, your parner shouldn't be younger than 17.""

Can be perceived as excuse for slight pedophilia .."
11158,"This, I really think this is weird. If you’re 40 and dating someone who is 45 it’s normal but 16 and 14 is weird? I get it but I think that it should still be socially acceptable..."
11159,Yeah that's the one I've always heard
11160,Its because kids in the age range of 10-12-14/15 are usually going through puberty. A 16 year old is somewhat mature whereas a 13-14 is probably not that mature. So that makes it a little weird. On the other hand a 30yo dating a 40yo is completely fine as both of them are complete adults.
11161,This. Its less about age difference and ~~now~~ more about maturity level
11162,Yes
11163,i'd only date someone a year older than me but as you get older the difference becomes less significant so that number will probably get bigger over time
11164,"Sure, absolutely! The person I’m kinda falling for right now is 17, and we talked about it and really see anything wrong with it. We live in California, and legally the grace period is 2 years. 

However in the end, it comes down to maturity. I know people my age who I wouldn’t date cause they just act ridiculous. On the flip side, I have friends who’re a year younger and are more mature than me. So as long as me and them are in sync on maturity, and fit within the legal 2 year gap, I don’t see anything wrong with it."

If you're 20, your partner shouldn't be older than 24.

If you're 15, your parner shouldn't be younger than 14.

If you're 30, your parner shouldn't be older than 44."

Edit: nah legit tho, those are just debates. It's just really hard to make a well thought out point, consider and rebut someone's argument, and stay civil all at the same time. Especially when you haven't prepped for it. You also have to open to admit that you're wrong, and overcome whatever biases you have.

11266,"As a 13 year old, just talk to him and tell him that he needs to take a break. Ask his mother to tell him it's not okay to play games so much."

Routers vary though, if you have discord and need help I can work on it with you"

And thanks for your input. I’m literally filling a notebook here thanks to you guys."
11274,"1. The main social medias I use are Instagram Reddit, Snapchat and discord. They all have slightly different uses to me. Instagram is for seeing what friends are getting up to and also I put a bit of memes in my Instagram feed as well. Snapchat is generally more for messaging but I check out people's stories sometimes. Reddit is a nice way to communicate semi-anonymously where everyone is equal in black and white and it's what they say and post that matters, I enjoy comedy subreddits, ones about my hobbies and political/economic discourse on here (but those are all niche and specific for me) a lot of people on Reddit are quite introverted as well. I communicate with a band I'm in over WhatsApp and my music group has an Instagram chat as well so in a way Instagram can perform the same function as Snapchat and WhatsApp but it just depends on what everyone else you're trying to communicate with is using. Discord is a bit of a weird one, it's not necessarily social media, it's generally more of a messaging service and voice call thing which puts an emphasis on you joining and taking part in communities. Or you could just use it for voice calls and chats with friends.


2. Yes young people meet less however during quarantine I speak with my friends over voice chat everyday and we've set up a discord server for events that we do. So it's swings and roundabouts, we're more connected than people could ever have been during a quarantine in the past.

3. People on Reddit are generally not going to be people who follow influencers as it's just a different demographic, you see more extroverted kids being obsessed with influencers. For celebs footballers are obviously a very large thing, you would likely follow your local sports team of interest and a couple of your favourite players. Actors are also very big on social media. Especially Instagram. Snapchat is more used for messaging whereas Instagram is in some ways people projecting a version of themselves onto the internet.

I live in England and feel free to ask any follow up questions"
11275,Thanks. Appreciate it
11276,fyi discord is not popular among more popular kids

11280,"1.All my friends use Snapchat insta and sometimes Facebook but I'm only one who uses Reddit
2.its true that gaming and social media made teenagers a little bit more distant because we can play together without being physically together and still have a lot of fun. But when we can we hang out , we go to cinema, play football (let's say twice a month during school)

11281,"Hope all goes well, do you have a name for the book? When it comes out I’d love to read it."
11282,"Ah yes, with you now."
11283,"Well, you can always save it in the chat or screenshot the chat. If you do so, though, everyone else can see that you’ve done it. 

I was more referring to the fact that Snapchat is legally required to back up its servers and information. I’m not quite sure how far into the past it’s forced to save the data, but competent (read: legal) investigation could find stuff supposedly “erased” from Snapchat within that time period.

Ninja edit: something people do to get around that is take a picture of the chat or snap with another phone or computer. Might be useful to know."
11284,All I can really say is that in my experience most people my age don’t use Twitter
11285,"Dumb teenagers (like myself) would probably use Snapchat to commit crimes over other platforms because “messages disappear, it’s fine no need to be more careful”."
11286,"The social media really depends where you are. Here we mostly use whatsapp to text but a lot of countries use snap or insta, and it also depends on the year haha"
11287,That’s fascinating. I suppose there are ways of it being saved though?
11288,"1. Instagram and Snapchat are the most used platform by people my age in my school (probably Instagram slightly more) and tiktok has gained popularity, though mostly with a female audience.
2. Online gaming definitely means you meet less in real life, most of my friends I see only in school and talk to only at school, on online games and on social media. This is apart from some very close friends and there are other factors at play.
3. Teenage boys usually follow footballers ( Christiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi being the most popular) along with actors and musicians ( pop or rap). Teenage girls usually favour fashion icons and reality stars and (again) actors and musicians (slightly more pop than rap). Everyone follows friends from school as well.

This is from my experience and can be a bit stereotypical at some points but I think it's mostly true.

11289,"1: Alot of my friends use Snapchat for texting each other and Instagram to post pictures of themselves ig.

2: Yes i see my friends outside of school maybe once a month? We usually just hop on a discord call and play video games

3: I would say people my age just follow their favourite sport idols (LeBron James, christiano Ronaldo, Messi, tom brady are just a few examples) and their favourite musicians (Billie eilish, Drake, the weeknd, Justin Bieber and people like them)

11297,"1. My friends and I mostly use WhatsApp to text, Instagram for posting pictures of ourselves and sometimes snapchat to text too. I personally use twitter, tiktok and reddit for entertainment and news.

2. I don't see my friends that often, because I'd rather be alone, but also sometimes they'd just meet up to play sports and i suck at most sports.

11548,"Sure, you do you man. I’m sure that there are some adults out there that sleep with stuffed animals"
11549,It’s not normal but yes of course its okay. And by not normal i just mean that the majority of guys don’t.

11551,"i sleep w/o clothes, don’t wanna accidentally fuck my dog."
11552,Just don't stick it on your balls
11553,Something funny bruv?
11554,"Sure. Many of us have stuffed animals from our childhood. It's not just the familiarity or the memories, it's just: They exist, they mean something to you so why let them collect dust somewhere when you could have them close to you?"
11555,I still sleep with one because I’ve gotten so used to the feeling and position that when it’s not there I feel uncomfortable
11556,of course! i personally don’t anymore but there’s nothing wrong with it at all.

11560,Same
11561,Lmao
11562,I think it's totally okay
11563,I stopped when I was about 6 or 7. I always found it weird that people would sleep with stuffed animals past the age of 10 but lots of people do it so I must be the weird one.
11564, No. I still sleep with him. He knows my secrets. I’ll keep it until I have a son or daughter and give it to them.
11565,What did you just say? Fucking a 12 pillow is illegal?
11566,I use a pillow too but for my knees cuz I don’t like the bony feeling
11567,penguins are the best
11568,Yes if it comforts you

11619,No problem. I feel you though. I’ve been feeling a bit lonely as of late as well.

Dirty sex comes later, I want to have an intimate moment with my lady first."
11626,that sounds great but i don't really have any friends...
11627,I want the intimacy of slow sensual sex but either would be great
11628,If you’ve got any friends just ask for a hug. It may seem strange and out of character in the moment but just being like “I’ve been feeling pretty down lately. I could really use a hug if you don’t mind.” More than likely they’ll oblige.
11629,Same
11630,when I had a girlfriend sometimes I put my arm around her shoulder
11631,Aye
11632,"We are busy but every Saturday we arrange a virtual movie date, we both watch the same movie while video calling cuddled up in blankets eating junk food while adding stupid commentary.. I recommend it"
11633,She's beem talking to me less over the past couple days. She leaves me on delivered but is active in group chats and Instagram. She talks to guys across the country from discord more than me. So overall not great.
11634,"She just lost feelings I guess, it ended on really good terms but she didn’t really know what she wanted, I was her first boyfriend though so she probably just wasn’t sure I guess but idk"
11635,"You gotta confront her and communicate about it. I have had that happen before, communication and understanding is key"
11636,Aww may I ask what happened? :(
11637,We talk occasionally. Had a massive falling out late March or April and didn't speak for 3 weeks. My mum got us back together though and we've been fine ever since.
11638,[deleted]
11639,Yea well she doesnt have Netflix or something so we just cant watch any romantic movies together aaahhhrrg 😩. And yours Sound actually cute
11640,"uhhh, I can help you out if you want me to.  DM me some movies you want and ill send you a google drive link, it will be a 7zip with a password. Also, if you dont speak english I need to know that, and what language you do speak."
11641,"I try and she just leaves me read, she's said it's because quarentines hard and she's trying not to miss me although that just sounds like an exscuse :/"
11642,"Bruh say you YOU WANT TO TALK TO HER. That you are willing to video call and comfort her and talk, and if not, it's not like the relationship is gonna suddenly hop back to normal after quarantine."
11643,"I feel for you, she is pretty new to everything.. because emotions are confusing and stupid"
11644,[deleted]
11645,DANG YOU'RE LUCKY!!
11646,Just want to say that you are a good guy
11647,"Ahhh, thanks for the clarification. Unfortunately, I don't have one. But thanks anyway cos I've been wondering for a while now and always thought it was something like Superior Officer xD"
11648,As far as I can tell everything is a-ok and we started dating basically right as this started so nothing really changed
11649,What's an S/O?
11650,"It means significant other, so boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. :)"
11651,We text each other everyday about everything. It's kinda sad we cant see eachother
11652,"I’m sorry about that bro, but now that you guys are back together, hopefully you won’t mind me asking what happened?"
11653,I fell for two catfishes who I thought were real girls and I started chatting them up. It was a huge dick move.
11654,"There are so many movies that secretly get uploaded to YouTube, and I find lots of pirated sites (my bf isn't a techie so I worry about him going there).. if your gf is a fan of musicals on YouTube just search ""slime tutorials"" and you will find Broadway recordings secretly uploaded in disguise, including Hamilton"
11655,Thanks!
11656,"She doesent like video calls and she's usually too busy anyway cause shes always doing ""farm work"" (she lives on a farm). Outside of quarentine she's amazing and always their for me. I think the main reason is that I've put too much pressure on her with my mental health and stuff."
11657,sorry homie 😔
11658,So you think that she is not talking to you because she doesn't want to get bombarded with that responsibility? I do understand that
11659,"We're really sad we can't see eachother. We're just doing everything we can, but over text."
11660,"Yeah it sucks, but life moves on and I feel very happy without a relationship now so I’m pretty stoked about that, best of luck to you in your love life"
11661,"Ikr! I’ve been in a few relationships and have never called another guy cute or went to talk with random guys while with them. 

I’ve been hit up more when i was dating them, but I never fell into talking to them because I respect my partner and expect them to do the same for me"
11662,skirts😭😭
11663,"Yes

 i mean depends on the girl and the skirts, but skirts are pretty"
11664,"Short skirts are hot, long skirts not so much according to me"
11665,yes it’s pretty hot
11666,"Yes. Yes. Y E S.

Did I mention that yes?"

11676,"what does thick mean, like big thighs smaller lower leg/calf? or just bigger *private areas* like on the back side and chest? or does it mean like girls that r a little chubby?"
11677,nah not really imo it works no matter your skin tone
11678,Yes skirts even somehow make boys look cute (no homo) even though I'm straight.

i think it's called microphthalmia and it's a birth defect where one of ur eyes grows wrong so it doesn't work correctly
 
he really lost the eye lottery cuz his functioning eye needs glasses lol"
11702,Guys he said the funny word

11711,"Ok, lol. When I was really young one of my eyes was so much worse than the other that my nervous system could have stopped taking the info to my brain, basically rendering it blind. Luckily wearing a pair of glasses with a lense that made that specific eye look huge was enough to fix it, I don't even need glasses anymore!"

11722,I was humming/ barely singing to my favorite Daft Punk song and this guy said “Well look at the emo gay kid.” I had nothing to certify as an emo kid and do not qualify as an emo kid.
11723,"Following bodybuilding because that involves looking at muscular, oiled up dudes in very skimpy clothes, hitting all sorts of poses."
11724,"Lol Daft Punk is just electronic, how tf do you get emo from that?"
11725,Washing your face. Seriously.
11726,"_**“The colour pink is gay.”**  tbh I don't feel it's the weirdest thing, but it seems kinda strange._

(even tho i am)"
11728,That thing pisses me off tbh.
11729,Me not playing country roads on the guitar.
11730,"Not gay

But my mum tells me using a small umbrella is girly and men normally use big umbrellas (which isn't true at all)"
11731,That's kinda gay dude
11732,"Pedicures and manicures, and basically just showing any interest on beauty treatments or products, like everyone wants to look good idk why you have to be judgemental."
11733,Woah you're gay?? That is pretty gay ngl
11734,My dad says that straws in drinks without lids are gay
11735,"For real. I love my manis and pedis, my massages, and my chiropractor. I use facial scrubs, body moisturizing cream, and SPF because I don't want to look 90 when I'm 30. If people want to call me gay for that, go right ahead.

11740,At my volunteer fire department they put neon green stickers on the helmets of all members under the age of 18 so we wouldn’t be confused by out of town officers as interior firefighters. Previously our helmets were the same as 18+ exterior firefighters and interior firefighters. This move was minor and done for our safety and that of our community and one of the idiots called them gay because he didn’t like it. Both the weirdest thing to call gay and a very stupid thing for that person to say.
11741,*our weekly circle jerk*
11742,"I think a lot of you guys confuse people calling stuff gay. There's gay that literally just means something is gay, and there's gay that just means that something sucks.

11751,"I mean it is, only a gay guy would be too afraid or too shy to not kiss the homies good night. Cause it's weird you know? Kissing the gender that you're attracted to. It's like a straight dude kissing a girl in a platonic way, feels kinda weird for many unless you're really really close. So it actually makes sense. And if you're secure enough in your sexuality, you shouldn't have issue with kissing another man that you're not sexually attracted towards."

11783,"sounds like you just chilled out, you didn't go ""lone wolf"""
11784,I came here to say that.
11785,"Is skiing with family being a lone wolf haha?

I mean I just have trust issues, I’m not socially awkward and have many friends at school, but I just choose to sit in a room and read by myself during school. Usually cos I tend to feel lonelier around people, I do prefer single player games even if I do play multiplayer a decent amount. Overall I enjoy being alone yeah"

11788,"That's the reason why I don't want to be alone all the time, I actually don't care if I'm alone but people would think that I'm a loser or something like that"
11789,"I have been this person for ages, as long as i can really remember. After all this time im finding it difficult to change at all. Sure, i have managed to make a few more friends recently but its difficult"
11790,"yea, my brother told recently told me that I haven't been to a social event in 3 years, and it kinda shook me up, but I prefer to be alone. However, there is a girl that I'm soon going to ask out, who I would rather be with her than being alone."
11791,"I love going places with just my father, but I also thrive from other social interactions IRL and online."
11792,I feel like I would have been content too if my dad took me skiing on weekends lmao
11793,More like a... regular wolf
11794,"For personal reasons, my parents and I move to a new country every few months. I don’t make a lot of friends because of it. I mostly sit inside and watch anime, play video games or walk to the McDonalds across the street. I like my lifestyle. Being alone is easier for me than being around people I pretend to like. I have a dog which is basically my stand in girlfriend (even though she’s a he) so I’ve got all my bases covered. There’s nothing wrong with being alone. If you enjoy it, why change it. That’s my philosophy at least."
11795,"I think it's important to do some stuff by yourself and have time to be by yourself so you can work on yourself, but friends definitely should still have a large place in life. However if you're with family you're not a ""lone wolf"" you just like to stick with family and aren't interested in hanging out with anyone else."
11796,Yeah I prefer being alone but my friends usually force me to go out and try new things
11797,Being alone ia awesome. Its just so much freedom. Still being with friends is usually more fun then being alone at like the school were you cant really do alot of other things
11798,"I'm fine with being alone, but friends do make it more interesting"
11799,I’m just fine with a small friend group
11800,I'm not.
11801,I much rather ski than play video games any day. But ya know its January and we don't have any snow so
11802,No.
11803,"Yeah sorta, I have friends but I used to think friends were everything"
11804,"Sometimes I like being alone, if I have something to do

But when I'm alone, bored, my girlfriends up state and I'm just sitting in room for hours on end after going to work the other half of the day I start feeling kinda depressed and empty, even a little unhealthy....^that ^is ^exactly ^how ^today ^went ^for ^me ^please ^someone ^talk ^to ^me ^I'm ^so ^bored"

11808,Lone wolf makes it sound much cooler than it actually is.
11809,"Poor choice of words, that would just be someone who doesn’t care about making everyone happy and I’ve been doing that since sixth grade. As far as I can tell no one really hates me except maybe someone who heard me say a slightly racist joke, but who cares. Also if you’re looking for confirmation about being a “lone wolf” then you’re not a “lone wolf”."

11977,To see my girl
11978,Basketball practice and/or going to the gym
11979,I meant stay safe from corona but good for you lol
11980,I feel you dude
11981,It helps to write things down
11982,Me too. Me too.
11983,"I work out, basically"
11984,r/ihavesex?
11985,A girl to be with (both physically/sexually and emotionally)
11986,Its just the way he worded it
11987,"Taking a crap, it's here, but I am too lazy to stand up and go to the toilet"
11988,^
11989,"Haha, well it's not really that part that feels good, but the fact that you came a long way to build an aesthetic body, that you actually enjoy to be in. In October, when I started, I could barely bench 20 kilos. Before Corona, I was getting ready to bench 60. The progression part is what makes it so rewarding, because it's very easy to measure. Not only in numbers, but in your looks. Also, you don't really get DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, which makes your muscles hurt) after lifting a couple of months, unless you had a really intensive workout, but even then, it's mild. And at a certain point muscle soreness, feels good, because it indicates if you hit the right muscle groups that day. I've never done sports before lifting, but I'm so glad I started, because it is really good, both physically, and mentally. 

I love to talk about this stuff, so feel free to ask."
11990,Quarantine screwed up everything.
11991,How can you be shredded and 15 at the same time?

(This made me choke! From laughter!)"
11993,"It's cool until they start getting a bit weird. Talking shit about how my friends have cute butts and stuff. Told him to stop talking to me and he sent me a pic of him in his underwear. I was about to yell at him in front of everyone, but my friend stopped me."
11994,"I'm totally comfortable. They just like different things than me, that doesn't change much. A man is a man - it shouldn't matter what their preference is or anything."
11995,He’ll make you choke.. not from laughter
11996,"No, there just another dude with a different sexuality. Doesn’t really matter to me."
11997,"ok yeah, that's pushing it."
11998,"Everyone focused on BLM, but what about No Lives Matter?"
11999,Kinky
12000,"yes, we should kill all humans."
12001,"No problem with em, half of my group of “the boys” are bi and we still are chillin"
12002,No. I just can’t relate; I’m put in a slightly uncomfortable position when talking about guys bc I don’t know who’s hot or not. But that’s like as bad as it gets. Love who you want idc
12003,That's wrong behaviour for anyone bruh
12004,"I just don’t want one to come and hit on me because I’d feel kinda weird. But no problem with the community, I don’t know any except my neighbor but he is really nice."
12005,Agreed. I'm bi and even if I was attracted to someone that would be weird.
12006,BLM (bruh lives matter)
12007,"I feel as comfortable around them as straight people. Although there is an exception, if a gay guy is hitting on me, go ahead a straight female may do it to, but there’s a limit, the flirty jokes are whatever just don’t go wrapping your arm around me :)"
12008,"Why's that, babe? 😘 /s"
12009,"No, not at all. Same as I’m fine with having friends who are girls"
12010,"A reminder that creepy, pervy people can be any sexuality.

Don't base your judgment on a group of people based on the actions of one dickhead."

12014,Lmaoooo😂
12015,as long as they don't get touchy I couldn't care less
12016,that's not something only gay people do...
12017,"Ok, one of them, yes. But that's because he's a weird guy who moans when you get close to him. Otherwise no, I know another gay guy and my brother is bi."
12018,"1. you weren't downvoted.
2. \>  . Be who you are, I support that entirely, but I really don’t want to hear about it whenever you come working 50 fucking feet of me.   


Bi guy here. what constitutes ""hear about it whenever you come working 50 fucking feet of me"".? like if your friend isn't the flamboyant type, but may sometimes talk about accepting himself, etc, or deeper subjects regarding sexuality (religion) does that count? (honestly asking)"
12019,bruh i don't care until u pin me to a wall and try to suck my dick fuk you Jeremy..
12020,"""Who moans when you get close to him"" lmao wut"
12021,"Depends, if you are a normal gay person who acts as any other member of society I am 100% comfortable.  If your the type that walks around making their sexuality a fucking personality trait, then it’s weird.  Be who you are, I support that entirely, but I really don’t want to hear about it whenever you come working 50 fucking feet of me.

12022,">is

Not was

But it still has issues"
12023,"I mean a slavery was not exclusive to the US, yes it went on longer in the US but it not a thing now and most normal people dont discriminate"
12024,Not really. The British had it sworn off even in their most extreme colonies by the 1833 without a civil war. France ended it in 1815. Also without a civil war.
12025,"Communism is evil, let me demonstrate by staging coups and sabotaging literally every socialist regime in Latin America"
12026,"Something something, but communists /s"
12027,"Idk man, we’re all teenagers here. I feel like we probably don’t have the best grip on world politics"
12028,"To be fair, the Atlantic Slave Trade was one of the more brutal and violent systems of slavery."
12029,"Yeah, I just find America both irritating and entertaining but mostly just batshit crazy"
12030,to have it sworn off means it had to happen at one point. their history didn't start as soon as they ended slavery
12031,Don’t forget to ensure the new authoritarian regime(s) makes laws and policies that oppress the working class and give American companies plenty of profit.
12032,"America isn’t even in the top 20 most democratic countries so idk why it’s still considered “the land of the free”

Freedom is a good thing tho and we should work to actually make it the land of the free"
12033,"No one is arguing whether it was brutal or not, it obviously was. Also the British were *extremely* involved with slave trading at many points. I also never said exactly everyone I said ""like everyone"" because there were a very significant amount of countrys did participate. In conclusion everyone now thinks slavery is bad, but back then many countries actively participated in the slave trade."
12034,\*caughs in all latin american dialects of spanish\*
12035,"Yeah, but that involved like everyone"
12036,"Because USA isn't exactly a democracy I guess. Democracy need not mean freedom. India is widely known as highly democratic, but we still do not have total free speech."
12037,But the Europeans directly benefited from American slavery because of all their cheap products from America.
12038,Discussing it should still be encouraged
12039,Yeah. You don’t blame German children because their great grandparents were Nazis.
12040,I mean slavery was a big part of every country but the us had it much more recently
12041,The USA was one of the first western nations to condemn and outlaw slavery. It’s ironic that people care more about slavery in America that was outlawed over 150 years ago than the 40 Million + people enslaved today.
12042,[deleted]
12043,Yes that’s true but it didn’t take them a civil war to see that it’s wrong and a lot less time to figure it out. It’s still bad what they did but they managed to correct it earlier than USA.
12044,"Actually Brazil was the last country to outlaw slavery, so OP is even more confused."
12045,"Kill me if the US is first in any of [these](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_freedom_indices) scientific freedom aggregates, not just some supposed hogwash about about going to prison over offensive jokes"
12046,America is very undemocratic and not at all free from an outside perspective
12047,I find it ironic since according to the [Human Freedom Index 2019](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/human-freedom-index-2019) they are in 15th place. It's not looking that good for them
12048,"""Freedom for us but screw eveyone we don't immediately like"" is a much mpre accurate moto"
12049,Ya it’s amazing you can literally just buy a gun and shoot up a McDonald’s for messing up your order. Freedom
12050,Hell yeah stabby stabby
12051,23 american states also have criminal defamation laws
12052,Nah it’s fine. And those guys you mentioned at the end are weird
12053,I can understand it if you think it's weird in general but I wouldnt understand it if you meant it like it was weird for girls.
12054,"No it's not weird

But the dudes are prob just getting horny because of the convo topic and the hormones are clouding their judgement 

I'm not defending them but that's prob what's happening most of the time"
12055,"Yeah I mean in general but I also kinda disagree with your comment. I get that were humans so we *technically* can talk about sex all we want, we can talk about anything all we want, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still a bit awkward and uncomfortable in certain situations. It depends on the context mainly."
12056,[deleted]
12057,"Now that's where I disagree.
Make it everything you talk about.
You have to feel it.
rate the porn.
Walk up to complete strangers just to talk to them about porn.
#BE THE PORN."
12058,"Okay, I can see that. I mean of course would it be weird if, for example, someone you barely know just starts to talk about porn and sex.

It depends on the context, as you said, I think that's a good conclusion"
12059,Guys might get turned on by it or something but it probably is fine if you tell them that you are just interested in that
12060,"Saying things like this not only mocks people of a younger age then you but also puts yourself on a pedestal and is cringy as hell

STÖP"
12061,"But it's not legal... you can't watch it yet.

Jokes aside: I personally don't mind anyone talking openly about porn. Actually, with a few of my friends I quite often talk about porn, so it's not weird for me"
12062,"Absolutely not. 

However the reason you may find girls don’t talk openly about it often is because of the assumptions people can make, where people may assume that because she talks about sex, even a little, she’s interested in whoever she is talking to. 

TL/DR; It’s totally fine just don’t be quick to judge if someone does, because she probably doesn’t like you/want to bone."
12063,Stfu coomer
12064,"Nah... it's cool as hell
My girlfriend is like this and it makes for better, more open conversations"
12065,Guess I'm the weird one here because I don't talk about that
12066,Ofc not all guys do! But i know some who zalk about it very openly
12067,"It has really damaging effects on your brain, which is why I stopped watching pornography. Watching prostitutes all day isn't the way you should use your limited time on this planet."
12068,This man speaks the holy words!
12069,"Personally I think porn is degenerate so its equally as bad for both genders, but whatever I can't stop you."
12070,"It's not about age. I've seen plenty of people with better opinions at younger ages. Just because someone is young does that make them stupid, nor does it say their opinions are flawed, but that is strongly implied in your comment. Basically age =/= intelligence. If you want other people to be smarter make them, don't just say it's because of their age."
12071,Girls are so much hornier than the boys I know fr
12072,It’s not weird..one of my best friends and I talk about porn and sex and kinks completely openly and platonically with each other. Some people are just immature
12073,"same girl.

I’ve gotten the whole “you’re not like other girls” thing multiple times just because I’m open about stuff like that"
12074,"It’s fine if they can talk openly about it, in some ways it’s even great; the problem lies in if they only ever talk about it/they’re obsessed and serious about it, then it can become uncomfortable and negative to talk about."
12075,"Yeah I'm kinda confused why because he agreed with me a couple comments later, but that's Reddit for you"
12076,"No! You’re defying gender roles which everyone should do cuz let’s be real, no one is 100% of gender roles"
12077,Nah but I don’t know any guy that talks about a pornstars lifestyle or struggles when they mention one
12078,It’s not weird. It is fine to talk about that stuff cause it’s just what happens in life and those boys were just being weird.
12079,"Porn is pretty weird I’d understand why they might be uncomfortable with that, but sexuality is all good"
12080,Why do you think that? Just kinda curious.
12081,downvote gang
12082,Soon my friend. Well let’s hope :)
12083,"I like it. At the end of the day, the icon might be average but our community is great!"
12084,Yes
12085,"The current (updated) icon looks like it got the color scheme from a late 90's movie 
No offence to artist tho"
12086,Wow that went faster than expected lol
12087,Whisper so that no one else can hear you!
12088,Ever heard of a joke?
12089,Idk y ur being downvoted I thought it was funny
12090,hey at least atb’s colour scheme isnt some weird pastel piss colour
12091,"Me neither, but can't really change that"
12092,Jesus you’re right. I just saw the new logo and thought I was on r/jreg
12093,"In the current logo his hoodie and the background are indistinguishable if you don't look carefully, make it like a mix of darker cyan and blue , and shift the red towards orange by a little.

If you are gonna trash this and design a new one.
Design the same one but like a reddit snoo."
12094,I prefer last sub icon it was cuter
12095,the real question is why do we have a better sub than atg
12096,Because.
12097,Reddit is a weird place with lots of karma roulette
12098,Yeah the icon is horrible
12099,I like ATB's better
12100,Because we are cooler

12142,It would be a zoom meeting between Stephen Colbert and Casey Niestat. That’s it.
12143,Them cancelling it will be the best yt rewind in recent years
12144,I suppose.
12145,"I wasn’t really sure what they were going to do tbh. 80% of this year was all coronavirus, BLM, and sad celebrity deaths. I guess they could but among us in it but there isn’t much else to put in."
12146,What are you talking about. the memes would be legendary
12147,"Mr beast retweeted a Casey neistat tweet saying he should takeover this year

So I think Mr beast is just going to be  makingthe unofficial official yet rewinds from hear on out"
12148,Honestly I really wanted to see unus annus in youtube rewind
12149,"Yea I can’t wait to see new meme formats on r/memes and r/dankmemes, well I guess not this year."
12150,"I think they could’ve used to highlight how YouTube was used during the pandemic, but they didn’t take that stance."
12151,same
12152,We’ll let our lord and saviour pewdiepie take YT’s place for rewind.
12153,"Today’s the day, dear friend"
12154,Sad thing is... I can actually see that happening
12155,"Mr beast retweeted this and hasn't said anything since, idk why he would rt it if he wasn't going to do something.


https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1326951426765975552"
12156,It was gonna be another top 10 idc
12157,"Really, he is? Well I was going to expect like a meme rewind like Pewdiepie had done for the past 2 years with content creators like flyingkitty, Dolan Dark and Grandayy."
12158,"I mean everyone hated the last few so I don’t really care

I do miss the old ones that were good tho ;-;"
12159,"They were my guilty pleasure. It was fun playing where waldo with my favorite creators, but it became the most profitable creators instead of all of the faces of youtube. And people said they were cringe, but we were the people who let those trends get popular."
12160,Same
12161,"Yes my friend, memento mori"
12162,idc
12163,happy it was cringe
12164,"That was to be excpecter after they spectacularly fucked up the last 3 ones and didn't even try to fix them.. It's judt todays mentality, if something stops working, kill it"
12165,I kinda wanted to laugh at it
12166,"Oh no! 

Anyways...."
12167,"Idc, there are hardly any good yters anymore anyway"
12168,"Good.

They were so terrible after like 2015 that at this point I don’t think we’re missing much."
12169,I will miss feeling nostalgic in two to three years
12170,They're pussys. They know that they can't come up with something good so they just cancelled it.
12171,"YT rewind started as a genuinely good thing from YouTube to remind the consumers and content creators of all the great moments from the passed year. It them became this advertiser-focused frenzy, still getting theft greatest content creators on board hoping it would be better each time - no such luck. The fact they didn't do it this year - with everything everyone's faced and overcome, and done for us all in lockdown's internationally - it just shows what their priorities are with the whole rewind, despite all the negatives they have recieved for the past few years, meaning they dont care to spend that little extra effort and money getting it right for the people, bc they still are focusing on advertisers (which they're short of rn). It's a fucking disgrace, it's the exact reason I don't watch YT bc I like the company/platform it's all about the creators. The leadership is all wrong and is finance-centric, which is understandable being a company but they don't spend the littlest time on the people making them money essentially for free. I mean just think how much money Google (and even YouTube specifically) makes, and how much tax they dodge (pretty much in the billions internationally by all accounts), and they can't spend the effort or money on those essential people!

So no... I don't really care about rewind bc it's just a hyped up advertisement, for advertisers, at this point!"
12172,I love studying that stuff so yeah I would. Unless she like idolises Ted Bundy or some shut
12173,"Not sure, would need to know her first.

People like these are potential secret admirers and I don't wanna mess with that, such a thing would spark caution in me at least."
12174,Same
12175,"Ted bundy is so hot 😳

No jk jk!!"
12176,double negatives lmao
12177,"*My crush is Ted bundy, lol he is so cute*"
12178,"Sure, as long as she doesn't admire them."
12179,"Well I know various ways to suicide, some of them painless and you can do them at home that don't include blasting your brains out with a gun so idc.

Also, some boys know a shit ton about ww2 so it'd be a little hypocrite to see red flags in someone's interest"
12180,I 100% agree with that..
12181,"Ted bundy is so kawaii!!! 🥺🥺🥺owo (,,๏ ㅅ ๏,,) (,,๏ ㅅ ๏,,) (,,๏ ㅅ ๏,,) hes my anime bf !!!! 😘I love him and if u take him from me... 😳Im gonna have to show you my ヽ(*´з｀*)ﾉ  BAD side... o(>< )o owo owo kill me daddy XD👁👄👁"
12182,Same
12183,yup.
12184,Same
12185,;)
12186,Hell yeah. Unless she believes they're innocent and/or just in their actions. A lil serial killer movie binge watch sesh sounds like an ideal date.
12187,Unless..?
12188,Same
12189,"as long as she isn't one or idolises them, sure."
12190,"I mean, I'd say there's a difference between interest and idolatry. Anyone would be seen as weird for idolizing Ted Bundy or Facists. On the other hand, enjoying stuff like WW2 in color or Buzzfeed Unsolved is pretty normal"
12191,Same
12192,"If she's not psycho, then yes. To most people, I know a little too much about drugs. Doesn't mean I'm popping pills left and right. Just means I'm interested on how different substances affect your brain."
12193,r/makemesuffer
12194,Hit her with a bunch of mythological shit that u read from percy Jackson that's how I did it
12195,"Yeah, we would end up talking about serial killers together"
12196,"Depends. If that's the only thing that defines her, no. If she has other things in common, then yeah, I would."
12197,yea
12198,Yeah for sure long as she doesn't stab me in my sleep
12199,Same
12200,Same
12201,"Yes and no, part of me wants to say yes to the questions but if she knows alot alot, it low key means she either crazy or dedicated to learning this stuff. So imma go wit no :("
12202,"Ahh y'all sweet

I feel confident and I have a good system now. Just wanted to tell you guys cuz a few people were worried :)"
12203,"Oh my. Get well soon.

I obviously don’t know what happened (you said yourself that you wouldn’t want to say) but I’m sure everyone here is willing to talk to you in DMs if you want to tell people about it."

12239,Sometimes.
12240,wait do you like wipe the messages or do you wipe the whole phone
12241,"idk, makes me less atached to stuff i gues."
12242,I do that tooo 😔
12243,"whole phone.
i started at one point and now i just do it again and again."
12244,Nah that'd be too depressing
12245,"Yes, only the ones from when I was pissed at them to think of how dumb they were, or (if I still have issues with them) things I could have said to make a better point"
12246,With girls yeah with the boys nah
12247,This is so relatable
12248,Why
12249,Fair enough to each their own
12250,"Funny enough I was doing that before I jumped on Reddit 

I do it a lot to see if I missed any details of the conversation or just to remember some good times.
Sometimes if I’m in a stale conversation I look back to see if they mentioned anything they’re happy about to bring it up"
12251,Yeah.
12252,I’d probably do the same if I regularly texted people tbh.
12253,"I sent my first message/text about 4 years ago because I had relatively strict parents

And I got my first phone less than 2 years ago. The oldest messages on this phone are like 7 months old"

12255,"Yeah, whenever I'm lonely or all the suddenly curious about a past conversation for whatever reason."
12256,Chat with people? A likely story

12258,Yeah i do
12259,"yaaa i do this all the time, it just makes me cringe tho"
12260,I do it and whenever i do it it makes me kinda happy. Remembering all those dumb jokes and shit. Sometimes I go through old texts my ex sent me just to laugh at them. Seeing someone as shitty as her call me a dickhead is hilarious.

12262,oh no
12263,No
12264,Just do the Kpop hair then
12265,"To answer your question, no. But why are you anxious? There’s nothing that can oppose a threat to you."
12266,yeah ik i just get bad anxiety sometimes.. but i like long hair too so it's all fine i dont need a cut
12267,Exactlyyyyyy
12268,Being anxious has nothing to do with anything being threatening?
12269,"I never go to barbers because most of the time, their idea of medium lengh is a lot shorter than mine. I normally just go to my mums’ hairdresser because she knows how I like my hair lol."
12270,me neither
12271,I get excited
12272,I used to but I got used to it.
12273,long hair is cool tho
12274,"I do not, but I do have social anxiety, so this is interesting. I guess we kinda cling on to different aspects of our lives to aimlessly worry about. 

If you would like to get a haircut, best to find someone who knows you, maybe go to your mother or fathers barber for the time being? They'll know who you are(indirectly) and it should be a smooth ride all the way through depending of you want to talk to him/her or not. 

I personally have a small talk conversation with my barber and then we choose to not talk for the rest of the time. It's not awkward, it's their job. obviously all easier said than done, but I'm sure you can do it!

P.S. I also suggest trying to call in an appointment for yourself so you feel in charge :) good luck!"
12275,"Oddly, even though I am not part of this sub and it's a few years too late to call myself a teen, this popped up in my reddit feed as trending.

To answer your question, yes for a very long time I had a lot of anxiety about getting my hair cut.

I cannot remember how old I was, but during one haircut, the stylist actually cut my ear lobe pretty badly. After that, I didn't want to go back because what if they cut the other one?!? 

I also was not allowed to choose my hair cut. If I came home with anything less than a buzz cut (military style), I was in trouble with my father and my mum would get yelled at. 

Because I pretty much refused to go back and I was only allowed a buzz cut, my mum bought clippers and started doing it herself. After she cut my other ear lobe because she got distracted, I started cutting it myself and she only had to make sure the back looked good.

I was in my senior year of high school when I had a hair cut from someone else again. A work friend was also going through the vocational school to be a stylist and she got rid of the buzz cut streak. 

So, just because you felt anxious today, it doesn't mean you will have issues in the future. You can find a way to move past the anxiety. You just have to find a way that works for you."
12276,I have horrible anxiety but I'm not too sure if I get anxious before a haircut. I go over what I'm going to say like my life depended on it but I don't get too nervous. You might wanna find a way to calm yourself before one tbh
12277,"same
:("
12278,"Kids:go to the barber
Mens:go to their moms hairdresser
Legends:grab a bowl and a scissors and u know the remaining"
12279,so don't go to the barber?
12280,"I'm glad you can laugh about it.  

You've really opened my eyes because I just laugh at myself in those situations.  

I'm probably your exact opposite.  My dad likes to say that I'm the human version of Labrador retriever and a little too friendly with people I don't know.  

I've been reminded for as long as I can remember to be more cautious about other people's personal space.  Just this past winter we were talking about it and my mom went and got her laptop and she had a slide show of pictures of me with other kids, group photos, team photos and asked me to take a look and tell me what I see.  

I blazed through them and said yeah, team photos and pics with my friends.  Then one by one, she showed me how sometimes everyone had their arms around some one, but more often, like in a pic 6 people, I'd be the only one with my hands draped on someones shoulder or on their waist.  And if I wasn't doing that, I'd be the only one whose shoulder or leg was touching someone else. 

I was like WOW.  I never thought about it. Is that bad and she said, no, but you should ask, not everyone wants to be touched.  

That made me much more self conscious of other people, but true to form, I don't want to offend or make anyone uncomfortable, so at my lunch table I asked the guys if I invade their space or touch them too much. 

That opened the flood gates for them to rip on me, in fun way, so I knew they didn't have a problem with it. 

I won't just say ""I'm all good now"".  If I'm meeting someone for the first time or just getting to know them, it's on my mind to reel it in.  

Honestly, I think everyone has some social issues that they question about themselves."
12281,Never
12282,"No, it feels good"
12283,Yes
12284,I get really nervous that it’ll end up bad but it doesn’t stop me from actually going through with it.
12285,"not anxious, but i do expect it to look like shit"
12286,yes i get anxious before anything
12287,i dun feel anxious but i dun want them to be cut down
12288,Nope
12289,I really hate getting haircuts bc i hate short hair. The local school system has pretty strict guidelines which don't apply to me luckily bc private school and all the barbers follow them so I end up with a cookie cutter style which doesn't suit me.
12290,"Yeah, my dad always has to take me to get them because I'll never go myself"
12291,Not at all.
12292,What if you spent so long on your own so it’s kind of just a chronic feeling and you want to feel like you have people you’re close to?
12293,"if it's only occasional i guess don't worry too much,but if it's affecting your life or making you unhappy see a doc"
12294,[removed]
12295,It's okay everybody gets this feeling from time to time sometimes it lasts longer but it's normal whenever i have a feeling like that i just try to do anything to stop thinking like playing a hard game or learning something just find something that you know you need to focus on to succeed
12296,"I’ve been trying to do that but it never feels like something sticks. I did theater stuff at my school and once those events come to an end, I go back to feeling alone and just end up with more people who I say hi to in the hallway."
12297,"Yeah same except it’s more like I realize that I probably will never be happy in the future and no matter what I do, it will never change. Makes me hope I die nice and early so I don’t have to face my emptiness at an old age."

I wish I could say it gets better overall but it didn’t for me, but what you are feeling right now may be mitigated as puberty starts to wind down like it did for me."

If you have this a lot it may be good to see a therapist. There’s nothing wrong with that."
12319,"My life is not empty at all, it’s actually quite full of things to do and is definitely a life some people can only dream of.

Still, there is just nothing that makes me happy. I am at a point where I basically accepted that barely anything will and am just living life based on my goals, not even today, my birthday, was something special for me. It was just a day like any other, occasionally some texts congratulating me but thats it. I didn’t even see anyone today and nobody bothered to even give me a gift or anything remotely special. All I did was work, clean, play.

That’s just life though, and I guess I have to be fine with that for now."

It's supposed to protect the right people. Like protecting prostitutes who want a way out and don't want to incriminate themselves. How could you otherwise report a bad customer? You can't! If they hire you as a prostitute and commence to be violent, you can now report them to the police without getting in trouble with the law.

On the other hand, what you said could happen, sure, but it's a way to make prostitution less common without putting the people who are often victims of the system (the prostitutes) in legal danger."
12406,I think it is legal in my country. I don't think there is anything wrong with prostitution as long as the prostitu does the job out of freewil
12407,Hes saying every few months is too little testing
12408,"Yes, people have definitely gotten hurt. If prostitution was decriminalised, rates of many STDs would probably decrease since the prostitutes can work in a safer environment under their own terms.

People are going to have sex whether it’s legal or not. Why not make it legal and safer for everyone?"
12409,"If p stars get paid to have sex, then why is prostitution illegal?"
12410,"Yeah. There should obviously be a minimum age for both the prostitute and the... uh... customer? I guess that word works. But anyways, the prostitute should also be required to get regular STD tests, but just like it’s completely up to someone to give consent, it should be up to them to be able to make money off prostitution if they wish. Like, if there was no money involved, it would be completely legal (assuming all parties give consent), so why does it suddenly become illegal if there’s a payment?"

12487,"I guess I'm one of those people. I guess it would depend on how they're taking the deaths.

For me, I have a morbid curiosity and I'm studying in the medical field. I've seen a fair amount of medical gore in real life, deep lacerations beyond fascia that goes to bone, seen orbiting rib displacement and intestines exposed. I find it fascinating honestly but it's all in a very clinical and controlled setting. I look at those death videos, sometimes to just see how trauma happens and what could have been done in those situations to save a life or what the direct cause of the death was. Seeing people bleed out (arterial bleeds only take about 2 minutes), decapitation showing eye movement and muscle spasming, etc.

I think poorly of people who see death and laugh like life is a game/joke. There's some people who watch it because of some sick fantasy and I think those people are psychos. There's morbid curiosity and a medical curiosity and thst is a lot more acceptable to me as long as they're being respectful about it."
12488,"But... Why? Why would you do that?

No but seriously why the fuck would you enjoy watching people die? What kind of sick shit is that?? They're probably trying to assert some dominance."

Boys tend to not notice these things like awkwardness or something, and even if they do, they mostly shrug it off and don't even think about the possibility that you might like them. I speak from personal experience; my gf literally had to tell me that she wanted to date me because I had no idea, as everything she did seemed normal to me lol

And even if your ""friends"" told him, he might not believe them. Same thing happened with my current gf, where her best friend told me that she liked me and I was like ""yeaaa, no, that's not true"" but whoops, here we are.


So, yes, my response wouldn't change. Just do it, what is the worst that could happen? (:"

12563,Nice
12564,Say something about how much you enjoy talking to her and ask if she would wanna hang out as more than friends sometime? Good luck man
12565,"Probably what I would do tbh

Except then I would need to know how she responds so I’d turn it back on and check"
12566,"I got lucky w/ my crush. We where close freinds for a while until I realised how much I liked her, so I said:
 "" Wanna go out?"" while texting. She said ""omg I thought you'd never ask!"" best day of my life."
12567,"Like an introduction, or something leading up to something else."
12568,"Nah that's pretty weird, if they're just having a normal conversion and he randomly just blurted out that he likes her, it's better to atleast kind of get onto the topic of their friendship or how much he likes her or soemthing"
12569,"When I told my gf that I had a crush on her I didn’t really try to bring it up in conversation, we were at the park and we sat down at a bench and I said “I think it’s pretty obvious by how much we’ve been talking and my failed attempt to wrap my arm around you but I really like you” the week before we had seen endgame in theaters and I tried putting my arm around her and it didn’t really work.  But anyway we’ve been dating for over a year and that worked fine, just be honest if she likes you back it really doesn’t matter how you say it."
12570,What does prelude mean
12571,I had to read this 3 times to make sure you didn’t mean *lucky* lucky because I saw your were 14.
12572,How’d that work out for you?
12573,"Honestly, you should just say, “Hey, I like you.”

Simple, easy, gets the point across. You just gotta do it."
12574,Just screenshot this post and send it to her.
12575,"Yeah, you can't just be like HEY I LIKE YOU"
12576,You just gotta go for it my guy
12577,You like jazz?
12578,Not tell her on the phone ?
12579,You need to smoothly transition into the subject
12580,"Yeah, ive done this"
12581,Just drop it like a bomb
12582,"I just said ""tbh i kinda like you haha"""
12583,"I spontaneously told her I had feelings out of the blue. She replied and said she respects that but didn't feel the same way, and we both moved on.

You should remember that having crushes can be very unlikely to result in you two getting together, and you shouldn't expect to get into a relationship from this."
12584,Hiroshima vibes
12585,I mean...

12589,"If it didn’t work, it’s not because of how you did it. You probably wouldn’t have any better luck with a smooth pickup line. Unless the pickup line is like, Titan Tier."
12590,"Yea, I know. In fact she was taken recently, so remember: if you wanna ask, actually do it. Don’t wait around for the opportunity to dissapear"
12591,Don’t do it over text ever please don’t
12592,"You sleep with him? 

I just sleep on the couch or somfin it’s more fun"
12593,I used to but now made a room out of a storage/sewing room.  I used to hate he was a slob and snored and was gross.  Now i got my own tiny ass room but i like it
12594,"What are you doing, stepbro?"
12595,"I mean i don't sleep with him, but our beds are in the same room, not together tho, but yeah, I can lay in my bed and and my phone can be on the charger at the same time which is the only reason, there ain't a charging plug near the couch"

12597,yea mine does that too
12598,THEY ALWAYS SLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BED!!!
12599,"When I shared a room with my sister, we both had a bunk bed. I could never jack off at night because it would shake the whole bed"
12600,hate
12601,"I used to share a room with my sister. The worst thing was definitely that she was super messy, and I always was finding dirty underwear and bras laying around everywhere. Her never cleans up after herself, and it was always a pain to navigate out of the room or to the bathroom in there without stepping on any of her stuff.

I finally became free a year ago by moving into a tiny little room, but it's so much better in every way"
12602,Yea mine snores but so do I apparently it’s like a race to see who falls asleep first
12603,lmao yea me and my stepbro have bunk beds so always know when the other person is doing it -.-
12604,You share a bed with them?
12605,My sister snores so loudly. I cant sleep at night because of it. Ive tried head phones and they dont work. Ive tried plugging her nose and it doesnt work. She is also really messy and leaves bottles and plates everywhere
12606,"What are you doing stepbro..???

^sorry ^had ^to"

12623,"Me too, WWIII won't be a result of bombing Iran. Iran doesn't have anything close to the monetary and military backing NATO has. Not even Russia or China will back them up. They're on their own. Even if Iran has nuclear weapons, it will be such a limited arsenal that it's almost nothing compared to what the U.S. has in their arsenal. The only viable threat is cyber security of domestic infrastructure of the U.S. like schooling and digitized currency."

12625,"If America goes to a war NATO goes to a war, and then Russia and the Arab countries will probably join and if Pakistan will be dragged into it so will
India, and if even 3 Arab countries declare war on America they will attack America’s only ally in the Middle East, Israel so I can’t see how it will lead to a world war, but that is depend on a lot of stuff. But anyway I agree with you that a world war isn’t coming"
12626,"No, it’s just Reddit circlejerking again. The only possible war I could see is a Pt. 2 of a war with Iran. No one else cares about what we’re doing, at least not with Iran"

12640,"WWI started 106 years ago, countries’ views on war have changed since then. We’re now more aware of the consequences, so I don’t think we’d rush into war like we did when the Archduke was assassinated.

I feel like the most likely way a world war would start is if Russia & China got involved. But even though Russia could back up Iran, I don’t know why they’d take the risk. But who knows lol, I’m just going off what others have been saying, and nothing is concrete as of yet"
12641,I think history disagrees with you about that. The terms of the Paris Peace Accords that ended WW1 were so burdensome to Germany that it was almost guaranteed another war and that's what we got.
12642,That post is just fear mongering.
12643,"NATO is a defense pact though. They only have to go to war if the US is attacked first. At this point, the US is the aggressor, so NATO doesn’t have to do anything if they don’t want to."

12654,"So far I've known two girls who were 13 and dated a 17 year old guy, now that's an age gap"
12655,That’s a nonce age gap. Like surely there becomes a point where it’s just taking advantage of someone younger...

12658,So 12 shouldn’t date younger than 13?
12659,Me too! I’m a senior and I turned 16 a week ago. Never knew there was anybody like me.
12660,If shes 14 I wouldnt really say anything because that's when girls generally start to mature and stuff but 13 even tho  there is only a 1 year age difference just seems a bit off to me
12661,Me too chief
12662,"He means theyre turning that this year

For example my birthday is in june and my brothers is august and there is two years between us, so if i said im 17 and my brother is 14 that doesnt convey that

However if i was to say im 17 and hes 14/15, it means thats what we will be by the end of the year"

12693,"Hitler asked for a glass of juice, not to gas the Jews"
12694,"Yes America is fucked up, but I still think it’s ok to brag about being a law abiding citizen. In any case, people here don’t drink because Redditors aren’t cool enough to be invited to parties."
12695,👊😔
12696,True
12697,Not much
12698,That dude sounds a bit uptight
12699,Except for Americans where drinking is illegal for teenagers
12700,So you do get how this question won't get anyone like that here?
12701,"I saw an argument spanning over 2 popular posts that were ""tips about girls"" to which someone made ""tips about boys"" as a response."
12702,#
12703,...you guys would really fuck the opposite-gender version of you. like that’s the first thought that came to your head when someone asked the question..
12704,Who?
12705,"I think most people that are against drinking are the Americans because I'd say the demographic of this sub isn't necessarily the ""popular group"". Therefore they don't have access to alcohol and look down upon parties. And it's a given for them that alcohol is illegal so why ""be cool"" and drink illegally."
12706,Some of you guys are very closed minded and don't like trying new things and when someone makes a suggestion about how you could do something different you either get really defensive or you make some sort of self deprecating joke and dismiss their idea
12707,"You mean before I've joined this sub, what have I heard about it?"
12708,That’s what being a teenager is all about
12709,"I mean you don't have to go to parties, even when celebrating new year with your close friends it's fun"
12710,Really?
12711,# what? You can't just make a hashtag with no message to spread
12712,Someone said I have nice cheekbones. Compliment people some people will remember it forever.
12713,"Kinda weird but there was this girl next to me in science and she was so far out of my league, but she was still so nice to me and we laughed together a lot, and once, I made her laugh so much she had a panic attack. In hindsight it really isn’t as wholesome as it is questionable. I redact, I’m a horrible person lmao"

12716,"we were in chem lab and it was like late afternoon and the sun was setting, really gorgeous orange sunset. I looked out the window and one of my friends who was sitting kinda infront of me with his back to the window went ""yo in the sun your eyes look so awesome wth, it's like honey but golden"" 

been riding that wave ever since"
12717,I know how you're feeling.
12718,"Someone said i looked like an anime character.

Dunno if its wholesome or anything but i took it as a compliment... Or should I ?"
12719,my friends group has a channel for that in our discord server it's not gay at all sometimes it's just nice to complement your homies dick
12720,"A girl in my class went around and hugged a lot of her friends, me included.  
I'm not all that talkative or social, so my friend group had no idea how I would react.  
My group's reaction when I hugged back still makes me smile to this day"
12721,Nah that's wholesome
12722,🧁
12723,"I didn’t have many friends in year 7 and I didn’t have any in my maths class. So when the teacher told us we could sit with our friends I just stayed where I was. A girl walked up to me and sat next to me and another girl said “hey (girls name), she said we can sit with our friends” and then the girl who sat next to me said “I know.” 





So that made me feel a lot more valued which was cool"
12724,I smell a bromance
12725,"possible TW (i’ll put one just incase): i was having a really rough time a few years ago. i was doing so bad that i was considering taking my own life. one day at school i had brought pills with me and i was just gonna do it in the bathroom. my first period class was an engineering class, it was my favorite and it also had my favorite teacher. at the end of class he told me to stay after class. when i asked what he needed he said: “everything is gonna be okay, okay? i know things are hard now but i enjoy having you in my class and i see great potential in you. i’m proud of you and i know you can do this.” i don’t know if he knew something was wrong due to my quietness but i’m glad he noticed. he saved my life honestly. i ended up getting some help and have gone to therapy and take medication ever since.

12731,"~Two years ago after I had come out as bisexual in school we had a holiday where the 9th graders are the teachers and the teachers ""go back to"" 1st grade. I was bullied for being a ""faggot"" and I was a bit depressed. In estonian class we had to write about our favourite teacher and I wrote something cringey about how I hate everything and everyone and handed the paper to the ""teacher"" and after I went back to my seat I started crying. The teacher came to talk to me and asked if I smoke. We went outside and she gave me a cigarette and we smoked and talked about how I was feeling and my bullying. After we finished smoking we went back and she went and scolded the people who were bullying me. They didn't magically stop bullying me but I felt better after our conversation. 

Sorry if my grammar is bad and if it sounds rabling. English is my second language."
12732,The girl I liked called me a 9/10 with long hair and long sleeves.

12736,Only one teacher for me so far
12737,"Same, in 7th grade my teacher did a student spotlight thing and someone said I ha e a nice nose and a good forehead."
12738,"I love it when non-native English speakers apologize for their English that's usually better than mine.

Well that really sucked, but I'm glad the teacher defended you. That doesn't always happen."
12739,"A combination of happiness and shock.
I was very shy back then and I mostly just kept to myself, so they didn't expect that I would do that (mostly because I didn't the other times)."
12740,Bro lemme join this please 😩
12741,"Oh okay, a relationship then perhaps?"
12742,well great im the whole package then ;)
12743,"I've seen multiple girls try to be the class clown and to them it is: hell no! (Their jokes were just snarky comments followed by a laugh and they also couldn't take a joke themselves and that sort of thing.)

But if a girl happens to be genuinly funny that a really big plus."
12744,"I'll do it for you.

12745,💍😍
12746,"I don't, but not because of the ""class clown"" part. Also, your crush having a sense of humor is always a big plus."
12747,i dont wanna say the S word
12748,"Same at my school. Nothing they say is clever, it's just rude. I know a couple girls that have a good sense of humor, but were good friends, so I abandoned the idea of asking one out."
12749,P ^ur ^pp ^skin
12750,"Not really. Your crush might though , what do I know. It’s just preferences."

The personality really is what matters."
12756,N
12757,"I never really had a girl be the class clown so I'd find it cool to even see a girl act that way. Maybe it's just that in my culture, girls are sorta expected to be more mature than guys but also more dramatic (not consistent) that girls just don't show that side of themselves. I think I'd find it cute, but Idk. Different people have different preferences. This question will give you insight into us commenters, but not into your crush."
12758,"You wont find a general idea with preferences. And it wouldn't be helpful anyway as you shouldn't conform to the norm, just be yourself"

12763,Can you be my big tiddy goth gf
12764,Euhh you're funny at least so that's a good sign ig
12765,"Depends I guess. If it's like shitty outdated jokes then it's cute that you're trying but meh. But if you're actually funny, it would definitely be attractive to have something like that in common."
12766,yeah it is pretty attractive

12803,Are you the cardboard or the complex mess?
12804,Humans are confusing
12805,Oh sorry I should have worked it better. That’s the most I’ve ever seen a girl wait to tell a guy she wasn’t interested in him.
12806,That answer shall remain unknown
12807,When I talk to girls they just walk off and I can talk with any type of men for hours. I have no idea what girls want to talk about lol
12808,i am a very complicated man
12809,Girl like talking about literally anything half the time. What do you talk to guys about?
12810,"Oh right yeah that makes more sense. In that scenario, did the guy tell the girl he liked her? Or did she just know second-handedly?"
12811,"School, spirituality, astrology, drugs, sport, games, music. I like to talk about motives and what somebody likes in things they do."
12812,Fair
12813,I read that in a british accent and i dont know why
12814,The guy told the girl but they girl wanted to know if she liked him. So she waited a week to find out
12815,"Sometimes I talk to them and they are like ""why are you asking so many questions?"" Like am I supposed to talk about myself?"
12816,If they dont ask you the same questions back they probably aren't interested mate.. Just from my own experience hh
12817,Come back in three months to find out.
12818,pEoPlE aRe LiKe OnIoNs lmao
12819,The Universe is confusing
12820,"Well most girls do like drugs,music and astrology so try to stick to those. Like if you start talking about drugs and a girl doesn’t seem interested switch to music and so on and so forth. If she’s not interested in anything you have to talk about she’s probably lame anyways."
12821,You're not wrong

12826,"I don't think either is particularly complicated.

Oops didn't realize this was r/askteenboys but I hope you'll accept my answer."
12827,Far as I really know or care to think about this one. We are usually really blunt about things and are upfront but it makes out day if we ever get attention so alot of us are much more reserved. I'll admit I and other guys probably tend to scheme alot of things but only to get something nice in return like a hug
12828,"Same as for girls: Some are but not all of 'em. The biggest difference is in the way they' re complicated. Ofc this too is something differing from individual to individual but as an example are typically most girls more complicated when it comes to clothing, looks 'n stuff and boys on the otherhand when it comes to emotions or getting shit done"

12833,yeah and it’s also very attractive 🙈
12834,"Long hair is pretty fucking nice to be fair and I really like painted nails. I think you're good and well some people want to be some feminine parts, some want more and some don't want them"
12835,It's normal for anyone to want to be feminine

12837,Get me in the screenshot :D
12838,[deleted]
12839,"Fair enough. Sexuality is different to gender and they are both different to gender expression. In your case, your gender expression may be more feminine, but that doesn't necessarily make your gender female, and it doesn't necessarily make you gay.

12855,"Maybe a bit unusual doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it. You shouldn't be worried about what's normal, bad stuff can be considered completely normal just worry about if it's wrong or not and in this case I really don't see what could possibly be wrong with it"
12856,Please grow up.

12858,Do it bro
12859,"yeah ofcourse some hairstyles suit some more than others, that’s obvious. but i think a lot of guys would look better without shaved sides and just let it grow out a little bit. and they definitly do NOT have to be muscular or have a jawline. just be a healthy weight and i’ll most likely find you attractive"

12891,Can someone make me one as well?
12892,"Everyone has a type. Not every girl needs to be ""thicc"" and a lot of small girls are actually quite cute. Ass n tits aren't everything."
12893,"Physical attraction still counts tho. It’s often what first draws you to someone, it’s naturally a part of romantic love, and there’s nothing wrong with that"
12894,"Ass n tits r like sauce, they dont taste great on their own."
12895,"I personally prefer flatter girls, I’d say I’m definitely In the minority though."
12896,"I never said physical attraction is wrong. But I find that romantic attraction induces physical attraction for me. If I like someone, then I’ll automatically find them attractive anyways."
12897,"Yeah guys like girls with tits and ass but that doesnt mean girls with none cant be attractive. If you really want to start gaining weight, start eating more per meal."
12898,"But when the ""sauce"" is on top of something amazing like personality and mind, it just adds even more flavor."
12899,"lmao I eat just as much as anyone else, if not with more snacks. fast metabolism I guess"
12900,"Face > everything, don't worry."
12901,I’m not one to like flat but I’m pretty sure there’s tons of lads who love  flat chested women
12902,Lad who enjoys a flat chest reporting
12903,I can be attracted to petite girls as long as their boobs aren't nonexistent.
12904,"I like all girls, be confident with the body you have, you only get one and they’re all beautiful"
12905,"I’m the same, definitely in the minority"
12906,I meant flat chested as in small not literally flat haha
12907,Minority gang! Small boobs are the cutest boobs
12908,"I've seen girls my age completely flat before, so I had to clarify. You should be fine."
12909,Exactly my point.
12910,Your body sounds like runway models. Skinny and tall. I bet clothes look really good on you.
12911,"Pro 1. Hugs are a lot more comfortable

Pro 2. They can do more things without having back issues

Pro. 3 it just looks cute"
12912,Also personality is extremely important
12913,"Dont gain weight, if you are currently healthy. You dont want to become unhealthy because you think it will make you look ""thicc"""
12914,smol is better ngl
12915,"Hear, hear!"
12916,"Eh, I guess It's the other way around for me. Their physical appearance is what catches my eye and their personality is what makes me want to actually pursue them. It takes a while of getting to know someone to actually get an idea of their personality which is why physical attraction is what I usually go off of at first."
12917,Minority gang! I completely agree with that statement.
12918,"Like 99% of guys don't like fat girls, for some reason some girls don't know that ""thicc"" doesn't equal fat. When a guy says he likes ""Thicc"" girls, they're talking about a girl with a nice ass or boobs, it doesn't actually mean overall fat, just having a big ass and tits."
12919,Physical attraction is just as important as romantic attraction. The problem is finding out what physical attraction really is. Good health and hygiene is much more important than her shape. Our faces never lie when it comes to this. We are also naturally drawn to people who fit better with our DNA.
12920,"As I always say, nice shaped ass > big ass."
12921,"that’s the goal fam, although, I eat healthy while still being packed in with calories so I’m not sure how I’m still the same weight. My nanna has a body similar to mine so half of it would be genetics"

12951,Loving doesn’t always imply cheating. Cheating and disloyalty are based on actions. If you start to fall in love with someone else it’s not cheating unless you act on it before breaking up the original relationship. So it really depends on how you interpret the quote.

i got good family and hella homies and ppl to talk to but i feel the same exact way as u, empty as fuck and just scared bout what the future holds 4 me. i try to live in the moment as much as i can but man i ain't rdy to apply to colleges, get a job, drive my own car yet, etc 😞😞😞"
12956,Sometimes when the mountain of homework might kill me
12957,Same
12958," \>it just feels like i have nothing and nobody everyone knows me i have a good family and a lot of great friends but i feel so empty and just like no matter how high i get or good i feel i get knocked down and everything’s so fast   


can attest friend. it ""feels"" like i have no control."
12959,"I’m doing homework so much, that yeah it really does. I feel like last year, when there was no pandemic, most teens have time to be social and get together. I do homework all night and take breaks to browse Reddit for a couple minutes. And I take one break a day to run, which is the only thing that makes me feel slightly in control of anything. I want to enjoy life but I can because schools don’t believe that I need sleep or social interaction or free time. I want to run an ultramarathon one quarantine, maybe have a few hours off like most working citizens do. Like once you’re off you’re off. I get a few hours of homework, but now homework until 4 am daily."
12960,"I remember our New Years' party like it was 4 months ago. It feels like May, June and July didn't exist"
12961,Yeah for me it's not being able to see my friends. Usually we would just play video games on PS4 but they all got PS5s and i got new graphics cards
12962,Sometimes I don't feel like I have a reason to live. I always feel an obligation to stay alive tho.
12963,">all of this is temporary and will be over soon.

havent yall been saying this exact line since fucking march"
12964,same
12965,All the time. Lol
12966,same
12967,yeah you’re not alone in that. recently i’ve just felt like you said that life’s passing me by but i also struggle a bit with derealisation due to anxiety so essentially nothing feels real a lot of the time and it’s as if i’m walking through a dream while awake. idk. unfortunately i can’t even say i have good friends. they’re not shitty but i have like 3 who all prefer other people to me and two of them hang out together all the time without me so .. i have a nice family tho..
12968,That feeling when you're just kinda... existing?
12969,"Sometimes I feel like I have almost nothing to live for, but I'll be a huge fool if I throw it all away before I know for certain what the future has in hold for me, be it good or bad. Plus, there are some important things I still have to discover, so I'll just wait and see."
12970,"It's okay, what you're feeling is okay! Just push through it, you are so brave for posting this comment, we have your back :)"
12971,all the time
12972,"I relate to this so much, i get Anxious how fast the days pass by and i have to think about my career annd shit  and its so hard to decide. All my friends are so clear about what they wanna do and im stuck here. Im sacred if I'll be able to make a good career and earn enough money. Everyone expects so much from me cuz my brother and cousins are such great achievers i feel like a disappointment. Man as a kid i did not expect growing up to be this way. Sigh.
But i believe in time. It heals. Thing do get better. We just have to hold on. I hope everyone's situations get better."
12973,Same. Im just waiting for that reason to die again.
12974,Yeah adults can come home and do what they want but we get to study till 2 am let's gooooo
12975,Of course :)
12976,No.
12977," Yeah the feeling is definitely tangible- it comes and goes like the seasons and just seems to always linger just over the horizon. Right now especially because of the situation the world is in everyone is suffering and in pain, whether due to stress, loss, or grief, it could be anything. It manifests itself differently in every person. I for one lost a lot of personal drive and I went from the one who had his dreams realized and in motion to just- I’ll get to it eventually. 

 I definitely would consider this my lowest point I’ve been at in long time, possibly ever. If not for one thing. I’ve always been fairly social, but definitely not loud so I’ve had some experience with romance. My first girlfriend was fine but our relationship just didn’t last too long, typical high school type romance. Then I met this girl. Well I already knew her from the previous year but we never really talked much- she was the very smart and extremely shy/quiet type and I was the more “captain of the debate team” kinda guy. Well we talked for a bit, pretty basic stuff, if not for the fact that I could talk to her for hours and not get bored of it. After a week or two of us talking on the phone pretty much everyday, I finally decided to ask her out.

 She said yes and we've been dating ever since, so more than a month straight as of the 2nd. It puzzles me because honestly she could be talking about baking or something I have virtually no interest in but I still love just sitting there and listening to her talk about it, and she does the same for me. The relationship is just pure love, respect, and trust. We've told each other things not a single soul knows about each other. The main thing I've noticed is that I love her in a way that's not just romantic. I love her in a way that I truly just want what's best for her, and she reciprocates that completely. This relationship sort of filled up a part of me I didn't know existed: an emotional side that I've turned my back to my entire life. I finally have someone that I really truly just see as an equal, someone that completes me and will love me no matter what. This is what is keeping me going in this hard time.

 In sum, if you're ever feeling down or empty, just think about the future. Because there's probably some guy or girl down the road that will love you for who you are, not for what you create or cause. If you want to talk more about this DM me, I'd love to talk."
12978,this
12979,Same
12980,Thanks bro
12981,Thanks a lot
12982,its freaky just to think about
12983,Write that stuff down. Maybe it could be a best seller
12984,I would probably be super paranoid for the rest of my life and having trouble sleeping because I would be scared that everytime I close my eyes I would wake up in another world.
12985,"yeah exactly bro like im emotionally invested in this life idc if it's fake


like i don't get how someone is like ""oH i wOldNt caRe"""

isnt that really what a dream is though?"

12998,"Yeah, I’d be devastated if I lived a whole life in a dream then woke up, but I’d also be happy because now I have experience in life and wouldn’t make the same mistakes I did in the dream."
12999,hope it ends soon then cause FUCK shit is stressful
13000,I’d probably forget about it and carry on with my actual life
13001,Probably the most realistic answer here

nobody says that"
13016,Marriage you heretic
13017,*cries in no first kiss yet*
13018,"Yeah , second works best"
13019,*cries in no anything yet*
13020,">if you’re hanging out with the other person alone regularly for a month or so but only confessed recently, would you consider that a relationship?

For a relationship, there needs to be a certain level of intimacy. Just having mutual feelings doesn't make a relationship IMO, so no

>would that change the timing of the kiss?

Not really because I'd go in for the kiss pretty quickly either way. If she told me she liked me and isn't shy, I'd say the first date. Otherwise, the second

I'm not sure what's normal but it's usually much, much faster than a month"
13021,"It really depends on the couple, I had my first kiss in my current relationship only after 4-5 days.... for some it could be several weeks, sometimes even a month, but that can also depend on how often you see them.... if you see them everyday at school for example then usually not too long"
13022,We were about 20 minutes into it after being friends for a while. She ended up breaking my heart the next day
13023,I'm sorry my guy. You good now?
13024,definitely within the first month
13025,Well I’m definitely doing something wrong
13026,I dont even make eye contact before marriage
13027,A month is a long time. I was talking to a girl I worked with for a week or two but the day after our first date we ended up kissing. Obviously I was a pussy and didn't initiate. She grabbed my face and gave me a quick one and I loosened up a bit and was more confident after a quick laugh with her.
13028,I think you should kiss when it feels right for the both of you.
13029,"For me it was like two days, but gotta say there was a lot of confidence in the relationship."
13030,"My first kiss was like 2 months after it started, so yeah I'd agree that it depends on the couple."
13031,+2
13032,"We’re both pretty awkward about our relationship, but we know we like each other. I enjoy taking her out on dates and stuff but I just don’t know how to really talk to her about it."
13033,"had the exact same situation two years ago when I was in your place. i had a relationship my sophomore year with a girl who was a freshman. we really liked each other and enjoyed hanging out all the time but never aknowledged the fact that we hadn’t kissed. for 3 or 4 months at least. there’s no rush. do it when you’re both ready, that’s the way to make sure it’s the right time. that way no one has to force the moment. also one thing i wish i would have known (or thought about) is that it’s both of your firsts! she has no idea what she’s doing either. if it’s not her first then just let her guide you. anyway i guess taking it slow worked because we just hit our two year."
13034,\+1
13035,That’s pretty sick
13036,"With what? My parents said I was banned from seeing ""the other ones"" that look like my mom or something til I'm 18 and the arranged marriage is situated."
13037,"Kissed before the relationship! But to answer your question, in the first couple of months. Don't stress about it, if you're insecure about it, talk about it with your SO"
13038,"Yeah, it was my first relationship so I wasn't very keen on what I should do. I'm much more confident now. Feels great."
13039,"It depends. I know a lot of people kiss on the first date. Some people don't for a long time. I know my mom wouldn't even let my dad hug her until well into their relationship. Some parents don't let my friends kiss/touch/hug each other, which makes sense. (They definitely haven't stopped, though.) It really is up to the people in the relationship."
13040,My first kiss was 3 months after we started dating. It’s not really a big deal tho. Do it when you feel ready.
13041,"pretty soon, within the first couple of months (preferably instantly tho)

also its not a relationship unless its official"
13042,"Yeah, you literally need to tell me that you like me in order for me to notice"
13043,Hmmm what if she sacrifices 23 babies?
13044,"pffff, don't talk to me ever again, we ain't friends anymore"
13045,"basically but thing is tho is that I swear girls overstate how obvious their being like my ex before we started dating said she was So ObViOus 

when literally she never complimented me or anything like breh 

I think for majority of guys (especially ones on Reddit lmao) arent gonna know if someone has a crush on them all u really gotta do is 

1 have basic hygiene / take care of urself 

2 laugh at jokes 

3 say u like hair or some shit
and boom they got crush on u"
13046,Nope. Blind as a bat to it. I usually only learn after we cut contact and some mutuals tell me about it and then I feel dumb about it.
13047,Even if it keeps happening? Is there a point where you just KNOW
13048,Aw dude that sucks. You should do what I do and assume that EVERY guy that talks to me likes me and then I find out years later that he didn’t even know my name :|
13049,"when she tells me and then proves it because i dont believe her

*laughs in non existent self esteem*

i dont pick up on flirting until at least a month later (im being deadass rn), and even then it's just an idea that it might be what was happening

#but

i end up liking pretty much every girl who initiates interactions with me

like fr i ended up with a crush on because she said hi to me a few times"
13050,It is annoying dont beat around the Bush just say it
13051,"Ok ok good 2 know. Follow up Q: am I not allowed to compliment a boy I’m not interested in? 
Like... if I say I like his hair today will he fall for me haha"
13052,"ok ok well if u do that tbh you def have had atleast some guy have a crush on u like

guys don’t compliment each other cause “tHaTs gAy” and then girls generally don’t compliment guys like I’ve only been complimented by 2 I think 

both of which I technically did have crushes on but whatever irrelevant 🥴

but genuinely please keep complimenting guys like it actually makes there week and that’s not a joke"
13053,😭😭😭
13054,Hell even then it's 50/50
13055,"Jeez sorry to hear that. Most girls which I can say at least have liked me a little bit are girls which I've liked and didn't have the courage to ask out or something else. So yeah, I'm kinda of a lost cause. 😎"
13056,Yeah 23 babies is an insult. Now 22 babies on the other hand is the sign that they are your BFF
13057,Being lowkey won't do shit. Let them know with sincerity.
13058,I think that part of the reason that guys are seen as oblivious is because we teach ourselves not to fall for people doing things that could just be someone being nice. If we think someone is flirting with us but they arent that could potentially screw up a friendship.
13059,What makes you realize that it was actually flirting? Just like more time to reflect? And I totally get the crushing on random ppl thing
13060,"Aww alright I’ll do it more then... usually I just call them stupid and occasionally say something nice cuz I’ve been afraid they’ll try and find a deeper meaning....But I think I’m just overthinking x)  
 (Also, I’m pretty sure I’ve had a guy like me cuz I’ve uh dated b4 haha)"
13061,"I think I speak for all men when I say, we don’t fucking know unless you’re being crystal clear and even then we second guess it so much or so easily brush it off it doesnt matter"
13062,50/50? Naw. You know the magic numbers. 80/20.
13063,"95/1


It doesn't have to make sense. It never does."
13064,Frik. You think? Well Im just not a really flirty person in general so that’s why they’re “lowkey” But being completely transparent is scary haha
13065,Wow look at us... couple of pathetic ppl (jkkk ur cool) you should ask those girls out I’m sure they’ll say yes. What’s that quote? You miss all the shots you don’t take or whatever 🤔
13066,21 means they’re your mortal enemy tho so be careful
13067,Because her dad told me she thinks I’m cute. That’s literally the only time I’ve known for sure.
13068,Y’all are always so worried about “screwing up a friendship” when sometimes there’s not much of a friendship to screw up in the first place
13069,"Nah, could be a prank call.  Seriously, you gotta be very clear"
13070,"Honestly, I don't know how to explain it, but I can tell how much a girl likes me pretty accurately.

Like a girl who hates me will avoid talking to me and even avoid looking at me in the eyes.

A girl who likes me as a friend will hold a conversation with me on more than just dry responses and will even start her own conversations at times. This is the kind of relationship some boys confuse for love. Only girls who are really close and talk to you a lot ever have a chance of liking you more than a friend in this case.

A girl who loves me (I haven't met any irl, but I think I know how they'd act) would probably try her hardest to hide her crush and only let me know about it in small amounts and on accident. The way she speaks  will be very different, but not in a way I can explain. She will also probably get on my side when I am in debates/arguments, even if she knows nothing about it or my position is super weak.

So far, I have been entirely correct with knowing what every girl thinks of me. This has stopped me from making big mistakes."

13126,"Honestly, I'm starting to think that it's just one of those weird things girls come up with to criticize each other.  In middle school, my ""friends"" were always teasing me for having ""humongous thighs"" and not having a thigh gap... I've never heard a single guy irl mention liking a thigh gap.

Typically, the girls I've seen with a ""thigh gap"" tend to be skinny, so maybe that's the appeal?  I've never found them cute, tbh."
13127,"Yeah but I've yet to hear an actual definition of the thigh gap. Some just consider it putting your feet together and having a significant gap between your thigh, which I think for the average girl is unhealthy unless they're really slender.

On the other hand, I'd like to think of the ""real"" thigh gap as the uh... ""Toblerone Tunnel"", I've heard it called. But that may genetics too just depending on how fat is distributed, so I dunno...

Real life tends to not be instagram lmao"

Not only that, I think I'm a lot smarter then them even though they may be older than me, I've always been more advanced than people at my school not to toot my own horn.. but I think it's funny how they have the nerve to say anything to me. ;)"

13146,"If you want some context I want touching her or so close I was almost above her (she really short) and maybe a little under a foot away from her. The reason she prob reacted like that to me is cause she dont like me very much. We used to be gud friend but I didnt want to make a promise for her and she didnt wanna be friends, I took it as we are friends any more and she dont wanna talk any more but she prob meant it more as she hates my guts. She also hates me more cause I'm getting kinda buddy buddy with her BF cause I think he is a legit cool lad, I leave him alone whenever she is near but I still thinks she hates me for that cause she did say ""stay away from me and my boyfriend"" one time and I said ""no"" cause I think he should be a gud friend"

13155,"I mean if your laughing at someone because something you did annoyed them, kinda makes you look like an asshole, I mean yeah she was being unreasonable by yelling at you, but laughing in her face doesn't even really make sense like what' funny about it? It's not like you have power over her either."
13156,"nah, seems fine to me"
13157,Keep laughing
13158,This makes me think of Arthur Fleck from Joker
13159,"On a similar note I laugh when someone hurts me, because pain is temporary, especially physical pain and all things shall pass and such. So it doesn’t phase me much, and I laugh because they tried to do that and it didn’t work. (If someone knocked the air out of me I wouldn’t be laughing but if it’s a hit on the arm or something), hope this helps, sorry if not. On the smiling thing, I used to have it bad but I’ve toned it down a bit"
13160,It’s a common coping mechanism to laugh at people who are angry as we can see all over the internet. However if someone’s angry then at least consider their side and opinion even if you must laugh.
13161,"It doesnt help, but if its funny..."
13162,Wait other people also do the lunges? lmao
13163,i Just don’t go outside
13164,"
cannot relate, down here it is the season in which the sack virtually retracts up into the body because it is *freezing*"
13165,"step 1: get a fan

step 2: put it in your room

step 3: stay in your room and play games till fall

step 4: success"
13166,Idk how many other people do them I'm just saying I have lol
13167,But tight really aint as comfortable
13168,Agreed
13169,Sacrifices have to be made
13170,That's pretty logical yk
13171,learn to store them
13172,yuppppp
13173,shower every day and change underwear every day and you won't have that problem
13174,Step 1: *store the balls*
13175,Just separate you legs for a second. Not a big deal
13176,i do both of those things and it still happens. some people jus got sticky balls brodie
13177,we're up there and It reaches 10C sometimes so same
13178,"Sadly, I have a job and cannot do this anymore"
13179,learn
13180,I don't want to have to rearrange in public
13181,"I hate my balls so much. They are just large, uncomfortable inconveniences."
13182,Well let's call that plan b for now
13183,Pretend there’s something on the floor or stumble a bit and slightly stretch your groin that way.
13184,*snip snip*
13185,"Just get the dog treatment, that's how I deal with it"
13186,I just shower after i exercise which is generally when I am sweaty
13187,You're 17 I think it's time to learn lol
13188,It’s castration time
13189,"worst feeling is when you’re sitting down and think “when i stand up it’ll be fine, i’ll move around and it’ll detach and i’ll be comfy”, then you stand up and no am mount of movement will unstick it."
13190,lmao sometimes it gets to like 0°C here and it's only partially there
13191,Yes. Please come help me. Maybe I'll get stuck ;)
13192,"i got hit by a car, didnt want any any trouble so i threw away the number they gave me, to this day i still completely regret not doing something like this to them

sue that mf"
13193,"Proceed with legal action. I’m sorry, but something like this isn’t just a “teenage boy” thing, this is seriously damaging and is a behavior he needs to learn is not okay.

I know things like this seem normalized nowadays but making fake nudes just to fuck with somebody is NOT normal. At the very least, put it in the hands of maybe your parents, they will know how to approach this situation better."
13194,"And that’s bad? He assessed the consequences of his actions and thought it was okay to go through with it. So whatever comes out of this, he deserves. Why should “ruining his life” be the concern of the victim? He did this to himself, and not facing the consequences now will likely result in him doing worse things later on."
13195,Proceed. If he isnt punished he'll probably do it again
13196,"Thats very illegal, of course"
13197,Definitely legal action. That guy is a douche
13198,Nah man this shit ain’t normal nor is it thought of as okay by Americans. Maybe we don’t like following rules but this is an extremely immoral thing to do.
13199,"Being a teenager isn't an excuse, he's old enough to know whats wrong and that everything has consequences. She has a right to take legal action"
13200,Proceed legally. That’s not a subject to mess around with
13201,"Why are you using such a small word such as ""douche"" for such a piece of shit? I was shocked when I read that such fucking assholes like that bastard roams the same floating space rock as me, this absolutely disgust me and I want the dick-faced-bitch-boy to be removed from this plane of existence entirely."
13202,I don't think you can forgive anyone for doing something like that
13203,Proceed with legal action immediately. Speak to your parents and a lawyer. What he did was VERY illegal
13204,Totally agree with my guy right here when you grow up you'll definitely regret not suing him. (Fuckhimup)
13205,okay bro you might need to calm down a bit with the edgy comments that you've made throughout this thread because they will do nothing for you nor OP whatsoever
13206,"""The point is to make him **suffer**, not to help yourself but to **destroy your enemy's**, If he gets **punished** he will learn, people will be safer, but the most important thing is that he **suffers** for his horrendous deed that he should be **punished** for, he is a piece of shit that needs to be **cleaned off**, a **plague that damages society itself**, some one who brings pain for his own gain, He must be **punished** for being a less then worthless being who **deserves nothing but pain.**""

""**Destroy him.**""

""Why are you using such a small word such as ""douche"" for such a piece of shit? I was shocked when I read that such fucking assholes like that bastard roams the same *floating space rock as me*, this absolutely disgust me and I want the **dick-faced-bitch-boy** to be **removed from this plane of existence entirely.**""

""I did not read the whole thing yet but, **FUCKING MURDER HIM!** He blackmailed you out of some thing you loved by using paedophile pics of you, he is the **most disgusting piece of shit in the universe** and **deserves to go to hell**, Legal actions definitely because he is **scum and deserves to be treated as such.**""

You're trying wayyyy too hard to seem badass. Just say ""press charges"" and then leave. No need to act out your revenge fantasies vicariously through a Reddit post from someone you never have met in your life. Also being edgy is not just what you said, but rather edginess is also being performatively controversial for the semblance of badassery or to appear tough, which you are clearly doing through your descriptors of what you want to do with this boy who you have never met and will never meet in your life. Also, I can tell that you probably have some kind of God complex through your diction of ""cleaned off"", ""suffer"" ""destroy"" ""deserves"" and seeming lack of a fleshed-out vocabulary in your repetition of the same phrases a bunch of times to show how much you hate this guy. Knock your rage down a couple of pegs, man, it's not healthy."
13207,"Here's the deal, actions have consequences, and in his case, his (very severe and very illegal) actions might prevent him from getting into college. He knows what he did was wrong, and there's no way he will learn or that others will not try to recreate what he did if there is no punishment."
13208,"Tbf he fucked her life up in the first place. How dumb can a person be? No, he wasnt dumb, he knew by sharing fake nudes of a girl he would ruin her social life.

If a piece if shit sends my classmates fake nudes of me im not taking some fucking high road. Lucky for him OP seems mentally stable. Had he done it to someone else it could have seriousky fucked their mental health and lead them to something worse. Who knows who else he’s done this to?"
13209,I think you should talk with your parents about this. Obviously what this guy has done is very illegal and scummy and he needs to face the consequences for his actions but I don't think you should take matters into your own hands. Let your parents figure out what to do
13210,"he deserves punishment, you deserve some form of justice"
13211,"Nope he deserves it,  take legal action, fuckem up."
13212,Especially if he is French.
13213,Proceed with legal actions
13214,Legal action. I’m sure everyone else here agrees
13215,I would proceed with legal action
13216,He ruined his own life lmao
13217,Do it
13218,so this won't get taken down. How should it be censored?
13219,"What he did was fucked up. Period. People have killed themselves over shit like this. If OP wasn't as resilient mentally, this guy could've literally killed someone. I can assure you that the average teenage male isn't this much of a dumbass. Heck, this ain't even something stupid, it's just cruel. The guy ain't a dumbass, he's an asshole who now needs to 'assess' those consequences in court."
13220,yes because when people don't punish me for doing bad things i never do them ever again
13221,"As a minor, your parents would have to be involved in any legal action you take against this boy."
13222,"Nope.

My job is to be a parent, not a scumbag."
13223,(#)ZoomerTillIDie ✋😩
13224,I'm definitely gonna say it sarcastically lmao

13229,"Absolutely, my dad never really pulls that shit so I'll never have that moment where I flash back and realize I'm becoming my dad"
13230,Honestly the pandemic isn't bad enough to be used in that context
13231,Thx for making me feel like a boomer \#ZoomerTurnedBoomer
13232,Is it this easy to be a troll in ATB lmao
13233,Nah lol i basically just stayed inside for over a year it's not an accomplishment
13234,"you have to just say something that most people here disagree with, it isn't even necessarily a bad thing, it's just controversial and people get triggered by it lmao"
13235,That’s exactly what the boomers said about their parents’ generation back when they were super progressive teens...
13236,No problem dude :)
13237,No way I'm not gonna end up like those boomers
13238,[deleted]
13239,No
13240,You kinda gotta put effort in to NOT survive this pandemic
13241,no because I'm not going to invalidate what he's going through
13242,Wait you're a mom??!?
13243,"Wait are you a- dad?



Sorry if I'm being weird lol"
13244,I ain't gonna have kids but if I did I wouldn't use that card
13245,"No? I think we all hate it when people did it to us and made us feel invalidated as a result, why should I continue that trend and be an asshole for no reason to my own child? Might i joke about it if we have a joke argument? Maybe dunno yet , but I'll never ever use it in a serious context even if they're making a fuss."
13246,"Not for real, I would probably joke about it, but it's not good for a kid's mental health to keep pushing them based on your experiences"
13247,"I was lucky to not have gotten Covid or a close family member. No one of my friends it their family got it either, school in my country went back to normal about a month into lockdown, basically just got a month of because I didn't really work. I had an excuse not to go out shopping and I actually like the face masks when I'm not wearing my glasses because it hides my feminine face. 



I was lucky, I don't want children in the first place. But metaphorically if I did I would never use that card. My child's experience won't be invalidated because of anything I went through."
13248,"Nah, I’m not about to sound like a boomer."
13249,"No. Undermining someone's feelings, ESPECIALLY your own child's is such a shitty thing to do. I'd listen to them and help them with their problem. However, I may use it here and there as a joke, but never seriously."

13314,okay idk if this counts but in grade 2 i had a boyfriend named mason and i distinctly remember him showing me his leg hair and me being very impressed
13315,omg agh thinking about it makes me so ✨🥺🦋 but he took me on this super long drive which is my fav thing and we sang the whole ride there it was so fun and then since he had a truck we sat in the back w a blanket and stargazed🥺🥺🥺

Then we climbed onto the roof and he held me in his arms on his lap while we looked up at the stars and we just talked for a while. When we finally came down I fell asleep and he put me to bed, however I woke up at 2 so we watched a movie, went to baskin Robbins and finally went to bed."

13337,I was on a date with my bf when we were buying donuts for us. He had his right hand on my waist (he's 5'11 and I'm 6'1) and when we were queuing he accidentally kicked his own foot and groped me in my ass. I blushed so hard lol

13403,the first thing???? bruh and why is that? not the face but their hair?
13404,fair.
13405,I don't pay a lot of attention to it because ~95% of the time it looks good.
13406,*hair
13407,yes because i pay attention to my own hair

13413,Not too crazy about details but hairstyle says a lot imo

like give me a length please. hair past the chin? hair on the shoulders? hair past the bobs? hair past the hips? like come on"

13432,"I was homeschooled for about 2 years, I made friends by going to homeschooling get-togethers with other people every Thursday. For me that time was depressing and lonely. Goodluck with it all though."
13433,"Yea debate club, with yourself, because your the only fucking student👍"
13434,"I'm doing college classes in a week, no clue if that'll make me any friends but you can also do sports, clubs, or just make friends online."
13435,Dude I debate myself all the damn time
13436,"You join things I am in robotics, dance, orchestras etc. I make my friends in those"
13437,Same here
13438,You don’t unless you do things outside of school. All my current friends I either met before I started homeschooling or when my parents made me socialize. Met my girlfriend on a cruise. You literally don’t make friends if your homeschooled and don’t do any groups or anything
13439,"I second this, I’ve made a lot of friends through robotics and computer science clubs throughout the years. You could also try joining an organization such as the Boy Scouts since they develop a strong sense of comradery between the different troops."
13440,"Same. I had an awful kindergarten teacher and then said I didn't want to go back to school. I was an awful student to my mother who tried to homeschool me, and ended up coming back to school in 2nd grade. So glad I did..."
13441,Same!
13442,Homeschooled my whole life but I had a co-op with like 40 other people. That’s one way or try some club sports around you or even getting a job and meeting new people. It’s the most annoying thing when people get snippy because your homeschooled
13443,Hey me too!
13444,Sameee. Im actually on my first day of highschool after a year of homeschool
13445,"I am part of a church, but for people who don’t have a church, I play a lot of video games, and have made many friends doing so. Sorry I can’t give any better advice :/"
13446,I (16M) was homeschooled from 1st to 8th grade. I went to high school at the local public high school. At first it sucked. But after a while i realized i liked going to an actual school a lot better. If you want to meet new people you gotta get out there and find people. One of the best ways to do it is to dial enroll at the local high school and take a few classes and join sports.
13447,I would disagree with that. I've also been homeschooled most of my life and I think it's totally posable to make friends.
13448,Are you british?
13449,Oh that makes more sense cuz anti social in the uk is different to ani social in America
13450,"Obligatory I’m not a boy, but I had done online school for two years and I made friends by doing sports and I also had friends when I went to school so I just kept in touch with them."
13451,My parents are so asocial they would never do that. And they're trying to raise me to be the same
13452,Definitely not gonna recommend church. Church kids are just... just.
13453,"I've never laughed out loud at a comment in Reddit before, just a little air comes at my nose... until now. My parents just yelled at mee and said ""what's so damn funny?"""
13454,"Nah, I take a few high school classes and a few college classes"
13455,"Thank you, this made my day."
13456,No I'm a  u s a b o i
13457,"Exactly,
Just be careful and think about what you are saying next time."
13458,"I’m not homeschooled but I have a friend who is and I met him because he goes to cadets, and another friend joined a bunch of orchestras"
13459,"Been homeschooled my whole life and my parents won't put me in public school even though I want to, because they say I wouldn't do well and would get in trouble with the teachers. I don't know why they assume that, but they do. 

The friends part is slightly easier for me because I live in an apartment, but I'm not in any sports or clubs or anything."
13460,"I’ve never been home schooled but I met a lot of friends at YMCA’s or Clubs, I suggested you do the same. Best of luck, partner. *tips cowboy hat*"
13461,"Alright, so I’ve been homeschooled since day 1. The first few years were really crappy. No friends, all work no play. My family tried for years to put me into homeschooling groups but they were always so pretentious and uptight. I had a church youth group that I attended when I was old enough and I made some of the best friends of my life in that group. I also got into Boy Scouts which gave me better people skills. I then had to leave my old church and my friends. It was really hard and I had a really hard time making friends at my old church. I eventually just put myself out there and made new friends. So with that to say I recommend you look around in your local area and find some things that spike your interest and then put yourself out there and do it. It’s going to be hard and you might hate it but you’re not gonna get anywhere without doing stuff that you hate. Don’t just show up and stand by yourself in a corner, go meet people! Have fun and good luck"

13492,"Just a friendly reminder that the fact that if you are reading this comment you are probably among the worlds 1% most privileged people. You aren’t starving in Africa, you aren’t under the rule of China and you aren’t in the war stricken middle-east. You have freedom and opportunity and are very lucky to have a country that surrounds you and genuinely cares. Yeah there is a few bad apples but if you look at life from the bright side you will be much happier :D

I’m also not denying the fact that there are still hardships in life and you definitely only deserve the best in life. Being a teenager is hard and I’m still struggling a lot with it but when I remember how lucky I am to live in Canada, have food on the table and go to school worry-free it makes me happy."

13537,"Firstly, transgender is not a sexual orientation, that's a completely different topic. And secondly, you're right. That's why I described them as sub-sexualities. Pansexual is just a specific flavour of bisexual, not it's own thing."
13538,"There are several issues with that stance. 

>There are 2 genders,

This is contested pretty heavily by scientific evidence (assuming you're saying that someone can't actually be trans and that you believe it's made up)

>and you can be straight bi or gay. Anything else are just unnecessary add-ons that are just personal preferences that don't mean you are a different sexuality

What about asexual, no sexual attraction to anyone?

And words are just used to describe things typically. For example, saying that you're pansexual instead of bisexual gives a more distinct description of what you are. What you're doing is comparable to shutting someone down for saying that a colour is crimson by saying ""That just means red!"" They're similar, but there's still a distinction to be made."

13548,"Nope, polysexual is... I think it's defined as attraction to multiple but not all genders. It's stupid and redundant, I know, but that's just how it is. I think the reason there are so many barely distinguishable variations of bisexuality is to do with the misconceptions surrounding bisexuality itself, namely the idea that it only means attraction to the 2 binary genders, leading people to make new terms when in reality, that's already what bisexuality is."
13549,I know asexual and bi and thats about it
13550,Arent most of us demisexual here?
13551,Thank you! I'm glad to be or assistance :)
13552,I'm from switzerland and we have a drink called sprite but thats just the brand and technically it's lemonade
13553,"I think the difference is lemonade always has water and sugar added [fruit] juice is often, when homemade, just that fruit squeezed into a cup. Pure lemon juice is too strong to be appealing to most."
13554,"Yes, us Aussies call Sprite and other drinks that are the same lemonade. It fucking pissed me off every time I asked for a lemonade in America and got some shitty lemon drink.

Same with chips. We order a fucking burger or some shit and ask for chips on the side and they give us fucking potato chips/crisps. Who the hell has that on a side of their meal. nO, you gotta ask for fries to get your fucken hot chips"
13555,That is not lemonade and i'm gonna cry.
13556,Sprite is carbonated. Lemonade is not carbonated. Which product do you have?
13557,"I’m from Norway, and we have a lemon flavored Fanta which i guess is lemonade? Idk."
13558,I'm so sorry that you never had lemonade. I will fly to Switzerland make lemonade for you when i can afford to and when there is not a plague.
13559,"Canadian here, we have lemonade."
13560,"Chips (US kind) are not typically something people get on the side, like very few restaurants I’ve been to have them at all. They CAN be decent with the right food tho"
13561,We don't have lemonade then :(
13562,UK and oh yes
13563,"Yeah, In the cartoons lemonade is always piss yellow, here it’s greenish white almost"
13564,"In Australia we have Sprite which we call both Sprite or lemonade, and we also have normal lemonade"
13565,Whats the difference between sprite and lemonade? And why would I drink sugar water?
13566,I'm from the UK and sprite 100% is lemonade. I've been to America and lemonade was a completely different thing
13567,"Finland, and here it's called ""idc as long as it has alcohol in it"""
13568,Yes please i need more friends anyways :)
13569,And I need a good excuse to go to Switzerland :)

13571,*laughs maniacally in American*
13572,I’ve always called sprite lemonade
13573,Are you talking about carbonated lemonade like you get at a pub? cause Americans don’t count that as lemonade
13574,Sprite is carbonated and lemonade is not
13575,bror sitronjuice og lemonade er samme ting hva snakker du om. fanta er brus ikke lemonade ???
13576,"UK. To me lemonade is fizzy, sugary lemon juice. It can be still but that’s usually when it’s something posh."
13577,"No I don't really think so, I'm from Sweden."
13578,Can i come too? I desperately want to go to switzerland again sometime.
13579,"Ah, smart. Carbonated drinks are shit. If I want to drink gas, I have enough gas around me."

13590,This
13591,No. I have a lot of personas and act different around each person and I feel that I have a lot of parts of me. I alone would know all parts of me and I’m very sure that I don’t even know all parts. Also it’s my way to be save so I’m not going to give that security up.

We don't plan on banning every question but for me personally self validation posts are so annoying because its basically the same answer unless its a super unique situation"
13613,"I dislike them because they’re really lazy and it’s never a controversial question that you’ll get real answers to. They’re mostly “is it cute if a girl does [arbitrary thing that the general consensus is that it is a cute thing]” so you have 90% of the comments saying “yup. Cute thing is cute.” and 10% off topic jokes and very little disagreement.

I would much prefer questions that I have to think on rather than confirming what the question practicality states as fact."

13823,"I totally agree. I have notes and all and a pretty well explaining website with summaries and details. But the chapters itself are just so huge.

So basically there are 12 chapters: Cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, ecology, evolution, human physiology, nucleic acids, metabolism, plant biology, genetics and animal physiology. Most of them have about 4 to 5 subtopics, but some have 9 and some have 3."
13824,"They probably don’t expect you to know every single process in each chapter. I have to say a 3 hour exam is really ridiculous, so try and remember the major concepts from each chapter and you should be fine."

13828,That's sinilar to how I began. I tried tying connections between the chapter and that works. Just the amount of information is the problem
13829,"Here’s some quick tips that have helped me through high school and university: 
1. if it wasn’t on a previous test, it probably won’t be on your exam, and
2. if you didn’t take notes on it, it’s probably not on the exam

So study what was on past tests and what you took notes on. If you have your old tests, then you know where you went wrong and what you got correct, so you know where gaps are in your knowledge and can focus those areas.

Edit: it’s a mock exam, so don’t stress. This is just to prep for the real thing."

Ah I'm in grade 11, and plants are always my least favourite thing, like for my previous exam I had to study sexual reproduction of plants"
13832,"Don't make yourself work against you, when you study and are mentally tired, that's when you take a break. If you're tired you won't learn anything, so just do what you want when you're studying."
13833,"Makes sense. I'll try that, thanksss"
13834,I for one can't wait until May when I have to know 3 years worth of stuff...
13835,"College is worse and in the end that high grade doesn’t mean shit man. You don’t have to have high grades to be smart. Do what you can until you can’t and when you can’t stop. Break, rest, and restart. No point in beating a dead horse. 

All you can do is your best, if you do that it’ll work out."
13836,Yeah I did. I also started some weeks ago. I just think it's crazy how much they expect you to memorize. Even with daily revision it's impossible to remember everything
13837,"Thanks for the advice, DildoMachineFFS!"
13838,Oh bro I was literally u a few weeks ago I'd say my biggest advice would be treat it like an exam only that. Like try and remember and it is just an exam and not the whole thing- ur life has more to it and will continue and thrive even with them. Any anxiety is just in ur head nothing has happened dor sure yet. Remember that too
13839,"Your mind can’t focus after an hour and a half of work. Take frequent breaks, stay hydrated, and try to make it entertaining? I quiz myself every so often to see how much is sticking. Repetition is my biggest piece of advice, or explaining it to someone else (like a helpful family member or a friend)."
13840,what the fuck is a dildo machine
13841,I'll do that. Probably a good way to revise the stuff. Thanksss!!!
13842,I'll remember that. I should really take this more chill. Thank you!!!
13843,*laughs in indian education system*
13844,Yeah that’s pretty insane. I would say those would actually be easier tho cus the answers r already kinda there so if you see the right one it will probably jog your memory
13845,Of course it's impossible to memorize everything. I don't think that they expect you to memorize everything perfectly. Just do good. Still aim for perfectness though.
13846,"Thx man, I really appreciate the kind words!!"
13847,"Yeah, I gotta study all of it. And then there's biochemistry. I hate it. I chose bio instead of chemistry and still have to do chemistry, its so annoying"
13848,"did you know you had to learn this much, like weeks earlier?"
13849,You ever seen what we do in the UK for GCSEs lmao its a mental amount of content to do at 16
13850,"i get you, my exams (which will be conducted in february) will have the full syllabus (that was taught over the course of almost an entire year). idk how i will cope up with it.

i think that you should first thing in the morning, set a goal of how much you'll get covered in the entire day. you should take regular breaks and shouldn't pressure yourself too much. after studying for like 2 hours, give yourself a break! this break could be anything, like just going, eating something, or even petting your pet (if u have one)."
13851,It only gets worse at university. All my exams are canceled which is bad for me cause I’m not getting the practice I need.
13852,"You can't.  It will suck, but remember the good times, and it won't suck so much."
13853,Thank you so much
13854,"That’s horrible. I’m grateful I get this time to prepare and say goodbye, I’m sorry you didn’t get that"
13855,The dog I had for all my life (18 year old dog) died. TBH I always replaced my sadness emotion with anger
13856,Thanks
13857,Just think they're in so much pain that you cant stop.  Go and feel no more pain.
13858,That sucks man. My condolences
13859,"you can't prepare. just spend as much time with them as you can while they are still here. what's tough about a pet is there aren't (usually) very many bad memories associated with them, they were always just there for you and loved you.

unfortunately once they are gone you're never going to see them again, and especially the first year (at least) without them it feels horrible when you're in the house and they are not there.
like they are almost part of the house, it's eerily empty without them.

once you are able, I highly recommend fostering another pet. there are agencies all over that rescue dogs from kill shelters and get them adopted. during that time before they are adopted, they stay with foster families. you get to be with them and take care of them for a few weeks at least and once you are a little bit over your cat it's a lot better for you than being alone.

after fostering many pets, since they leave you and you never see them again after making a short term connection, but still a meaningful connection nonetheless, it makes it a little easier when your own pet dies. it's still one of the hardest things in the world.

so no, there's not much you can do to prepare. there's just a few things you can do to distract yourself or make it easier after it happens.

can we have a picture of your cat?"
13860,"That’s a good way to think about it. You’re freeing your baby of pain, so they are at peace and now they can go enjoying all the chicken and tuna in cat heaven"
13861,"I don’t have or know how to use imgur, but I can post a pic on another sub if that works for you.


Thank you so much for your response

Edit: I noticed you made a superior r/teenagers. Want a picture on there?"
13862,Posted 2. :) the black cat is the one this post is about
13863,that would actually be awesome thanks
13864,"**[The Rainbow Bridge for Your Cat](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/the-rainbow-bridge-for-your-cat)**

Just this side of Heaven is a place called the Rainbow Bridge.

When an animal that has been especially close to someone here dies, that pet goes to the Rainbow Bridge—even your cat! There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends where they can run and play together. There is also a dark closet for your cat to dart into, because, well, there are a lot of dead special friends running around. Kind of hectic and exposed out there in the meadows and hills.

In the back of the dark closet is a shelf, and on that shelf is the comfiest, coziest cat bed. But your cat will go to the other side of the shelf and burrow into the stacks of expensive sweaters—sweaters that cost a fortune to dry-clean—and after a while it’s, like, fuck it, the sweaters are the cat bed now.

And that’s O.K. at the Rainbow Bridge, where all the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor, just as we remember them in our dreams. Your cat, threatened by the presence of so many healthy, vigorous animals (even though, truly, they could not care less about him and barely noticed his arrival), will start marking every part of the Rainbow Bridge, until the meadows and hills have a sort of stale ammonia smell.

The animals are content (even your cat, mostly), except for one small thing: they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. But then the day comes when an animal pauses and looks into the distance. His eager body quivers. Suddenly, he begins to run away from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.

You have been spotted. Well, not you. That’s more an example of what happens with the dogs. When you show up, you will look around at all the happy, healthy, former pets and think, Huh. Where’s my cat? And then you will catch the ammonia smell (remember when your house smelled like that?), and you will see the dark closet, and you will know. And you will joyously throw open the closet door and yell “Felix!” and he may look up. Maybe not. Probably not. And you will clap your hands and call for him, as you used to do before you were both, you know, dead, and he will remember that sound, and the excitement in your voice, and it will disgust him. Your unquenchable thirst. Your vulgar need. And he will yawn and stretch and extend a claw and pull on a cashmere thread—a loop he’s been working all day—until, gently (oh so gently; you love this little asshole!), you reach into the closet and lift him up and cover him in kisses.

And, as you scratch his ears the way he likes, and look once more into his trusting eyes, he bites your hand for NO GODDAM REASON YOU WERE JUST PETTING HIM, and you drop him, and he runs back into the closet, and he vomits on the sweaters, and you fish him out again and then you cross Rainbow Bridge togeth—

Nope. You were halfway across, and you stepped on a stick or something, and the noise freaked him out, and he raked your chest and leaped down and ran back to the closet.

You live in the meadow now. You and your cat. For eternity"
13865,"Spend as much time as you possibly can, when my pets died iz was out of nowhere and I felt really bad for not being more with them"
13866,"I have experienced the death of livestock, which I say has prepared me for the death of my pet."
13867,you can’t. you just wait miserably and then it happens. make the most of the time you can
13868,Take some nice pictures to remember them by.
13869,Enjoy every minute you can.
13870,Im dreading the day my mental support dog dies she like 9 tho so i have a few more years yet
13871,"Just spend as good as a time as you can and accept you will say goodbye but prepare to be happy it happened, not sad because it's over. As someone who has lost 2 dogs, one of which I had since I was 3, this really helped."
13872,"Recently had a doggo that got put down a few months ago. 

You really can't prepare besides knowing that it is going to happen sooner or later. I cry sometimes still, but it's okay because he was my best friend. It's tough as fuck but you will get through it. My advice would be to focus on the time you have left and make good memories with your catto :)"
13873,"I don't think there's any way you can prepare for this, but I highly suggest you hanging out with you cat a lot more, make his last few months on earth worth it, also I hope your cat can survive asthma attack"
13874,for my gpig i honestly knew it was coming and it was very hard but knowing i gave her the best life i could and not seeing her in pain anymore helped me a lot there's no real way to prepare but knowing that you gave it your best will help just make sure your pet feels loved and give the most in the time you have left
13875,"I’ve had two dogs pass before and I know how hard it is. They both died of natural causes within two months of each other. There really is no perfect way to prepare for it. This was my first close encounter with death on a personal level. Let me tell you that preparing for death isn’t always possible. I can tell you how to cope though. Always remember and cherish the time you had with someone you love. Don’t try to replace the ones you lose either. They have a special place in your heart that can’t be filled. When and if you get a new pet, think of them as a new story. Think of your new companion as a new adventure. I didn’t have any guidance when dealing with death so I spent long hours considering mortality. Even to this day, years later, I still have existential meltdowns because I try to imagine what death is like. It’s my worst fear and I wish I learned better avenues for dealing with it. So don’t dwell on what you lost because it will haunt you longer than if you’d just have focused on the good time you had."
13876,"I had to put my dog down 2 years ago, honestly there is so real way to prepare for it to happen, but this is what to expect. Also, this is my own experience and no ones else’s so I’m in no way saying that this is everyone’s experience just mine. 


So, for me it kinda started off as denial. I didn’t cry or rly think about it for 2 months, then the crying really started when they say a pets death doesn’t hurt as much as a family members death their fucking lying. Slowly you’re gonna forget your cat a little bit and what I mean by that is you’ll start to forget the little things that it used to so like where it slept etc. I kinda pushed for my dog being put down and I still feel guilty so if you can avoid putting your cat down because it will destroy you, it something I carry with me every day. But again, if it’s in the cats best interest then do it but if you can avoid it then do because no matter how much you tell yourself that it wasn’t your fault it will still feel like that.

You won’t ever rly get over it. I still kinda have random crying sessions after 2 years, so yea, it doesn’t rly stop the pain it just kinda get locked away.

Edit: also, everything they say about greef is true. Well, for the most part all the clichés are truthful."
13877,Think about how your cat had such a long and good life
13878,"You can't... 

last year I lost my dog who've I had since I was 3, he was very close to me because when I was 4 my dad died from cancer.

a day before my dog died I just pet him fully knowing he's probably isn't gonna stay for long. 

I still miss him so much."
13879,"There is no way to prepare for it, I've seen my dog be put down and found another one dead at the door when I got home from school. All I can say to you is that you know what's coming so spend as much time as you can with it beforehand. With time it will get easier."
13880,"I said goodbye and after some time my cat didn’t want to see me anymore and went away to die. We found her corpse a bit later.

Could’ve put her down but I wanted the natural way, and I found it way less saddening because she just faded away, I didn’t see her suddenly turning into a corpse"
13881,"Try to take some pictures or videos that are meaningful to you. I'm in my 30s, and have some home videos of the dog I got when I was 7 and died when I was 18. Those videos are so meaningful to me."
13882,[deleted]
13883,"Generally, something would only be creepy to the guy if it’s creepy to you. 

No, it’s not out of place."
13884,But also not wrong how you said originally
13885,"Nah, we don’t want to make the first move lol"
13886,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
13887,I think the 1st was just right Kappa
13888,"Not creepy, unless you make it creepy. Be nice about it."
13889,You know you can edit your comment right?
13890,#More girls need to make the first move op.
13891,nah its cool
13892,"Nope, i think its kind of hot and a show that she really does like you"
13893,r/unexpectedstarwars
13894,KappaPride
13895,Noone wants to make the first move
13896,I think that most of the people here will be flattered and won't mind you making the first move but honestly it depends on his/her personality
13897,Nope plus I have social anxiety.
13898,No
13899,Not at all
13900,Not at all
13901,"No, I'd be quite flattered and as my autocorrect suggests Flatbread. It's never creepy when someone makes the move, nor is it out of place. If you like her then you should try to show that, if you don't know how you feel about her then try to get to know her better. If you're not interested then try to be as easy on her as possible, you don't want to make her sad."
13902,Well i dont think so i havent ever asked out a guy but i have asked out a few girls and they didnt seem creeped out or anything
13903,"No, imo it's flattering and can make a guy feel good about himself."
13904,No. I fucking love when girls make moves because I'm way too much of a wuss to do that myself.
13905,"Yes, you can"
13906,"Not at all. Tbh it’s pretty cool. I’d respect whomever made the first move, it’s pretty courageous, and I can respect the confidence."
13907,"Not at all, everyone wants the other to make the first move"
13908,"I’m to socially awkward to make the first move, so I prefer it."
13909,"Nah I’d be flattered, but I’d like to know her a bit first"
13910,I don’t think most guys would be flattered in the first situation considering how little of the population is male.
13911,"It’s often accepted positively, unless the first move is made in a creepy/uncomfortable way.

I personally would love for a girl to make the first move on me."
13912,At this point probably over 100
13913,"I feel like I type a lot of them. Maybe I’ll say like 5 a day, 1 at max if it’s a day I’m not at school and spend a lot of time around family. And I would have to be by myself and have something prompt me to say it"
13914,"Dinghy Sailor here

We cuss a fucking lot. Especially at the damn race committees"
13915,"Now this is a little closer to where I am

I feel like I went from 4-5 to like, 20"
13916,Every fucking other fucking word
13917,"More when I text then I talk, I really only swear if I'm really mad or I hurt myself badly."
13918,Nah fuck that. I talk my ass off and swear every damn sentence. Probably 400 fucking times
13919,"The thing is with curse words is that they're only good if used affectively. Usually it's when you want to super exaggerate a point, or you use it instinctually when hurt. Use in moderation and don't say it too much, otherwise it will become pointless."
13920,"20+ each day

~~shut your fucking face uncle fucker! youre a cock sucking ass licking uncle fucker! youre an uncle fucker yes thats true, nobody fucks uncles just like you~~"
13921,"I never swear in person. I like writing little short stories and such sometimes, so I type it out in those. I think like once or twice in like actual texts or messages. I might swear in real life in the future though if I’m acting out a character, because I love to act in plays and theatre, but I’m limited by choosing not to swear. If I do swear as a character, I don’t think that’s quite the same because it’s just an act."
13922,"0
Somehow."
13923,A good 4
13924,"Yep, same"
13925,"I agree. I know when I’m sad or hurt I don’t pull out curses, but when I get annoyed I curse a lot. So something like me being upset would be fresher, but if I went off when I was angry, no one would give it a second thought as to why I was cursing so much. Really I find when I get annoyed around my mom, before I say a sentence that would normally have a curse in it, my brain kind of does an auto-switch for another word, it’s become habitual enough when I get annoyed."
13926,"That’s it? Well, I’m going to hell"
13927,"IRL? Probably 0-2. But online? Dozens per day, probably around 50-75 lmao."
13928,Atleast 20
13929,Holy fucking fuck
13930,"Zero, a lot of days"
13931,"Yea when I'm around my parents, I start with a curse word, but the quickly change it to another so they don't say 'LANGUAGE!' like a boomer. I am absolutely with you on the pissed off thing, but I sometimes use it to highlight the nature of a conversation, casual or not."
13932,Nice try dad
13933,Hundreds probably
13934,"*Wind shifts 90 degrees and they don’t abandon the race*


What the fucken hell are the jackasses doing"
13935,"Between 1-0, I don’t cuss that fucking much."
13936,None. Nobody talks to me and i dont talk to anyone.
13937,"At least one every sentence or two. It's just the area I live, we all are like it"
13938,"I’ll say 5, that’s because I rarely talk"
13939,I can't specify today I didn't talk a lot so like 3 somedays i feel religious and say frick other days I'm angry as frick and say about 20

13941,That's a yikes for me
13942,"A girl in my class once said (it's translated so not 100% correct) "" There are more ugly guys than girls"" and tbh I agree"
13943,[deleted]
13944,"dating site statistics for one.

and the fact that most men fall into the average or below average category"
13945,"ugly or hot is subjective. someone might think said ugly person is hot, or someone might think said hot person is ugly. it’s really just a matter of what you’re in to. i think there’s no in between because guys are so often deprived of attention in comparison to most girls, and they’ll take whatever they can get as long as it meets a certain standard. it’s like a threshold where 5/10+ is hot and below is ugly (keep in mind this is subjective). not going to say that guys will just fuck anything in sight, this is just in terms of looks."
13946,Where are you getting those numbers from?
13947,"The majority of men cannot be below average because that's not how averages work. Statistically speaking 50% of men will be above average and the other 50% will be below average, with maybe less than 1% being right on the line. Now I don't have any facts to back up what I'm about to say, but I feel as though the kind of women to use dating websites are going to be a bit different than the average women you're most likely to meet in person. But still thank you for responding!"
13948,"There must be an average. I'd think of an average girl as a hot one but with some notable flaws, though not enough to make her ugly."
13949,"""average or below average""

Being even slightly above average in looks puts you in the top 20% of men because the average is so large, averages can also work like that it doesnt have to be 50% cuz also if 50 are above and 50 are below... there is no average lmao.

and nah it applies to real life too, women seem to have far higher standards than men thats why youll see a decent guy settling for an ugly girl far more than the other way round"
13950,"well thats just not true.

Attractive women hold more value in society more specifically in dating"
13951,"most people fall into the range of 4/10 to 6/10.

anyone above that is in the top 20% of men"
13952,Dating site statistics are usually very unrealistic though
13953,"I disagree with your idea of average but never less, thanks for your input"
13954,"[this study](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-07-29/evolution-makes-women-more-attractive/1371676) talks about how women have evolved to become more attractive than men so that's probably why. this is something that i noticed too, i genuinely find average girls to be good looking but the average boy is just... average"
13955,"Also true, but not as many at my school"
13956,"In my opinion, ""average"" girls may not be attractive, but have great personality (or vice versa)"
13957,"I see what your saying here, I think with guys it's a bit more of a scale, a girl will put you on a 1-10. I think guys tend to rate at the extremities though, if your hot, your hot and if you aren't attractive to them (at least this is the way my friends go) you are ugly or 'clapped'. I kinda put it on a 1-10 tho. A girl can still be pretty without being hot and she can not be ugly and not be attractive to me."
13958,"Yeah, if an average girl showed me any interest I’d immediately be attached lol"
13959,Oof
13960,"That's almost every statistics, man."
13961,"Simply because the nature of dating sites do not reflect real life dating.

It is a much more toxic place with bots, catfishing and so much more."
13962,"Never said it was insanely easy or anything, but there definetley is a higher chance of being able to get into a relationship than guys is what I'm saying."
13963,"That's a really interesting study, and makes completely logical sense."
13964,"Well the curve from ugly to beautiful when men rate women is a pretty straight line, there is a clear distribution where theres the same amount of ugly, average and beautiful girls for them.

For the women rating men curve it's more like ""most men are ugly, a handful are average and almost none are beautiful"".

I think that is kinda bad but the same ""study"" (it's not scientific) also said that women tend to settle for lower ratings and go for them than men, so it evens out."
13965,"I mean in general it is true guys find ""average"" girls more hotter and usually the other way around for girls. I'm sure you can agree that it's easier for a girl to get a man than the other way around so it makes sense for girls to be more picky."
13966,It depends on what way u find the average. If there are 10 men and 9 of them are 10/10 and 1 man who is 1/10 the average rating would be 8.2/10 which would make 90% of the men above average
13967,"I think there was a study about it somewhere

I can't find it anywhere though, so it might be fake"
13968,"Most girls aren't like that, just a loud and obnoxious minority"
13969,"This is what some (non-scientific) study kinda found out. Men rate women more on that kind of scale, where theres actually a similar amount for any rating 1-10  with no notable bumps, while for women rating men it was really like most men are in 1-3, and the very least were in 7-10, it's like a curve going straight down"
13970,It's not about actual looks it's about how women perceive and rate them
13971,"I consider a few of my friends average, not that I care or something. It's subjective and different for everyone"
13972,"I usually eat something, then take a shower, a nap...

Oh no looks like the day is over. Oh well, I'll cram it in the morning before I go to school"
13973,I only have the parents part.
13974,[deleted]
13975,Well I do for the most part but I don’t fear bad grades.
13976,Damn it bro. I need the energy.
13977,"Thank you. 

~~now give me all the energy you have to get me started on that~~"
13978,So you always get good grades? Nice dude good job
13979,Steal the life force of other like Putin
13980,Well frick man I sure do
13981,"But how

Can't experience the success that comes with discipline if I can never even get to the part where I experience discipline"
13982,"yeah, it's more that it gets easier as you live a disciplined life. not that it's easy to start with."
13983,My parents yell at me if I get anything less than an A
13984,The unrelenting pain of failure keeps me motivated
13985,Same but my parents are shorter then me and I workout. They’re slightly intimidated by me so they don’t go too harsh.
13986,Force yourself to. Reward yourself for doing it at the beginning or take something of yours away until you do it.
13987,"Should you college, study something you’re passionate about. I study mechanical engineering and I love this work. It’s all really interesting for me."
13988,"I think it's just about having the right mindset and environment. Wake up, wash up, have something to drink or eat, i sometimes go out for a walk. And get your working space ready for the day.

Little things can really affect productivity."
13989,"Same situation lmao, I just force myself to do my homework, but I genuinely enjoy studying sometimes, but mostly only when Im learning something new. I guess the best answer to your question could be discipline, do it because you need to, not because you want to."
13990,I don’t have such an ability. 😔
13991,My mom is but not my dad
13992,Grades
13993,My dad would yell at me if I didn’t. But I do procrastinate a shitload.
13994,"I use a checklist on things I need to do, which I update as needed. Checking things off makes me feel productive"
13995,"People say I'm very unique in my work ethic. I think it's just how I was brought up. If I don't do work during the day I feel guilty. If I play games all day doing nothing productive I feel incredibly shit, which forces me to do work to make up for it.

Usually a sense of urgency like how summer is nearly over helps me get started with study"
13996,Shit this one hits hard
13997,So how do you start
13998,"Discipline. It's not fun to start. It sucks. It stops sucking later. You can do things that suck, so do it when it sucks and then it'll stop sucking. Get rid of distractions, that's the only way to do it."
13999,I wouldn’t do that.
14000,I mean they’re like 5’6 max and I’m 5’11. Plus I get pissed off easily(not enough to hurt them though).
14001,I want to have better grades than the other students and I also find some subjects interesting so studying them isn’t too difficult
14002,I would appreciate the thought of the gift but I think that flowers are a complete waste of money
14003,I would be happy that someone gifted me something but I would much prefer most things over it
14004,"Welp yeah, it's little, but it shows that someone care for you, and that's one of the best feelings in the world"
14005,yeah i get that. they aren't the most useful thing but at least the're pretty :D
14006,"> best feelings in the world

definitely."
14007,It’s a nice gift and it means someone cares about me
14008,yeah can't disagree with that. you can't really do much with a flower besides admiring it :)
14009,"And it's even better if you receive the flower after a rough day, a difficult exam, or any uncomfortable/stress-inducing situation"
14010,"I can’t recall a moment where I’ve ever been given flowers, which is alright with me because I’m not a fan of the whole “giving flowers as a gift” thing, but I’d no doubt appreciate the gift and gesture"
14011,Agreed
14012,A girl gave me some flowers she picked out of the grass while her boyfriend was standing next to me. I put it in an old Sprite can because i couldnt find a suitable vase. It made me feel really good because someone cared about me.
14013,"yeah it's not useful, just meaningful"
14014,so true. having someone that cares about you in such moments is so important
14015,I would be really flattered

14020,definitely.
14021,this was so nice to read :)

14023,i will. just let me find someone first :)
14024,"I feel like I'm now obligated by reddit law to say ""now kith"""
14025,If a girl gave me a flower I would be filled with so much joy and I’d probably never forget it
14026,"idk how I would feel

i would definetly appreciate it a lot and probably fall in love with her right on the spot"
14027,"Dude, my last girlfriend gave me an old, crushed up roll of smarties for Valentine’s Day. If a girl were to legitimately put thought into a gift to me, it might just make my week."
14028,do you need some specific kind of flowers for the satanic ritual?
14029,"Thank you, we dont get compliments"
14030,"I assume it’s nice, I’ve never been gifted them but it would be nice"
14031,It would be nice but honestly most of us are literally satisfied with a hug.
14032,nah. drinking in general is basically just you damaging your liver for something you won't remember
14033,Tried drinking wasn’t my think I prefer weed
14034,"Wow, if you're 13 you shouldn't smoke weed. Your brain will be severely damaged"
14035,no I do not
14036,I agree u can really fuck your body if u abuse it. I don’t drink that often I was just curious cus it’s kind of a normal thing here
14037,It’s not legal here until you’re 18 but no one seems to care.
14038,"I did once, vomited a lot and it wasn’t fun. Here in the US you can’t legally do it until age 21."
14039,I’m the same id occasionally have 1 or 2 beers but I’d never get plastered.
14040,No but I think I will when I get older
14041,Only one shot with friends if they want to. I'm not an alcoholic but not a mood killer either.
14042,My dad lets me sometimes drink but only in the house.
14043,"""Removed too quickly to be archived"""
14044,I live in Ireland and honestly no one cares about the drinking and kids as young as 12 drink and sometimes during parties kids might have some beer or something with their parents. It's kind of the norm here
14045,I forgot it was even illegal in the UK because it is so widely accepted lmao
14046,Literally every country that isn’t the us
14047,I'm from Spain and I drunk vodka with fanta with my friends
14048,"You will not destroy your liver from a few light drinks every now and then.

It’s really not that hard to just not get drunk. Don’t make the aim of drinking to get wasted, and you won’t have an issue."
14049,"In the US, despite the stupid age restriction, most people I've met have gotten drunk at least once by the time they're 18, with many doing it before they're 16"
14050,"For me weed just isn't fun because I can't smoke at home and then outside I just get tired as f*ck and want to sleep, no matter what strain."
14051,Oh most 14 year olds I know have had a drink. By 16 half my school was raging alcoholics
14052,Yeah :c
14053,"Personally I find that shit disgusting. I don’t wanna put that in my body, and with two alcoholic parents I know what that crap can do to you. I don’t wanna drink. Not ever."
14054,Ikr people as young as like 14 r getting pissed in a field somewhere
14055,same
14056,Cause my parents won't let me and now due to the virus they won't even let me out 😖
14057,"Yes, I've been drinking ever since I was born. Hydration is important"
14058,I’m not disagreeing or anything but I’m interested as to why you want to wait?
14059,"You mean it kills people who are irresponsible and addicted? Correct.

If you’re having a few beers with some friends on a Friday night, anyone with some basic self control knows when to stop. If you know your limits and don’t try to get drunk, you won’t get drunk."
14060,"Yeah, but only with friends. Most of the time I am only tipsy but sometimes I get pretty drunk"
14061,Not regularly  (I'm from Germany) but I drunk a lot on Partys but never vomited. If you know what you're doing it's fun. Otherwise it can damage you very badly. In Germany we can drink stuff below about 12% at age 14 but Noone will care if you drink something above 12%.
14062,Good choice
14063,too short
14064,My reddit account is named after something from Spongebob which my mother used to call me as a child and 84 is my favorite number because the Ghostbusters came out in 1984.

14101,"Bisexuality just means you’re attracted to 2 or more genders. Bisexual people don’t ignore gender and often can prefer a gender. Meanwhile pan people properly don’t care, no preferences, gender doesn’t even come into the equation in choosing a partner. If that makes sense? Trans men and trans women don’t change someones sexuality because they are men or women. Not to mention it’s still pretty debated in the community and even if someone fits pansexual more than bisexual or vice versa it doesn’t really matter. Sometimes people joke about picking a bisexual identity instead of pansexual one because “pretty colours”"

14114,"Break up because I’m not gay, nothing personal and I’d still want to remain friends with them."
14115,Well I think what he meant is that what if they figured it out while dating you? Some trans people haven't always known and kind of realised it the way some gay people haven't always known.
14116,"since i’m bi, i wouldn’t mind at all and i’d stay with them. my answer would’ve been different when i was straight tho"

14152,How did you get to stop? Just doing it more often?
14153,Yes. It’s called being nervous.
14154,"I can speak normally under many circumstance, but I suddenly get worried about how my voice sounds and I get really monotone for some reason in large groups, or even when talking to people I don't know in small groups."
14155,"You just gotta fake having confidence until you actually get some. Go up there and put on a show, make eye contact with the audience, move around if you’re not forced to stand behind a podium, use hand gestures, vary the tone of your voice so you’re not monotone, throw some interesting facts in there and you’re set"
14156,Probably but like I don’t see other people get super shaky when they talk
14157,Yeah but I get crazier. Like I yelled out “The fuck you doing!” During a skit where I pretended to be a bully.
14158,"Uh, I have the exact opposite problem. I literally cannot hold personal convos but am comfortable to talking to hundreds at once."
14159,They're just as scared as you pal. Public speaking isn't easy but the best way to get over it is to practice your speeches until you can't get them wrong.
14160,You have philosophy classes? I'm jealous
14161,"Just one simple solution, don't give a goddamn f\*\*k about everyone in the group, instead, just look at the mean emotion of the audience and come up with a general improv to it. That cannot be the case with personal convos, so I kinda suck at them. 

Just tell yourself to not react to everything in the group. Don't imagine stuff happening to them (like most people often tell), rather, just speak, and then do not give a f\*\*k about anything else. They aren't going to come over and slap you on the podium, so just be yourself."
14162,how do you deal with it? what do you tell yourself?
14163,I get huge adrenalin rushes and get shaky and sweaty when discussing something I am passionette for xd

14168,"this was for “what was the cringiest moment of your life.

“oooooh this is gonna be fuuun. 

im a shy person... a VERY shy person. but, when a shy person hears the word “presentation”, you know it aint gonna be a good time, but guess what, the presentation was in front of 3 classes, so basically 100 students. the presentation is in duos, but the guy im working with doesnt wanna cooperate, so we have to both work alone. a month passes by, he starts the presentation. he says LITERALLY EVERYTHING i had ready to say, but luckily, i had a qna section in my part, i was ready to say it, anime music is playing, everyone is waiting... theyre waiting... my microphone wasnt working, so that was a full 30 seconds wasted, then we switch mics, then i start.... but i cant. im shaking so hard, im scared, i cant read properly, my voice isnt loud enough for the mic, im stuttering, im frozen. i look at the person managing it, he starts encouraging me... but i cant, im too scared, but i had no idea why, it wasnt like my life was on the line, but i was so scared that i just told the manager guy that i said everything i had to say, and i finished my presentation... but i never started, i said 0 words. that was 2 years ago, ive never cringed harder im my entire life.”

so my answer is yes"
14169,Groups more than 5 absolutely
14170,I will quite literally have a panic attack speaking to a group of 2 people.
14171,I get that from groups of 5

14173,I don't
14174,It's not that extreme but I definitely notice my heart racing faster. Especially when everyone has to say something and my turn comes closer and closer...
14175,Depends on who those ten person is

14184,"I don't really want to out myself, life's complicated sometimes"
14185,i’m bi so... if he cute then lemme date him
14186,Why tho D:?
14187,"I have personal experience with this. I've had two gay guys hit on me in two different situations, and the way I reacted was completely different in each situation. 

One time, I was in a club with a few friends and a guy started flirting with me and complimented me on my dancing (although tbh I thought I was pretty terrible at it). It was obvious that he thought I was attractive. I pretty much thanked him for the compliment and when he persisted further said that I wasn't gay so I couldn't really be into him. I think it turned out fine. Nobody got angry and I genuinely do appreciate the compliments he gave me.

The other time was really bad. I had a gay friend who developed a huge crush on me and would not listen to any of my (not so subtle) hints that I was straight. The way he acted around me was downright creepy, and I had to change friendship groups to avoid him (although he followed me to my new group a few days later). When a few of my friends tried talk to him and get him to stop being a creep, he refused to believe them when they said I wasn't gay, and said he wanted to hear it from me. I told him I wasn't gay, and he shot back with ""well I only thought you were gay because everyone else does"". Now I can understand him thinking I was gay to start with because I'm very bubbly when I'm overexcited and happy about stuff (which is frequent) and I'm pretty androgynous (although I still identity as male - screw gender norms tho). What I don't like is how he wouldn't just take my word for it and move on with his life. When I rejected him, he set about spreading rumours behind my back to attempt to sabotage my chances with any girls and simultaneously try to make me ask them out so that I could understand how rejection feels or something like that. Almost a year down the track, I would be prepared to forgive him if I got an apology, but I haven't even received an attempt at one. As a result, I don't call him my friend anymore, and I try to avoid him as much as possible."
14188,Basically every straight person's comment in this thread. Why did OP bother?
14189,Sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to be comfortable about your sexuality around others at some point.
14190,"Depends on who, really, but would likely be 'Fuck it, lets give it a go'"
14191,“Nah im good I still like girl”
14192,"You'd be surprised, as a gay person it can be PETRIFYING to ask a guy out if you're not sure if they're straight. Emotions fuck you up man, especially when society isn't there to help explain them."
14193,"Same answer here, but I wouldn't give it a try. If anyone is interested in you/thinks that you are attractive then that's a confidence boost right there."
14194,Bi folks rise up!
14195,"No matter if it was a guy, girl or anything in between, I'd just panic because I'm bad at social interactions - especially if it was a guy, since I don't want to out myself as gay, and when flustered, I tend to talk way too much."
14196,Bro I’m straight
14197,"im bi

I would probably react the same if a girl told me she had feelings for me"
14198,"I've actually had a couple gay guys tell me they'd date me if I was gay. So, if I ever do swing that way, I'm definitely in luck. Unfortunately, though, as flattered as I would be, I would probably have to turn him down."
14199,"Relatable, but bi"
14200,"I have a similar situation of your 2nd story. For me its been 2 1/2 years now and it gets better. ""Attempt to sabotage my chances with any girls and simultaneously try to make me ask them out"" thats exactly what happened with me, and let me tell you it stuck with me for like a year and 1/2. Nowadays I don't hear much about it but still there's a chance. Anyone who can't take no for a answer needs to face reality. I'm sorry for being unhelpful."
14201,Do the Stanky leg
14202,"Hm... blush probably. Explain that I’m straight by stammering a lot, saying a bunch of nonsense, rambling on awkwardly, reaching to pat his shoulder before realizing that’s weird and pull my hand away, making things weirder, etc."
14203,What if they were the 1.5%.....
14204,"Fuck I don't know

14268,I cannot see a single situation when this is not useful

14271,"Because if I'm coding it's just gibberish. I don't know how to explain it but my fingers just write random words, usually about my day, I just move my hands, idk how to explain"
14272,"I havent tried lsd yet but I have done magic mushrooms 3 times already and it should be somewhat similar. Like the others already said, get a kit and a trip sitter. And look shit up, dont just do it. tripstoppers also might dome in handy like Benzos or just lots of sugar+vit c. Only use psychedelics when you know you dont have any mental problems, it can turn very dark very quickly if you're depressed and take it. 6 hours of crying and bad thoughts...
Have fun and take care"
14273,Nah I’m not into drugs personally.
14274,"Oh yeah, that guy that died at the music festival. Very sad indeed"
14275,yea the only thing im missing is a trip sitter but im thinking i might just take half a tab
14276,I know people who have taken tabs and I would highly suggest finding a tripsitter
14277,No drugs gang rise up
14278,"Ok, looking through the comments I see lots of “Don’t do it bro, it’s dangerous” and other absolutely retarded statements from people that have zero experience with the substance, except from drug ads or some other bs scare campaign. 

LSD is not a toy. It’s a tool. It’s not necessarily fun. It’s more intense than anything you can imagine and it’s personal as shit. It’s a journey you, and only you, have to choose to go on. Don’t let anyone else make that decision for you, and understand how to do it. Be around people you trust very intimately, even if that is only one person. Do it knowing you have the next 36-48 hours completely free, and without a worry, and please for the love of god test it. You can buy test kits online or in some pharmacies. You will need no more than 50-75 ug. You can probably do 100 ug but i recommend doing less. With LSD more is really not better.

LSD is extremely volatile. It will allow you brain to enter a type of dynamic state where you can think, see and experience things you wouldn’t be able to otherwise. It allows you to unlearn bad habits, learn things you didn’t think about before, feel more content, rempove anxiety and much more. Many times the experience will have lasting effects on your personality and world vision. But it can go both ways. With especially bad experiences you can have lasting trauma and might feel discontent with people/yourself. However this can be controlled through set and setting, and no experience is permanent.

Please don’t take my word for everything, research all of this yourself if you’re really interested in doing LSD. Respect the substance, and have fun."

You arent ready for it either. Youre going through so many changes, Im not sure you will be able to soak in the whole experience. Wait until 18 or 21."
14284,You call it tripsitter? Thats way better than the name they've got for me aka spotter
14285,"No. That is unforgivable. You have already been tainted by the foul effects of drugs. BEGONE, HEATHEN"
14286,Can I join? I accidentally took a sip of alcohol when I was like 5.
14287,Can you flare yourself please?
14288,[deleted]
14289,That is a little less obvious but tripsitter is still pretty unclear without context
14290,"It's true that you can't die due to an overdose of acid but you definetley CAN die due to the results of taking acid. Most deaths because of LSD is usually because of the result of using it like suicide, dangerous behaviour etc.

This is why it's a really good idea to have a tripsitter so you don't do anything dangerous or anything like that."
14291,It made my ADHD way worse and I got addicted. It might have also given me GAD
14292,Done
14293,"I would just like to say, if OP does LSD only once and it doesn’t trigger anything, his brain will be able to reverse any adverse effects because it is so young thanks to neurogenisis and neuroplasticity. However, he would have to be completely sober for a while and he needs to do a low dose (and of course it cant be a bad trip)."

14302,I would actually *like* to have my ribcage show a bit tbh
14303,[deleted]
14304,I mean I'm close to having my ribcage show but I prefer that over being fat because I lowkey don't have the best knees. But there's nothing wrong with being fat either!
14305,I guess both because mine does show a bit but I still hate myself for being a fat piece of shit
14306,Long ribcage gang
14307,I'd rather it show.
14308,"I'd rather have my ribcage show just a little bit, not like *accordion ribcage* level of skinny"

14311,It's nice to see you being more active lately.
14312,Rib cage. I’m fat already.
14313,My ribcage already shows lol.
14314,Im more of a meh for being a fatass lol. I like eating too much
14315,"I've had both, I'd take the ribcage over the fat."
14316,thanks!!
14317,Being fat is horrible
14318,*How is it that you are finding all of my self-depreciating comments?*
14319,"Yep. Idc about if I hurt anyone’s feelings with this statement, being fat is horrible."
14320,Another formerly fat guy who also agrees. And speaking of knees... turns out carrying around 60 extra pounds everywhere you go is terrible for your knees and joints. LPT everybody
14321,"Muscle can also go over the ribcage, although it still shows a bit."
14322,As a fat guy (thankfully not as fat as I used to be and still working on it) I agree completely
14323,I'm big boned so a ribcage wouldn't make me look way skinny so that's what imma pick
14324,Same
14325,Same
14326,Twunk
14327,*fair enough*
14328,My rib cage already shows kinda. So I'd rather stick with that

14368,My grandmas life support machine is perfect for this. Thanks I will take it apart and try to fit one inside.
14369,I'm glad I inspired somebody. Just make sure to order them early enough delivery from China can take ages.
14370,Nah the roomba would drag them out under there but I like the idea
14371,Endless possibilities and yet I only have 100 ducks :(
14372,I live in China so I think it will be fine but thanks.
14373,"*inside* big pieces of technology. Like if there’s anything that you could easily take apart, fit a duck inside, and put it back together. They may never see it but if they do, it’ll be great, especially if it’s like several years from now"
14374,think about the places u use the least. places you never or rarely ever use. you know that random chore you have to do every year or the housekeeping job that comes around annually. hide it in a spot relating to that task so it will take them ages to find it.
14375,Make sure you unplug it so you don’t electrocute yourself
14376,Holy shit this is a fantastic idea. Just imagine wanting to clean under the bed and an upside down duck (maybe with a batman paintjob) looks at you
14377,Tape them to the underside
14378,As a preventive measure I will set the lamp on fire
14379,"For casual places put em in like cabinets, under beds, etc. When you get aggressive with it balance em on doorknobs, put em in the shower, in the fridge, maybe in their car somewhere. 

I had an idea for an April fools prank on my sister that was exactly like this. My plan was to start soft and get really aggressive just like yours. But I was gonna use pennies. The end was gonna get so aggressive that I’d have all her friends add her to a group chat and spam penny emojis. Then I’d steal her phone and change my contact to “penny man” and call her while playing static noises on the other line. All of that would be up until April 1st when I walk up to her and hand her a penny."

If I spent 5 minutes really masaging the muscles in one arm, I could fully extend it with no pain until it tightened back up a little while later. I'd say masage, rest, and heat the area if you can. Hope you get back to 100% soon"
14424,Lmao he busted out the protractor for that one
14425,"As my coach says, embrace the pain"
14426,That's a very specific angle
14427,"Depends on the muscle tbh, I like having a sore back or arm but hate having sore legs"

14432,Yes it feels like I accomplished something.
14433,"Feel the burn, baby"
14434,I’m not a fan. Mostly because last time it happened I had to haul ass right before Mother’s Day dinner and could barely walk all night.
14435,"Yeah, mine likes to tell us to embrace the suck."
14436,But I don’t like the burn

14441,"You need to stretch your arms after every workout to avoid this. What I do is I extend my arm horizontally, put my palm on the inside of a doorframe and try to bend my arm the way it isnt supposed to, this is a really good stretching exercise imo"

14443,"Fosho. I don't workout much but I'm currently trynna change that, I wanna loose weight and I love the feeling of my muscles after they've been pushed to their limits."

14446,No.
14447,I love it after I do some deadlifts and other lower body workouts and my ass hurts for like 3 days afterwards

14461,"My mom has said to me ""If I ever find out that you have smoked, you're in so much trouble that you won't believe it"" (that's the exact words). Even a slight smell of smoke when I've been near a smoker causes a fit, and she wants to smell my breath (which is OK with me cause I've never smoked and never will). This is all because her brother, my uncle, died of smoking before I was even born, after ignoring all the warnings. So I can't blame her tbh"

14474,"Hey, you have gone 17 years without it, why start now? That's my mentality on it, at least."
14475,"Weed is so damn good. See people just pigeon hole everything into DRUGS. But believe me weed and Percocet and heroin and cocaine are all verrrryyy different. As you get old you realise everyone is doing drugs. Not saying that’s a good thing but once you realise that, a bit of weed seems fine."
14476,"It may be a little hypocritical, but the only reason they are saying that is because they know it's bad, and they want the best for you. At least I hope that's why. And your dad is trying to quit, so, wish him good luck from me. Nothing harder than that."
14477,I'm not planning on doing it every day. I'm just doing it every once in a while to relieve stress and I'm not allowing myselfbto do it morw often than once per month.

14484,#yes
14485,"I'm not overwhelmed by the amount of work, I'm overwhelmed by the fact that they are still grading us even though some of us cant contact them."
14486,I feel absolutely overwhelmed by some of the work I’m assigned. Procrastination is a bit of a factor to why it may take me 15 hours to complete my work but give us less work if you’re going to directly state that these circumstances are different. Props to my band teacher for assigning less work directly because of this
14487,"I may not agree with most of the school system, and most older people go ""i was in your shoes""

Some of it is stupid work I'll give you that, but my math teacher put it in a different light. Its not teaching you things like geometry or pre-calculus because you'll use it later (trust me...the most you'll probably use is geometry) but its more so teaching you to think about the problem and go about it in a way you see fit.

The time school starts, i agree with as it gets you ready for waking up early for work. We shouldn't be staying up until hours before we have to wake up for school then complain about it. Its not healthy.

As for the work? Well i do believe teachers give in class time to work and if your like me and front load your highschool days without a study hall and barely scrape by, your senior year will be ezpz"
14488,"As a homeschooled kid, I feel sorry for y'all. My friends who are in school are drowning in schoolwork, and I can see how stressed they are about it. I don't think I ever felt a half of that stress about any of my work."

14490,"It's simple, I don't do it"
14491,My district made it so grades cant go down and I already had straight as so basically no work for me
14492,"it's simple, u ain't passing"
14493,"The excessive work I disagree with because it means I am very deprived of sleep. This is mainly because of extra-curricular but the extra-curricular is the best way to stay fit, which is partly why it exists.

I have to get up at around 5:30 every morning for gym before school and stay in school until 5:30 in the evening for gym after school too (I row by the way). I eat dinner at 6:30 and then have to do yoga/stretching until 7. This should be fine if I didn't have 4 hours of homework to do!

If I wake up at half 5 every morning and go to bed at 11 every night I only get 6 hours of sleep each night. That's not good lmao."
14494,"Not me, but some people I know."
14495,Me. I have more work now than I did when I was actually in school
14496,Yep. I have 5 assignments which were due in the past. And have had at least 5 breakdowns.
14497,I do. The coming week will be all about studying for finals. My bladder has been seriously overactive. 🤣
14498,"I'm a senior, my grades are pretty much safe and I know what college I'm going to. I'm just cruisin baby"
14499,"Honestly, I think most people are like this because the actual school time has been disrupted and now school time is like, anytime.

Try making a weekly schedule so that you don't waste all of your day doing school work. Personally, I do everything that has been posted on a day in that same day, except for big projects, I take as much time as I need with them."
14500,"You should still do work, especially in math or you’ll be screwed next year."
14501,"Im on the same boat, minus the college...im just livin in paradise"
14502,I hate my teachers they send out parents emails saying that if we are having problems we should just message them. They dont even tell us what chapters we have to to or anything and when we ask what they just say “look for it yourself” bitch noone in the class knows what we should do and you should lose your job
14503,damn you guys are unlucky. my school made all the work optional
14504,Best of luck man. I cant relate since all my school work is optional so I just said fuck it I aint doin it. Havent been to a zoom or google classroom meeting in weeks.
14505,"I started looking into it, and the response of the renal system to intense exertion is actually really interesting imo. The way reduced blood flow to the kidneys effects vasopressin release and all that jazz."
14506,We dont have homework and our teachers actually care very much about us so we get the best of the best experience we could from our school so we can get good grades
14507,"Yup, I do... I get shit loads of homework and it is honestly just stressing me out so bad. They expect us to make all of that and have literally 0 free time and next to that teach ourselves... I had an test this week and that teacher literally gave us fucking 30 seconds per answer and was even counting down... I fucked up that test so fucking hard because of that, I can't stand time stress and he gave us only 30 seconds per question... I can't answer a question in 30 seconds with someone counting down because I first want to think logically about the answer and understand the question..."
14508,"Me. It's so much unnecessary BS. I'm 19 and I want to do what I want, school is for kids.

I'm sitting here working my ass off, unpaid, for shit that will never benefit me, just so that I can get into university, what I probably won't even do."
14509,"I live in Finland so the school system is fucking awesome, so I can't really relate to that. I mean, yeah there are some teachers that give us a lot of school work atm, but I'm actually very glad that we have online classes. There's a lot of toxic people in my school, so I don't have to worry about them."
14510,It has completely fucked up my sleep schedule
14511,i can’t focus whatsoever at home so i always did my homework in other classes. now that it’s all homework i can’t get any of it done and some of my teachers are assigning more things than they did before quarantine :/

14521,"That’s the best answer here. While you should get out and do things, you shouldn’t feel forced to do so all the time. I feel like talking should be the major thing"
14522,"Well I mean u do what u want I guess. (Pardon me I’m entering Ted talk Mode). Of course don’t be the guy/girl who just abuses their partner. When your in a relationship, nothing really changes. You just have in a sense a closer friendship with a certain someone in your life. So you basically do things u would do with your friends with whoever your dating mostly. The only thing that changes is the things you can do in this “friendship”.  Like you wouldn’t take your best friend with you on a romantic trip in Paris. So basically u get a special friendship with someone in ur life. Then after that well I don’t got a clue. It’s ether you breakup or get married. Or just stay like that forever for some reason."
14523,Yea until you can drive out to dates and stuff that’s basically how it b

14529,bro premarital hand holding?? not cool dude
14530,Talking should prob be like 75% of the stuff you do lol
14531,you're gonna grow up to be a fine kid

14533,dont you think its a little early for hand holding bro?
14534,Eew now you also talk about ***
14535,And this is why you're still single Cbow... You could've had the girl or Uno... To this day I can't believe you chose Uno

14569,This was a question directed at guys y’all wouldn’t understand lmao
14570,How u know ?
14571,I wish I could give you gold
14572,"It doesn't really make a difference to me, and it depends more on how it compliments the rest of the look. So, I honestly couldn't tell you without understanding how you look and your style."
14573,"No, not at all. In my opinion it makes you look slutty which is the exact opposite. It's literally called a choker."
14574,I didn’t really know they were a thing until recently and just thought it was a weird fad to wear dog collars...
14575,"I kinda like it and kinda not. Depends on what style they have. A choker is kinda a ""hot"" style item and not a cute one. So if what you're going for is hot, then yes its nice. But if you wanna look cute, nope its not. I dont really like when you mix cute and hot looks. Also remember to match it with your personality"
14576,It can be quite nice yeah but most of the time it’s not especially cute
14577,"To be fair, aren’t you talking about the “stigma,” for lack of a better term, surrounding a choker rather than the choker, itself?"
14578,This.
14579,Not really
14580,Shit I didn't mean to comment on a comment
14581,No they remind me of collars almost
14582,We can agree cloth is the good one right?
14583,Same with piercings for me
14584,"it’s more hot than cute, but yes i like the look. especially with short hair"
14585,"*A girl wearing a choker would suck a cock for 1$*

-me and the boys"
14586,I think they look weird but thats just my opinion
14587,no aha i dont like them just simple ones to match whatever im wearing :)
14588,I think they are super hot but just without spikes
14589,Nope. I just think they look slutty (no offense).
14590,"This is a really interesting take, I've never thought of that before"
14591,Doesn't bother me so no
14592,I have a really cute girl buddy who I think wears chokes now and then (my memory is iffy and I dont remember how often) and I say it's really cute cause it fits her style
14593,I think it depends on the girl who wears it and how it looks on her
14594,It either adds nothing or subtracts
14595,I think it looks quite good on most girls
14596,You should probably try other types of tight necklaces that don’t have the exact design of chokers
14597,so damn cute . chokers are underrated tbh
14598,bro shes 14
14599,Chokers are better tho imo

14632,"Rioters be doing what rioters do ig

Like are you really surprised 

They’re burning buildings and looting stores like I’m p sure they’re also gonna attack people yk"
14633,Disgusting human beings
14634,"unprovoked attacks are terrible, retaliation against police shooting rubber bullets and the like at peaceful protestors is understandable"
14635,"Yeah, most police are just... doing their jobs like everyone else"
14636,"Yeah  if any one of these idiots attacks anyone they need to be charged with whatever the fuck possible alright

and apparently there was talks of riots moving into neighborhoods so..."
14637,"wait, are people attacking firefighters/first responders? I haven’t heard of that, would you mind maybe linking footage of it please?"
14638,https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3UMSOChtD/?igshid=sx7b2hj07csh
14639,"Yeah, so when the rioters’ houses are on fire, instead of putting it out with water... they’ll now throw the bricks back at the houses🧐"
14640,It’s pointless because they break the law to defend someone (as far as I’ve been informed) who has not broken the law. They’re being violent to stop unnecessary violence. They’re making the problems the victims.
14641,Ungrateful idiots. All of them.
14642,the guy was attacking people with a machete
14643,"Heard about that as well, white ones specifically too."
14644,"Im not suprised no, in kinda disgusted tho, i saw a vid of a group of around 30 people kicking a man, beating him with skateboards and beating and throwing medium sized rocks at him untill he was so mangled up and probably dead...u know why they did thst? Because that guy wouldnt let the people loot and trash his store ...fucking disgusting"
14645,where are the fucking roof koreans when we need em
14646,"Ah yes the ""privilege"" of having rocks and bricks thrown at me at 2am

only reason I'm on reddit is bc cops FINALLY showed up."
14647,"IM FUCKING 17. I DON'T PARTICIPATE IN POLICE OR STATE-SANCTIONED ACTIVITES.

So you're saying its justified for citizens angry at the *government* to hurt fellow citizens' livelihoods?"
14648,Fucking disgusting
14649,It's terrible. What did they do? Nothing. Pacific protesting in my opinion is what they should do.
14650,"Imma go against the popular sentiment here.  obviously this is terrible, but beware that a lot of irrelevant people have been pouring in from the surrounding areas to take advantage of the chaos. Minnesotan officials, in particular, believe that white supremacists have been the ones looting, mostly. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/george-floyd-protests-white-supremacists-minnesota-minneapolis-st-paul-a9541676.html

Obviously not saying that actual protesters haven't been looting, but it's been greatly amplified by a select few"
14651,Well outside of the peaceful protests yes obliviously but there are a lot of violent protesters casing damage.
14652,"I feel like retaliation against police using tear gas etc. is okay in certain circumstances. In my city, riots started *before* police used any kind of crowd suppression. Someone started shooting fireworks and throwing bricks at police, as well as lighting buildings on fire, and that’s when police started using force. That’s when I don’t think retaliation is okay. When I do think it’s okay, is when there’s a peaceful protest occurring and no one is breaking any laws, and police use crowd suppression then."
14653,The vast majority of the protests are peaceful.
14654,If they attack anyone even police they should be arrested
14655,"Rioters: saying cops and trump are destroying America.

See it this way, in every armed conflict, all sides have committed war crimes. Does that necessarily make everyone in the military bad people?

Also, the Catholic Church is struggling with its sex abuse scandal and cover ups and all. Does that necessarily make all priests sex predators? No, the vast majority of priests want to serve God and the community. 

In every group of humans, there is at least one piece of shit in 'em."
14659,"Government buildings and police only. Private companies and people aren't the target. 

Also ""cops started it"" is a shit excuse. 

Please enlighten me more about how you, a 15 year old kid with more privilege than me, someone currently living  through a fucking riot, knows more and obviously is smarter than all else - as of course ""ape mode"" is the only solution."
14660,"That not ok. Retaliation against the police who are using tear gas, mace and rubber bullets is ok. But attacking the people who are trying to actually help is just a shitty move."
14661,"I don’t get the point in what they’re doing with the riots. It’s not the rioting in itself, it’s the fact that they’re burning down stores and buildings that have literally nothing to do with what happened. 

Like for fucks sake, what is burning down a wallmart gonna do to help with showing that black lives matter. It’s not gonna help, it’s gonna make it worse. Lots of people have already died or been seriously injured because of it, and people that have nothing to do with the death of Floyd or police brutality."

I hope you’re okay!"

The next day I go and first thing I do before any of my classmates arrive (I got there early) is pop three xanax pills, classmates arrive, my ex with them and they see me just “chilling” some teacher arrives and tells me I failed his class (a really important class) so I go outside and pop two more pills, my ex and I start talking and she sees I’m actually quite high at that moment, we go sit down and I start crying, a teacher sees her hugging me so she asks us to stop and to go back to our classroom, I cry in front of the door of our classroom, and then when I get in I pop idk 3-4 pills and I stopped being conscious, idk how many pills I took other than those, my best friend took them and hid them from me but I was already too gone, from what people tell me at some point I’m sleeping in front of the whole class and when a teacher comes and tells me to get up, I try but end up falling and hitting my head. 

Now an important part is that my friends tried to contact my parents but couldn’t cuz they don’t know my password, the only person that could is my ex, cuz I have her fingerprints saved in my phone, she used it and calls my brother, mom and then dad in that order, the only one who picked up was my dad, so she calls him and tells him “I’m not feeling good and that I need help” so he comes to my high school and actually comes into my class and sees me passed out on the floor, barely even breathing they take me to the hospital and idk what else happened, my ex was the one to greet my dad and tell him what had happened.

At the end my dad liked her and thought she was quite sweet and caring, I still think that too.    
My mom also met her but she met her when me and her were just best friends."

14771,"My first relationship was long distance (800+ miles, 1300+ kilometres) and I had never met her irl. I knew they would be super concerned at the prospect of that and so I haven’t told them. So far that’s the only proper relationship I have been in."

14783,"I was told that putting toothpaste on your nipples would make you high. I didn't really want to get high, but it was 3am and my inhibitions were low so I had to try it. Ended up falling asleep and getting woken up at 6am to go on a 20 hour car ride. I didn't have time to wash the tooth paste off so I just walked around with toothpaste on my nipples all day. To add salt to that wound, the toothpaste was made with charcoal so it was all black and I wore a mostly white shirt. I walked around with black stains on my shirt where my nipples are."

14785,Stuck my big toe into a tea bag and left it on for a day because I read somewhere that it was meant to help heal my broken toe nail.
14786,Rubbed a banana on a scratched Xbox disc to try and fix it
14787,"This works but you like shake first, me and my friends did it to each other a while back"
14788,Makes sense
14789,I think that’s how you get an infection

14805,"I thought you were supposed to cut off a bit of the tea bag, put a base coat over your nail and then use the tiny piece of teabag to cover the crack while the coat is still wet + add top coat over tea bag"
14806,"Rubbed toothpaste on my cracked DS screen to fix it. A few years later I rubbed toothpaste on my very very cracked phone screen to fix it.  Pieces were literally falling out, so I think the toothpaste held some of the smaller stuff together. It's still broken though."
14807,Probably some 5 minute craft shit

14812,;-; feelsbadman
14813,"Yes

Unless I see my thighs

I love my thighs"
14814,"Not really, especially as of late, seeing myself in photos is really bad but mirror was always mostly tolerable"
14815,Glad to hear you got out of the downward spiral
14816,Nope
14817,I love having sexy ass thighs
14818,Good for you
14819,"no, i'm used to it. Pictures and recordings on the other hand..."
14820,Believe me I’m glad too ahaha
14821,"[If you look in the mirror and don't like what you see, you can find out first-hand what it's like to be me](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kf2mr4s7G3ErS-ruCXgDFFwY8HyHQijfA)"
14822,Guys with nice thighs thread
14823,It’s only for certain parts of my face like my teeth or my acne but other than those 2 things which are the majority of my face no.
14824,Same..
14825,"Literally all the time. Both my body and to a slightly lesser degree my face. Im working on it, but it's baaaaaddd. I usually try to just forget i look like garbage and go on with my life."
14826,"I go back and forth. ""Oh I'm not too ugly"" to ""I look like shit"" and back"
14827,Yep every day
14828,"Yeah, but then I look at other ppl and think like ""oh it ain't that bad"""
14829,Same
14830,"Yeah, sometimes"
14831,All of the fucking time bro
14832,lol
14833,Wanna switch?
14834,I wish :/
14835,"Literally always. I hate what I am because I see what I could become, but I just can't get to that point. I see people all around me succeed, so why can't I too?"
14836,"Yeah, I really hate gender dysphoria."
14837,i was literally abt to comment that im so disappointed some1 beat me to it
14838,Same :(
14839,Yeah my Siamese twin Is very ugly
14840,lmao yes- body swap✨
14841,"Yea. Its not really a matter of disliking my appearance, its disliking who I am. Its disappointing to see myself as a person from another perspective, and knowing everything I don't like about myself. I avoid looking into my reflection always, even in bathroom mirrors ill try to keep it out of vision. I'm not who I seem to be to everyone else."
14842,My parents are younger than most but yeah it is kinda weird when my dad makes “fucking weeb” jokes and stuff
14843,"Yes

Also your parents listen to hatsune miku? How did that happen? Not saying older people can’t listen to that but it just seems kinda weird."
14844,Y'all can catch me singing along to that call me maybe shit in the club
14845,"Yes, especially when I’m listening to a song like “Mi General Augusto Pinochet” or “Family Friendly Noose Song”"
14846,"What really gives me anxiety is when I'm listening to music with others and I get to pick the music

Cause while some of the music I listen to is pretty accessible, some of it would definitely require an explanation"
14847,Fuck yeah. Like if an old person says to me what you listening to? I can’t just say I’m listening to Camelot lol
14848,Family friendly noose song is a low key bop
14849,No I’m talking about her full albums she bops like nothing else bro
14850,"onlu if they ask me to play it, my playlist has some contrasting songs on it lol. only time its fine is when its only on in the background, like sparring or something"
14851,same
14852,They just think everything I listen to is anime music
14853,How young tho? Like young young like 35 or something or like in his early 40s?
14854,Yeah my playlist goes from anime ops to heavy power metal and then to fillipeno vocaloid
14855,Not really. Not anymore at least.
14856,"Yeah, mainly because I only really listen to video game OSTs and I don't want anybody to think I'm weird"
14857,"Definitely; I listen to a combination of Harry Styles, Calum Scott, and Troye Sivan, so I have no idea what kind of music my straight friends are expecting to get lmao"
14858,"Yea I know, Emotion Side B is an absolute masterpiece

I was just saying that because last week that song was played at a party in a club I went to and that shit was fire"
14859,"Nah, everybody who knows me knows that I only listen to kanye"
14860,"I don’t think I’ve showered in the past 2 years without blasting Boy Problems tbh.

Don’t get me wrong CMM still Fire asf tho"
14861,No. I’m just like “Death metal. Bye” sometimes I air drum to chop suey
14862,[deleted]
14863,"Not at all, I love introducing people to my music."
14864,"Bot anxiety, but I get really evasive"
14865,"Not music, but this when I'm asked what game I'm playing or what I'm watching on Youtube. The Youtube one is probably bad because my mom probably thinks I'm watching porn or something"
14866,"Depends on who asks. If it’s with my friends or my mom (she listens to similar music to me) I’ll proudly say how much of a Taylor Swift fan I am. But when it’s people I barely even know talking about their favorite autotune rappers asking who my favorite musician is, it’s kind of weird to say “I have 30 Zara Larsson songs in my playlist” and not get judged hard.

EDIT: all that said, if someone comes up to me looking for music suggestions, I’m happy to give them ideas because I’m proud of my taste in music and would love to promote my favorite artists"
14867,Dang this took me back to my freshman year... I listened almost exclusively to the Donkey Kong Country OST for about a month lol. VGM is great though!
14868,Also a huge fan of TS. I’ll definitely check out Zara Larsson. If you have any other suggestions I’d totally be down to hear them.
14869,Can I be an ass and ask what extra tone is
14870,"bruh if you think chop suey is death metal than you've never heard death metal. chop suey is heavy rock or alt metal but not death metal.

&#x200B;

[heres some actual death metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBy4gn8VBMo)"
14871,"Yooo, it IS my freshman year. I listen to a lot of Deltarune and Terraria Calamity Mod OSTs, but Donkey Kong is great too."
14872,play with boobs
14873,Pray that I’m not on my period
14874,straight forward
14875,Help all my homies get girlfriends
14876,In public
14877,calm down soldier
14878,Fair enough
14879,See if anyone actually likes me...
14880,If your masturbating during your transformation back into a guy will you just have 3 fingers stuck in your urethra?
14881,Masturbate and have sex like all day to figure out 'what the ladies like'
14882,We all know what at least half of the answers will be.
14883,Homiesexual is neither gay nor straight as it does not deal in the realm of the physical spectrum
14884,Um 'discover myself' then find the candy man van
14885,What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land?
14886,"Take all sorts of hot pictures of myself, then see how it feels to masturbate as a girl

And I would say that I'd fuck with some of my friends except I don't have any"
14887,I strongly agree
14888,[deleted]
14889,U good bro?
14890,Bold of him to assume I'm only using 3 fingers.
14891,"Play with my tits, masturbate, play with my tits, be gay, play with my tits, hope I'm not on my period, play with my tits, fuck everything and everyone, play with my tits...

OH

and play with my tits"
14892,Kimi no na wa?
14893,"Not a bad idea honestly, but it’s going to be harder than you think, trust me, I’ve tried to set my friend up with the girl he liked, and it took a few months, but I did do it, it’ll be really hard to do that for multiple people in the span of a day"
14894,I didn't even have to look at your comment history to tell how annoying your are lol
14895,You don’t have a flair either though
14896,Not gay if youre a girl
14897,Masturbate and play with my temporary boobs
14898,And rape him first
14899,Prostitution.
14900,Please go fuck yourself
